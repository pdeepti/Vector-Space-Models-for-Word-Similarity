but a partnership between local imams and the police has improved the situation . essen police officer herbert czarnyan was familiar with the unemployment , poverty and low education levels that led to youth crime in essen 's katernberg neighborhood .

its walls , ceiling and floor are covered with thousands of tiles in all different hues . so unique is the creamery that it 's made a record as the " prettiest milk store in the world " in the guinness book of world records .
dozens of angels and putti , animals and flowers are depicted on the hand-painted tiles , spread across thousands of square feet . " up to 1,000 visitors come every day , " managing director frank zabel told german news agency dpa . survived world war ii the creamery was built 125 years ago by the pfund brothers .
even today , visitors can buy cheese and milk at the 4-meter-long -lrb- 13 feet -rrb- counter .
the fronts of the traditional " ice boxes " are still there too , but the original insides have been replaced with modern refrigerators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : molkerei pfund has been called the " most beautiful creamery in the world " leaving the village of reinholdshain , paul gustav leander pfund went to dresden in 1879 with his wife , six children and a herd of pigs .
he started up the creamy business , which his brother friedrich later joined .
paul developed new products and manufacturing methods , improved hygienic processes and accessed new markets .
he was the first in germany to produce condensed milk .
he introduced pasteurization in 1900 . the two pfund brothers had a flourishing business that included several stores , their own insurance company , company housing and a swimming pool , as well as a kindergarten .
when paul died in 1923 , his children took over the business , which also remarkably withstood world war ii and the massive destruction of dresden . not succumbing to gdr deco in 1972 , the business became state-run in socialist east germany , with the variety of products reduced to just three sorts of cheese and milk . but zabel told dpa that the creamery was spared of the typical gdr decorating style . " people were able to stop plans to destroy the traditional tiles that were supposed to be replaced by plastic paneling , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hand-painted tiles lure one into the shop after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , the business virtually disappeared .
but , gaining inheritance rights , one of paul 's great-grandchildren restored the creamery to its former glory and founded the dresdener molkerei gebrüder pfund gmbh . zabel said that five percent of the old tiles had to be replaced ; the rest were restored , with the store opening up in 1995 .
now , cheese lovers can choose from 120 different sorts and wash it down with a glass of milk . the building also houses a restaurant and gift shop , where visitors can buy tile replicas .

but a partnership between local imams and the police has improved the situation . essen police officer herbert czarnyan was familiar with the unemployment , poverty and low education levels that led to youth crime in essen 's katernberg neighborhood .
but instead of cracking down on local youths himself , he turned to imams in katernberg 's three mosques for help . czarnyan organized a meeting that included businesspeople , the parents of children , who vandalized local property , and a lebanese imam . " -lsb- the imam -rsb- addressed the parents and told them that their children 's behavior was a disgrace for the community , and he demanded a response from the fathers , " czarnyan said of the first time essen 's police sought religious aid in fighting crime 10 years ago .
expanded cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mosques have become a center for recreational activities since that initial meeting , the partnership between police and the religious leader has grown to include talks with at-risk youth and their parents , and the mosque has become a contact point for educational opportunities and recreational activities . police say pressure from the imam helped curb youth crime and push down delinquency rates among immigrants in the region .
after seeing the progress made at essen 's lebanese mosque , halit pismek , an imam at one of essen 's two turkish mosques , gave his support to the project . " why should n't we work with the police ? "
pismek said , adding that the mosque 's religious council agreed with the decision .
" we are very satisfied .
our major problem was domestic violence and crime , and the members of the community wanted to find a way to solve this problem .
the police offer was perfect for us . " shared concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police and religious leaders communicate better thanks to the ongoing cooperation the agreement has also helped police , according to chief commissioner frank matuszek .
the youth in essen-katernberg understand that there is no more space beyond the reach of the law ..
matuszek said the cooperation has also helped break down barriers between mosque members and police officers . " we have learned more about each other in this project and have thus been able to dispel a lot of fears , " he said .
" the mosque community was able to see that police officers are only citizens in uniform and are also family fathers with the same concerns . " now 10 years old , the essen project is being copied and adapted by cities across germany with czarnyan often holding lectures about his work in large german cities , and pismek passing on his experiences to other religious leaders . alexandra jarecka -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

citing massive violations , russia 's communist party on sunday said it planned to contest the results of parliamentary elections that handed a huge victory to president vladimir putin 's party . shortly after the first returns in the parliamentary elections were announced on dec .
2 , communist party leader gennady zyuganov rejected the result and demanded that party monitors be allowed to verify the count , news agencies reported . " we do not trust these figures announced by the central elections commission and we will conduct a parallel count , " he said . " i am appealing to the authorities : stop raping the entire country , " zyuganov was quoted by interfax as saying . the head of the party 's legal office , vadim solovyov , separately said some 300,000 party observers had recorded more than 10,000 election violations during voting for the 450 seats to the state duma lower house of parliament . " our lawyers have already begun preparing a complaint to the supreme court to challenge the results of the elections , " solovyov was quoted by ria novosti as saying . " these are violations exceeding all acceptable norms , " he said . a kremlin-backed campaign to rig the election ? putin 's united russia party won an overwhelming lead in russia 's fifth parliamentary election since the 1991 fall of the soviet union , according to first partial results . zyuganov earlier said the election had been " the toughest and least democratic " ever held in post-soviet russia , itar-tass news agency reported . the opposition has accused the kremlin of suppressing debate during the campaign , dominating state television , confiscating election leaflets and arresting activists . meanwhile russians across the country complained of being pressured to vote in what election observers have said appeared to be part of an organized campaign to raise turnout and produce a big win for united russia , whose top candidate is putin . election-monitoring group golos , which is funded by eu and us organizations , documented cases of voters being paid to cast ballots for united russia , said alexander kynev , a political expert with the group .
in the town of pestovo in the western novgorod region , voters complained that they were given ballots that had already been filled out for united russia , he told reporters . only some 80 western observers were allowed into the country to monitor the vote spread across 11 time zones .
europe 's main election watchdog , the organization for security and cooperation in europe , had withdrawn plans to send a team to russia after accusing moscow of imposing restrictions and deliberately delaying the issuing of visas . putin had promised a fair and transparent election and the head of the central electoral commission , vladimir churov said voting had progressed " calmly and according to schedule . " churov has not commented on specific allegations of violations . boris gryzlov , chief of putin 's united russia party , told reporters violations were not significant .
" of course there are violations , but the question is do they have an impact on the final result ...
they in no way put in doubt the final result , " gryzlov told a news conference . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as russians elect a new parliament on sunday , dec .
2 , dw-world.de takes a look at several possible outcomes to a vote that has been criticized as step in putin 's path back to power . according to a recent survey , about two thirds of the russian population does n't expect sunday 's parliamentary elections to be run fairly . the country 's constitution stipulates that a president may only serve two consecutive terms , which would exclude president vladmir putin from staying on for a third term when his current one is up next year - a fact the kremlin elite does n't seem to want to accept . for the government leaders , most of whom come from the kgb , putin serves as a guarantee of their own status and , most importantly , their access to russia 's economic resources . the " 2008 problem " has been on the table for years : what to do to keep putin on after spring 2008 as russia 's most powerful man and thus maintain the existing order and distribution of power ? speculation and outcome theories abound ; the following three are the most popular . scenario one : from president to prime minister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to two scenarios , prime minister zubkov could become president the prime minister scenario is based on the fact that putin is running in the parliamentary elections as the top candidate of the united russia party , which has the strong support of the kremlin , and has n't excluded the possibility of becoming prime minister - either directly following the elections or in spring 2008 at the latest . according to russia 's current constitution , the office of prime minister has only limited authority .
should putin take on the position , it is expected that some of the presidential powers would be shifted to his new office .
one of putin 's confidantes , like sergei ivanov , viktor zubkov or boris gryzlov , would likely be named president . since the election of the prime minister occurs through a majority vote in the duma , russia 's parliament , the scenario could be touted both domestically and internationally as a boost for parliamentarianism . scenario two : the constitution card trick a second scenario stems from ambiguity in the constitution : following the elections in the duma , putin could step down as president and become a parliamentarian .
russia 's current prime minister viktor zubkov would then become the country 's third president since the fall of communism , after boris yeltsin and vladimir putin .
in this case , it would be possible - even if the constitutionality is hotly disputed - for putin to run in the march 2008 presidential elections and once again claim russia 's highest political chair . a variation on this scenario suggests that zubkov could be elected in march but resign a year later due to health reasons .
this would open the door once again for putin to reclaim the presidency . scenario three : the populist national leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a united russia campaign poster reads : " our choice is vladimir putin " according to a third scenario , putin would relinquish the presidency in 2008 , but informally maintain power by being glorified as the country 's " national leader . "
a new , supposedly spontaneous " for putin " movement has recently been campaigning in this direction .
the movement is , in fact , supported by the kremlin-supported united russia party . a win in sunday 's elections by united russia with putin as its top candidate would , according to this scenario , give him the moral right after his term expires to pressure his successor into maintaining his political course . the third scenario does n't rule out the possibility of putin returning to the presidency following an " acceptable " break . real possibilities following the social , economic and political upheaval of the 1990s , the russian population sees putin as a guarantor of political stability , which is in turn associated with economic growth and international influence . for this reason , the majority does n't expect fair elections , but still puts up with every strategic maneuver of the political elite to keep putin in power .
it is this apolitical stance , solidified by the kremlin 's harsh treatment of its critics , that make all three of these scenarios not just theories but real possibilities . ingo mannteufel heads dw-world.de 's russian department . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

citing massive violations , russia 's communist party on sunday said it planned to contest the results of parliamentary elections that handed a huge victory to president vladimir putin 's party . shortly after the first returns in the parliamentary elections were announced on dec .
2 , communist party leader gennady zyuganov rejected the result and demanded that party monitors be allowed to verify the count , news agencies reported . " we do not trust these figures announced by the central elections commission and we will conduct a parallel count , " he said . " i am appealing to the authorities : stop raping the entire country , " zyuganov was quoted by interfax as saying . the head of the party 's legal office , vadim solovyov , separately said some 300,000 party observers had recorded more than 10,000 election violations during voting for the 450 seats to the state duma lower house of parliament . " our lawyers have already begun preparing a complaint to the supreme court to challenge the results of the elections , " solovyov was quoted by ria novosti as saying . " these are violations exceeding all acceptable norms , " he said . a kremlin-backed campaign to rig the election ? putin 's united russia party won an overwhelming lead in russia 's fifth parliamentary election since the 1991 fall of the soviet union , according to first partial results . zyuganov earlier said the election had been " the toughest and least democratic " ever held in post-soviet russia , itar-tass news agency reported . the opposition has accused the kremlin of suppressing debate during the campaign , dominating state television , confiscating election leaflets and arresting activists . meanwhile russians across the country complained of being pressured to vote in what election observers have said appeared to be part of an organized campaign to raise turnout and produce a big win for united russia , whose top candidate is putin . election-monitoring group golos , which is funded by eu and us organizations , documented cases of voters being paid to cast ballots for united russia , said alexander kynev , a political expert with the group .
in the town of pestovo in the western novgorod region , voters complained that they were given ballots that had already been filled out for united russia , he told reporters . only some 80 western observers were allowed into the country to monitor the vote spread across 11 time zones .
europe 's main election watchdog , the organization for security and cooperation in europe , had withdrawn plans to send a team to russia after accusing moscow of imposing restrictions and deliberately delaying the issuing of visas . putin had promised a fair and transparent election and the head of the central electoral commission , vladimir churov said voting had progressed " calmly and according to schedule . " churov has not commented on specific allegations of violations . boris gryzlov , chief of putin 's united russia party , told reporters violations were not significant .
" of course there are violations , but the question is do they have an impact on the final result ...
they in no way put in doubt the final result , " gryzlov told a news conference . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

citing massive violations , russia 's communist party on sunday said it planned to contest the results of parliamentary elections that handed a huge victory to president vladimir putin 's party . shortly after the first returns in the parliamentary elections were announced on dec .
2 , communist party leader gennady zyuganov rejected the result and demanded that party monitors be allowed to verify the count , news agencies reported . " we do not trust these figures announced by the central elections commission and we will conduct a parallel count , " he said . " i am appealing to the authorities : stop raping the entire country , " zyuganov was quoted by interfax as saying . the head of the party 's legal office , vadim solovyov , separately said some 300,000 party observers had recorded more than 10,000 election violations during voting for the 450 seats to the state duma lower house of parliament . " our lawyers have already begun preparing a complaint to the supreme court to challenge the results of the elections , " solovyov was quoted by ria novosti as saying . " these are violations exceeding all acceptable norms , " he said . a kremlin-backed campaign to rig the election ? putin 's united russia party won an overwhelming lead in russia 's fifth parliamentary election since the 1991 fall of the soviet union , according to first partial results . zyuganov earlier said the election had been " the toughest and least democratic " ever held in post-soviet russia , itar-tass news agency reported . the opposition has accused the kremlin of suppressing debate during the campaign , dominating state television , confiscating election leaflets and arresting activists . meanwhile russians across the country complained of being pressured to vote in what election observers have said appeared to be part of an organized campaign to raise turnout and produce a big win for united russia , whose top candidate is putin . election-monitoring group golos , which is funded by eu and us organizations , documented cases of voters being paid to cast ballots for united russia , said alexander kynev , a political expert with the group .
in the town of pestovo in the western novgorod region , voters complained that they were given ballots that had already been filled out for united russia , he told reporters . only some 80 western observers were allowed into the country to monitor the vote spread across 11 time zones .
europe 's main election watchdog , the organization for security and cooperation in europe , had withdrawn plans to send a team to russia after accusing moscow of imposing restrictions and deliberately delaying the issuing of visas . putin had promised a fair and transparent election and the head of the central electoral commission , vladimir churov said voting had progressed " calmly and according to schedule . " churov has not commented on specific allegations of violations . boris gryzlov , chief of putin 's united russia party , told reporters violations were not significant .
" of course there are violations , but the question is do they have an impact on the final result ...
they in no way put in doubt the final result , " gryzlov told a news conference . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as russians elect a new parliament on sunday , dec .
2 , dw-world.de takes a look at several possible outcomes to a vote that has been criticized as step in putin 's path back to power . according to a recent survey , about two thirds of the russian population does n't expect sunday 's parliamentary elections to be run fairly . the country 's constitution stipulates that a president may only serve two consecutive terms , which would exclude president vladmir putin from staying on for a third term when his current one is up next year - a fact the kremlin elite does n't seem to want to accept . for the government leaders , most of whom come from the kgb , putin serves as a guarantee of their own status and , most importantly , their access to russia 's economic resources . the " 2008 problem " has been on the table for years : what to do to keep putin on after spring 2008 as russia 's most powerful man and thus maintain the existing order and distribution of power ? speculation and outcome theories abound ; the following three are the most popular . scenario one : from president to prime minister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to two scenarios , prime minister zubkov could become president the prime minister scenario is based on the fact that putin is running in the parliamentary elections as the top candidate of the united russia party , which has the strong support of the kremlin , and has n't excluded the possibility of becoming prime minister - either directly following the elections or in spring 2008 at the latest . according to russia 's current constitution , the office of prime minister has only limited authority .
should putin take on the position , it is expected that some of the presidential powers would be shifted to his new office .
one of putin 's confidantes , like sergei ivanov , viktor zubkov or boris gryzlov , would likely be named president . since the election of the prime minister occurs through a majority vote in the duma , russia 's parliament , the scenario could be touted both domestically and internationally as a boost for parliamentarianism . scenario two : the constitution card trick a second scenario stems from ambiguity in the constitution : following the elections in the duma , putin could step down as president and become a parliamentarian .
russia 's current prime minister viktor zubkov would then become the country 's third president since the fall of communism , after boris yeltsin and vladimir putin .
in this case , it would be possible - even if the constitutionality is hotly disputed - for putin to run in the march 2008 presidential elections and once again claim russia 's highest political chair . a variation on this scenario suggests that zubkov could be elected in march but resign a year later due to health reasons .
this would open the door once again for putin to reclaim the presidency . scenario three : the populist national leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a united russia campaign poster reads : " our choice is vladimir putin " according to a third scenario , putin would relinquish the presidency in 2008 , but informally maintain power by being glorified as the country 's " national leader . "
a new , supposedly spontaneous " for putin " movement has recently been campaigning in this direction .
the movement is , in fact , supported by the kremlin-supported united russia party . a win in sunday 's elections by united russia with putin as its top candidate would , according to this scenario , give him the moral right after his term expires to pressure his successor into maintaining his political course . the third scenario does n't rule out the possibility of putin returning to the presidency following an " acceptable " break . real possibilities following the social , economic and political upheaval of the 1990s , the russian population sees putin as a guarantor of political stability , which is in turn associated with economic growth and international influence . for this reason , the majority does n't expect fair elections , but still puts up with every strategic maneuver of the political elite to keep putin in power .
it is this apolitical stance , solidified by the kremlin 's harsh treatment of its critics , that make all three of these scenarios not just theories but real possibilities . ingo mannteufel heads dw-world.de 's russian department . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as russians elect a new parliament on sunday , dec .
2 , dw-world.de takes a look at several possible outcomes to a vote that has been criticized as step in putin 's path back to power . according to a recent survey , about two thirds of the russian population does n't expect sunday 's parliamentary elections to be run fairly . the country 's constitution stipulates that a president may only serve two consecutive terms , which would exclude president vladmir putin from staying on for a third term when his current one is up next year - a fact the kremlin elite does n't seem to want to accept . for the government leaders , most of whom come from the kgb , putin serves as a guarantee of their own status and , most importantly , their access to russia 's economic resources . the " 2008 problem " has been on the table for years : what to do to keep putin on after spring 2008 as russia 's most powerful man and thus maintain the existing order and distribution of power ? speculation and outcome theories abound ; the following three are the most popular . scenario one : from president to prime minister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to two scenarios , prime minister zubkov could become president the prime minister scenario is based on the fact that putin is running in the parliamentary elections as the top candidate of the united russia party , which has the strong support of the kremlin , and has n't excluded the possibility of becoming prime minister - either directly following the elections or in spring 2008 at the latest . according to russia 's current constitution , the office of prime minister has only limited authority .
should putin take on the position , it is expected that some of the presidential powers would be shifted to his new office .
one of putin 's confidantes , like sergei ivanov , viktor zubkov or boris gryzlov , would likely be named president . since the election of the prime minister occurs through a majority vote in the duma , russia 's parliament , the scenario could be touted both domestically and internationally as a boost for parliamentarianism . scenario two : the constitution card trick a second scenario stems from ambiguity in the constitution : following the elections in the duma , putin could step down as president and become a parliamentarian .
russia 's current prime minister viktor zubkov would then become the country 's third president since the fall of communism , after boris yeltsin and vladimir putin .
in this case , it would be possible - even if the constitutionality is hotly disputed - for putin to run in the march 2008 presidential elections and once again claim russia 's highest political chair . a variation on this scenario suggests that zubkov could be elected in march but resign a year later due to health reasons .
this would open the door once again for putin to reclaim the presidency . scenario three : the populist national leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a united russia campaign poster reads : " our choice is vladimir putin " according to a third scenario , putin would relinquish the presidency in 2008 , but informally maintain power by being glorified as the country 's " national leader . "
a new , supposedly spontaneous " for putin " movement has recently been campaigning in this direction .
the movement is , in fact , supported by the kremlin-supported united russia party . a win in sunday 's elections by united russia with putin as its top candidate would , according to this scenario , give him the moral right after his term expires to pressure his successor into maintaining his political course . the third scenario does n't rule out the possibility of putin returning to the presidency following an " acceptable " break . real possibilities following the social , economic and political upheaval of the 1990s , the russian population sees putin as a guarantor of political stability , which is in turn associated with economic growth and international influence . for this reason , the majority does n't expect fair elections , but still puts up with every strategic maneuver of the political elite to keep putin in power .
it is this apolitical stance , solidified by the kremlin 's harsh treatment of its critics , that make all three of these scenarios not just theories but real possibilities . ingo mannteufel heads dw-world.de 's russian department . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" at the world cup , we were already put into the so-called group of death -lrb- against argentina , ivory coast and serbia and montenegro -rrb- , " said dutch coach marco van basten .
" i wonder what they are going to call this one . "
meanwhile , romanian coach victor piturca refused to rule out the possibility of his team qualifying for the knockout phase , especially as they had finished ahead of the dutch in their qualifying group .
" why should we not be one of the two teams to advance from this group ? " he asked . german coach : i am delighted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löw was happy in contrast , germany coach joachim löw was thrilled after being drawn in group b against croatia , poland and co-hosts austria , probably the weakest team in the tournament .

" we have a good opportunity to reach the next round . "
austria coach josef hickersberger was also overjoyed at having avoided the likes of italy and france , calling his group " a great draw for us . " the other co-hosts switzerland were drawn in group a and will play the czech republic in the opening game of the tournament in basle on june 7 .
portugal and turkey complete the group . defending champions greece will be confident of making it to the knockout phase after being drawn against sweden , spain and russia in group d. euro 2008 takes place between june 7 and 29 in basle , berne , zurich and geneva in switzerland as well as the austrian cities of innsbruck , klagenfurt , salzburg and vienna , where the final takes place . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a partnership between local imams and the police has improved the situation . essen police officer herbert czarnyan was familiar with the unemployment , poverty and low education levels that led to youth crime in essen 's katernberg neighborhood .
but instead of cracking down on local youths himself , he turned to imams in katernberg 's three mosques for help . czarnyan organized a meeting that included businesspeople , the parents of children , who vandalized local property , and a lebanese imam . " -lsb- the imam -rsb- addressed the parents and told them that their children 's behavior was a disgrace for the community , and he demanded a response from the fathers , " czarnyan said of the first time essen 's police sought religious aid in fighting crime 10 years ago .
expanded cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mosques have become a center for recreational activities since that initial meeting , the partnership between police and the religious leader has grown to include talks with at-risk youth and their parents , and the mosque has become a contact point for educational opportunities and recreational activities . police say pressure from the imam helped curb youth crime and push down delinquency rates among immigrants in the region .
after seeing the progress made at essen 's lebanese mosque , halit pismek , an imam at one of essen 's two turkish mosques , gave his support to the project . " why should n't we work with the police ? "
pismek said , adding that the mosque 's religious council agreed with the decision .
" we are very satisfied .
our major problem was domestic violence and crime , and the members of the community wanted to find a way to solve this problem .
the police offer was perfect for us . " shared concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police and religious leaders communicate better thanks to the ongoing cooperation the agreement has also helped police , according to chief commissioner frank matuszek .
the youth in essen-katernberg understand that there is no more space beyond the reach of the law ..
matuszek said the cooperation has also helped break down barriers between mosque members and police officers . " we have learned more about each other in this project and have thus been able to dispel a lot of fears , " he said .
" the mosque community was able to see that police officers are only citizens in uniform and are also family fathers with the same concerns . " now 10 years old , the essen project is being copied and adapted by cities across germany with czarnyan often holding lectures about his work in large german cities , and pismek passing on his experiences to other religious leaders . alexandra jarecka -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as russians elect a new parliament on sunday , dec .
2 , dw-world.de takes a look at several possible outcomes to a vote that has been criticized as step in putin 's path back to power . according to a recent survey , about two thirds of the russian population does n't expect sunday 's parliamentary elections to be run fairly . the country 's constitution stipulates that a president may only serve two consecutive terms , which would exclude president vladmir putin from staying on for a third term when his current one is up next year - a fact the kremlin elite does n't seem to want to accept . for the government leaders , most of whom come from the kgb , putin serves as a guarantee of their own status and , most importantly , their access to russia 's economic resources . the " 2008 problem " has been on the table for years : what to do to keep putin on after spring 2008 as russia 's most powerful man and thus maintain the existing order and distribution of power ? speculation and outcome theories abound ; the following three are the most popular . scenario one : from president to prime minister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to two scenarios , prime minister zubkov could become president the prime minister scenario is based on the fact that putin is running in the parliamentary elections as the top candidate of the united russia party , which has the strong support of the kremlin , and has n't excluded the possibility of becoming prime minister - either directly following the elections or in spring 2008 at the latest . according to russia 's current constitution , the office of prime minister has only limited authority .
should putin take on the position , it is expected that some of the presidential powers would be shifted to his new office .
one of putin 's confidantes , like sergei ivanov , viktor zubkov or boris gryzlov , would likely be named president . since the election of the prime minister occurs through a majority vote in the duma , russia 's parliament , the scenario could be touted both domestically and internationally as a boost for parliamentarianism . scenario two : the constitution card trick a second scenario stems from ambiguity in the constitution : following the elections in the duma , putin could step down as president and become a parliamentarian .
russia 's current prime minister viktor zubkov would then become the country 's third president since the fall of communism , after boris yeltsin and vladimir putin .
in this case , it would be possible - even if the constitutionality is hotly disputed - for putin to run in the march 2008 presidential elections and once again claim russia 's highest political chair . a variation on this scenario suggests that zubkov could be elected in march but resign a year later due to health reasons .
this would open the door once again for putin to reclaim the presidency . scenario three : the populist national leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a united russia campaign poster reads : " our choice is vladimir putin " according to a third scenario , putin would relinquish the presidency in 2008 , but informally maintain power by being glorified as the country 's " national leader . "
a new , supposedly spontaneous " for putin " movement has recently been campaigning in this direction .
the movement is , in fact , supported by the kremlin-supported united russia party . a win in sunday 's elections by united russia with putin as its top candidate would , according to this scenario , give him the moral right after his term expires to pressure his successor into maintaining his political course . the third scenario does n't rule out the possibility of putin returning to the presidency following an " acceptable " break . real possibilities following the social , economic and political upheaval of the 1990s , the russian population sees putin as a guarantor of political stability , which is in turn associated with economic growth and international influence . for this reason , the majority does n't expect fair elections , but still puts up with every strategic maneuver of the political elite to keep putin in power .
it is this apolitical stance , solidified by the kremlin 's harsh treatment of its critics , that make all three of these scenarios not just theories but real possibilities . ingo mannteufel heads dw-world.de 's russian department . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as russians elect a new parliament on sunday , dec .
2 , dw-world.de takes a look at several possible outcomes to a vote that has been criticized as step in putin 's path back to power . according to a recent survey , about two thirds of the russian population does n't expect sunday 's parliamentary elections to be run fairly . the country 's constitution stipulates that a president may only serve two consecutive terms , which would exclude president vladmir putin from staying on for a third term when his current one is up next year - a fact the kremlin elite does n't seem to want to accept . for the government leaders , most of whom come from the kgb , putin serves as a guarantee of their own status and , most importantly , their access to russia 's economic resources . the " 2008 problem " has been on the table for years : what to do to keep putin on after spring 2008 as russia 's most powerful man and thus maintain the existing order and distribution of power ? speculation and outcome theories abound ; the following three are the most popular . scenario one : from president to prime minister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to two scenarios , prime minister zubkov could become president the prime minister scenario is based on the fact that putin is running in the parliamentary elections as the top candidate of the united russia party , which has the strong support of the kremlin , and has n't excluded the possibility of becoming prime minister - either directly following the elections or in spring 2008 at the latest . according to russia 's current constitution , the office of prime minister has only limited authority .
should putin take on the position , it is expected that some of the presidential powers would be shifted to his new office .
one of putin 's confidantes , like sergei ivanov , viktor zubkov or boris gryzlov , would likely be named president . since the election of the prime minister occurs through a majority vote in the duma , russia 's parliament , the scenario could be touted both domestically and internationally as a boost for parliamentarianism . scenario two : the constitution card trick a second scenario stems from ambiguity in the constitution : following the elections in the duma , putin could step down as president and become a parliamentarian .
russia 's current prime minister viktor zubkov would then become the country 's third president since the fall of communism , after boris yeltsin and vladimir putin .
in this case , it would be possible - even if the constitutionality is hotly disputed - for putin to run in the march 2008 presidential elections and once again claim russia 's highest political chair . a variation on this scenario suggests that zubkov could be elected in march but resign a year later due to health reasons .
this would open the door once again for putin to reclaim the presidency . scenario three : the populist national leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a united russia campaign poster reads : " our choice is vladimir putin " according to a third scenario , putin would relinquish the presidency in 2008 , but informally maintain power by being glorified as the country 's " national leader . "
a new , supposedly spontaneous " for putin " movement has recently been campaigning in this direction .
the movement is , in fact , supported by the kremlin-supported united russia party . a win in sunday 's elections by united russia with putin as its top candidate would , according to this scenario , give him the moral right after his term expires to pressure his successor into maintaining his political course . the third scenario does n't rule out the possibility of putin returning to the presidency following an " acceptable " break . real possibilities following the social , economic and political upheaval of the 1990s , the russian population sees putin as a guarantor of political stability , which is in turn associated with economic growth and international influence . for this reason , the majority does n't expect fair elections , but still puts up with every strategic maneuver of the political elite to keep putin in power .
it is this apolitical stance , solidified by the kremlin 's harsh treatment of its critics , that make all three of these scenarios not just theories but real possibilities . ingo mannteufel heads dw-world.de 's russian department . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as russians elect a new parliament on sunday , dec .
2 , dw-world.de takes a look at several possible outcomes to a vote that has been criticized as step in putin 's path back to power . according to a recent survey , about two thirds of the russian population does n't expect sunday 's parliamentary elections to be run fairly . the country 's constitution stipulates that a president may only serve two consecutive terms , which would exclude president vladmir putin from staying on for a third term when his current one is up next year - a fact the kremlin elite does n't seem to want to accept . for the government leaders , most of whom come from the kgb , putin serves as a guarantee of their own status and , most importantly , their access to russia 's economic resources . the " 2008 problem " has been on the table for years : what to do to keep putin on after spring 2008 as russia 's most powerful man and thus maintain the existing order and distribution of power ? speculation and outcome theories abound ; the following three are the most popular . scenario one : from president to prime minister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to two scenarios , prime minister zubkov could become president the prime minister scenario is based on the fact that putin is running in the parliamentary elections as the top candidate of the united russia party , which has the strong support of the kremlin , and has n't excluded the possibility of becoming prime minister - either directly following the elections or in spring 2008 at the latest . according to russia 's current constitution , the office of prime minister has only limited authority .
should putin take on the position , it is expected that some of the presidential powers would be shifted to his new office .
one of putin 's confidantes , like sergei ivanov , viktor zubkov or boris gryzlov , would likely be named president . since the election of the prime minister occurs through a majority vote in the duma , russia 's parliament , the scenario could be touted both domestically and internationally as a boost for parliamentarianism . scenario two : the constitution card trick a second scenario stems from ambiguity in the constitution : following the elections in the duma , putin could step down as president and become a parliamentarian .
russia 's current prime minister viktor zubkov would then become the country 's third president since the fall of communism , after boris yeltsin and vladimir putin .
in this case , it would be possible - even if the constitutionality is hotly disputed - for putin to run in the march 2008 presidential elections and once again claim russia 's highest political chair . a variation on this scenario suggests that zubkov could be elected in march but resign a year later due to health reasons .
this would open the door once again for putin to reclaim the presidency . scenario three : the populist national leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a united russia campaign poster reads : " our choice is vladimir putin " according to a third scenario , putin would relinquish the presidency in 2008 , but informally maintain power by being glorified as the country 's " national leader . "
a new , supposedly spontaneous " for putin " movement has recently been campaigning in this direction .
the movement is , in fact , supported by the kremlin-supported united russia party . a win in sunday 's elections by united russia with putin as its top candidate would , according to this scenario , give him the moral right after his term expires to pressure his successor into maintaining his political course . the third scenario does n't rule out the possibility of putin returning to the presidency following an " acceptable " break . real possibilities following the social , economic and political upheaval of the 1990s , the russian population sees putin as a guarantor of political stability , which is in turn associated with economic growth and international influence . for this reason , the majority does n't expect fair elections , but still puts up with every strategic maneuver of the political elite to keep putin in power .
it is this apolitical stance , solidified by the kremlin 's harsh treatment of its critics , that make all three of these scenarios not just theories but real possibilities . ingo mannteufel heads dw-world.de 's russian department . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as russians elect a new parliament on sunday , dec .
2 , dw-world.de takes a look at several possible outcomes to a vote that has been criticized as step in putin 's path back to power . according to a recent survey , about two thirds of the russian population does n't expect sunday 's parliamentary elections to be run fairly . the country 's constitution stipulates that a president may only serve two consecutive terms , which would exclude president vladmir putin from staying on for a third term when his current one is up next year - a fact the kremlin elite does n't seem to want to accept . for the government leaders , most of whom come from the kgb , putin serves as a guarantee of their own status and , most importantly , their access to russia 's economic resources . the " 2008 problem " has been on the table for years : what to do to keep putin on after spring 2008 as russia 's most powerful man and thus maintain the existing order and distribution of power ? speculation and outcome theories abound ; the following three are the most popular . scenario one : from president to prime minister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to two scenarios , prime minister zubkov could become president the prime minister scenario is based on the fact that putin is running in the parliamentary elections as the top candidate of the united russia party , which has the strong support of the kremlin , and has n't excluded the possibility of becoming prime minister - either directly following the elections or in spring 2008 at the latest . according to russia 's current constitution , the office of prime minister has only limited authority .
should putin take on the position , it is expected that some of the presidential powers would be shifted to his new office .
one of putin 's confidantes , like sergei ivanov , viktor zubkov or boris gryzlov , would likely be named president . since the election of the prime minister occurs through a majority vote in the duma , russia 's parliament , the scenario could be touted both domestically and internationally as a boost for parliamentarianism . scenario two : the constitution card trick a second scenario stems from ambiguity in the constitution : following the elections in the duma , putin could step down as president and become a parliamentarian .
russia 's current prime minister viktor zubkov would then become the country 's third president since the fall of communism , after boris yeltsin and vladimir putin .
in this case , it would be possible - even if the constitutionality is hotly disputed - for putin to run in the march 2008 presidential elections and once again claim russia 's highest political chair . a variation on this scenario suggests that zubkov could be elected in march but resign a year later due to health reasons .

"
a new , supposedly spontaneous " for putin " movement has recently been campaigning in this direction .
the movement is , in fact , supported by the kremlin-supported united russia party . a win in sunday 's elections by united russia with putin as its top candidate would , according to this scenario , give him the moral right after his term expires to pressure his successor into maintaining his political course . the third scenario does n't rule out the possibility of putin returning to the presidency following an " acceptable " break . real possibilities following the social , economic and political upheaval of the 1990s , the russian population sees putin as a guarantor of political stability , which is in turn associated with economic growth and international influence . for this reason , the majority does n't expect fair elections , but still puts up with every strategic maneuver of the political elite to keep putin in power .

but a partnership between local imams and the police has improved the situation . essen police officer herbert czarnyan was familiar with the unemployment , poverty and low education levels that led to youth crime in essen 's katernberg neighborhood .
but instead of cracking down on local youths himself , he turned to imams in katernberg 's three mosques for help . czarnyan organized a meeting that included businesspeople , the parents of children , who vandalized local property , and a lebanese imam . " -lsb- the imam -rsb- addressed the parents and told them that their children 's behavior was a disgrace for the community , and he demanded a response from the fathers , " czarnyan said of the first time essen 's police sought religious aid in fighting crime 10 years ago .
expanded cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mosques have become a center for recreational activities since that initial meeting , the partnership between police and the religious leader has grown to include talks with at-risk youth and their parents , and the mosque has become a contact point for educational opportunities and recreational activities . police say pressure from the imam helped curb youth crime and push down delinquency rates among immigrants in the region .
after seeing the progress made at essen 's lebanese mosque , halit pismek , an imam at one of essen 's two turkish mosques , gave his support to the project . " why should n't we work with the police ? "

citing massive violations , russia 's communist party on sunday said it planned to contest the results of parliamentary elections that handed a huge victory to president vladimir putin 's party . shortly after the first returns in the parliamentary elections were announced on dec .
2 , communist party leader gennady zyuganov rejected the result and demanded that party monitors be allowed to verify the count , news agencies reported . " we do not trust these figures announced by the central elections commission and we will conduct a parallel count , " he said . " i am appealing to the authorities : stop raping the entire country , " zyuganov was quoted by interfax as saying . the head of the party 's legal office , vadim solovyov , separately said some 300,000 party observers had recorded more than 10,000 election violations during voting for the 450 seats to the state duma lower house of parliament . " our lawyers have already begun preparing a complaint to the supreme court to challenge the results of the elections , " solovyov was quoted by ria novosti as saying . " these are violations exceeding all acceptable norms , " he said . a kremlin-backed campaign to rig the election ? putin 's united russia party won an overwhelming lead in russia 's fifth parliamentary election since the 1991 fall of the soviet union , according to first partial results . zyuganov earlier said the election had been " the toughest and least democratic " ever held in post-soviet russia , itar-tass news agency reported . the opposition has accused the kremlin of suppressing debate during the campaign , dominating state television , confiscating election leaflets and arresting activists . meanwhile russians across the country complained of being pressured to vote in what election observers have said appeared to be part of an organized campaign to raise turnout and produce a big win for united russia , whose top candidate is putin . election-monitoring group golos , which is funded by eu and us organizations , documented cases of voters being paid to cast ballots for united russia , said alexander kynev , a political expert with the group .
in the town of pestovo in the western novgorod region , voters complained that they were given ballots that had already been filled out for united russia , he told reporters . only some 80 western observers were allowed into the country to monitor the vote spread across 11 time zones .
europe 's main election watchdog , the organization for security and cooperation in europe , had withdrawn plans to send a team to russia after accusing moscow of imposing restrictions and deliberately delaying the issuing of visas . putin had promised a fair and transparent election and the head of the central electoral commission , vladimir churov said voting had progressed " calmly and according to schedule . " churov has not commented on specific allegations of violations . boris gryzlov , chief of putin 's united russia party , told reporters violations were not significant .

she hoped that russia would choose to move towards being more open to different opinions . merkel acknowledged that under vladimir putin 's presidency , russians had more economic and material stability - citing salary increases and paid pensions - and that russia played a more active role on the international stage .

putin , 55 , who is required by the constitution to step down next year after two kremlin terms , heads united russia 's candidate list .
he said victory on sunday would give him a " moral " mandate in the future , fueling speculation that he intends to retain power .

" i voted for united russia .
life 's got better under putin , " mohammed egemberdiyev , a 43-year-old plumber , told afp news service after casting his ballot at a polling station in central moscow .
opposition decries irregularities the election followed a campaign marred by accusations that the kremlin rigged the contest with controversial new election laws and media bias to ensure victory for putin 's party .
observers from the communist party , seen as russia 's main opposition force , also reported " an enormous quantity of violations across the whole country , " andrey klychkov , a legal expert for the party , told afp .
former chess champion and kremlin critic garry kasparov , who spent five days behind bars last week for taking part in an unauthorized anti-putin protest , called the elections a " farce " and said that russian authorities were " raping the whole electoral system " with numerous irregularities .

russian opposition leaders called the poll a " farce . " merkel said she had noticed how difficult it had been for civil rights activists to be heard in russia .
" i also regret that osce observers will not be able to take part in the elections there , " merkel told deutschlandfunk public radio . the organization for the security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , europe 's main elections watchdog , called off its observer mission for the election , citing a lack of cooperation , a charged that moscow dismissed .

she hoped that russia would choose to move towards being more open to different opinions . merkel acknowledged that under vladimir putin 's presidency , russians had more economic and material stability - citing salary increases and paid pensions - and that russia played a more active role on the international stage .

eleven parties participated , but opinion polls predicted united russia would secure at least two thirds of seats in the 450-seat state duma , with the communists a distant second , and other votes divided between kremlin-friendly parties .
for the first time since the 1991 soviet collapse , pro-western liberal candidates were forecast to be excluded from parliament .
putin , 55 , who is required by the constitution to step down next year after two kremlin terms , heads united russia 's candidate list .
he said victory on sunday would give him a " moral " mandate in the future , fueling speculation that he intends to retain power .
" i 'm sure that voters have determined their preferences and now only have to come and vote for the party whose platform seems convincing , vote for those people in whom you trust , " he said after casting his ballot in moscow , according to ap news service .
high voter turnout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers wait to cast their ballots in moscow polling stations opened in a wave across the world 's biggest country , from the pacific ocean to the baltic sea .
turnout was brisk , the central election commission said , despite voters having to brave icy temperatures .
" i voted for united russia .
life 's got better under putin , " mohammed egemberdiyev , a 43-year-old plumber , told afp news service after casting his ballot at a polling station in central moscow .
opposition decries irregularities the election followed a campaign marred by accusations that the kremlin rigged the contest with controversial new election laws and media bias to ensure victory for putin 's party .
observers from the communist party , seen as russia 's main opposition force , also reported " an enormous quantity of violations across the whole country , " andrey klychkov , a legal expert for the party , told afp .
former chess champion and kremlin critic garry kasparov , who spent five days behind bars last week for taking part in an unauthorized anti-putin protest , called the elections a " farce " and said that russian authorities were " raping the whole electoral system " with numerous irregularities . " these elections are a reminder of soviet elections when there was no choice , " kasparov said after casting his ballot , according to reuters news service .

" i voted for united russia .
life 's got better under putin , " mohammed egemberdiyev , a 43-year-old plumber , told afp news service after casting his ballot at a polling station in central moscow .

citing massive violations , russia 's communist party on sunday said it planned to contest the results of parliamentary elections that handed a huge victory to president vladimir putin 's party . shortly after the first returns in the parliamentary elections were announced on dec .
2 , communist party leader gennady zyuganov rejected the result and demanded that party monitors be allowed to verify the count , news agencies reported . " we do not trust these figures announced by the central elections commission and we will conduct a parallel count , " he said . " i am appealing to the authorities : stop raping the entire country , " zyuganov was quoted by interfax as saying . the head of the party 's legal office , vadim solovyov , separately said some 300,000 party observers had recorded more than 10,000 election violations during voting for the 450 seats to the state duma lower house of parliament . " our lawyers have already begun preparing a complaint to the supreme court to challenge the results of the elections , " solovyov was quoted by ria novosti as saying . " these are violations exceeding all acceptable norms , " he said . a kremlin-backed campaign to rig the election ? putin 's united russia party won an overwhelming lead in russia 's fifth parliamentary election since the 1991 fall of the soviet union , according to first partial results . zyuganov earlier said the election had been " the toughest and least democratic " ever held in post-soviet russia , itar-tass news agency reported . the opposition has accused the kremlin of suppressing debate during the campaign , dominating state television , confiscating election leaflets and arresting activists . meanwhile russians across the country complained of being pressured to vote in what election observers have said appeared to be part of an organized campaign to raise turnout and produce a big win for united russia , whose top candidate is putin . election-monitoring group golos , which is funded by eu and us organizations , documented cases of voters being paid to cast ballots for united russia , said alexander kynev , a political expert with the group .
in the town of pestovo in the western novgorod region , voters complained that they were given ballots that had already been filled out for united russia , he told reporters . only some 80 western observers were allowed into the country to monitor the vote spread across 11 time zones .
europe 's main election watchdog , the organization for security and cooperation in europe , had withdrawn plans to send a team to russia after accusing moscow of imposing restrictions and deliberately delaying the issuing of visas . putin had promised a fair and transparent election and the head of the central electoral commission , vladimir churov said voting had progressed " calmly and according to schedule . " churov has not commented on specific allegations of violations . boris gryzlov , chief of putin 's united russia party , told reporters violations were not significant .
" of course there are violations , but the question is do they have an impact on the final result ...
they in no way put in doubt the final result , " gryzlov told a news conference . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russian opposition leaders called the poll a " farce . " merkel said she had noticed how difficult it had been for civil rights activists to be heard in russia .
" i also regret that osce observers will not be able to take part in the elections there , " merkel told deutschlandfunk public radio . the organization for the security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , europe 's main elections watchdog , called off its observer mission for the election , citing a lack of cooperation , a charged that moscow dismissed .

for the first time since the 1991 soviet collapse , pro-western liberal candidates were forecast to be excluded from parliament .
putin , 55 , who is required by the constitution to step down next year after two kremlin terms , heads united russia 's candidate list .
he said victory on sunday would give him a " moral " mandate in the future , fueling speculation that he intends to retain power .
" i 'm sure that voters have determined their preferences and now only have to come and vote for the party whose platform seems convincing , vote for those people in whom you trust , " he said after casting his ballot in moscow , according to ap news service .
high voter turnout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers wait to cast their ballots in moscow polling stations opened in a wave across the world 's biggest country , from the pacific ocean to the baltic sea .

citing massive violations , russia 's communist party on sunday said it planned to contest the results of parliamentary elections that handed a huge victory to president vladimir putin 's party . shortly after the first returns in the parliamentary elections were announced on dec .
2 , communist party leader gennady zyuganov rejected the result and demanded that party monitors be allowed to verify the count , news agencies reported . " we do not trust these figures announced by the central elections commission and we will conduct a parallel count , " he said . " i am appealing to the authorities : stop raping the entire country , " zyuganov was quoted by interfax as saying . the head of the party 's legal office , vadim solovyov , separately said some 300,000 party observers had recorded more than 10,000 election violations during voting for the 450 seats to the state duma lower house of parliament . " our lawyers have already begun preparing a complaint to the supreme court to challenge the results of the elections , " solovyov was quoted by ria novosti as saying . " these are violations exceeding all acceptable norms , " he said . a kremlin-backed campaign to rig the election ? putin 's united russia party won an overwhelming lead in russia 's fifth parliamentary election since the 1991 fall of the soviet union , according to first partial results . zyuganov earlier said the election had been " the toughest and least democratic " ever held in post-soviet russia , itar-tass news agency reported . the opposition has accused the kremlin of suppressing debate during the campaign , dominating state television , confiscating election leaflets and arresting activists . meanwhile russians across the country complained of being pressured to vote in what election observers have said appeared to be part of an organized campaign to raise turnout and produce a big win for united russia , whose top candidate is putin . election-monitoring group golos , which is funded by eu and us organizations , documented cases of voters being paid to cast ballots for united russia , said alexander kynev , a political expert with the group .
in the town of pestovo in the western novgorod region , voters complained that they were given ballots that had already been filled out for united russia , he told reporters . only some 80 western observers were allowed into the country to monitor the vote spread across 11 time zones .
europe 's main election watchdog , the organization for security and cooperation in europe , had withdrawn plans to send a team to russia after accusing moscow of imposing restrictions and deliberately delaying the issuing of visas . putin had promised a fair and transparent election and the head of the central electoral commission , vladimir churov said voting had progressed " calmly and according to schedule . " churov has not commented on specific allegations of violations . boris gryzlov , chief of putin 's united russia party , told reporters violations were not significant .
" of course there are violations , but the question is do they have an impact on the final result ...
they in no way put in doubt the final result , " gryzlov told a news conference . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as russians elect a new parliament on sunday , dec .
2 , dw-world.de takes a look at several possible outcomes to a vote that has been criticized as step in putin 's path back to power . according to a recent survey , about two thirds of the russian population does n't expect sunday 's parliamentary elections to be run fairly . the country 's constitution stipulates that a president may only serve two consecutive terms , which would exclude president vladmir putin from staying on for a third term when his current one is up next year - a fact the kremlin elite does n't seem to want to accept . for the government leaders , most of whom come from the kgb , putin serves as a guarantee of their own status and , most importantly , their access to russia 's economic resources . the " 2008 problem " has been on the table for years : what to do to keep putin on after spring 2008 as russia 's most powerful man and thus maintain the existing order and distribution of power ? speculation and outcome theories abound ; the following three are the most popular . scenario one : from president to prime minister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to two scenarios , prime minister zubkov could become president the prime minister scenario is based on the fact that putin is running in the parliamentary elections as the top candidate of the united russia party , which has the strong support of the kremlin , and has n't excluded the possibility of becoming prime minister - either directly following the elections or in spring 2008 at the latest . according to russia 's current constitution , the office of prime minister has only limited authority .
should putin take on the position , it is expected that some of the presidential powers would be shifted to his new office .
one of putin 's confidantes , like sergei ivanov , viktor zubkov or boris gryzlov , would likely be named president . since the election of the prime minister occurs through a majority vote in the duma , russia 's parliament , the scenario could be touted both domestically and internationally as a boost for parliamentarianism . scenario two : the constitution card trick a second scenario stems from ambiguity in the constitution : following the elections in the duma , putin could step down as president and become a parliamentarian .
russia 's current prime minister viktor zubkov would then become the country 's third president since the fall of communism , after boris yeltsin and vladimir putin .
in this case , it would be possible - even if the constitutionality is hotly disputed - for putin to run in the march 2008 presidential elections and once again claim russia 's highest political chair . a variation on this scenario suggests that zubkov could be elected in march but resign a year later due to health reasons .
this would open the door once again for putin to reclaim the presidency . scenario three : the populist national leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a united russia campaign poster reads : " our choice is vladimir putin " according to a third scenario , putin would relinquish the presidency in 2008 , but informally maintain power by being glorified as the country 's " national leader . "
a new , supposedly spontaneous " for putin " movement has recently been campaigning in this direction .
the movement is , in fact , supported by the kremlin-supported united russia party . a win in sunday 's elections by united russia with putin as its top candidate would , according to this scenario , give him the moral right after his term expires to pressure his successor into maintaining his political course . the third scenario does n't rule out the possibility of putin returning to the presidency following an " acceptable " break . real possibilities following the social , economic and political upheaval of the 1990s , the russian population sees putin as a guarantor of political stability , which is in turn associated with economic growth and international influence . for this reason , the majority does n't expect fair elections , but still puts up with every strategic maneuver of the political elite to keep putin in power .
it is this apolitical stance , solidified by the kremlin 's harsh treatment of its critics , that make all three of these scenarios not just theories but real possibilities . ingo mannteufel heads dw-world.de 's russian department . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

citing massive violations , russia 's communist party on sunday said it planned to contest the results of parliamentary elections that handed a huge victory to president vladimir putin 's party . shortly after the first returns in the parliamentary elections were announced on dec .
2 , communist party leader gennady zyuganov rejected the result and demanded that party monitors be allowed to verify the count , news agencies reported . " we do not trust these figures announced by the central elections commission and we will conduct a parallel count , " he said . " i am appealing to the authorities : stop raping the entire country , " zyuganov was quoted by interfax as saying . the head of the party 's legal office , vadim solovyov , separately said some 300,000 party observers had recorded more than 10,000 election violations during voting for the 450 seats to the state duma lower house of parliament . " our lawyers have already begun preparing a complaint to the supreme court to challenge the results of the elections , " solovyov was quoted by ria novosti as saying . " these are violations exceeding all acceptable norms , " he said . a kremlin-backed campaign to rig the election ? putin 's united russia party won an overwhelming lead in russia 's fifth parliamentary election since the 1991 fall of the soviet union , according to first partial results . zyuganov earlier said the election had been " the toughest and least democratic " ever held in post-soviet russia , itar-tass news agency reported . the opposition has accused the kremlin of suppressing debate during the campaign , dominating state television , confiscating election leaflets and arresting activists . meanwhile russians across the country complained of being pressured to vote in what election observers have said appeared to be part of an organized campaign to raise turnout and produce a big win for united russia , whose top candidate is putin . election-monitoring group golos , which is funded by eu and us organizations , documented cases of voters being paid to cast ballots for united russia , said alexander kynev , a political expert with the group .
in the town of pestovo in the western novgorod region , voters complained that they were given ballots that had already been filled out for united russia , he told reporters . only some 80 western observers were allowed into the country to monitor the vote spread across 11 time zones .
europe 's main election watchdog , the organization for security and cooperation in europe , had withdrawn plans to send a team to russia after accusing moscow of imposing restrictions and deliberately delaying the issuing of visas . putin had promised a fair and transparent election and the head of the central electoral commission , vladimir churov said voting had progressed " calmly and according to schedule . " churov has not commented on specific allegations of violations . boris gryzlov , chief of putin 's united russia party , told reporters violations were not significant .
" of course there are violations , but the question is do they have an impact on the final result ...
they in no way put in doubt the final result , " gryzlov told a news conference . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

its walls , ceiling and floor are covered with thousands of tiles in all different hues . so unique is the creamery that it 's made a record as the " prettiest milk store in the world " in the guinness book of world records .
dozens of angels and putti , animals and flowers are depicted on the hand-painted tiles , spread across thousands of square feet . " up to 1,000 visitors come every day , " managing director frank zabel told german news agency dpa . survived world war ii the creamery was built 125 years ago by the pfund brothers .
even today , visitors can buy cheese and milk at the 4-meter-long -lrb- 13 feet -rrb- counter .
the fronts of the traditional " ice boxes " are still there too , but the original insides have been replaced with modern refrigerators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : molkerei pfund has been called the " most beautiful creamery in the world " leaving the village of reinholdshain , paul gustav leander pfund went to dresden in 1879 with his wife , six children and a herd of pigs .
he started up the creamy business , which his brother friedrich later joined .
paul developed new products and manufacturing methods , improved hygienic processes and accessed new markets .
he was the first in germany to produce condensed milk .
he introduced pasteurization in 1900 . the two pfund brothers had a flourishing business that included several stores , their own insurance company , company housing and a swimming pool , as well as a kindergarten .
when paul died in 1923 , his children took over the business , which also remarkably withstood world war ii and the massive destruction of dresden . not succumbing to gdr deco in 1972 , the business became state-run in socialist east germany , with the variety of products reduced to just three sorts of cheese and milk . but zabel told dpa that the creamery was spared of the typical gdr decorating style . " people were able to stop plans to destroy the traditional tiles that were supposed to be replaced by plastic paneling , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hand-painted tiles lure one into the shop after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , the business virtually disappeared .
but , gaining inheritance rights , one of paul 's great-grandchildren restored the creamery to its former glory and founded the dresdener molkerei gebrüder pfund gmbh . zabel said that five percent of the old tiles had to be replaced ; the rest were restored , with the store opening up in 1995 .
now , cheese lovers can choose from 120 different sorts and wash it down with a glass of milk . the building also houses a restaurant and gift shop , where visitors can buy tile replicas .
but they may just have to elbow their way in : on some days , a slew of buses are lined up outside - packed with tourists . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as russians elect a new parliament on sunday , dec .
2 , dw-world.de takes a look at several possible outcomes to a vote that has been criticized as step in putin 's path back to power . according to a recent survey , about two thirds of the russian population does n't expect sunday 's parliamentary elections to be run fairly . the country 's constitution stipulates that a president may only serve two consecutive terms , which would exclude president vladmir putin from staying on for a third term when his current one is up next year - a fact the kremlin elite does n't seem to want to accept . for the government leaders , most of whom come from the kgb , putin serves as a guarantee of their own status and , most importantly , their access to russia 's economic resources . the " 2008 problem " has been on the table for years : what to do to keep putin on after spring 2008 as russia 's most powerful man and thus maintain the existing order and distribution of power ? speculation and outcome theories abound ; the following three are the most popular . scenario one : from president to prime minister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to two scenarios , prime minister zubkov could become president the prime minister scenario is based on the fact that putin is running in the parliamentary elections as the top candidate of the united russia party , which has the strong support of the kremlin , and has n't excluded the possibility of becoming prime minister - either directly following the elections or in spring 2008 at the latest . according to russia 's current constitution , the office of prime minister has only limited authority .
should putin take on the position , it is expected that some of the presidential powers would be shifted to his new office .
one of putin 's confidantes , like sergei ivanov , viktor zubkov or boris gryzlov , would likely be named president . since the election of the prime minister occurs through a majority vote in the duma , russia 's parliament , the scenario could be touted both domestically and internationally as a boost for parliamentarianism . scenario two : the constitution card trick a second scenario stems from ambiguity in the constitution : following the elections in the duma , putin could step down as president and become a parliamentarian .
russia 's current prime minister viktor zubkov would then become the country 's third president since the fall of communism , after boris yeltsin and vladimir putin .
in this case , it would be possible - even if the constitutionality is hotly disputed - for putin to run in the march 2008 presidential elections and once again claim russia 's highest political chair . a variation on this scenario suggests that zubkov could be elected in march but resign a year later due to health reasons .
this would open the door once again for putin to reclaim the presidency . scenario three : the populist national leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a united russia campaign poster reads : " our choice is vladimir putin " according to a third scenario , putin would relinquish the presidency in 2008 , but informally maintain power by being glorified as the country 's " national leader . "
a new , supposedly spontaneous " for putin " movement has recently been campaigning in this direction .
the movement is , in fact , supported by the kremlin-supported united russia party . a win in sunday 's elections by united russia with putin as its top candidate would , according to this scenario , give him the moral right after his term expires to pressure his successor into maintaining his political course . the third scenario does n't rule out the possibility of putin returning to the presidency following an " acceptable " break . real possibilities following the social , economic and political upheaval of the 1990s , the russian population sees putin as a guarantor of political stability , which is in turn associated with economic growth and international influence . for this reason , the majority does n't expect fair elections , but still puts up with every strategic maneuver of the political elite to keep putin in power .
it is this apolitical stance , solidified by the kremlin 's harsh treatment of its critics , that make all three of these scenarios not just theories but real possibilities . ingo mannteufel heads dw-world.de 's russian department . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as russians elect a new parliament on sunday , dec .
2 , dw-world.de takes a look at several possible outcomes to a vote that has been criticized as step in putin 's path back to power . according to a recent survey , about two thirds of the russian population does n't expect sunday 's parliamentary elections to be run fairly . the country 's constitution stipulates that a president may only serve two consecutive terms , which would exclude president vladmir putin from staying on for a third term when his current one is up next year - a fact the kremlin elite does n't seem to want to accept . for the government leaders , most of whom come from the kgb , putin serves as a guarantee of their own status and , most importantly , their access to russia 's economic resources . the " 2008 problem " has been on the table for years : what to do to keep putin on after spring 2008 as russia 's most powerful man and thus maintain the existing order and distribution of power ? speculation and outcome theories abound ; the following three are the most popular . scenario one : from president to prime minister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to two scenarios , prime minister zubkov could become president the prime minister scenario is based on the fact that putin is running in the parliamentary elections as the top candidate of the united russia party , which has the strong support of the kremlin , and has n't excluded the possibility of becoming prime minister - either directly following the elections or in spring 2008 at the latest . according to russia 's current constitution , the office of prime minister has only limited authority .
should putin take on the position , it is expected that some of the presidential powers would be shifted to his new office .
one of putin 's confidantes , like sergei ivanov , viktor zubkov or boris gryzlov , would likely be named president . since the election of the prime minister occurs through a majority vote in the duma , russia 's parliament , the scenario could be touted both domestically and internationally as a boost for parliamentarianism . scenario two : the constitution card trick a second scenario stems from ambiguity in the constitution : following the elections in the duma , putin could step down as president and become a parliamentarian .
russia 's current prime minister viktor zubkov would then become the country 's third president since the fall of communism , after boris yeltsin and vladimir putin .
in this case , it would be possible - even if the constitutionality is hotly disputed - for putin to run in the march 2008 presidential elections and once again claim russia 's highest political chair . a variation on this scenario suggests that zubkov could be elected in march but resign a year later due to health reasons .
this would open the door once again for putin to reclaim the presidency . scenario three : the populist national leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a united russia campaign poster reads : " our choice is vladimir putin " according to a third scenario , putin would relinquish the presidency in 2008 , but informally maintain power by being glorified as the country 's " national leader . "

its walls , ceiling and floor are covered with thousands of tiles in all different hues . so unique is the creamery that it 's made a record as the " prettiest milk store in the world " in the guinness book of world records .
dozens of angels and putti , animals and flowers are depicted on the hand-painted tiles , spread across thousands of square feet . " up to 1,000 visitors come every day , " managing director frank zabel told german news agency dpa . survived world war ii the creamery was built 125 years ago by the pfund brothers .
even today , visitors can buy cheese and milk at the 4-meter-long -lrb- 13 feet -rrb- counter .
the fronts of the traditional " ice boxes " are still there too , but the original insides have been replaced with modern refrigerators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : molkerei pfund has been called the " most beautiful creamery in the world " leaving the village of reinholdshain , paul gustav leander pfund went to dresden in 1879 with his wife , six children and a herd of pigs .
he started up the creamy business , which his brother friedrich later joined .
paul developed new products and manufacturing methods , improved hygienic processes and accessed new markets .
he was the first in germany to produce condensed milk .
he introduced pasteurization in 1900 . the two pfund brothers had a flourishing business that included several stores , their own insurance company , company housing and a swimming pool , as well as a kindergarten .
when paul died in 1923 , his children took over the business , which also remarkably withstood world war ii and the massive destruction of dresden . not succumbing to gdr deco in 1972 , the business became state-run in socialist east germany , with the variety of products reduced to just three sorts of cheese and milk . but zabel told dpa that the creamery was spared of the typical gdr decorating style . " people were able to stop plans to destroy the traditional tiles that were supposed to be replaced by plastic paneling , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hand-painted tiles lure one into the shop after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , the business virtually disappeared .
but , gaining inheritance rights , one of paul 's great-grandchildren restored the creamery to its former glory and founded the dresdener molkerei gebrüder pfund gmbh . zabel said that five percent of the old tiles had to be replaced ; the rest were restored , with the store opening up in 1995 .
now , cheese lovers can choose from 120 different sorts and wash it down with a glass of milk . the building also houses a restaurant and gift shop , where visitors can buy tile replicas .
but they may just have to elbow their way in : on some days , a slew of buses are lined up outside - packed with tourists . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

its walls , ceiling and floor are covered with thousands of tiles in all different hues . so unique is the creamery that it 's made a record as the " prettiest milk store in the world " in the guinness book of world records .
dozens of angels and putti , animals and flowers are depicted on the hand-painted tiles , spread across thousands of square feet . " up to 1,000 visitors come every day , " managing director frank zabel told german news agency dpa . survived world war ii the creamery was built 125 years ago by the pfund brothers .
even today , visitors can buy cheese and milk at the 4-meter-long -lrb- 13 feet -rrb- counter .
the fronts of the traditional " ice boxes " are still there too , but the original insides have been replaced with modern refrigerators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : molkerei pfund has been called the " most beautiful creamery in the world " leaving the village of reinholdshain , paul gustav leander pfund went to dresden in 1879 with his wife , six children and a herd of pigs .
he started up the creamy business , which his brother friedrich later joined .
paul developed new products and manufacturing methods , improved hygienic processes and accessed new markets .
he was the first in germany to produce condensed milk .
he introduced pasteurization in 1900 . the two pfund brothers had a flourishing business that included several stores , their own insurance company , company housing and a swimming pool , as well as a kindergarten .
when paul died in 1923 , his children took over the business , which also remarkably withstood world war ii and the massive destruction of dresden . not succumbing to gdr deco in 1972 , the business became state-run in socialist east germany , with the variety of products reduced to just three sorts of cheese and milk . but zabel told dpa that the creamery was spared of the typical gdr decorating style . " people were able to stop plans to destroy the traditional tiles that were supposed to be replaced by plastic paneling , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hand-painted tiles lure one into the shop after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , the business virtually disappeared .
but , gaining inheritance rights , one of paul 's great-grandchildren restored the creamery to its former glory and founded the dresdener molkerei gebrüder pfund gmbh . zabel said that five percent of the old tiles had to be replaced ; the rest were restored , with the store opening up in 1995 .
now , cheese lovers can choose from 120 different sorts and wash it down with a glass of milk . the building also houses a restaurant and gift shop , where visitors can buy tile replicas .
but they may just have to elbow their way in : on some days , a slew of buses are lined up outside - packed with tourists . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

citing massive violations , russia 's communist party on sunday said it planned to contest the results of parliamentary elections that handed a huge victory to president vladimir putin 's party . shortly after the first returns in the parliamentary elections were announced on dec .
2 , communist party leader gennady zyuganov rejected the result and demanded that party monitors be allowed to verify the count , news agencies reported . " we do not trust these figures announced by the central elections commission and we will conduct a parallel count , " he said . " i am appealing to the authorities : stop raping the entire country , " zyuganov was quoted by interfax as saying . the head of the party 's legal office , vadim solovyov , separately said some 300,000 party observers had recorded more than 10,000 election violations during voting for the 450 seats to the state duma lower house of parliament . " our lawyers have already begun preparing a complaint to the supreme court to challenge the results of the elections , " solovyov was quoted by ria novosti as saying . " these are violations exceeding all acceptable norms , " he said . a kremlin-backed campaign to rig the election ? putin 's united russia party won an overwhelming lead in russia 's fifth parliamentary election since the 1991 fall of the soviet union , according to first partial results . zyuganov earlier said the election had been " the toughest and least democratic " ever held in post-soviet russia , itar-tass news agency reported . the opposition has accused the kremlin of suppressing debate during the campaign , dominating state television , confiscating election leaflets and arresting activists . meanwhile russians across the country complained of being pressured to vote in what election observers have said appeared to be part of an organized campaign to raise turnout and produce a big win for united russia , whose top candidate is putin . election-monitoring group golos , which is funded by eu and us organizations , documented cases of voters being paid to cast ballots for united russia , said alexander kynev , a political expert with the group .
in the town of pestovo in the western novgorod region , voters complained that they were given ballots that had already been filled out for united russia , he told reporters . only some 80 western observers were allowed into the country to monitor the vote spread across 11 time zones .
europe 's main election watchdog , the organization for security and cooperation in europe , had withdrawn plans to send a team to russia after accusing moscow of imposing restrictions and deliberately delaying the issuing of visas . putin had promised a fair and transparent election and the head of the central electoral commission , vladimir churov said voting had progressed " calmly and according to schedule . " churov has not commented on specific allegations of violations . boris gryzlov , chief of putin 's united russia party , told reporters violations were not significant .
" of course there are violations , but the question is do they have an impact on the final result ...
they in no way put in doubt the final result , " gryzlov told a news conference . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a partnership between local imams and the police has improved the situation . essen police officer herbert czarnyan was familiar with the unemployment , poverty and low education levels that led to youth crime in essen 's katernberg neighborhood .
but instead of cracking down on local youths himself , he turned to imams in katernberg 's three mosques for help . czarnyan organized a meeting that included businesspeople , the parents of children , who vandalized local property , and a lebanese imam . " -lsb- the imam -rsb- addressed the parents and told them that their children 's behavior was a disgrace for the community , and he demanded a response from the fathers , " czarnyan said of the first time essen 's police sought religious aid in fighting crime 10 years ago .
expanded cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mosques have become a center for recreational activities since that initial meeting , the partnership between police and the religious leader has grown to include talks with at-risk youth and their parents , and the mosque has become a contact point for educational opportunities and recreational activities . police say pressure from the imam helped curb youth crime and push down delinquency rates among immigrants in the region .
after seeing the progress made at essen 's lebanese mosque , halit pismek , an imam at one of essen 's two turkish mosques , gave his support to the project . " why should n't we work with the police ? "
pismek said , adding that the mosque 's religious council agreed with the decision .
" we are very satisfied .
our major problem was domestic violence and crime , and the members of the community wanted to find a way to solve this problem .
the police offer was perfect for us . " shared concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police and religious leaders communicate better thanks to the ongoing cooperation the agreement has also helped police , according to chief commissioner frank matuszek .
the youth in essen-katernberg understand that there is no more space beyond the reach of the law ..
matuszek said the cooperation has also helped break down barriers between mosque members and police officers . " we have learned more about each other in this project and have thus been able to dispel a lot of fears , " he said .
" the mosque community was able to see that police officers are only citizens in uniform and are also family fathers with the same concerns . " now 10 years old , the essen project is being copied and adapted by cities across germany with czarnyan often holding lectures about his work in large german cities , and pismek passing on his experiences to other religious leaders . alexandra jarecka -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

europe 's main election watchdog , the organization for security and cooperation in europe , had withdrawn plans to send a team to russia after accusing moscow of imposing restrictions and deliberately delaying the issuing of visas . putin had promised a fair and transparent election and the head of the central electoral commission , vladimir churov said voting had progressed " calmly and according to schedule . " churov has not commented on specific allegations of violations . boris gryzlov , chief of putin 's united russia party , told reporters violations were not significant .
" of course there are violations , but the question is do they have an impact on the final result ...
they in no way put in doubt the final result , " gryzlov told a news conference . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as russians elect a new parliament on sunday , dec .
2 , dw-world.de takes a look at several possible outcomes to a vote that has been criticized as step in putin 's path back to power . according to a recent survey , about two thirds of the russian population does n't expect sunday 's parliamentary elections to be run fairly . the country 's constitution stipulates that a president may only serve two consecutive terms , which would exclude president vladmir putin from staying on for a third term when his current one is up next year - a fact the kremlin elite does n't seem to want to accept . for the government leaders , most of whom come from the kgb , putin serves as a guarantee of their own status and , most importantly , their access to russia 's economic resources . the " 2008 problem " has been on the table for years : what to do to keep putin on after spring 2008 as russia 's most powerful man and thus maintain the existing order and distribution of power ? speculation and outcome theories abound ; the following three are the most popular . scenario one : from president to prime minister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to two scenarios , prime minister zubkov could become president the prime minister scenario is based on the fact that putin is running in the parliamentary elections as the top candidate of the united russia party , which has the strong support of the kremlin , and has n't excluded the possibility of becoming prime minister - either directly following the elections or in spring 2008 at the latest . according to russia 's current constitution , the office of prime minister has only limited authority .
should putin take on the position , it is expected that some of the presidential powers would be shifted to his new office .
one of putin 's confidantes , like sergei ivanov , viktor zubkov or boris gryzlov , would likely be named president . since the election of the prime minister occurs through a majority vote in the duma , russia 's parliament , the scenario could be touted both domestically and internationally as a boost for parliamentarianism . scenario two : the constitution card trick a second scenario stems from ambiguity in the constitution : following the elections in the duma , putin could step down as president and become a parliamentarian .
russia 's current prime minister viktor zubkov would then become the country 's third president since the fall of communism , after boris yeltsin and vladimir putin .
in this case , it would be possible - even if the constitutionality is hotly disputed - for putin to run in the march 2008 presidential elections and once again claim russia 's highest political chair . a variation on this scenario suggests that zubkov could be elected in march but resign a year later due to health reasons .
this would open the door once again for putin to reclaim the presidency . scenario three : the populist national leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a united russia campaign poster reads : " our choice is vladimir putin " according to a third scenario , putin would relinquish the presidency in 2008 , but informally maintain power by being glorified as the country 's " national leader . "
a new , supposedly spontaneous " for putin " movement has recently been campaigning in this direction .
the movement is , in fact , supported by the kremlin-supported united russia party . a win in sunday 's elections by united russia with putin as its top candidate would , according to this scenario , give him the moral right after his term expires to pressure his successor into maintaining his political course . the third scenario does n't rule out the possibility of putin returning to the presidency following an " acceptable " break . real possibilities following the social , economic and political upheaval of the 1990s , the russian population sees putin as a guarantor of political stability , which is in turn associated with economic growth and international influence . for this reason , the majority does n't expect fair elections , but still puts up with every strategic maneuver of the political elite to keep putin in power .
it is this apolitical stance , solidified by the kremlin 's harsh treatment of its critics , that make all three of these scenarios not just theories but real possibilities . ingo mannteufel heads dw-world.de 's russian department . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dozens of angels and putti , animals and flowers are depicted on the hand-painted tiles , spread across thousands of square feet . " up to 1,000 visitors come every day , " managing director frank zabel told german news agency dpa . survived world war ii the creamery was built 125 years ago by the pfund brothers .
even today , visitors can buy cheese and milk at the 4-meter-long -lrb- 13 feet -rrb- counter .
the fronts of the traditional " ice boxes " are still there too , but the original insides have been replaced with modern refrigerators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : molkerei pfund has been called the " most beautiful creamery in the world " leaving the village of reinholdshain , paul gustav leander pfund went to dresden in 1879 with his wife , six children and a herd of pigs .

its walls , ceiling and floor are covered with thousands of tiles in all different hues . so unique is the creamery that it 's made a record as the " prettiest milk store in the world " in the guinness book of world records .
dozens of angels and putti , animals and flowers are depicted on the hand-painted tiles , spread across thousands of square feet . " up to 1,000 visitors come every day , " managing director frank zabel told german news agency dpa . survived world war ii the creamery was built 125 years ago by the pfund brothers .
even today , visitors can buy cheese and milk at the 4-meter-long -lrb- 13 feet -rrb- counter .
the fronts of the traditional " ice boxes " are still there too , but the original insides have been replaced with modern refrigerators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : molkerei pfund has been called the " most beautiful creamery in the world " leaving the village of reinholdshain , paul gustav leander pfund went to dresden in 1879 with his wife , six children and a herd of pigs .
he started up the creamy business , which his brother friedrich later joined .
paul developed new products and manufacturing methods , improved hygienic processes and accessed new markets .
he was the first in germany to produce condensed milk .
he introduced pasteurization in 1900 . the two pfund brothers had a flourishing business that included several stores , their own insurance company , company housing and a swimming pool , as well as a kindergarten .
when paul died in 1923 , his children took over the business , which also remarkably withstood world war ii and the massive destruction of dresden . not succumbing to gdr deco in 1972 , the business became state-run in socialist east germany , with the variety of products reduced to just three sorts of cheese and milk . but zabel told dpa that the creamery was spared of the typical gdr decorating style . " people were able to stop plans to destroy the traditional tiles that were supposed to be replaced by plastic paneling , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hand-painted tiles lure one into the shop after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , the business virtually disappeared .
but , gaining inheritance rights , one of paul 's great-grandchildren restored the creamery to its former glory and founded the dresdener molkerei gebrüder pfund gmbh . zabel said that five percent of the old tiles had to be replaced ; the rest were restored , with the store opening up in 1995 .
now , cheese lovers can choose from 120 different sorts and wash it down with a glass of milk . the building also houses a restaurant and gift shop , where visitors can buy tile replicas .
but they may just have to elbow their way in : on some days , a slew of buses are lined up outside - packed with tourists . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as russians elect a new parliament on sunday , dec .
2 , dw-world.de takes a look at several possible outcomes to a vote that has been criticized as step in putin 's path back to power . according to a recent survey , about two thirds of the russian population does n't expect sunday 's parliamentary elections to be run fairly . the country 's constitution stipulates that a president may only serve two consecutive terms , which would exclude president vladmir putin from staying on for a third term when his current one is up next year - a fact the kremlin elite does n't seem to want to accept . for the government leaders , most of whom come from the kgb , putin serves as a guarantee of their own status and , most importantly , their access to russia 's economic resources . the " 2008 problem " has been on the table for years : what to do to keep putin on after spring 2008 as russia 's most powerful man and thus maintain the existing order and distribution of power ? speculation and outcome theories abound ; the following three are the most popular . scenario one : from president to prime minister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to two scenarios , prime minister zubkov could become president the prime minister scenario is based on the fact that putin is running in the parliamentary elections as the top candidate of the united russia party , which has the strong support of the kremlin , and has n't excluded the possibility of becoming prime minister - either directly following the elections or in spring 2008 at the latest . according to russia 's current constitution , the office of prime minister has only limited authority .
should putin take on the position , it is expected that some of the presidential powers would be shifted to his new office .
one of putin 's confidantes , like sergei ivanov , viktor zubkov or boris gryzlov , would likely be named president . since the election of the prime minister occurs through a majority vote in the duma , russia 's parliament , the scenario could be touted both domestically and internationally as a boost for parliamentarianism . scenario two : the constitution card trick a second scenario stems from ambiguity in the constitution : following the elections in the duma , putin could step down as president and become a parliamentarian .

as russians elect a new parliament on sunday , dec .
2 , dw-world.de takes a look at several possible outcomes to a vote that has been criticized as step in putin 's path back to power . according to a recent survey , about two thirds of the russian population does n't expect sunday 's parliamentary elections to be run fairly . the country 's constitution stipulates that a president may only serve two consecutive terms , which would exclude president vladmir putin from staying on for a third term when his current one is up next year - a fact the kremlin elite does n't seem to want to accept . for the government leaders , most of whom come from the kgb , putin serves as a guarantee of their own status and , most importantly , their access to russia 's economic resources . the " 2008 problem " has been on the table for years : what to do to keep putin on after spring 2008 as russia 's most powerful man and thus maintain the existing order and distribution of power ? speculation and outcome theories abound ; the following three are the most popular . scenario one : from president to prime minister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to two scenarios , prime minister zubkov could become president the prime minister scenario is based on the fact that putin is running in the parliamentary elections as the top candidate of the united russia party , which has the strong support of the kremlin , and has n't excluded the possibility of becoming prime minister - either directly following the elections or in spring 2008 at the latest . according to russia 's current constitution , the office of prime minister has only limited authority .
should putin take on the position , it is expected that some of the presidential powers would be shifted to his new office .
one of putin 's confidantes , like sergei ivanov , viktor zubkov or boris gryzlov , would likely be named president . since the election of the prime minister occurs through a majority vote in the duma , russia 's parliament , the scenario could be touted both domestically and internationally as a boost for parliamentarianism . scenario two : the constitution card trick a second scenario stems from ambiguity in the constitution : following the elections in the duma , putin could step down as president and become a parliamentarian .

as russians elect a new parliament on sunday , dec .
2 , dw-world.de takes a look at several possible outcomes to a vote that has been criticized as step in putin 's path back to power . according to a recent survey , about two thirds of the russian population does n't expect sunday 's parliamentary elections to be run fairly . the country 's constitution stipulates that a president may only serve two consecutive terms , which would exclude president vladmir putin from staying on for a third term when his current one is up next year - a fact the kremlin elite does n't seem to want to accept . for the government leaders , most of whom come from the kgb , putin serves as a guarantee of their own status and , most importantly , their access to russia 's economic resources . the " 2008 problem " has been on the table for years : what to do to keep putin on after spring 2008 as russia 's most powerful man and thus maintain the existing order and distribution of power ? speculation and outcome theories abound ; the following three are the most popular . scenario one : from president to prime minister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to two scenarios , prime minister zubkov could become president the prime minister scenario is based on the fact that putin is running in the parliamentary elections as the top candidate of the united russia party , which has the strong support of the kremlin , and has n't excluded the possibility of becoming prime minister - either directly following the elections or in spring 2008 at the latest . according to russia 's current constitution , the office of prime minister has only limited authority .
should putin take on the position , it is expected that some of the presidential powers would be shifted to his new office .
one of putin 's confidantes , like sergei ivanov , viktor zubkov or boris gryzlov , would likely be named president . since the election of the prime minister occurs through a majority vote in the duma , russia 's parliament , the scenario could be touted both domestically and internationally as a boost for parliamentarianism . scenario two : the constitution card trick a second scenario stems from ambiguity in the constitution : following the elections in the duma , putin could step down as president and become a parliamentarian .
russia 's current prime minister viktor zubkov would then become the country 's third president since the fall of communism , after boris yeltsin and vladimir putin .
in this case , it would be possible - even if the constitutionality is hotly disputed - for putin to run in the march 2008 presidential elections and once again claim russia 's highest political chair . a variation on this scenario suggests that zubkov could be elected in march but resign a year later due to health reasons .
this would open the door once again for putin to reclaim the presidency . scenario three : the populist national leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a united russia campaign poster reads : " our choice is vladimir putin " according to a third scenario , putin would relinquish the presidency in 2008 , but informally maintain power by being glorified as the country 's " national leader . "
a new , supposedly spontaneous " for putin " movement has recently been campaigning in this direction .
the movement is , in fact , supported by the kremlin-supported united russia party . a win in sunday 's elections by united russia with putin as its top candidate would , according to this scenario , give him the moral right after his term expires to pressure his successor into maintaining his political course . the third scenario does n't rule out the possibility of putin returning to the presidency following an " acceptable " break . real possibilities following the social , economic and political upheaval of the 1990s , the russian population sees putin as a guarantor of political stability , which is in turn associated with economic growth and international influence . for this reason , the majority does n't expect fair elections , but still puts up with every strategic maneuver of the political elite to keep putin in power .
it is this apolitical stance , solidified by the kremlin 's harsh treatment of its critics , that make all three of these scenarios not just theories but real possibilities . ingo mannteufel heads dw-world.de 's russian department . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a partnership between local imams and the police has improved the situation . essen police officer herbert czarnyan was familiar with the unemployment , poverty and low education levels that led to youth crime in essen 's katernberg neighborhood .
but instead of cracking down on local youths himself , he turned to imams in katernberg 's three mosques for help . czarnyan organized a meeting that included businesspeople , the parents of children , who vandalized local property , and a lebanese imam . " -lsb- the imam -rsb- addressed the parents and told them that their children 's behavior was a disgrace for the community , and he demanded a response from the fathers , " czarnyan said of the first time essen 's police sought religious aid in fighting crime 10 years ago .
expanded cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mosques have become a center for recreational activities since that initial meeting , the partnership between police and the religious leader has grown to include talks with at-risk youth and their parents , and the mosque has become a contact point for educational opportunities and recreational activities . police say pressure from the imam helped curb youth crime and push down delinquency rates among immigrants in the region .
after seeing the progress made at essen 's lebanese mosque , halit pismek , an imam at one of essen 's two turkish mosques , gave his support to the project . " why should n't we work with the police ? "
pismek said , adding that the mosque 's religious council agreed with the decision .

matuszek said the cooperation has also helped break down barriers between mosque members and police officers . " we have learned more about each other in this project and have thus been able to dispel a lot of fears , " he said .

but a partnership between local imams and the police has improved the situation . essen police officer herbert czarnyan was familiar with the unemployment , poverty and low education levels that led to youth crime in essen 's katernberg neighborhood .
but instead of cracking down on local youths himself , he turned to imams in katernberg 's three mosques for help . czarnyan organized a meeting that included businesspeople , the parents of children , who vandalized local property , and a lebanese imam . " -lsb- the imam -rsb- addressed the parents and told them that their children 's behavior was a disgrace for the community , and he demanded a response from the fathers , " czarnyan said of the first time essen 's police sought religious aid in fighting crime 10 years ago .
expanded cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mosques have become a center for recreational activities since that initial meeting , the partnership between police and the religious leader has grown to include talks with at-risk youth and their parents , and the mosque has become a contact point for educational opportunities and recreational activities . police say pressure from the imam helped curb youth crime and push down delinquency rates among immigrants in the region .
after seeing the progress made at essen 's lebanese mosque , halit pismek , an imam at one of essen 's two turkish mosques , gave his support to the project . " why should n't we work with the police ? "
pismek said , adding that the mosque 's religious council agreed with the decision .
" we are very satisfied .
our major problem was domestic violence and crime , and the members of the community wanted to find a way to solve this problem .
the police offer was perfect for us . " shared concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police and religious leaders communicate better thanks to the ongoing cooperation the agreement has also helped police , according to chief commissioner frank matuszek .
the youth in essen-katernberg understand that there is no more space beyond the reach of the law ..
matuszek said the cooperation has also helped break down barriers between mosque members and police officers . " we have learned more about each other in this project and have thus been able to dispel a lot of fears , " he said .
" the mosque community was able to see that police officers are only citizens in uniform and are also family fathers with the same concerns . " now 10 years old , the essen project is being copied and adapted by cities across germany with czarnyan often holding lectures about his work in large german cities , and pismek passing on his experiences to other religious leaders . alexandra jarecka -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as russians elect a new parliament on sunday , dec .
2 , dw-world.de takes a look at several possible outcomes to a vote that has been criticized as step in putin 's path back to power . according to a recent survey , about two thirds of the russian population does n't expect sunday 's parliamentary elections to be run fairly . the country 's constitution stipulates that a president may only serve two consecutive terms , which would exclude president vladmir putin from staying on for a third term when his current one is up next year - a fact the kremlin elite does n't seem to want to accept . for the government leaders , most of whom come from the kgb , putin serves as a guarantee of their own status and , most importantly , their access to russia 's economic resources . the " 2008 problem " has been on the table for years : what to do to keep putin on after spring 2008 as russia 's most powerful man and thus maintain the existing order and distribution of power ? speculation and outcome theories abound ; the following three are the most popular . scenario one : from president to prime minister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to two scenarios , prime minister zubkov could become president the prime minister scenario is based on the fact that putin is running in the parliamentary elections as the top candidate of the united russia party , which has the strong support of the kremlin , and has n't excluded the possibility of becoming prime minister - either directly following the elections or in spring 2008 at the latest . according to russia 's current constitution , the office of prime minister has only limited authority .
should putin take on the position , it is expected that some of the presidential powers would be shifted to his new office .
one of putin 's confidantes , like sergei ivanov , viktor zubkov or boris gryzlov , would likely be named president . since the election of the prime minister occurs through a majority vote in the duma , russia 's parliament , the scenario could be touted both domestically and internationally as a boost for parliamentarianism . scenario two : the constitution card trick a second scenario stems from ambiguity in the constitution : following the elections in the duma , putin could step down as president and become a parliamentarian .
russia 's current prime minister viktor zubkov would then become the country 's third president since the fall of communism , after boris yeltsin and vladimir putin .
in this case , it would be possible - even if the constitutionality is hotly disputed - for putin to run in the march 2008 presidential elections and once again claim russia 's highest political chair . a variation on this scenario suggests that zubkov could be elected in march but resign a year later due to health reasons .
this would open the door once again for putin to reclaim the presidency . scenario three : the populist national leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a united russia campaign poster reads : " our choice is vladimir putin " according to a third scenario , putin would relinquish the presidency in 2008 , but informally maintain power by being glorified as the country 's " national leader . "
a new , supposedly spontaneous " for putin " movement has recently been campaigning in this direction .
the movement is , in fact , supported by the kremlin-supported united russia party . a win in sunday 's elections by united russia with putin as its top candidate would , according to this scenario , give him the moral right after his term expires to pressure his successor into maintaining his political course . the third scenario does n't rule out the possibility of putin returning to the presidency following an " acceptable " break . real possibilities following the social , economic and political upheaval of the 1990s , the russian population sees putin as a guarantor of political stability , which is in turn associated with economic growth and international influence . for this reason , the majority does n't expect fair elections , but still puts up with every strategic maneuver of the political elite to keep putin in power .
it is this apolitical stance , solidified by the kremlin 's harsh treatment of its critics , that make all three of these scenarios not just theories but real possibilities . ingo mannteufel heads dw-world.de 's russian department . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this would open the door once again for putin to reclaim the presidency . scenario three : the populist national leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a united russia campaign poster reads : " our choice is vladimir putin " according to a third scenario , putin would relinquish the presidency in 2008 , but informally maintain power by being glorified as the country 's " national leader . "
a new , supposedly spontaneous " for putin " movement has recently been campaigning in this direction .
the movement is , in fact , supported by the kremlin-supported united russia party . a win in sunday 's elections by united russia with putin as its top candidate would , according to this scenario , give him the moral right after his term expires to pressure his successor into maintaining his political course . the third scenario does n't rule out the possibility of putin returning to the presidency following an " acceptable " break . real possibilities following the social , economic and political upheaval of the 1990s , the russian population sees putin as a guarantor of political stability , which is in turn associated with economic growth and international influence . for this reason , the majority does n't expect fair elections , but still puts up with every strategic maneuver of the political elite to keep putin in power .
it is this apolitical stance , solidified by the kremlin 's harsh treatment of its critics , that make all three of these scenarios not just theories but real possibilities . ingo mannteufel heads dw-world.de 's russian department . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

its walls , ceiling and floor are covered with thousands of tiles in all different hues . so unique is the creamery that it 's made a record as the " prettiest milk store in the world " in the guinness book of world records .
dozens of angels and putti , animals and flowers are depicted on the hand-painted tiles , spread across thousands of square feet . " up to 1,000 visitors come every day , " managing director frank zabel told german news agency dpa . survived world war ii the creamery was built 125 years ago by the pfund brothers .
even today , visitors can buy cheese and milk at the 4-meter-long -lrb- 13 feet -rrb- counter .
the fronts of the traditional " ice boxes " are still there too , but the original insides have been replaced with modern refrigerators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : molkerei pfund has been called the " most beautiful creamery in the world " leaving the village of reinholdshain , paul gustav leander pfund went to dresden in 1879 with his wife , six children and a herd of pigs .
he started up the creamy business , which his brother friedrich later joined .
paul developed new products and manufacturing methods , improved hygienic processes and accessed new markets .
he was the first in germany to produce condensed milk .
he introduced pasteurization in 1900 . the two pfund brothers had a flourishing business that included several stores , their own insurance company , company housing and a swimming pool , as well as a kindergarten .
when paul died in 1923 , his children took over the business , which also remarkably withstood world war ii and the massive destruction of dresden . not succumbing to gdr deco in 1972 , the business became state-run in socialist east germany , with the variety of products reduced to just three sorts of cheese and milk . but zabel told dpa that the creamery was spared of the typical gdr decorating style . " people were able to stop plans to destroy the traditional tiles that were supposed to be replaced by plastic paneling , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hand-painted tiles lure one into the shop after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , the business virtually disappeared .
but , gaining inheritance rights , one of paul 's great-grandchildren restored the creamery to its former glory and founded the dresdener molkerei gebrüder pfund gmbh . zabel said that five percent of the old tiles had to be replaced ; the rest were restored , with the store opening up in 1995 .
now , cheese lovers can choose from 120 different sorts and wash it down with a glass of milk . the building also houses a restaurant and gift shop , where visitors can buy tile replicas .
but they may just have to elbow their way in : on some days , a slew of buses are lined up outside - packed with tourists . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as russians elect a new parliament on sunday , dec .
2 , dw-world.de takes a look at several possible outcomes to a vote that has been criticized as step in putin 's path back to power . according to a recent survey , about two thirds of the russian population does n't expect sunday 's parliamentary elections to be run fairly . the country 's constitution stipulates that a president may only serve two consecutive terms , which would exclude president vladmir putin from staying on for a third term when his current one is up next year - a fact the kremlin elite does n't seem to want to accept . for the government leaders , most of whom come from the kgb , putin serves as a guarantee of their own status and , most importantly , their access to russia 's economic resources . the " 2008 problem " has been on the table for years : what to do to keep putin on after spring 2008 as russia 's most powerful man and thus maintain the existing order and distribution of power ? speculation and outcome theories abound ; the following three are the most popular . scenario one : from president to prime minister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to two scenarios , prime minister zubkov could become president the prime minister scenario is based on the fact that putin is running in the parliamentary elections as the top candidate of the united russia party , which has the strong support of the kremlin , and has n't excluded the possibility of becoming prime minister - either directly following the elections or in spring 2008 at the latest . according to russia 's current constitution , the office of prime minister has only limited authority .
should putin take on the position , it is expected that some of the presidential powers would be shifted to his new office .
one of putin 's confidantes , like sergei ivanov , viktor zubkov or boris gryzlov , would likely be named president . since the election of the prime minister occurs through a majority vote in the duma , russia 's parliament , the scenario could be touted both domestically and internationally as a boost for parliamentarianism . scenario two : the constitution card trick a second scenario stems from ambiguity in the constitution : following the elections in the duma , putin could step down as president and become a parliamentarian .
russia 's current prime minister viktor zubkov would then become the country 's third president since the fall of communism , after boris yeltsin and vladimir putin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : tackling youth crime squeezed in state poll , german politician pulls out old tricks conservative cdu turns youth crime debate into election issue german conservatives want crackdown on youth crime politicians call for tougher laws against young offenders intercultural dialogue -pipe- 02.12.2007 german mosque , police pair up to fight urban crime großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police in essen have turned to religious leaders , not handcuffs , to deal with local crime shoplifting and extortion used to be commonplace in part of the western german city of essen .
but a partnership between local imams and the police has improved the situation . essen police officer herbert czarnyan was familiar with the unemployment , poverty and low education levels that led to youth crime in essen 's katernberg neighborhood .
but instead of cracking down on local youths himself , he turned to imams in katernberg 's three mosques for help . czarnyan organized a meeting that included businesspeople , the parents of children , who vandalized local property , and a lebanese imam . " -lsb- the imam -rsb- addressed the parents and told them that their children 's behavior was a disgrace for the community , and he demanded a response from the fathers , " czarnyan said of the first time essen 's police sought religious aid in fighting crime 10 years ago .
expanded cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mosques have become a center for recreational activities since that initial meeting , the partnership between police and the religious leader has grown to include talks with at-risk youth and their parents , and the mosque has become a contact point for educational opportunities and recreational activities . police say pressure from the imam helped curb youth crime and push down delinquency rates among immigrants in the region .
after seeing the progress made at essen 's lebanese mosque , halit pismek , an imam at one of essen 's two turkish mosques , gave his support to the project . " why should n't we work with the police ? "
pismek said , adding that the mosque 's religious council agreed with the decision .
" we are very satisfied .
our major problem was domestic violence and crime , and the members of the community wanted to find a way to solve this problem .
the police offer was perfect for us . " shared concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police and religious leaders communicate better thanks to the ongoing cooperation the agreement has also helped police , according to chief commissioner frank matuszek .
the youth in essen-katernberg understand that there is no more space beyond the reach of the law ..
matuszek said the cooperation has also helped break down barriers between mosque members and police officers . " we have learned more about each other in this project and have thus been able to dispel a lot of fears , " he said .
" the mosque community was able to see that police officers are only citizens in uniform and are also family fathers with the same concerns . " now 10 years old , the essen project is being copied and adapted by cities across germany with czarnyan often holding lectures about his work in large german cities , and pismek passing on his experiences to other religious leaders . alexandra jarecka -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after seeing the progress made at essen 's lebanese mosque , halit pismek , an imam at one of essen 's two turkish mosques , gave his support to the project . " why should n't we work with the police ? "
pismek said , adding that the mosque 's religious council agreed with the decision .
" we are very satisfied .
our major problem was domestic violence and crime , and the members of the community wanted to find a way to solve this problem .
the police offer was perfect for us . " shared concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police and religious leaders communicate better thanks to the ongoing cooperation the agreement has also helped police , according to chief commissioner frank matuszek .
the youth in essen-katernberg understand that there is no more space beyond the reach of the law ..
matuszek said the cooperation has also helped break down barriers between mosque members and police officers . " we have learned more about each other in this project and have thus been able to dispel a lot of fears , " he said .
" the mosque community was able to see that police officers are only citizens in uniform and are also family fathers with the same concerns . " now 10 years old , the essen project is being copied and adapted by cities across germany with czarnyan often holding lectures about his work in large german cities , and pismek passing on his experiences to other religious leaders . alexandra jarecka -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as russians elect a new parliament on sunday , dec .
2 , dw-world.de takes a look at several possible outcomes to a vote that has been criticized as step in putin 's path back to power . according to a recent survey , about two thirds of the russian population does n't expect sunday 's parliamentary elections to be run fairly . the country 's constitution stipulates that a president may only serve two consecutive terms , which would exclude president vladmir putin from staying on for a third term when his current one is up next year - a fact the kremlin elite does n't seem to want to accept . for the government leaders , most of whom come from the kgb , putin serves as a guarantee of their own status and , most importantly , their access to russia 's economic resources . the " 2008 problem " has been on the table for years : what to do to keep putin on after spring 2008 as russia 's most powerful man and thus maintain the existing order and distribution of power ? speculation and outcome theories abound ; the following three are the most popular . scenario one : from president to prime minister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to two scenarios , prime minister zubkov could become president the prime minister scenario is based on the fact that putin is running in the parliamentary elections as the top candidate of the united russia party , which has the strong support of the kremlin , and has n't excluded the possibility of becoming prime minister - either directly following the elections or in spring 2008 at the latest . according to russia 's current constitution , the office of prime minister has only limited authority .
should putin take on the position , it is expected that some of the presidential powers would be shifted to his new office .
one of putin 's confidantes , like sergei ivanov , viktor zubkov or boris gryzlov , would likely be named president . since the election of the prime minister occurs through a majority vote in the duma , russia 's parliament , the scenario could be touted both domestically and internationally as a boost for parliamentarianism . scenario two : the constitution card trick a second scenario stems from ambiguity in the constitution : following the elections in the duma , putin could step down as president and become a parliamentarian .
russia 's current prime minister viktor zubkov would then become the country 's third president since the fall of communism , after boris yeltsin and vladimir putin .
in this case , it would be possible - even if the constitutionality is hotly disputed - for putin to run in the march 2008 presidential elections and once again claim russia 's highest political chair . a variation on this scenario suggests that zubkov could be elected in march but resign a year later due to health reasons .
this would open the door once again for putin to reclaim the presidency . scenario three : the populist national leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a united russia campaign poster reads : " our choice is vladimir putin " according to a third scenario , putin would relinquish the presidency in 2008 , but informally maintain power by being glorified as the country 's " national leader . "
a new , supposedly spontaneous " for putin " movement has recently been campaigning in this direction .
the movement is , in fact , supported by the kremlin-supported united russia party . a win in sunday 's elections by united russia with putin as its top candidate would , according to this scenario , give him the moral right after his term expires to pressure his successor into maintaining his political course . the third scenario does n't rule out the possibility of putin returning to the presidency following an " acceptable " break . real possibilities following the social , economic and political upheaval of the 1990s , the russian population sees putin as a guarantor of political stability , which is in turn associated with economic growth and international influence . for this reason , the majority does n't expect fair elections , but still puts up with every strategic maneuver of the political elite to keep putin in power .
it is this apolitical stance , solidified by the kremlin 's harsh treatment of its critics , that make all three of these scenarios not just theories but real possibilities . ingo mannteufel heads dw-world.de 's russian department . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as russians elect a new parliament on sunday , dec .
2 , dw-world.de takes a look at several possible outcomes to a vote that has been criticized as step in putin 's path back to power . according to a recent survey , about two thirds of the russian population does n't expect sunday 's parliamentary elections to be run fairly . the country 's constitution stipulates that a president may only serve two consecutive terms , which would exclude president vladmir putin from staying on for a third term when his current one is up next year - a fact the kremlin elite does n't seem to want to accept . for the government leaders , most of whom come from the kgb , putin serves as a guarantee of their own status and , most importantly , their access to russia 's economic resources . the " 2008 problem " has been on the table for years : what to do to keep putin on after spring 2008 as russia 's most powerful man and thus maintain the existing order and distribution of power ? speculation and outcome theories abound ; the following three are the most popular . scenario one : from president to prime minister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to two scenarios , prime minister zubkov could become president the prime minister scenario is based on the fact that putin is running in the parliamentary elections as the top candidate of the united russia party , which has the strong support of the kremlin , and has n't excluded the possibility of becoming prime minister - either directly following the elections or in spring 2008 at the latest . according to russia 's current constitution , the office of prime minister has only limited authority .
should putin take on the position , it is expected that some of the presidential powers would be shifted to his new office .
one of putin 's confidantes , like sergei ivanov , viktor zubkov or boris gryzlov , would likely be named president . since the election of the prime minister occurs through a majority vote in the duma , russia 's parliament , the scenario could be touted both domestically and internationally as a boost for parliamentarianism . scenario two : the constitution card trick a second scenario stems from ambiguity in the constitution : following the elections in the duma , putin could step down as president and become a parliamentarian .
russia 's current prime minister viktor zubkov would then become the country 's third president since the fall of communism , after boris yeltsin and vladimir putin .
in this case , it would be possible - even if the constitutionality is hotly disputed - for putin to run in the march 2008 presidential elections and once again claim russia 's highest political chair . a variation on this scenario suggests that zubkov could be elected in march but resign a year later due to health reasons .
this would open the door once again for putin to reclaim the presidency . scenario three : the populist national leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a united russia campaign poster reads : " our choice is vladimir putin " according to a third scenario , putin would relinquish the presidency in 2008 , but informally maintain power by being glorified as the country 's " national leader . "
a new , supposedly spontaneous " for putin " movement has recently been campaigning in this direction .
the movement is , in fact , supported by the kremlin-supported united russia party . a win in sunday 's elections by united russia with putin as its top candidate would , according to this scenario , give him the moral right after his term expires to pressure his successor into maintaining his political course . the third scenario does n't rule out the possibility of putin returning to the presidency following an " acceptable " break . real possibilities following the social , economic and political upheaval of the 1990s , the russian population sees putin as a guarantor of political stability , which is in turn associated with economic growth and international influence . for this reason , the majority does n't expect fair elections , but still puts up with every strategic maneuver of the political elite to keep putin in power .
it is this apolitical stance , solidified by the kremlin 's harsh treatment of its critics , that make all three of these scenarios not just theories but real possibilities . ingo mannteufel heads dw-world.de 's russian department . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i voted for united russia .
life 's got better under putin , " mohammed egemberdiyev , a 43-year-old plumber , told afp news service after casting his ballot at a polling station in central moscow .
opposition decries irregularities the election followed a campaign marred by accusations that the kremlin rigged the contest with controversial new election laws and media bias to ensure victory for putin 's party .
observers from the communist party , seen as russia 's main opposition force , also reported " an enormous quantity of violations across the whole country , " andrey klychkov , a legal expert for the party , told afp .
former chess champion and kremlin critic garry kasparov , who spent five days behind bars last week for taking part in an unauthorized anti-putin protest , called the elections a " farce " and said that russian authorities were " raping the whole electoral system " with numerous irregularities . " these elections are a reminder of soviet elections when there was no choice , " kasparov said after casting his ballot , according to reuters news service .

its walls , ceiling and floor are covered with thousands of tiles in all different hues . so unique is the creamery that it 's made a record as the " prettiest milk store in the world " in the guinness book of world records .
dozens of angels and putti , animals and flowers are depicted on the hand-painted tiles , spread across thousands of square feet . " up to 1,000 visitors come every day , " managing director frank zabel told german news agency dpa . survived world war ii the creamery was built 125 years ago by the pfund brothers .
even today , visitors can buy cheese and milk at the 4-meter-long -lrb- 13 feet -rrb- counter .
the fronts of the traditional " ice boxes " are still there too , but the original insides have been replaced with modern refrigerators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : molkerei pfund has been called the " most beautiful creamery in the world " leaving the village of reinholdshain , paul gustav leander pfund went to dresden in 1879 with his wife , six children and a herd of pigs .
he started up the creamy business , which his brother friedrich later joined .
paul developed new products and manufacturing methods , improved hygienic processes and accessed new markets .
he was the first in germany to produce condensed milk .
he introduced pasteurization in 1900 . the two pfund brothers had a flourishing business that included several stores , their own insurance company , company housing and a swimming pool , as well as a kindergarten .
when paul died in 1923 , his children took over the business , which also remarkably withstood world war ii and the massive destruction of dresden . not succumbing to gdr deco in 1972 , the business became state-run in socialist east germany , with the variety of products reduced to just three sorts of cheese and milk . but zabel told dpa that the creamery was spared of the typical gdr decorating style . " people were able to stop plans to destroy the traditional tiles that were supposed to be replaced by plastic paneling , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hand-painted tiles lure one into the shop after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , the business virtually disappeared .
but , gaining inheritance rights , one of paul 's great-grandchildren restored the creamery to its former glory and founded the dresdener molkerei gebrüder pfund gmbh . zabel said that five percent of the old tiles had to be replaced ; the rest were restored , with the store opening up in 1995 .
now , cheese lovers can choose from 120 different sorts and wash it down with a glass of milk . the building also houses a restaurant and gift shop , where visitors can buy tile replicas .
but they may just have to elbow their way in : on some days , a slew of buses are lined up outside - packed with tourists . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i wonder what they are going to call this one . "
meanwhile , romanian coach victor piturca refused to rule out the possibility of his team qualifying for the knockout phase , especially as they had finished ahead of the dutch in their qualifying group .

its walls , ceiling and floor are covered with thousands of tiles in all different hues . so unique is the creamery that it 's made a record as the " prettiest milk store in the world " in the guinness book of world records .
dozens of angels and putti , animals and flowers are depicted on the hand-painted tiles , spread across thousands of square feet . " up to 1,000 visitors come every day , " managing director frank zabel told german news agency dpa . survived world war ii the creamery was built 125 years ago by the pfund brothers .
even today , visitors can buy cheese and milk at the 4-meter-long -lrb- 13 feet -rrb- counter .
the fronts of the traditional " ice boxes " are still there too , but the original insides have been replaced with modern refrigerators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : molkerei pfund has been called the " most beautiful creamery in the world " leaving the village of reinholdshain , paul gustav leander pfund went to dresden in 1879 with his wife , six children and a herd of pigs .
he started up the creamy business , which his brother friedrich later joined .
paul developed new products and manufacturing methods , improved hygienic processes and accessed new markets .
he was the first in germany to produce condensed milk .
he introduced pasteurization in 1900 . the two pfund brothers had a flourishing business that included several stores , their own insurance company , company housing and a swimming pool , as well as a kindergarten .
when paul died in 1923 , his children took over the business , which also remarkably withstood world war ii and the massive destruction of dresden . not succumbing to gdr deco in 1972 , the business became state-run in socialist east germany , with the variety of products reduced to just three sorts of cheese and milk . but zabel told dpa that the creamery was spared of the typical gdr decorating style . " people were able to stop plans to destroy the traditional tiles that were supposed to be replaced by plastic paneling , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hand-painted tiles lure one into the shop after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , the business virtually disappeared .
but , gaining inheritance rights , one of paul 's great-grandchildren restored the creamery to its former glory and founded the dresdener molkerei gebrüder pfund gmbh . zabel said that five percent of the old tiles had to be replaced ; the rest were restored , with the store opening up in 1995 .
now , cheese lovers can choose from 120 different sorts and wash it down with a glass of milk . the building also houses a restaurant and gift shop , where visitors can buy tile replicas .
but they may just have to elbow their way in : on some days , a slew of buses are lined up outside - packed with tourists . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as russians elect a new parliament on sunday , dec .
2 , dw-world.de takes a look at several possible outcomes to a vote that has been criticized as step in putin 's path back to power . according to a recent survey , about two thirds of the russian population does n't expect sunday 's parliamentary elections to be run fairly . the country 's constitution stipulates that a president may only serve two consecutive terms , which would exclude president vladmir putin from staying on for a third term when his current one is up next year - a fact the kremlin elite does n't seem to want to accept . for the government leaders , most of whom come from the kgb , putin serves as a guarantee of their own status and , most importantly , their access to russia 's economic resources . the " 2008 problem " has been on the table for years : what to do to keep putin on after spring 2008 as russia 's most powerful man and thus maintain the existing order and distribution of power ? speculation and outcome theories abound ; the following three are the most popular . scenario one : from president to prime minister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to two scenarios , prime minister zubkov could become president the prime minister scenario is based on the fact that putin is running in the parliamentary elections as the top candidate of the united russia party , which has the strong support of the kremlin , and has n't excluded the possibility of becoming prime minister - either directly following the elections or in spring 2008 at the latest . according to russia 's current constitution , the office of prime minister has only limited authority .
should putin take on the position , it is expected that some of the presidential powers would be shifted to his new office .
one of putin 's confidantes , like sergei ivanov , viktor zubkov or boris gryzlov , would likely be named president . since the election of the prime minister occurs through a majority vote in the duma , russia 's parliament , the scenario could be touted both domestically and internationally as a boost for parliamentarianism . scenario two : the constitution card trick a second scenario stems from ambiguity in the constitution : following the elections in the duma , putin could step down as president and become a parliamentarian .
russia 's current prime minister viktor zubkov would then become the country 's third president since the fall of communism , after boris yeltsin and vladimir putin .
in this case , it would be possible - even if the constitutionality is hotly disputed - for putin to run in the march 2008 presidential elections and once again claim russia 's highest political chair . a variation on this scenario suggests that zubkov could be elected in march but resign a year later due to health reasons .
this would open the door once again for putin to reclaim the presidency . scenario three : the populist national leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a united russia campaign poster reads : " our choice is vladimir putin " according to a third scenario , putin would relinquish the presidency in 2008 , but informally maintain power by being glorified as the country 's " national leader . "
a new , supposedly spontaneous " for putin " movement has recently been campaigning in this direction .
the movement is , in fact , supported by the kremlin-supported united russia party . a win in sunday 's elections by united russia with putin as its top candidate would , according to this scenario , give him the moral right after his term expires to pressure his successor into maintaining his political course . the third scenario does n't rule out the possibility of putin returning to the presidency following an " acceptable " break . real possibilities following the social , economic and political upheaval of the 1990s , the russian population sees putin as a guarantor of political stability , which is in turn associated with economic growth and international influence . for this reason , the majority does n't expect fair elections , but still puts up with every strategic maneuver of the political elite to keep putin in power .
it is this apolitical stance , solidified by the kremlin 's harsh treatment of its critics , that make all three of these scenarios not just theories but real possibilities . ingo mannteufel heads dw-world.de 's russian department . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a partnership between local imams and the police has improved the situation . essen police officer herbert czarnyan was familiar with the unemployment , poverty and low education levels that led to youth crime in essen 's katernberg neighborhood .
but instead of cracking down on local youths himself , he turned to imams in katernberg 's three mosques for help . czarnyan organized a meeting that included businesspeople , the parents of children , who vandalized local property , and a lebanese imam . " -lsb- the imam -rsb- addressed the parents and told them that their children 's behavior was a disgrace for the community , and he demanded a response from the fathers , " czarnyan said of the first time essen 's police sought religious aid in fighting crime 10 years ago .
expanded cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mosques have become a center for recreational activities since that initial meeting , the partnership between police and the religious leader has grown to include talks with at-risk youth and their parents , and the mosque has become a contact point for educational opportunities and recreational activities . police say pressure from the imam helped curb youth crime and push down delinquency rates among immigrants in the region .
after seeing the progress made at essen 's lebanese mosque , halit pismek , an imam at one of essen 's two turkish mosques , gave his support to the project . " why should n't we work with the police ? "
pismek said , adding that the mosque 's religious council agreed with the decision .
" we are very satisfied .
our major problem was domestic violence and crime , and the members of the community wanted to find a way to solve this problem .
the police offer was perfect for us . " shared concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police and religious leaders communicate better thanks to the ongoing cooperation the agreement has also helped police , according to chief commissioner frank matuszek .
the youth in essen-katernberg understand that there is no more space beyond the reach of the law ..
matuszek said the cooperation has also helped break down barriers between mosque members and police officers . " we have learned more about each other in this project and have thus been able to dispel a lot of fears , " he said .
" the mosque community was able to see that police officers are only citizens in uniform and are also family fathers with the same concerns . " now 10 years old , the essen project is being copied and adapted by cities across germany with czarnyan often holding lectures about his work in large german cities , and pismek passing on his experiences to other religious leaders . alexandra jarecka -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

its walls , ceiling and floor are covered with thousands of tiles in all different hues . so unique is the creamery that it 's made a record as the " prettiest milk store in the world " in the guinness book of world records .
dozens of angels and putti , animals and flowers are depicted on the hand-painted tiles , spread across thousands of square feet . " up to 1,000 visitors come every day , " managing director frank zabel told german news agency dpa . survived world war ii the creamery was built 125 years ago by the pfund brothers .
even today , visitors can buy cheese and milk at the 4-meter-long -lrb- 13 feet -rrb- counter .
the fronts of the traditional " ice boxes " are still there too , but the original insides have been replaced with modern refrigerators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : molkerei pfund has been called the " most beautiful creamery in the world " leaving the village of reinholdshain , paul gustav leander pfund went to dresden in 1879 with his wife , six children and a herd of pigs .
he started up the creamy business , which his brother friedrich later joined .
paul developed new products and manufacturing methods , improved hygienic processes and accessed new markets .
he was the first in germany to produce condensed milk .
he introduced pasteurization in 1900 . the two pfund brothers had a flourishing business that included several stores , their own insurance company , company housing and a swimming pool , as well as a kindergarten .
when paul died in 1923 , his children took over the business , which also remarkably withstood world war ii and the massive destruction of dresden . not succumbing to gdr deco in 1972 , the business became state-run in socialist east germany , with the variety of products reduced to just three sorts of cheese and milk . but zabel told dpa that the creamery was spared of the typical gdr decorating style . " people were able to stop plans to destroy the traditional tiles that were supposed to be replaced by plastic paneling , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hand-painted tiles lure one into the shop after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , the business virtually disappeared .
but , gaining inheritance rights , one of paul 's great-grandchildren restored the creamery to its former glory and founded the dresdener molkerei gebrüder pfund gmbh . zabel said that five percent of the old tiles had to be replaced ; the rest were restored , with the store opening up in 1995 .
now , cheese lovers can choose from 120 different sorts and wash it down with a glass of milk . the building also houses a restaurant and gift shop , where visitors can buy tile replicas .
but they may just have to elbow their way in : on some days , a slew of buses are lined up outside - packed with tourists . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for the first time since the 1991 soviet collapse , pro-western liberal candidates were forecast to be excluded from parliament .
putin , 55 , who is required by the constitution to step down next year after two kremlin terms , heads united russia 's candidate list .
he said victory on sunday would give him a " moral " mandate in the future , fueling speculation that he intends to retain power .
" i 'm sure that voters have determined their preferences and now only have to come and vote for the party whose platform seems convincing , vote for those people in whom you trust , " he said after casting his ballot in moscow , according to ap news service .

" i voted for united russia .
life 's got better under putin , " mohammed egemberdiyev , a 43-year-old plumber , told afp news service after casting his ballot at a polling station in central moscow .
opposition decries irregularities the election followed a campaign marred by accusations that the kremlin rigged the contest with controversial new election laws and media bias to ensure victory for putin 's party .
observers from the communist party , seen as russia 's main opposition force , also reported " an enormous quantity of violations across the whole country , " andrey klychkov , a legal expert for the party , told afp .
former chess champion and kremlin critic garry kasparov , who spent five days behind bars last week for taking part in an unauthorized anti-putin protest , called the elections a " farce " and said that russian authorities were " raping the whole electoral system " with numerous irregularities . " these elections are a reminder of soviet elections when there was no choice , " kasparov said after casting his ballot , according to reuters news service .

as russians elect a new parliament on sunday , dec .
2 , dw-world.de takes a look at several possible outcomes to a vote that has been criticized as step in putin 's path back to power . according to a recent survey , about two thirds of the russian population does n't expect sunday 's parliamentary elections to be run fairly . the country 's constitution stipulates that a president may only serve two consecutive terms , which would exclude president vladmir putin from staying on for a third term when his current one is up next year - a fact the kremlin elite does n't seem to want to accept . for the government leaders , most of whom come from the kgb , putin serves as a guarantee of their own status and , most importantly , their access to russia 's economic resources . the " 2008 problem " has been on the table for years : what to do to keep putin on after spring 2008 as russia 's most powerful man and thus maintain the existing order and distribution of power ? speculation and outcome theories abound ; the following three are the most popular . scenario one : from president to prime minister bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to two scenarios , prime minister zubkov could become president the prime minister scenario is based on the fact that putin is running in the parliamentary elections as the top candidate of the united russia party , which has the strong support of the kremlin , and has n't excluded the possibility of becoming prime minister - either directly following the elections or in spring 2008 at the latest . according to russia 's current constitution , the office of prime minister has only limited authority .
should putin take on the position , it is expected that some of the presidential powers would be shifted to his new office .
one of putin 's confidantes , like sergei ivanov , viktor zubkov or boris gryzlov , would likely be named president . since the election of the prime minister occurs through a majority vote in the duma , russia 's parliament , the scenario could be touted both domestically and internationally as a boost for parliamentarianism . scenario two : the constitution card trick a second scenario stems from ambiguity in the constitution : following the elections in the duma , putin could step down as president and become a parliamentarian .
russia 's current prime minister viktor zubkov would then become the country 's third president since the fall of communism , after boris yeltsin and vladimir putin .
in this case , it would be possible - even if the constitutionality is hotly disputed - for putin to run in the march 2008 presidential elections and once again claim russia 's highest political chair . a variation on this scenario suggests that zubkov could be elected in march but resign a year later due to health reasons .
this would open the door once again for putin to reclaim the presidency . scenario three : the populist national leader bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a united russia campaign poster reads : " our choice is vladimir putin " according to a third scenario , putin would relinquish the presidency in 2008 , but informally maintain power by being glorified as the country 's " national leader . "
a new , supposedly spontaneous " for putin " movement has recently been campaigning in this direction .
the movement is , in fact , supported by the kremlin-supported united russia party . a win in sunday 's elections by united russia with putin as its top candidate would , according to this scenario , give him the moral right after his term expires to pressure his successor into maintaining his political course . the third scenario does n't rule out the possibility of putin returning to the presidency following an " acceptable " break . real possibilities following the social , economic and political upheaval of the 1990s , the russian population sees putin as a guarantor of political stability , which is in turn associated with economic growth and international influence . for this reason , the majority does n't expect fair elections , but still puts up with every strategic maneuver of the political elite to keep putin in power .
it is this apolitical stance , solidified by the kremlin 's harsh treatment of its critics , that make all three of these scenarios not just theories but real possibilities . ingo mannteufel heads dw-world.de 's russian department . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

citing massive violations , russia 's communist party on sunday said it planned to contest the results of parliamentary elections that handed a huge victory to president vladimir putin 's party . shortly after the first returns in the parliamentary elections were announced on dec .
2 , communist party leader gennady zyuganov rejected the result and demanded that party monitors be allowed to verify the count , news agencies reported . " we do not trust these figures announced by the central elections commission and we will conduct a parallel count , " he said . " i am appealing to the authorities : stop raping the entire country , " zyuganov was quoted by interfax as saying . the head of the party 's legal office , vadim solovyov , separately said some 300,000 party observers had recorded more than 10,000 election violations during voting for the 450 seats to the state duma lower house of parliament . " our lawyers have already begun preparing a complaint to the supreme court to challenge the results of the elections , " solovyov was quoted by ria novosti as saying . " these are violations exceeding all acceptable norms , " he said . a kremlin-backed campaign to rig the election ? putin 's united russia party won an overwhelming lead in russia 's fifth parliamentary election since the 1991 fall of the soviet union , according to first partial results . zyuganov earlier said the election had been " the toughest and least democratic " ever held in post-soviet russia , itar-tass news agency reported . the opposition has accused the kremlin of suppressing debate during the campaign , dominating state television , confiscating election leaflets and arresting activists . meanwhile russians across the country complained of being pressured to vote in what election observers have said appeared to be part of an organized campaign to raise turnout and produce a big win for united russia , whose top candidate is putin . election-monitoring group golos , which is funded by eu and us organizations , documented cases of voters being paid to cast ballots for united russia , said alexander kynev , a political expert with the group .
in the town of pestovo in the western novgorod region , voters complained that they were given ballots that had already been filled out for united russia , he told reporters . only some 80 western observers were allowed into the country to monitor the vote spread across 11 time zones .
europe 's main election watchdog , the organization for security and cooperation in europe , had withdrawn plans to send a team to russia after accusing moscow of imposing restrictions and deliberately delaying the issuing of visas . putin had promised a fair and transparent election and the head of the central electoral commission , vladimir churov said voting had progressed " calmly and according to schedule . " churov has not commented on specific allegations of violations . boris gryzlov , chief of putin 's united russia party , told reporters violations were not significant .
" of course there are violations , but the question is do they have an impact on the final result ...
they in no way put in doubt the final result , " gryzlov told a news conference . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the fronts of the traditional " ice boxes " are still there too , but the original insides have been replaced with modern refrigerators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : molkerei pfund has been called the " most beautiful creamery in the world " leaving the village of reinholdshain , paul gustav leander pfund went to dresden in 1879 with his wife , six children and a herd of pigs .
he started up the creamy business , which his brother friedrich later joined .
paul developed new products and manufacturing methods , improved hygienic processes and accessed new markets .
he was the first in germany to produce condensed milk .
he introduced pasteurization in 1900 . the two pfund brothers had a flourishing business that included several stores , their own insurance company , company housing and a swimming pool , as well as a kindergarten .
when paul died in 1923 , his children took over the business , which also remarkably withstood world war ii and the massive destruction of dresden . not succumbing to gdr deco in 1972 , the business became state-run in socialist east germany , with the variety of products reduced to just three sorts of cheese and milk . but zabel told dpa that the creamery was spared of the typical gdr decorating style . " people were able to stop plans to destroy the traditional tiles that were supposed to be replaced by plastic paneling , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hand-painted tiles lure one into the shop after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , the business virtually disappeared .
but , gaining inheritance rights , one of paul 's great-grandchildren restored the creamery to its former glory and founded the dresdener molkerei gebrüder pfund gmbh . zabel said that five percent of the old tiles had to be replaced ; the rest were restored , with the store opening up in 1995 .
now , cheese lovers can choose from 120 different sorts and wash it down with a glass of milk . the building also houses a restaurant and gift shop , where visitors can buy tile replicas .
but they may just have to elbow their way in : on some days , a slew of buses are lined up outside - packed with tourists . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russian opposition leaders called the poll a " farce . " merkel said she had noticed how difficult it had been for civil rights activists to be heard in russia .
" i also regret that osce observers will not be able to take part in the elections there , " merkel told deutschlandfunk public radio . the organization for the security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , europe 's main elections watchdog , called off its observer mission for the election , citing a lack of cooperation , a charged that moscow dismissed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel says she keeps talking to putin about her concerns when they meet " we surely have a responsibility to again argue at length " to call for russia 's approval for free parties and for the respect of human rights , merkel added .
she hoped that russia would choose to move towards being more open to different opinions . merkel acknowledged that under vladimir putin 's presidency , russians had more economic and material stability - citing salary increases and paid pensions - and that russia played a more active role on the international stage . " we depend on each other , but this does not mean we should not criticize on certain subjects that we view differently from the russian president , " she said .

for the first time since the 1991 soviet collapse , pro-western liberal candidates were forecast to be excluded from parliament .
putin , 55 , who is required by the constitution to step down next year after two kremlin terms , heads united russia 's candidate list .
he said victory on sunday would give him a " moral " mandate in the future , fueling speculation that he intends to retain power .
" i 'm sure that voters have determined their preferences and now only have to come and vote for the party whose platform seems convincing , vote for those people in whom you trust , " he said after casting his ballot in moscow , according to ap news service .
high voter turnout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers wait to cast their ballots in moscow polling stations opened in a wave across the world 's biggest country , from the pacific ocean to the baltic sea .
turnout was brisk , the central election commission said , despite voters having to brave icy temperatures .
" i voted for united russia .
life 's got better under putin , " mohammed egemberdiyev , a 43-year-old plumber , told afp news service after casting his ballot at a polling station in central moscow .
opposition decries irregularities the election followed a campaign marred by accusations that the kremlin rigged the contest with controversial new election laws and media bias to ensure victory for putin 's party .
observers from the communist party , seen as russia 's main opposition force , also reported " an enormous quantity of violations across the whole country , " andrey klychkov , a legal expert for the party , told afp .
former chess champion and kremlin critic garry kasparov , who spent five days behind bars last week for taking part in an unauthorized anti-putin protest , called the elections a " farce " and said that russian authorities were " raping the whole electoral system " with numerous irregularities . " these elections are a reminder of soviet elections when there was no choice , " kasparov said after casting his ballot , according to reuters news service .

citing massive violations , russia 's communist party on sunday said it planned to contest the results of parliamentary elections that handed a huge victory to president vladimir putin 's party . shortly after the first returns in the parliamentary elections were announced on dec .
2 , communist party leader gennady zyuganov rejected the result and demanded that party monitors be allowed to verify the count , news agencies reported . " we do not trust these figures announced by the central elections commission and we will conduct a parallel count , " he said . " i am appealing to the authorities : stop raping the entire country , " zyuganov was quoted by interfax as saying . the head of the party 's legal office , vadim solovyov , separately said some 300,000 party observers had recorded more than 10,000 election violations during voting for the 450 seats to the state duma lower house of parliament . " our lawyers have already begun preparing a complaint to the supreme court to challenge the results of the elections , " solovyov was quoted by ria novosti as saying . " these are violations exceeding all acceptable norms , " he said . a kremlin-backed campaign to rig the election ? putin 's united russia party won an overwhelming lead in russia 's fifth parliamentary election since the 1991 fall of the soviet union , according to first partial results . zyuganov earlier said the election had been " the toughest and least democratic " ever held in post-soviet russia , itar-tass news agency reported . the opposition has accused the kremlin of suppressing debate during the campaign , dominating state television , confiscating election leaflets and arresting activists . meanwhile russians across the country complained of being pressured to vote in what election observers have said appeared to be part of an organized campaign to raise turnout and produce a big win for united russia , whose top candidate is putin . election-monitoring group golos , which is funded by eu and us organizations , documented cases of voters being paid to cast ballots for united russia , said alexander kynev , a political expert with the group .

even young women recovering from anorexia who have maintained a healthy weight for over a year had vastly different brain activity patterns .
the findings in the american journal of psychiatry point to a brain region linked to anxiety and perfectionism .
the university of pittsburgh authors said the understanding might help with the development of new treatments .
the work could also explain why people with anorexia nervosa are able to deny themselves food . "
this demonstrates how complex eating disorders are ... they should be treated as a serious mental illness and not a silly diet gone wrong " a spokeswoman from the eating disorders association " beat " ' dieting ruined my health ' it is estimated that one in 100 women between the ages of 15 and 30 has anorexia .
the main symptom is the relentless pursuit of thinness through self-starvation .
this may become so extreme that it is life-threatening .
dr walter kaye and his team studied 13 women who were recovering from anorexia and 13 healthy women .
the women were asked to play a computer quiz where correct guesses were rewarded financially .
at the same time , the researchers observed what was going on inside the mind using a type of brain scan called functional magnetic resonance imaging .
worriers and perfectionists during the game , brain regions lit up in different ways for the two groups of women .
while the brain region for emotional responses - the anterior ventral striatum - showed strong differences for winning and losing the game in the healthy women , women with a past history of anorexia showed little difference between winning and losing .
dr kaye said that , in anorexia , this might impact on food enjoyment .
" for anorexics , then , perhaps it is difficult to appreciate immediate pleasure if it does not feel much different from a negative experience , " said dr kaye .
another brain area , called the caudate , which is involved in linking actions to outcome and planning , was far more active in the women with a history of anorexia compared to the control group .
the anorexia group tended to have exaggerated and obsessive worry about the consequences of their behaviours , looked for rules where there were none and were overly concerned about making mistakes , said dr kaye .
he said : " there are some positive aspects to this kind of temperament .
paying attention to detail and making sure things are done as correctly as possible are constructive traits in careers such as medicine or engineering . "
but carried to extremes , such obsessive thinking can be harmful , he said .
dr ian frampton of exeter university , who has himself been conducting mri studies in patients with anorexia , said : " this shows how the brain might be important in eating disorders .
" there may be networks in the brain that make someone vulnerable to developing an eating disorder . "
establishing a neurobiological cause might help remove some of the blame and stigma that surrounds conditions like anorexia , he said .
a spokeswoman from the eating disorders association " beat " said : " this demonstrates how complex eating disorders are and underlines that they should be treated as a serious mental illness and not a silly diet gone wrong . "

omar al bashir 's government appears to welcome western anger sudan 's leaders are rather used to the sound of western outrage - and have come to realise that , for them , it rarely amounts to much .
power in khartoum rests with the combined machinery of national security , police intelligence and the interior ministry .
for the most part these agencies do not meet with western diplomats - and they have little interest in improving sudan 's relationship with the west .
shadowy organisations running these shadowy organisations are men who have been blamed and in some cases named for arming militias and organising the conflict in darfur .
what men like them fear most is having to account for their role in atrocities that have killed over 200,000 darfuris over the last four years .
their strategy appears to be to keep the sudanese government at odds with the west and to try and minimise the international presence in the form of both aid workers and peacekeepers .
as part of this the security apparatus seizes on any opportunity to discredit westerners in the eyes of the sudanese public and mrs gibbons 's detention now seems to fall into that category .
during the two-and-a-half years i lived in sudan , expatriates were regularly targeted by the authorities .
aid workers who provided information about human rights abuses in darfur were often arrested or expelled as spies .
on one occasion a small private party of aid workers and peacekeepers in darfur was violently broken up by national security and one of the women was sexually assaulted by an officer .
the chad ' kidnap ' case angered sudanese leaders the story that appeared in newspapers the next day was of a western orgy having been halted .
an interesting recent example of the strategy came after the arrest of french aid workers on child abduction charges in chad .
most of the children appear to have come from the chadian side of the border but nafi ali nafie - one of sudan 's most powerful politicians - still gave a calculatedly inflammatory comment .
" the question is why these children were being taken to the west ?
perhaps to provide organs such as hearts and kidneys to elderly patients . "
peacekeepers blocked the disconnect between the public face of the sudanese government and the reality on the ground has been seen clearly on the international stage .
despite sudan 's president having given his approval to the deployment of a large african union / united nations peacekeeping force into darfur it remains plagued with problems .
in part that is because of a reluctance on the part of western countries to contribute helicopters .
but it is also clear that at a national and state level , security agencies are blocking their arrival every step of the way .
the un / au peacekeeping force has faced obstacles in khartoum refusals to accept troops from non-african countries , delays in the allocation of land for military bases and the denial of landing rights are just a few of the problems .
in ms gibbons 's case she has primarily been dealt with by the ministry of justice .
that is the same ministry of justice that was referred to the international criminal court in the hague by the un security council in 2005 , which described it as unwilling and incapable of dealing with darfur 's atrocities .
having been so publicly dismissed as weak , it comes as little surprise that the ministry has now seized on ms gibbons 's case as a chance to flex its muscles in the face of its critics .
oil revenue the idea of cutting uk aid to sudan has been mooted as a possible retaliatory measure for ms gibbons 's detention .
perhaps surprisingly , nothing would please the hardliners more .
throughout the darfur conflict , sudanese officials have accused donor countries of perpetuating the crisis with their aid , rather than reducing its severity .
the reason why the uk and the west feeds about four million darfuris every day is not because the sudanese government is too poor to do so itself .
on the contrary - khartoum receives billions of dollars a year in oil revenue .
it just believes its priorities lie elsewhere .
the uncomfortable truth is that if the estimated billion dollars a year in western aid dried up , the food would stop too - with potentially serious consequences for the millions of victims of the conflict .
it took concerted international pressure to get aid workers permission to enter darfur .
every step of the way since then , humanitarian workers have had to struggle to gain access to refugee camps and displaced people .
journalist paul salopek -lrb- l -rrb- was rescued by governor richardson for those hoping that gillian gibbons will be released before the end of her 15-day sentence , perhaps the most optimistic precedent lies in the case of an american journalist called paul salopek .
detained for illegally crossing the border into sudan in 2006 , he was held in a darfur jail - on charges of being a spy .
after a month in detention he was released owing to the intervention of us politician bill richardson , during a visit to khartoum .
this release was portrayed as a " humanitarian gesture " from the sudanese president omar al-bashir to his longstanding friend the new mexico governor .

omar al bashir 's government appears to welcome western anger sudan 's leaders are rather used to the sound of western outrage - and have come to realise that , for them , it rarely amounts to much .
power in khartoum rests with the combined machinery of national security , police intelligence and the interior ministry .
for the most part these agencies do not meet with western diplomats - and they have little interest in improving sudan 's relationship with the west .
shadowy organisations running these shadowy organisations are men who have been blamed and in some cases named for arming militias and organising the conflict in darfur .
what men like them fear most is having to account for their role in atrocities that have killed over 200,000 darfuris over the last four years .
their strategy appears to be to keep the sudanese government at odds with the west and to try and minimise the international presence in the form of both aid workers and peacekeepers .
as part of this the security apparatus seizes on any opportunity to discredit westerners in the eyes of the sudanese public and mrs gibbons 's detention now seems to fall into that category .
during the two-and-a-half years i lived in sudan , expatriates were regularly targeted by the authorities .
aid workers who provided information about human rights abuses in darfur were often arrested or expelled as spies .
on one occasion a small private party of aid workers and peacekeepers in darfur was violently broken up by national security and one of the women was sexually assaulted by an officer .
the chad ' kidnap ' case angered sudanese leaders the story that appeared in newspapers the next day was of a western orgy having been halted .
an interesting recent example of the strategy came after the arrest of french aid workers on child abduction charges in chad .
most of the children appear to have come from the chadian side of the border but nafi ali nafie - one of sudan 's most powerful politicians - still gave a calculatedly inflammatory comment .
" the question is why these children were being taken to the west ?
perhaps to provide organs such as hearts and kidneys to elderly patients . "
peacekeepers blocked the disconnect between the public face of the sudanese government and the reality on the ground has been seen clearly on the international stage .
despite sudan 's president having given his approval to the deployment of a large african union / united nations peacekeeping force into darfur it remains plagued with problems .
in part that is because of a reluctance on the part of western countries to contribute helicopters .
but it is also clear that at a national and state level , security agencies are blocking their arrival every step of the way .
the un / au peacekeeping force has faced obstacles in khartoum refusals to accept troops from non-african countries , delays in the allocation of land for military bases and the denial of landing rights are just a few of the problems .
in ms gibbons 's case she has primarily been dealt with by the ministry of justice .
that is the same ministry of justice that was referred to the international criminal court in the hague by the un security council in 2005 , which described it as unwilling and incapable of dealing with darfur 's atrocities .
having been so publicly dismissed as weak , it comes as little surprise that the ministry has now seized on ms gibbons 's case as a chance to flex its muscles in the face of its critics .
oil revenue the idea of cutting uk aid to sudan has been mooted as a possible retaliatory measure for ms gibbons 's detention .
perhaps surprisingly , nothing would please the hardliners more .
throughout the darfur conflict , sudanese officials have accused donor countries of perpetuating the crisis with their aid , rather than reducing its severity .
the reason why the uk and the west feeds about four million darfuris every day is not because the sudanese government is too poor to do so itself .
on the contrary - khartoum receives billions of dollars a year in oil revenue .
it just believes its priorities lie elsewhere .
the uncomfortable truth is that if the estimated billion dollars a year in western aid dried up , the food would stop too - with potentially serious consequences for the millions of victims of the conflict .
it took concerted international pressure to get aid workers permission to enter darfur .
every step of the way since then , humanitarian workers have had to struggle to gain access to refugee camps and displaced people .
journalist paul salopek -lrb- l -rrb- was rescued by governor richardson for those hoping that gillian gibbons will be released before the end of her 15-day sentence , perhaps the most optimistic precedent lies in the case of an american journalist called paul salopek .
detained for illegally crossing the border into sudan in 2006 , he was held in a darfur jail - on charges of being a spy .
after a month in detention he was released owing to the intervention of us politician bill richardson , during a visit to khartoum .
this release was portrayed as a " humanitarian gesture " from the sudanese president omar al-bashir to his longstanding friend the new mexico governor .
british diplomats will be hoping that lord ahmed 's visit can have the same effect .

the un / au peacekeeping force has faced obstacles in khartoum refusals to accept troops from non-african countries , delays in the allocation of land for military bases and the denial of landing rights are just a few of the problems .
in ms gibbons 's case she has primarily been dealt with by the ministry of justice .
that is the same ministry of justice that was referred to the international criminal court in the hague by the un security council in 2005 , which described it as unwilling and incapable of dealing with darfur 's atrocities .
having been so publicly dismissed as weak , it comes as little surprise that the ministry has now seized on ms gibbons 's case as a chance to flex its muscles in the face of its critics .
oil revenue the idea of cutting uk aid to sudan has been mooted as a possible retaliatory measure for ms gibbons 's detention .
perhaps surprisingly , nothing would please the hardliners more .
throughout the darfur conflict , sudanese officials have accused donor countries of perpetuating the crisis with their aid , rather than reducing its severity .
the reason why the uk and the west feeds about four million darfuris every day is not because the sudanese government is too poor to do so itself .
on the contrary - khartoum receives billions of dollars a year in oil revenue .
it just believes its priorities lie elsewhere .
the uncomfortable truth is that if the estimated billion dollars a year in western aid dried up , the food would stop too - with potentially serious consequences for the millions of victims of the conflict .
it took concerted international pressure to get aid workers permission to enter darfur .
every step of the way since then , humanitarian workers have had to struggle to gain access to refugee camps and displaced people .
journalist paul salopek -lrb- l -rrb- was rescued by governor richardson for those hoping that gillian gibbons will be released before the end of her 15-day sentence , perhaps the most optimistic precedent lies in the case of an american journalist called paul salopek .
detained for illegally crossing the border into sudan in 2006 , he was held in a darfur jail - on charges of being a spy .
after a month in detention he was released owing to the intervention of us politician bill richardson , during a visit to khartoum .
this release was portrayed as a " humanitarian gesture " from the sudanese president omar al-bashir to his longstanding friend the new mexico governor .
british diplomats will be hoping that lord ahmed 's visit can have the same effect .

bbc news -pipe- technology -pipe- broadband speeds around the world bbc news / technology graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- sunday , 2 december 2007 , 10:16 gmt broadband speeds around the world as the uk debates how and when to roll our faster broadband networks , we look at the huge divide between the speeds of some of the world 's faster broadband nations and some of the slowest .
there is also a big gap between the advertised speeds and the actual speeds users are getting .
united kingdom currently in the uk the big issue is the gap between advertised and actual speeds , so while 10mbps might be available from a few suppliers , very few actually get this speed .
according to speedtest.net - a global speed test created by actual users and approved by most of the major isps in the us - the real speed is closer to 3mbps .
things get faster next year as adsl2 + comes online promising speeds of up to 24mbps , although as with all dsl technology , there are physical limits and only those close to the exchange will actually get the top speeds .
virgin media is currently trialling a 50mbps cable service and bt is also experimenting with fibre to the home , which could offers speeds of up to 100mbps .
return to map france france has an advertised average of 44mbps .
according to speedtest.net the average speed from those doing the test is 4.6mbps but higher speeds are beginning to come online .
adsl2 + is already available and is being marketed as providing speeds of up to 28mbps .
actual speeds will vary although the copper telephone lines are generally of better quality than in the uk , so speeds are typically higher .
the leading isps in france have announced fibre-based services .
orange and frees ' offerings are live now and are marketed at offering speeds around 50mbps .
free 's offer at 29 euros a month , comes bundled with a broadband telephone service , iptv , plus a free set top box .
return to map germany average advertised speeds of 9mbps falls to 4.8mbps according to speedtest.net.
in germany the main delivery mechanism is still largely dsl , and the leading company is the old incumbent deutsche telekom .
they have a vdsl network - which provides fibre as far as the street cabinet .
this is live in the main german cities , and offers speeds of up to around 25mbps .
outside of the main towns there is a mixture of adsl 1 and 2 technologies .
return to map sweden average advertised speed of 21mbps but according to speedtest.net , people are actually achieving an average of 7.4mbps.
in sweden there is a vdsl network live .
fibre has been available for quite a long time with a significant number of people served by it .
speeds vary depending on which network , but can go up to 100mbps , however there is a big polarisation between those that get it and those still relying on dsl products .
return to map south africa 1mbps -lrb- this data comes from the itu as oecd does n't have figures for africa -rrb- .
alongside countries such as morocco , south africa is one of the biggest broadband countries in africa .
the primary delivery mechanism is via broadband .
wimax penetration is still low .
although it is likely to become an important infrastructure in africa , currently it is too expensive to be widely deployed .
return to map israel israel 's advertised figure is 2mbps .
israel has very high penetration levels with around 70 % of households using a broadband connection .
there is quite a lot of cable services available alongside dsl and there has been quite a big government spend on broadband .
return to map united states the us has an average speed of 8mbps according to the oecd , although it is nearly half this -lrb- 4.6mbps -rrb- according to speedtest.net.
the us is unusual because it is one of the few countries in which cable is the largest connection network .
typically cable is marketed at offering between 5mbps and 20mbps .
number of fibre providers , most notably verizon which offers fibre to home , with speeds up to 20mb , this is just available on the east coast .
att is offering a hybrid dsl service while qwest has just announced a fibre to street strategy .
return to map mexico mexico 's advertised speed is 2mbps .
in mexico the predominant infrastructure is broadband via dsl .
its rich incumbent telecom firm telmex are considering laying fibre and despite the fact that there is no large scale implementation it is likely to overtake the uk very soon in terms of the amount of fibre available .
return to map japan japan has an average speed of 93mbps according to the oecd , but this falls to 10.6mbps according to speedtest.net , which could be indicative of the fact that fibre is concentrated in the towns and cities .
cable broadband is quite strong in japan but the biggest market is in fibre to the home .
this has proved so popular with consumers that dsl is actually in decline .
companies are so advanced with fibre delivery that they are beginning to find dsl surplus to requirements .
the speeds fibre provides means applications such as sharing video files are standard .
fibre also dramatically improves upload speeds , making it much more suitable for web 2.0 communication , with individuals contributing back to the internet with pictures and videos .
return to map south korea south korea 's figure is 43mbps .
in south korea there has also been a very strong fibre rollout , which has been enabled , at least in part , by state contributions .
often regarded as something of a gold standard when it comes to super-fast broadband , an amazing 90 % of homes have a broadband connection of between 50 and 100mbps .
they also pay the lowest rates in the world .
there are pilot services offering connections starting at 1,000mbps .
the big driver for fast broadband here is gaming and 43 % of the population has a personal profile in the virtual world cyworld , which recorded £ 5m worth of trade per month last year .
those dawdling on slow uk connections can take heart from results from speedtest.net which show that some citizens are only achieving speeds of 3.6mbps.
this is because the extremely fast networks are concentrated in the towns and cities .
return to map new zealand average advertised speed of 13.5mbps , falls to 2.4mbps according to speedtest.net broadband comes largely via dsl in new zealand where telecom new zealand is very dominant .
cable is limited to one or two cities .
there are very specific challenges for providers in new zealand .
because of the distances between houses there tends to be very long telephone lines , meaning quality is not great for many .
international connectivity is also an issue because of its physical distance from the rest of the world .
there is not much competition meaning speeds stay slow .
the model of local loop unbundling - opening the telephone exchanges to other operators - is being considered as is the idea of providing fibre to the street cabinet or to push dsl into remoter street cabinets to reduce line length .
return to map poland average speed of 4mbps , falls to 1.6mbps according to speedtest.net.
in poland there is virtually no local loop unbundling , which means little competition for the france telecom-owned incumbent .
speeds there are n't fast by western european standards although there are quite a lot of so-called lan networks -lrb- local area networks -rrb- using ethernet cable , which allow for super-fast speeds because of their limited geography .
this phenomenon is peculiar to eastern european countries such as poland where the existing infrastructure is n't great but it is relatively easy for local entrepreneurs to set up such systems quickly .
return to map china itu data puts china 's broadband speed at 1mbps .
china is fast becoming the world 's largest broadband economy .
it is laying quite a lot of fibre which is a less disruptive option in china because of the amount of new building work being done .
it already has 14 million fibre lines , compared to 9.6 million in japan , 1.7m in the us and just a few thousand in the uk but it does n't generate the same speeds as in other asian countries because the fibre tends to feed into blocks of flats rather than individual dwellings .

often regarded as something of a gold standard when it comes to super-fast broadband , an amazing 90 % of homes have a broadband connection of between 50 and 100mbps .
they also pay the lowest rates in the world .
there are pilot services offering connections starting at 1,000mbps .
the big driver for fast broadband here is gaming and 43 % of the population has a personal profile in the virtual world cyworld , which recorded £ 5m worth of trade per month last year .
those dawdling on slow uk connections can take heart from results from speedtest.net which show that some citizens are only achieving speeds of 3.6mbps.
this is because the extremely fast networks are concentrated in the towns and cities .
return to map new zealand average advertised speed of 13.5mbps , falls to 2.4mbps according to speedtest.net broadband comes largely via dsl in new zealand where telecom new zealand is very dominant .
cable is limited to one or two cities .
there are very specific challenges for providers in new zealand .
because of the distances between houses there tends to be very long telephone lines , meaning quality is not great for many .
international connectivity is also an issue because of its physical distance from the rest of the world .
there is not much competition meaning speeds stay slow .
the model of local loop unbundling - opening the telephone exchanges to other operators - is being considered as is the idea of providing fibre to the street cabinet or to push dsl into remoter street cabinets to reduce line length .
return to map poland average speed of 4mbps , falls to 1.6mbps according to speedtest.net.
in poland there is virtually no local loop unbundling , which means little competition for the france telecom-owned incumbent .
speeds there are n't fast by western european standards although there are quite a lot of so-called lan networks -lrb- local area networks -rrb- using ethernet cable , which allow for super-fast speeds because of their limited geography .
this phenomenon is peculiar to eastern european countries such as poland where the existing infrastructure is n't great but it is relatively easy for local entrepreneurs to set up such systems quickly .
return to map china itu data puts china 's broadband speed at 1mbps .
china is fast becoming the world 's largest broadband economy .
it is laying quite a lot of fibre which is a less disruptive option in china because of the amount of new building work being done .
it already has 14 million fibre lines , compared to 9.6 million in japan , 1.7m in the us and just a few thousand in the uk but it does n't generate the same speeds as in other asian countries because the fibre tends to feed into blocks of flats rather than individual dwellings .

there is also a big gap between the advertised speeds and the actual speeds users are getting .
united kingdom currently in the uk the big issue is the gap between advertised and actual speeds , so while 10mbps might be available from a few suppliers , very few actually get this speed .
according to speedtest.net - a global speed test created by actual users and approved by most of the major isps in the us - the real speed is closer to 3mbps .
things get faster next year as adsl2 + comes online promising speeds of up to 24mbps , although as with all dsl technology , there are physical limits and only those close to the exchange will actually get the top speeds .
virgin media is currently trialling a 50mbps cable service and bt is also experimenting with fibre to the home , which could offers speeds of up to 100mbps .
return to map france france has an advertised average of 44mbps .
according to speedtest.net the average speed from those doing the test is 4.6mbps but higher speeds are beginning to come online .
adsl2 + is already available and is being marketed as providing speeds of up to 28mbps .
actual speeds will vary although the copper telephone lines are generally of better quality than in the uk , so speeds are typically higher .
the leading isps in france have announced fibre-based services .
orange and frees ' offerings are live now and are marketed at offering speeds around 50mbps .
free 's offer at 29 euros a month , comes bundled with a broadband telephone service , iptv , plus a free set top box .
return to map germany average advertised speeds of 9mbps falls to 4.8mbps according to speedtest.net.
in germany the main delivery mechanism is still largely dsl , and the leading company is the old incumbent deutsche telekom .
they have a vdsl network - which provides fibre as far as the street cabinet .
this is live in the main german cities , and offers speeds of up to around 25mbps .
outside of the main towns there is a mixture of adsl 1 and 2 technologies .
return to map sweden average advertised speed of 21mbps but according to speedtest.net , people are actually achieving an average of 7.4mbps.
in sweden there is a vdsl network live .
fibre has been available for quite a long time with a significant number of people served by it .
speeds vary depending on which network , but can go up to 100mbps , however there is a big polarisation between those that get it and those still relying on dsl products .
return to map south africa 1mbps -lrb- this data comes from the itu as oecd does n't have figures for africa -rrb- .
alongside countries such as morocco , south africa is one of the biggest broadband countries in africa .
the primary delivery mechanism is via broadband .
wimax penetration is still low .
although it is likely to become an important infrastructure in africa , currently it is too expensive to be widely deployed .
return to map israel israel 's advertised figure is 2mbps .
israel has very high penetration levels with around 70 % of households using a broadband connection .
there is quite a lot of cable services available alongside dsl and there has been quite a big government spend on broadband .
return to map united states the us has an average speed of 8mbps according to the oecd , although it is nearly half this -lrb- 4.6mbps -rrb- according to speedtest.net.
the us is unusual because it is one of the few countries in which cable is the largest connection network .
typically cable is marketed at offering between 5mbps and 20mbps .
number of fibre providers , most notably verizon which offers fibre to home , with speeds up to 20mb , this is just available on the east coast .
att is offering a hybrid dsl service while qwest has just announced a fibre to street strategy .
return to map mexico mexico 's advertised speed is 2mbps .
in mexico the predominant infrastructure is broadband via dsl .
its rich incumbent telecom firm telmex are considering laying fibre and despite the fact that there is no large scale implementation it is likely to overtake the uk very soon in terms of the amount of fibre available .
return to map japan japan has an average speed of 93mbps according to the oecd , but this falls to 10.6mbps according to speedtest.net , which could be indicative of the fact that fibre is concentrated in the towns and cities .
cable broadband is quite strong in japan but the biggest market is in fibre to the home .
this has proved so popular with consumers that dsl is actually in decline .
companies are so advanced with fibre delivery that they are beginning to find dsl surplus to requirements .
the speeds fibre provides means applications such as sharing video files are standard .
fibre also dramatically improves upload speeds , making it much more suitable for web 2.0 communication , with individuals contributing back to the internet with pictures and videos .
return to map south korea south korea 's figure is 43mbps .
