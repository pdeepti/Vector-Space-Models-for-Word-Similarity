many young people reject their elders ' political claims for compensation but embrace their cultural roots . there is likely to be a generational divide when german expellees and their families commemorate tag der heimat or day of the homeland on saturday .
represented in large part by the league of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , a controversial group that lobbies and seeks compensation for ethnic germans and their descendants , the aging expellees themselves reflect on the injustices that occurred as the third reich crumbled and millions of ethnic germans were expelled from their homelands in eastern europe .
younger people , on the other hand , said they will be paying more attention to their cultural heritage .
leaving controversy behind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can expellee groups keep young people interested ?
for 17-year-old veronika moll , the day of remembrance is not about international relations but about dancing .
moll , a high school student in munich , is part of a silesian folk dancing group that performs at events like tag der heimat , as well as at her hometown 's famous oktoberfest .
she also takes part in conferences about expellee issues and other cultural activities .
both of moll 's grandmothers were expelled from silesia , in southwestern poland , at the end of world war ii .
while some people of the older generation feel silesia belongs to them , moll said she does n't feel that way at all . although she still feels special ties to silesia , munich is home .
" it 's simply not the situation that you can go back to silesia , " she said .
" it 's too long ago .
it 's important to not forget the history and to make sure that everyone knows what happened and that an injustice occurred .
but you ca n't displace all of the polish or other people who have lived in these houses or on this land for 60 years . "
youth groups focus on future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the average age for many groups is getting older this type of attitude is typical among the descendants of expellees , said thomas hoffmann , who heads the organization german youth in europe .
while the first generation of expellees dreamed of returning home , their grandchildren are uninterested in going back , hoffmann said .
the first part of german youth in europe 's harkens back to its foundation in 1951 as a group to fight for the rights of german expellee youths .
over the years it has evolved into a more progressive organization which promotes reconciliation and integration .
the group has approximately 90,000 members .
janna keberlein , a member of the youth organization and 28-year-old student at the university of düsseldorf , said that while her ethnic german grandparents still get angry about being deported from the volga region to kazakhstan during the war , she thinks the issue needs to be closed .
" young people do n't have to be drawn into this history of suffering , " the 28-year-old düsseldorf university student said , adding that she has no interest in being politically involved in the league of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- .
a taboo subject bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the silesian traditions remain important to some youth for many young people , the bdv focuses too much on the past , a fact seen in the graying of the organization , said alfred de zayas , a leading scholar on germen expellees .
when he gives talks to expellee groups , the average age is usually 60 , he said .
de zayas served for years as a lawyer for the united nations high commissioner for human rights .
he is currently a professor of international law at the geneva school of diplomacy .
he wrote the first scholarly work on german expellees to appear in english , breaking what had long been a taboo topic .
the post-war expulsions were the largest forced movement of europeans in the 20th century .
historians estimate that between 12 and 15 million people were expelled during the forced migrations .
finding an interest in cultural heritage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expellees on the road to germany de zayas ' books have been controversial in germany because he feels expellees have legal rights to reclaim lost property .
but that 's a claim he said he doubts younger generations will pursue as most are simply not interested in the debate 's political dimensions .
instead young people from expellee backgrounds are only just now becoming interested in their cultural heritage to find out more about themselves , de zayas said , adding that he expects that interest to grow .
" it 's important for your identity that you know where you come from , " de zayas said .
" it 's a peaceful activity .
that 's a good thing , and i 'm persuaded that will happen . " trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany cites international law as well as the german-soviet agreement .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de architecture -pipe- 16.08.2007 cologne cathedral is a picture of heaven , says its master builder großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the sheer size of the cathedral that many find impressive barbara schock-werner , a respected architect and art historian , is the first woman to become master builder of a german cathedral .
she knows every crook and cranny of germany 's favorite landmark . dw : what is the allure of the cologne cathedral in your opinion ? barbara schock-werner : there are two things : the first is the building itself , its size , its perfection and its beauty .
but it 's also the visitor-friendly management that ’ s behind it .
for example , there 's no entry fee - it 's a church and everyone 's welcome .
we have very long opening hours , from 6:00 am to 7:30 pm .
and we make a large effort to have friendly management , group tours , not too many tours at the same time , etc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the sheer size of the cathedral that many find impressive what about the building itself attracts people ? the overwhelming space .
go in , sit down - and your heart rises .
it 's something that really has an effect on your body and soul .
you have imagine that the people in the middle ages lived in much smaller spaces and they were n't used to theaters and cinemas , which are matter-of-fact for us today .
for them it must have seemed even bigger . the purpose behind the building was less to glorify the archbishop of cologne and much more an effort to give the christians a picture of heaven .
when you take your time , sit down and take in the building , you can experience that today as well . many people ask why the cathedral constantly seems to be under construction .
what do you say to that ? all historical buildings have to be taken care of if they are to be preserved .
the gothic ones are unfortunately the most fragile because their surfaces are so complicated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cathedral 's towers are about 157 meters -lrb- 515 feet -rrb- tall the cathedral building foundation and cathedral workshop , which i have overseen since 1999 , are there to manage the preservation of the church .
these incorporate a staff of 80 people .
thirty of these are craftspeople , including stonemasons , scaffold makers , roofers , locksmiths , carpenters , blacksmiths , electricians and painters . the cathedral has 8,000 square meters -lrb- about 86,000 square feet -rrb- of historical glass windows and we have our own glass restoration workshop with 10 staff members .
underneath the cathedral there is an archaeological dig going on and we also have a small team of archaeologists .
i 'm also in charge of the treasure chamber , the library and the administrators . what 's your annual budget ? between six and seven million euros -lrb- between eight and 9.4 million dollars -rrb- a year .
that mostly goes for the staff .
but the staff is the guarantee that the cathedral will be preserved .
they know every crack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steam engines so near to the cathedral damaged its facade , said schock-werner why is the cologne cathedral so black ? weathering of the stone began around the middle of the 19th century when the majority of the population began heating with coal .
before that , the poor people heated with wood and nothing happened .
but when everyone started heating with coal , the sulphur content in the air increased dramatically .
that happened in all cities . in cologne , in addition , train tracks were laid in direct proximity to the cathedral and for nearly 100 years steam engines drove by the cathedral every day and blew their smoke on the building .
that 's why the damage to the stone is greater here than in other places .
add to that the brown coal power plants in the western part of the city . today , there are n't any steam engines any more , the power plants have been moved and practically no one has individual heating since the whole city uses district heating .
the air today is much better and we can be sure that what we replace now will last longer . the renowned german artist gerhard richter recently completed a new stained glass window for the south wing of the cathedral that will be unveiled later this month .
why was gerhard richter chosen for the job ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard richter 's stained glass window consists of 11,250 squares of color in the field of contemporary glass painting , i could n't find a solution to the window that fit the cathedral 's status .
i had n't initially thought of richter for the project , because he 's not generally associated with glass windows .
but then we met at a reception and suddenly i thought , gerhard richter must be able to do it .
he has a relationship to the catholic church , he lives in cologne , and he 's worked both representationally and ornamentally .
he 's extremely sensitive and his work is of an incredibly high quality .
i asked him , he said yes and now we 've been working on the project for five years .
we 're very pleased that it 's nearly completed . legend has it that the cathedral was n't destroyed during world war two .
is this true ? no , that 's one of the cathedral 's pious legends .
the fact is , it was hit hard 14 times and suffered heavy damages but stayed standing .
that must have been an incredible symbol for the people .
they came out of their basements and shelters and the cathedral was still standing , even though the rest of the city had been flattened . what 's it like to be a woman in your job ? i had the better qualifications .
i am an architect and an art historian and that ’ s why they chose me .
i 'm the first woman with my special title , but i 'm not the first woman doing this job .
there are women in similar positions at the churches in ulm , freiburg , strasbourg , nuremberg and magdeburg , but they have different titles . my predecessor was quite respected in his position and i think it was easier for a woman to follow him than for a man , because we were n't in direct competition . bildunterschrift : cologne 's greatest landmark was constructed over six centuries click on the link below to read what visitors had to say about the cologne cathedral . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the chancellor 's not alone in her interest in the arctic : ever more states are attracted by the region 's resources . german chancellor angela merkel heads to greenland on thursday for a two-day visit with danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen .
the two politicians will ply the ilulissat fjord , over 300 kilometers -lrb- 186 miles -rrb- above the arctic circle , where one of the world 's biggest glaciers is gradually melting .
global warming is especially evident on the danish island , where the temperatures have been increasing twice as quickly as the world average .
" it 's good that a german chancellor examines the issues of climate change where its effects are especially easy to recognize , " said german climate expert peter lemke .
" politicians should also see for themselves where and how climate change occurs . "
merkel 's not the first politician to visit the spot .
she follows in the footsteps of italian prime minister romano prodi , european commission chief jose manuel barroso , nancy pelosi , speaker of the us house of representatives , and presidential candidate john mccain .
international interest and the region has n't only drawn attention due to growing concern about climate change .
the arctic is believed to be rich in resources .
however , until the ice started to melt , they were inaccessible .
climate researchers now say that the arctic could be ice-free by the summer of 2040 .
shipping is likely to take off , and it may then be affordable to excavate the gas and oil thought to be buried there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the russians will have to do more to cement their claims in early august , russian researchers planted a rust-free titanium russian flag on the ocean floor beneath the north pole to mark their country 's claim to the area .
denmark has also sent an arctic mission to back up its claims to the region .
and canadian premier stephen harper announced plans last week to establish a deep-sea port and a military base in the arctic .
a study by the us geological survey estimates the arctic has as much as 25 percent of the world 's undiscovered oil and gas .
but some say that 's just speculation .
geophysicist wilfried jodak of germany 's alfred wegener institute for polar and marine research -lrb- awi -rrb- is one of the skeptics .
the geo-scientific data from the area north of the arctic circle was too meager to identify any deposits , he said .
claims deadline looms " arctic research is expensive and was so unattractive until a few years ago , that hardly any public means were provided for research , " he said , adding that expanding territorial claims had not previously been a factor at all .
" the russians got that rolling . "
moscow is in a hurry to prove that the lomonosov ridge in the northern arctic ocean is a continuation of the russian mainland .
the 1982 un convention on law of the sea allows states to use the waters up to 200 sea miles -lrb- 370 kilometers -rrb- off their coasts as economic areas .
those governments that want to make further claims must submit requests to the un by may 2009 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arctic could be ice-free by 2040 any state missing the 2009 deadline risks losing un recognition of the claim .
countries that have not yet ratifed the law of the sea convention , including the united states , are not bound by the 2009 deadline .
the arctic push is a result of this deadline , according to jodak of the awi : " so that the claims have been resolved if at some point it turns out that there really are rich resource deposits in the northern arctic . "
shared heritage ?
thus , the clock is ticking for russia , denmark and canada , all of which view themselves as having the ultimate claim to the arctic sea .
" the arctic does n't belong to any state alone , " said moscow sea expert anatoly kolodkin of the un 's international tribunal of the law of the sea .
the arctic sea was part of " man 's common heritage , " he said , adding that the issue was , nevertheless , about who had the rights to explore and develop the resources there . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the chancellor 's not alone in her interest in the arctic : ever more states are attracted by the region 's resources . german chancellor angela merkel heads to greenland on thursday for a two-day visit with danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen .
the two politicians will ply the ilulissat fjord , over 300 kilometers -lrb- 186 miles -rrb- above the arctic circle , where one of the world 's biggest glaciers is gradually melting .
global warming is especially evident on the danish island , where the temperatures have been increasing twice as quickly as the world average .
" it 's good that a german chancellor examines the issues of climate change where its effects are especially easy to recognize , " said german climate expert peter lemke .
" politicians should also see for themselves where and how climate change occurs . "
merkel 's not the first politician to visit the spot .
she follows in the footsteps of italian prime minister romano prodi , european commission chief jose manuel barroso , nancy pelosi , speaker of the us house of representatives , and presidential candidate john mccain .
international interest and the region has n't only drawn attention due to growing concern about climate change .
the arctic is believed to be rich in resources .
however , until the ice started to melt , they were inaccessible .
climate researchers now say that the arctic could be ice-free by the summer of 2040 .
shipping is likely to take off , and it may then be affordable to excavate the gas and oil thought to be buried there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the russians will have to do more to cement their claims in early august , russian researchers planted a rust-free titanium russian flag on the ocean floor beneath the north pole to mark their country 's claim to the area .
denmark has also sent an arctic mission to back up its claims to the region .
and canadian premier stephen harper announced plans last week to establish a deep-sea port and a military base in the arctic .
a study by the us geological survey estimates the arctic has as much as 25 percent of the world 's undiscovered oil and gas .
but some say that 's just speculation .
geophysicist wilfried jodak of germany 's alfred wegener institute for polar and marine research -lrb- awi -rrb- is one of the skeptics .
the geo-scientific data from the area north of the arctic circle was too meager to identify any deposits , he said .
claims deadline looms " arctic research is expensive and was so unattractive until a few years ago , that hardly any public means were provided for research , " he said , adding that expanding territorial claims had not previously been a factor at all .
" the russians got that rolling . "
moscow is in a hurry to prove that the lomonosov ridge in the northern arctic ocean is a continuation of the russian mainland .
the 1982 un convention on law of the sea allows states to use the waters up to 200 sea miles -lrb- 370 kilometers -rrb- off their coasts as economic areas .
those governments that want to make further claims must submit requests to the un by may 2009 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arctic could be ice-free by 2040 any state missing the 2009 deadline risks losing un recognition of the claim .
countries that have not yet ratifed the law of the sea convention , including the united states , are not bound by the 2009 deadline .
the arctic push is a result of this deadline , according to jodak of the awi : " so that the claims have been resolved if at some point it turns out that there really are rich resource deposits in the northern arctic . "
shared heritage ?
thus , the clock is ticking for russia , denmark and canada , all of which view themselves as having the ultimate claim to the arctic sea .
" the arctic does n't belong to any state alone , " said moscow sea expert anatoly kolodkin of the un 's international tribunal of the law of the sea .
the arctic sea was part of " man 's common heritage , " he said , adding that the issue was , nevertheless , about who had the rights to explore and develop the resources there . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

steinberg , the author of a recent study on violence in iraq , said he believes a federal solution could help the country move forward peacefully . dw-world.de : what are the conclusions of your study ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido steinberg said a second iraqi civil war in the north was possible guido steinberg : looking at the situation in iraq today , i do n't think that it is that important anymore whether the us security plan in baghdad and central iraq is successful or not .
what i think is important is that the iraqi actors do n't come to terms with each other .
within the next couple of years , i think we will see an escalation of conflict not only in baghdad , but rather in the north and the south of the country : in the north , over the incorporation of the kirkuk into the turkish autonomy zone ; and in the south , over the control of the southern shiite areas .
this is why i think that only a federal solution can smooth this process of breaking off of iraq . some commentators say that it is too late , that iraqis themselves are set into partitioning the country into shiite , sunni and kurdish areas .
are the political differences between these groups fundamentally irreconcilable ? i do n't think that partition is a solution , because there will be no clear cut for the three parts .
the country will totally disintegrate .
i 'd rather see four or five iraq 's emerging .
this is why i think the only hope for us to come to any solution in iraq , in the long term , is a federalization , which might be called soft partition . a referendum is due to take place on the future status of the city of kirkuk , which the kurds regard as kurdish and want to be included in their province , but there is fierce resistance by turkmen and sunnis living there .
how significant is this issue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurds regard the citiy of kirkuk as their own it is extremely significant .
i argue in my study that it might be the most significant topic in the coming months .
what we are witnessing already is an escalation of violence .
it is exactly the territories where kurds , turkmen and arabs live together .
i think this is a deliberant attempt on the part of al qaeda in iraq and other terrorist organizations to provoke a civil war in the north of the country .
i think if the kirkuk issue is not solved between the political parties in baghdad , this second civil war , in the northern part of the country , might take place . the real danger for the rest of the year 2007 and for the year 2008 is for an intervention by the neighbors , because if the conflict escalates in the north of iraq , if the turkmen , for example , are increasingly targeted by the terrorists , it is more likely that the neighbors will try to intervene - if not directly , then indirectly - as iran already does in southern iraq . nathan witkop interviewed guido steinberg -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

politicians have called for a new effort to educate young people about the true nature of east germany after recently surfaced shoot-to-kill orders have rekindled a debate about conditions in the communist country . volker kauder , the parliamentary leader for germany 's governing christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , told the berliner zeitung on thursday that his party would take steps to raise awareness about eastern germany 's communist past . " we have worked enormously hard to deal with the past of the third reich 's terror system and continue to do so , but we 've done much too little when it comes to dealing with the gdr dictatorship , " he said .

on wednesday , agency officials uncovered a similar document .
unlike the first one , however , it was signed by a high-ranking stasi official , making it potentially more significant for a criminal investigation .

politicians have called for a new effort to educate young people about the true nature of east germany after recently surfaced shoot-to-kill orders have rekindled a debate about conditions in the communist country . volker kauder , the parliamentary leader for germany 's governing christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , told the berliner zeitung on thursday that his party would take steps to raise awareness about eastern germany 's communist past . " we have worked enormously hard to deal with the past of the third reich 's terror system and continue to do so , but we 've done much too little when it comes to dealing with the gdr dictatorship , " he said .
" when looking at the alarming lack of knowledge about the gdr past among the younger generation , we should use the current debate to clarify who was responsible . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonners may be surprised to learn that some think the former west german capital was in the gdr on wednesday , germany 's mass tabloid bild had asked young germans what they knew about the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- .
while some said that east germans were n't allowed to travel , others pointed out that there was a high level of unemployment , that people liked to bathe in the nude and that no one was able to buy fashionable clothes .

on wednesday , agency officials uncovered a similar document .
unlike the first one , however , it was signed by a high-ranking stasi official , making it potentially more significant for a criminal investigation .
a legal expert said that the second document might have led to different rulings in previous border shooting trials , where guards , who claimed that they had acted in self-defense , were acquitted .

birthler has suggested the year 2019 for such a merger .
members of the opposition free-market liberal free democrats and the cdu 's junior coalition partner , the social democrats , have called for quick reforms of the birthler agency as a result of the recent developments .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the fact that - in addition to the three police officers - a german aid worker , a german businessman and three german soldiers have already been murdered in afghanistan this year , the federal government has not wasted a single thought on coming up with an exit strategy .
quite to the contrary : the costly deployment of tornado reconnaissance jets was added this year and an expansion of training afghan security personnel is under consideration .
by doing so , the government is avoiding an important question : what price are we ready to pay fort he reconstruction of afghanistan ?
this question gets even more explosive as it becomes clearer that influential forces in afghanistan are not interested in a stabilization of the country and fight this with all their might .
that 's a fundamental difference to what 's happening in other countries , where germany sends soldiers or aid workers .
it 's expensive and it costs a lot of lives to try and bring peace to afghanistan when the taliban are fighting it .
the murder of three police officers who guarded the german embassy in kabul shows that the perpetrators are now directly targeting the government .
it 's safe to assume that the taliban are trying to influence the political debate in germany as all three afghanistan mandates for the german military are up for renewal the fall .
of course it would be wrong to bend one 's knees because of the taliban 's terror .
but this argument must not be used to brush off justified doubts regarding the international reconstruction effort .
the afghan government bears some of the responsibility for the fact that not enough was accomplished during the past five years .
but the many tens of thousands of foreign soldiers and aid workers have also , in part , acted incorrectly and without coordination .
precious time and resources have been wasted as a result .
the german government has so far failed to honestly weigh the mission 's chances and risks .
while surveys show that a majority of germans is now against the deployment of more than 3,000 soldiers in afghanistan , most politicians continue to preach that it 's necessary to endure .
but following the murder of three german police officers , the government should no longer stall a factual discussion .
as long as every german in afghanistan has to fear for his life , reconstruction efforts ca n't be effective , anyway .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de architecture -pipe- 16.08.2007 cologne cathedral is a picture of heaven , says its master builder großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the sheer size of the cathedral that many find impressive barbara schock-werner , a respected architect and art historian , is the first woman to become master builder of a german cathedral .
she knows every crook and cranny of germany 's favorite landmark . dw : what is the allure of the cologne cathedral in your opinion ? barbara schock-werner : there are two things : the first is the building itself , its size , its perfection and its beauty .
but it 's also the visitor-friendly management that ’ s behind it .
for example , there 's no entry fee - it 's a church and everyone 's welcome .
we have very long opening hours , from 6:00 am to 7:30 pm .
and we make a large effort to have friendly management , group tours , not too many tours at the same time , etc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the sheer size of the cathedral that many find impressive what about the building itself attracts people ? the overwhelming space .
go in , sit down - and your heart rises .
it 's something that really has an effect on your body and soul .
you have imagine that the people in the middle ages lived in much smaller spaces and they were n't used to theaters and cinemas , which are matter-of-fact for us today .
for them it must have seemed even bigger . the purpose behind the building was less to glorify the archbishop of cologne and much more an effort to give the christians a picture of heaven .
when you take your time , sit down and take in the building , you can experience that today as well . many people ask why the cathedral constantly seems to be under construction .
what do you say to that ? all historical buildings have to be taken care of if they are to be preserved .
the gothic ones are unfortunately the most fragile because their surfaces are so complicated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cathedral 's towers are about 157 meters -lrb- 515 feet -rrb- tall the cathedral building foundation and cathedral workshop , which i have overseen since 1999 , are there to manage the preservation of the church .
these incorporate a staff of 80 people .
thirty of these are craftspeople , including stonemasons , scaffold makers , roofers , locksmiths , carpenters , blacksmiths , electricians and painters . the cathedral has 8,000 square meters -lrb- about 86,000 square feet -rrb- of historical glass windows and we have our own glass restoration workshop with 10 staff members .
underneath the cathedral there is an archaeological dig going on and we also have a small team of archaeologists .
i 'm also in charge of the treasure chamber , the library and the administrators . what 's your annual budget ? between six and seven million euros -lrb- between eight and 9.4 million dollars -rrb- a year .
that mostly goes for the staff .
but the staff is the guarantee that the cathedral will be preserved .
they know every crack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steam engines so near to the cathedral damaged its facade , said schock-werner why is the cologne cathedral so black ? weathering of the stone began around the middle of the 19th century when the majority of the population began heating with coal .
before that , the poor people heated with wood and nothing happened .
but when everyone started heating with coal , the sulphur content in the air increased dramatically .
that happened in all cities . in cologne , in addition , train tracks were laid in direct proximity to the cathedral and for nearly 100 years steam engines drove by the cathedral every day and blew their smoke on the building .
that 's why the damage to the stone is greater here than in other places .
add to that the brown coal power plants in the western part of the city . today , there are n't any steam engines any more , the power plants have been moved and practically no one has individual heating since the whole city uses district heating .
the air today is much better and we can be sure that what we replace now will last longer . the renowned german artist gerhard richter recently completed a new stained glass window for the south wing of the cathedral that will be unveiled later this month .
why was gerhard richter chosen for the job ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard richter 's stained glass window consists of 11,250 squares of color in the field of contemporary glass painting , i could n't find a solution to the window that fit the cathedral 's status .
i had n't initially thought of richter for the project , because he 's not generally associated with glass windows .
but then we met at a reception and suddenly i thought , gerhard richter must be able to do it .
he has a relationship to the catholic church , he lives in cologne , and he 's worked both representationally and ornamentally .
he 's extremely sensitive and his work is of an incredibly high quality .
i asked him , he said yes and now we 've been working on the project for five years .
we 're very pleased that it 's nearly completed . legend has it that the cathedral was n't destroyed during world war two .
is this true ? no , that 's one of the cathedral 's pious legends .
the fact is , it was hit hard 14 times and suffered heavy damages but stayed standing .
that must have been an incredible symbol for the people .
they came out of their basements and shelters and the cathedral was still standing , even though the rest of the city had been flattened . what 's it like to be a woman in your job ? i had the better qualifications .
i am an architect and an art historian and that ’ s why they chose me .
i 'm the first woman with my special title , but i 'm not the first woman doing this job .
there are women in similar positions at the churches in ulm , freiburg , strasbourg , nuremberg and magdeburg , but they have different titles . my predecessor was quite respected in his position and i think it was easier for a woman to follow him than for a man , because we were n't in direct competition . bildunterschrift : cologne 's greatest landmark was constructed over six centuries click on the link below to read what visitors had to say about the cologne cathedral . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she knows every crook and cranny of germany 's favorite landmark . dw : what is the allure of the cologne cathedral in your opinion ? barbara schock-werner : there are two things : the first is the building itself , its size , its perfection and its beauty .
but it 's also the visitor-friendly management that ’ s behind it .
for example , there 's no entry fee - it 's a church and everyone 's welcome .
we have very long opening hours , from 6:00 am to 7:30 pm .
and we make a large effort to have friendly management , group tours , not too many tours at the same time , etc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the sheer size of the cathedral that many find impressive what about the building itself attracts people ? the overwhelming space .
go in , sit down - and your heart rises .
it 's something that really has an effect on your body and soul .
you have imagine that the people in the middle ages lived in much smaller spaces and they were n't used to theaters and cinemas , which are matter-of-fact for us today .
for them it must have seemed even bigger . the purpose behind the building was less to glorify the archbishop of cologne and much more an effort to give the christians a picture of heaven .
when you take your time , sit down and take in the building , you can experience that today as well . many people ask why the cathedral constantly seems to be under construction .
what do you say to that ? all historical buildings have to be taken care of if they are to be preserved .
the gothic ones are unfortunately the most fragile because their surfaces are so complicated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cathedral 's towers are about 157 meters -lrb- 515 feet -rrb- tall the cathedral building foundation and cathedral workshop , which i have overseen since 1999 , are there to manage the preservation of the church .
these incorporate a staff of 80 people .
thirty of these are craftspeople , including stonemasons , scaffold makers , roofers , locksmiths , carpenters , blacksmiths , electricians and painters . the cathedral has 8,000 square meters -lrb- about 86,000 square feet -rrb- of historical glass windows and we have our own glass restoration workshop with 10 staff members .
underneath the cathedral there is an archaeological dig going on and we also have a small team of archaeologists .
i 'm also in charge of the treasure chamber , the library and the administrators . what 's your annual budget ? between six and seven million euros -lrb- between eight and 9.4 million dollars -rrb- a year .
that mostly goes for the staff .
but the staff is the guarantee that the cathedral will be preserved .
they know every crack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steam engines so near to the cathedral damaged its facade , said schock-werner why is the cologne cathedral so black ? weathering of the stone began around the middle of the 19th century when the majority of the population began heating with coal .
before that , the poor people heated with wood and nothing happened .
but when everyone started heating with coal , the sulphur content in the air increased dramatically .
that happened in all cities . in cologne , in addition , train tracks were laid in direct proximity to the cathedral and for nearly 100 years steam engines drove by the cathedral every day and blew their smoke on the building .
that 's why the damage to the stone is greater here than in other places .
add to that the brown coal power plants in the western part of the city . today , there are n't any steam engines any more , the power plants have been moved and practically no one has individual heating since the whole city uses district heating .
the air today is much better and we can be sure that what we replace now will last longer . the renowned german artist gerhard richter recently completed a new stained glass window for the south wing of the cathedral that will be unveiled later this month .
why was gerhard richter chosen for the job ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard richter 's stained glass window consists of 11,250 squares of color in the field of contemporary glass painting , i could n't find a solution to the window that fit the cathedral 's status .
i had n't initially thought of richter for the project , because he 's not generally associated with glass windows .
but then we met at a reception and suddenly i thought , gerhard richter must be able to do it .
he has a relationship to the catholic church , he lives in cologne , and he 's worked both representationally and ornamentally .
he 's extremely sensitive and his work is of an incredibly high quality .
i asked him , he said yes and now we 've been working on the project for five years .
we 're very pleased that it 's nearly completed . legend has it that the cathedral was n't destroyed during world war two .
is this true ? no , that 's one of the cathedral 's pious legends .
the fact is , it was hit hard 14 times and suffered heavy damages but stayed standing .
that must have been an incredible symbol for the people .
they came out of their basements and shelters and the cathedral was still standing , even though the rest of the city had been flattened . what 's it like to be a woman in your job ? i had the better qualifications .
i am an architect and an art historian and that ’ s why they chose me .
i 'm the first woman with my special title , but i 'm not the first woman doing this job .
there are women in similar positions at the churches in ulm , freiburg , strasbourg , nuremberg and magdeburg , but they have different titles . my predecessor was quite respected in his position and i think it was easier for a woman to follow him than for a man , because we were n't in direct competition . bildunterschrift : cologne 's greatest landmark was constructed over six centuries click on the link below to read what visitors had to say about the cologne cathedral . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this is a tragic case , but we must assume that it will be repeated , " gdp chairman konrad freiberg said in the daily hannoversche allgemeine zeitung .
" we are in the sights of the taliban and other islamist terrorist organizations . "
three german police officers responsible for protecting the german ambassador to afghanistan died and a fourth was injured when their vehicles were blown up on a road to the east of kabul on wednesday .
freiberg said terrorists were aiming to influence germany 's decision on whether to renew its deployment of german military and police in afghanistan , which parliament will consider in the coming months .
tanks for police ?
freiberg disagreed with proposals from the rival german police union , the dpolg , to outfit police in afghanistan with military equipment . dpolg chief wolfgang speck had called for them to be provided with tanks , armored vehicles and equipment to jam remote signals that could detonate bombs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police are helping to train their afghan colleagues " we do not want the police to be militarized , " freiberg said .
but he said security arrangements for the police should be reviewed .
the calls for reviewing the measures taken to protect german troops and officials in afghanistan were backed up by politicians from merkel 's christian democratic party and the opposition green party .
there was a broad consensus not to allow such attacks to influence germany 's commitment to afghanistan , deputy foreign minister gernot erler , a social democrat , said of the bombing .
germans not necessarily targeted contrary to initial reports from the afghan police , the slain germans ' all-terrain vehicles were not marked with any national emblems , such as flags , ard television said .
thus , it was unlikely the attacks were intended to hit germans in particular .
the four had been driving to a training session when the bomb exploded .
the road they took to reach the shooting range , and the range itself , were known as places frequently used by foreign security services .
police authorities were preparing to hold a memorial service for the three men in berlin 's central cathedral , the dom , on saturday .
all of them were between the ages of 30 and 40 .
merkel 's former bodyguard among those killed bild newspaper reported thursday that one of the victims had been a long-serving bodyguard to chancellor angela merkel .
the 31-year-old officer from nuremberg had planned to return to duties guarding merkel in december after a stint in the german embassy in kabul , the paper wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the men killed worked for the german embassy the officers , all of whom worked as security staff for the embassy , were the first german police to die in afghanistan since the beginning of germany 's mandate there . the deaths brought to 24 the number of germans who have been killed in afghanistan since german troops joined the nato-led international security assisstance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in 2001 .
some 3,000 german troops are engaged in reconstruction in northern afghanistan as part of the isaf . german politicians have vowed to continue with their peacekeeping mission in afghanistan despite the latest attacks .
german defense minister franz josef jung said on thursday , the taliban were trying to sway political debate by " underhanded , one-sided attacks . "
if we give in now , the terrorists will acheive their goal , he added .
the latest german casualties have however raised deeper questions of germany 's involvement in afghanistan and exposed strains within the governing coalition of chancellor merkel . article based on news reports -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many young people reject their elders ' political claims for compensation but embrace their cultural roots . there is likely to be a generational divide when german expellees and their families commemorate tag der heimat or day of the homeland on saturday .
represented in large part by the league of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , a controversial group that lobbies and seeks compensation for ethnic germans and their descendants , the aging expellees themselves reflect on the injustices that occurred as the third reich crumbled and millions of ethnic germans were expelled from their homelands in eastern europe .
younger people , on the other hand , said they will be paying more attention to their cultural heritage .
leaving controversy behind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can expellee groups keep young people interested ?
for 17-year-old veronika moll , the day of remembrance is not about international relations but about dancing .
moll , a high school student in munich , is part of a silesian folk dancing group that performs at events like tag der heimat , as well as at her hometown 's famous oktoberfest .
she also takes part in conferences about expellee issues and other cultural activities .
both of moll 's grandmothers were expelled from silesia , in southwestern poland , at the end of world war ii .
while some people of the older generation feel silesia belongs to them , moll said she does n't feel that way at all . although she still feels special ties to silesia , munich is home .
" it 's simply not the situation that you can go back to silesia , " she said .
" it 's too long ago .
it 's important to not forget the history and to make sure that everyone knows what happened and that an injustice occurred .
but you ca n't displace all of the polish or other people who have lived in these houses or on this land for 60 years . "
youth groups focus on future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the average age for many groups is getting older this type of attitude is typical among the descendants of expellees , said thomas hoffmann , who heads the organization german youth in europe .
while the first generation of expellees dreamed of returning home , their grandchildren are uninterested in going back , hoffmann said .
the first part of german youth in europe 's harkens back to its foundation in 1951 as a group to fight for the rights of german expellee youths .
over the years it has evolved into a more progressive organization which promotes reconciliation and integration .
the group has approximately 90,000 members .
janna keberlein , a member of the youth organization and 28-year-old student at the university of düsseldorf , said that while her ethnic german grandparents still get angry about being deported from the volga region to kazakhstan during the war , she thinks the issue needs to be closed .
" young people do n't have to be drawn into this history of suffering , " the 28-year-old düsseldorf university student said , adding that she has no interest in being politically involved in the league of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- .
a taboo subject bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the silesian traditions remain important to some youth for many young people , the bdv focuses too much on the past , a fact seen in the graying of the organization , said alfred de zayas , a leading scholar on germen expellees .
when he gives talks to expellee groups , the average age is usually 60 , he said .
de zayas served for years as a lawyer for the united nations high commissioner for human rights .
he is currently a professor of international law at the geneva school of diplomacy .
he wrote the first scholarly work on german expellees to appear in english , breaking what had long been a taboo topic .
the post-war expulsions were the largest forced movement of europeans in the 20th century .
historians estimate that between 12 and 15 million people were expelled during the forced migrations .
finding an interest in cultural heritage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expellees on the road to germany de zayas ' books have been controversial in germany because he feels expellees have legal rights to reclaim lost property .
but that 's a claim he said he doubts younger generations will pursue as most are simply not interested in the debate 's political dimensions .
instead young people from expellee backgrounds are only just now becoming interested in their cultural heritage to find out more about themselves , de zayas said , adding that he expects that interest to grow .
" it 's important for your identity that you know where you come from , " de zayas said .
" it 's a peaceful activity .
that 's a good thing , and i 'm persuaded that will happen . " trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many young people reject their elders ' political claims for compensation but embrace their cultural roots . there is likely to be a generational divide when german expellees and their families commemorate tag der heimat or day of the homeland on saturday .
represented in large part by the league of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , a controversial group that lobbies and seeks compensation for ethnic germans and their descendants , the aging expellees themselves reflect on the injustices that occurred as the third reich crumbled and millions of ethnic germans were expelled from their homelands in eastern europe .
younger people , on the other hand , said they will be paying more attention to their cultural heritage .
leaving controversy behind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can expellee groups keep young people interested ?
for 17-year-old veronika moll , the day of remembrance is not about international relations but about dancing .
moll , a high school student in munich , is part of a silesian folk dancing group that performs at events like tag der heimat , as well as at her hometown 's famous oktoberfest .
she also takes part in conferences about expellee issues and other cultural activities .
both of moll 's grandmothers were expelled from silesia , in southwestern poland , at the end of world war ii .
while some people of the older generation feel silesia belongs to them , moll said she does n't feel that way at all . although she still feels special ties to silesia , munich is home .
" it 's simply not the situation that you can go back to silesia , " she said .
" it 's too long ago .
it 's important to not forget the history and to make sure that everyone knows what happened and that an injustice occurred .
but you ca n't displace all of the polish or other people who have lived in these houses or on this land for 60 years . "
youth groups focus on future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the average age for many groups is getting older this type of attitude is typical among the descendants of expellees , said thomas hoffmann , who heads the organization german youth in europe .
while the first generation of expellees dreamed of returning home , their grandchildren are uninterested in going back , hoffmann said .
the first part of german youth in europe 's harkens back to its foundation in 1951 as a group to fight for the rights of german expellee youths .
over the years it has evolved into a more progressive organization which promotes reconciliation and integration .
the group has approximately 90,000 members .
janna keberlein , a member of the youth organization and 28-year-old student at the university of düsseldorf , said that while her ethnic german grandparents still get angry about being deported from the volga region to kazakhstan during the war , she thinks the issue needs to be closed .
" young people do n't have to be drawn into this history of suffering , " the 28-year-old düsseldorf university student said , adding that she has no interest in being politically involved in the league of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- .
a taboo subject bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the silesian traditions remain important to some youth for many young people , the bdv focuses too much on the past , a fact seen in the graying of the organization , said alfred de zayas , a leading scholar on germen expellees .
when he gives talks to expellee groups , the average age is usually 60 , he said .
de zayas served for years as a lawyer for the united nations high commissioner for human rights .
he is currently a professor of international law at the geneva school of diplomacy .
he wrote the first scholarly work on german expellees to appear in english , breaking what had long been a taboo topic .

but that 's a claim he said he doubts younger generations will pursue as most are simply not interested in the debate 's political dimensions .
instead young people from expellee backgrounds are only just now becoming interested in their cultural heritage to find out more about themselves , de zayas said , adding that he expects that interest to grow .

many young people reject their elders ' political claims for compensation but embrace their cultural roots . there is likely to be a generational divide when german expellees and their families commemorate tag der heimat or day of the homeland on saturday .
represented in large part by the league of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , a controversial group that lobbies and seeks compensation for ethnic germans and their descendants , the aging expellees themselves reflect on the injustices that occurred as the third reich crumbled and millions of ethnic germans were expelled from their homelands in eastern europe .
younger people , on the other hand , said they will be paying more attention to their cultural heritage .
leaving controversy behind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can expellee groups keep young people interested ?
for 17-year-old veronika moll , the day of remembrance is not about international relations but about dancing .
moll , a high school student in munich , is part of a silesian folk dancing group that performs at events like tag der heimat , as well as at her hometown 's famous oktoberfest .
she also takes part in conferences about expellee issues and other cultural activities .
both of moll 's grandmothers were expelled from silesia , in southwestern poland , at the end of world war ii .
while some people of the older generation feel silesia belongs to them , moll said she does n't feel that way at all . although she still feels special ties to silesia , munich is home .
" it 's simply not the situation that you can go back to silesia , " she said .
" it 's too long ago .
it 's important to not forget the history and to make sure that everyone knows what happened and that an injustice occurred .
but you ca n't displace all of the polish or other people who have lived in these houses or on this land for 60 years . "
youth groups focus on future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the average age for many groups is getting older this type of attitude is typical among the descendants of expellees , said thomas hoffmann , who heads the organization german youth in europe .
while the first generation of expellees dreamed of returning home , their grandchildren are uninterested in going back , hoffmann said .
the first part of german youth in europe 's harkens back to its foundation in 1951 as a group to fight for the rights of german expellee youths .
over the years it has evolved into a more progressive organization which promotes reconciliation and integration .
the group has approximately 90,000 members .
janna keberlein , a member of the youth organization and 28-year-old student at the university of düsseldorf , said that while her ethnic german grandparents still get angry about being deported from the volga region to kazakhstan during the war , she thinks the issue needs to be closed .
" young people do n't have to be drawn into this history of suffering , " the 28-year-old düsseldorf university student said , adding that she has no interest in being politically involved in the league of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- .
a taboo subject bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the silesian traditions remain important to some youth for many young people , the bdv focuses too much on the past , a fact seen in the graying of the organization , said alfred de zayas , a leading scholar on germen expellees .
when he gives talks to expellee groups , the average age is usually 60 , he said .
de zayas served for years as a lawyer for the united nations high commissioner for human rights .
he is currently a professor of international law at the geneva school of diplomacy .
he wrote the first scholarly work on german expellees to appear in english , breaking what had long been a taboo topic .
the post-war expulsions were the largest forced movement of europeans in the 20th century .
historians estimate that between 12 and 15 million people were expelled during the forced migrations .
finding an interest in cultural heritage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expellees on the road to germany de zayas ' books have been controversial in germany because he feels expellees have legal rights to reclaim lost property .
but that 's a claim he said he doubts younger generations will pursue as most are simply not interested in the debate 's political dimensions .
instead young people from expellee backgrounds are only just now becoming interested in their cultural heritage to find out more about themselves , de zayas said , adding that he expects that interest to grow .
" it 's important for your identity that you know where you come from , " de zayas said .
" it 's a peaceful activity .
that 's a good thing , and i 'm persuaded that will happen . " trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de architecture -pipe- 16.08.2007 cologne cathedral is a picture of heaven , says its master builder großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the sheer size of the cathedral that many find impressive barbara schock-werner , a respected architect and art historian , is the first woman to become master builder of a german cathedral .
she knows every crook and cranny of germany 's favorite landmark . dw : what is the allure of the cologne cathedral in your opinion ? barbara schock-werner : there are two things : the first is the building itself , its size , its perfection and its beauty .
but it 's also the visitor-friendly management that ’ s behind it .
for example , there 's no entry fee - it 's a church and everyone 's welcome .
we have very long opening hours , from 6:00 am to 7:30 pm .
and we make a large effort to have friendly management , group tours , not too many tours at the same time , etc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the sheer size of the cathedral that many find impressive what about the building itself attracts people ? the overwhelming space .
go in , sit down - and your heart rises .
it 's something that really has an effect on your body and soul .
you have imagine that the people in the middle ages lived in much smaller spaces and they were n't used to theaters and cinemas , which are matter-of-fact for us today .
for them it must have seemed even bigger . the purpose behind the building was less to glorify the archbishop of cologne and much more an effort to give the christians a picture of heaven .
when you take your time , sit down and take in the building , you can experience that today as well . many people ask why the cathedral constantly seems to be under construction .
what do you say to that ? all historical buildings have to be taken care of if they are to be preserved .
the gothic ones are unfortunately the most fragile because their surfaces are so complicated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cathedral 's towers are about 157 meters -lrb- 515 feet -rrb- tall the cathedral building foundation and cathedral workshop , which i have overseen since 1999 , are there to manage the preservation of the church .
these incorporate a staff of 80 people .
thirty of these are craftspeople , including stonemasons , scaffold makers , roofers , locksmiths , carpenters , blacksmiths , electricians and painters . the cathedral has 8,000 square meters -lrb- about 86,000 square feet -rrb- of historical glass windows and we have our own glass restoration workshop with 10 staff members .
underneath the cathedral there is an archaeological dig going on and we also have a small team of archaeologists .
i 'm also in charge of the treasure chamber , the library and the administrators . what 's your annual budget ? between six and seven million euros -lrb- between eight and 9.4 million dollars -rrb- a year .
that mostly goes for the staff .
but the staff is the guarantee that the cathedral will be preserved .
they know every crack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steam engines so near to the cathedral damaged its facade , said schock-werner why is the cologne cathedral so black ? weathering of the stone began around the middle of the 19th century when the majority of the population began heating with coal .
before that , the poor people heated with wood and nothing happened .
but when everyone started heating with coal , the sulphur content in the air increased dramatically .
that happened in all cities . in cologne , in addition , train tracks were laid in direct proximity to the cathedral and for nearly 100 years steam engines drove by the cathedral every day and blew their smoke on the building .
that 's why the damage to the stone is greater here than in other places .
add to that the brown coal power plants in the western part of the city . today , there are n't any steam engines any more , the power plants have been moved and practically no one has individual heating since the whole city uses district heating .
the air today is much better and we can be sure that what we replace now will last longer . the renowned german artist gerhard richter recently completed a new stained glass window for the south wing of the cathedral that will be unveiled later this month .
why was gerhard richter chosen for the job ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard richter 's stained glass window consists of 11,250 squares of color in the field of contemporary glass painting , i could n't find a solution to the window that fit the cathedral 's status .
i had n't initially thought of richter for the project , because he 's not generally associated with glass windows .
but then we met at a reception and suddenly i thought , gerhard richter must be able to do it .
he has a relationship to the catholic church , he lives in cologne , and he 's worked both representationally and ornamentally .
he 's extremely sensitive and his work is of an incredibly high quality .
i asked him , he said yes and now we 've been working on the project for five years .
we 're very pleased that it 's nearly completed . legend has it that the cathedral was n't destroyed during world war two .
is this true ? no , that 's one of the cathedral 's pious legends .
the fact is , it was hit hard 14 times and suffered heavy damages but stayed standing .
that must have been an incredible symbol for the people .
they came out of their basements and shelters and the cathedral was still standing , even though the rest of the city had been flattened . what 's it like to be a woman in your job ? i had the better qualifications .
i am an architect and an art historian and that ’ s why they chose me .
i 'm the first woman with my special title , but i 'm not the first woman doing this job .
there are women in similar positions at the churches in ulm , freiburg , strasbourg , nuremberg and magdeburg , but they have different titles . my predecessor was quite respected in his position and i think it was easier for a woman to follow him than for a man , because we were n't in direct competition . bildunterschrift : cologne 's greatest landmark was constructed over six centuries click on the link below to read what visitors had to say about the cologne cathedral . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she knows every crook and cranny of germany 's favorite landmark . dw : what is the allure of the cologne cathedral in your opinion ? barbara schock-werner : there are two things : the first is the building itself , its size , its perfection and its beauty .
but it 's also the visitor-friendly management that ’ s behind it .
for example , there 's no entry fee - it 's a church and everyone 's welcome .
we have very long opening hours , from 6:00 am to 7:30 pm .
and we make a large effort to have friendly management , group tours , not too many tours at the same time , etc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the sheer size of the cathedral that many find impressive what about the building itself attracts people ? the overwhelming space .
go in , sit down - and your heart rises .
it 's something that really has an effect on your body and soul .
you have imagine that the people in the middle ages lived in much smaller spaces and they were n't used to theaters and cinemas , which are matter-of-fact for us today .
for them it must have seemed even bigger . the purpose behind the building was less to glorify the archbishop of cologne and much more an effort to give the christians a picture of heaven .
when you take your time , sit down and take in the building , you can experience that today as well . many people ask why the cathedral constantly seems to be under construction .
what do you say to that ? all historical buildings have to be taken care of if they are to be preserved .
the gothic ones are unfortunately the most fragile because their surfaces are so complicated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cathedral 's towers are about 157 meters -lrb- 515 feet -rrb- tall the cathedral building foundation and cathedral workshop , which i have overseen since 1999 , are there to manage the preservation of the church .
these incorporate a staff of 80 people .
thirty of these are craftspeople , including stonemasons , scaffold makers , roofers , locksmiths , carpenters , blacksmiths , electricians and painters . the cathedral has 8,000 square meters -lrb- about 86,000 square feet -rrb- of historical glass windows and we have our own glass restoration workshop with 10 staff members .
underneath the cathedral there is an archaeological dig going on and we also have a small team of archaeologists .
i 'm also in charge of the treasure chamber , the library and the administrators . what 's your annual budget ? between six and seven million euros -lrb- between eight and 9.4 million dollars -rrb- a year .
that mostly goes for the staff .
but the staff is the guarantee that the cathedral will be preserved .
they know every crack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steam engines so near to the cathedral damaged its facade , said schock-werner why is the cologne cathedral so black ? weathering of the stone began around the middle of the 19th century when the majority of the population began heating with coal .
before that , the poor people heated with wood and nothing happened .
but when everyone started heating with coal , the sulphur content in the air increased dramatically .
that happened in all cities . in cologne , in addition , train tracks were laid in direct proximity to the cathedral and for nearly 100 years steam engines drove by the cathedral every day and blew their smoke on the building .
that 's why the damage to the stone is greater here than in other places .
add to that the brown coal power plants in the western part of the city . today , there are n't any steam engines any more , the power plants have been moved and practically no one has individual heating since the whole city uses district heating .
the air today is much better and we can be sure that what we replace now will last longer . the renowned german artist gerhard richter recently completed a new stained glass window for the south wing of the cathedral that will be unveiled later this month .
why was gerhard richter chosen for the job ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard richter 's stained glass window consists of 11,250 squares of color in the field of contemporary glass painting , i could n't find a solution to the window that fit the cathedral 's status .
i had n't initially thought of richter for the project , because he 's not generally associated with glass windows .
but then we met at a reception and suddenly i thought , gerhard richter must be able to do it .
he has a relationship to the catholic church , he lives in cologne , and he 's worked both representationally and ornamentally .
he 's extremely sensitive and his work is of an incredibly high quality .
i asked him , he said yes and now we 've been working on the project for five years .

she knows every crook and cranny of germany 's favorite landmark . dw : what is the allure of the cologne cathedral in your opinion ? barbara schock-werner : there are two things : the first is the building itself , its size , its perfection and its beauty .
but it 's also the visitor-friendly management that ’ s behind it .
for example , there 's no entry fee - it 's a church and everyone 's welcome .
we have very long opening hours , from 6:00 am to 7:30 pm .
and we make a large effort to have friendly management , group tours , not too many tours at the same time , etc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the sheer size of the cathedral that many find impressive what about the building itself attracts people ? the overwhelming space .
go in , sit down - and your heart rises .
it 's something that really has an effect on your body and soul .
you have imagine that the people in the middle ages lived in much smaller spaces and they were n't used to theaters and cinemas , which are matter-of-fact for us today .
for them it must have seemed even bigger . the purpose behind the building was less to glorify the archbishop of cologne and much more an effort to give the christians a picture of heaven .
when you take your time , sit down and take in the building , you can experience that today as well . many people ask why the cathedral constantly seems to be under construction .
what do you say to that ? all historical buildings have to be taken care of if they are to be preserved .
the gothic ones are unfortunately the most fragile because their surfaces are so complicated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cathedral 's towers are about 157 meters -lrb- 515 feet -rrb- tall the cathedral building foundation and cathedral workshop , which i have overseen since 1999 , are there to manage the preservation of the church .
these incorporate a staff of 80 people .
thirty of these are craftspeople , including stonemasons , scaffold makers , roofers , locksmiths , carpenters , blacksmiths , electricians and painters . the cathedral has 8,000 square meters -lrb- about 86,000 square feet -rrb- of historical glass windows and we have our own glass restoration workshop with 10 staff members .
underneath the cathedral there is an archaeological dig going on and we also have a small team of archaeologists .
i 'm also in charge of the treasure chamber , the library and the administrators . what 's your annual budget ? between six and seven million euros -lrb- between eight and 9.4 million dollars -rrb- a year .
that mostly goes for the staff .
but the staff is the guarantee that the cathedral will be preserved .
they know every crack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steam engines so near to the cathedral damaged its facade , said schock-werner why is the cologne cathedral so black ? weathering of the stone began around the middle of the 19th century when the majority of the population began heating with coal .
before that , the poor people heated with wood and nothing happened .
but when everyone started heating with coal , the sulphur content in the air increased dramatically .
that happened in all cities . in cologne , in addition , train tracks were laid in direct proximity to the cathedral and for nearly 100 years steam engines drove by the cathedral every day and blew their smoke on the building .
that 's why the damage to the stone is greater here than in other places .
add to that the brown coal power plants in the western part of the city . today , there are n't any steam engines any more , the power plants have been moved and practically no one has individual heating since the whole city uses district heating .
the air today is much better and we can be sure that what we replace now will last longer . the renowned german artist gerhard richter recently completed a new stained glass window for the south wing of the cathedral that will be unveiled later this month .
why was gerhard richter chosen for the job ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard richter 's stained glass window consists of 11,250 squares of color in the field of contemporary glass painting , i could n't find a solution to the window that fit the cathedral 's status .
i had n't initially thought of richter for the project , because he 's not generally associated with glass windows .
but then we met at a reception and suddenly i thought , gerhard richter must be able to do it .
he has a relationship to the catholic church , he lives in cologne , and he 's worked both representationally and ornamentally .
he 's extremely sensitive and his work is of an incredibly high quality .
i asked him , he said yes and now we 've been working on the project for five years .
we 're very pleased that it 's nearly completed . legend has it that the cathedral was n't destroyed during world war two .
is this true ? no , that 's one of the cathedral 's pious legends .
the fact is , it was hit hard 14 times and suffered heavy damages but stayed standing .
that must have been an incredible symbol for the people .
they came out of their basements and shelters and the cathedral was still standing , even though the rest of the city had been flattened . what 's it like to be a woman in your job ? i had the better qualifications .
i am an architect and an art historian and that ’ s why they chose me .
i 'm the first woman with my special title , but i 'm not the first woman doing this job .
there are women in similar positions at the churches in ulm , freiburg , strasbourg , nuremberg and magdeburg , but they have different titles . my predecessor was quite respected in his position and i think it was easier for a woman to follow him than for a man , because we were n't in direct competition . bildunterschrift : cologne 's greatest landmark was constructed over six centuries click on the link below to read what visitors had to say about the cologne cathedral . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

quite to the contrary : the costly deployment of tornado reconnaissance jets was added this year and an expansion of training afghan security personnel is under consideration .
by doing so , the government is avoiding an important question : what price are we ready to pay fort he reconstruction of afghanistan ?
this question gets even more explosive as it becomes clearer that influential forces in afghanistan are not interested in a stabilization of the country and fight this with all their might .

precious time and resources have been wasted as a result .
the german government has so far failed to honestly weigh the mission 's chances and risks .
while surveys show that a majority of germans is now against the deployment of more than 3,000 soldiers in afghanistan , most politicians continue to preach that it 's necessary to endure .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the fact that - in addition to the three police officers - a german aid worker , a german businessman and three german soldiers have already been murdered in afghanistan this year , the federal government has not wasted a single thought on coming up with an exit strategy .
quite to the contrary : the costly deployment of tornado reconnaissance jets was added this year and an expansion of training afghan security personnel is under consideration .
by doing so , the government is avoiding an important question : what price are we ready to pay fort he reconstruction of afghanistan ?
this question gets even more explosive as it becomes clearer that influential forces in afghanistan are not interested in a stabilization of the country and fight this with all their might .
that 's a fundamental difference to what 's happening in other countries , where germany sends soldiers or aid workers .

precious time and resources have been wasted as a result .
the german government has so far failed to honestly weigh the mission 's chances and risks .
while surveys show that a majority of germans is now against the deployment of more than 3,000 soldiers in afghanistan , most politicians continue to preach that it 's necessary to endure .

politicians have called for a new effort to educate young people about the true nature of east germany after recently surfaced shoot-to-kill orders have rekindled a debate about conditions in the communist country . volker kauder , the parliamentary leader for germany 's governing christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , told the berliner zeitung on thursday that his party would take steps to raise awareness about eastern germany 's communist past . " we have worked enormously hard to deal with the past of the third reich 's terror system and continue to do so , but we 've done much too little when it comes to dealing with the gdr dictatorship , " he said .
" when looking at the alarming lack of knowledge about the gdr past among the younger generation , we should use the current debate to clarify who was responsible . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonners may be surprised to learn that some think the former west german capital was in the gdr on wednesday , germany 's mass tabloid bild had asked young germans what they knew about the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- .
while some said that east germans were n't allowed to travel , others pointed out that there was a high level of unemployment , that people liked to bathe in the nude and that no one was able to buy fashionable clothes .

" hitler was the boss and he had a wall build around his empire , " he added . second document found the current debate surrounding life in the gdr was sparked by a shoot-to-kill order that resurfaced over the weekend .

on wednesday , agency officials uncovered a similar document .
unlike the first one , however , it was signed by a high-ranking stasi official , making it potentially more significant for a criminal investigation .
a legal expert said that the second document might have led to different rulings in previous border shooting trials , where guards , who claimed that they had acted in self-defense , were acquitted . " but it 's unlikely that the cases will be reopened now , " ferdinand von schirach , who defended a top-level gdr official in the 1990s , told dw-world.de. agency under pressure the stasi file agency 's head , marianne birthler , has faced intense pressure in recent days for her handling of the situation , with some saying that she is trying to prevent the swift dismantling of her office and the transfer of the stasi files into germany 's federal archives .

unlike the first one , however , it was signed by a high-ranking stasi official , making it potentially more significant for a criminal investigation .
a legal expert said that the second document might have led to different rulings in previous border shooting trials , where guards , who claimed that they had acted in self-defense , were acquitted . " but it 's unlikely that the cases will be reopened now , " ferdinand von schirach , who defended a top-level gdr official in the 1990s , told dw-world.de. agency under pressure the stasi file agency 's head , marianne birthler , has faced intense pressure in recent days for her handling of the situation , with some saying that she is trying to prevent the swift dismantling of her office and the transfer of the stasi files into germany 's federal archives .
birthler has suggested the year 2019 for such a merger .
members of the opposition free-market liberal free democrats and the cdu 's junior coalition partner , the social democrats , have called for quick reforms of the birthler agency as a result of the recent developments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the files will eventually be transferred to the federal archives wolfgang böhmer , the state premier of saxony-anhalt , where the first shoot-to-kill order was found , said he saw a continued need to research the stasi files .
" the fact that a belittlement and minimization of the gdr 's problems can be seen in the public justifies further research and public debate about what happened , " böhmer told the german press agency dpa , adding that the he saw no need to rush a merger of the stasi agency with the federal archives . kauder agreed and added that a merger could be initiated during the next legislative period , which is likely to start in 2009 . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

steinberg , the author of a recent study on violence in iraq , said he believes a federal solution could help the country move forward peacefully . dw-world.de : what are the conclusions of your study ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido steinberg said a second iraqi civil war in the north was possible guido steinberg : looking at the situation in iraq today , i do n't think that it is that important anymore whether the us security plan in baghdad and central iraq is successful or not .
what i think is important is that the iraqi actors do n't come to terms with each other .
within the next couple of years , i think we will see an escalation of conflict not only in baghdad , but rather in the north and the south of the country : in the north , over the incorporation of the kirkuk into the turkish autonomy zone ; and in the south , over the control of the southern shiite areas .
this is why i think that only a federal solution can smooth this process of breaking off of iraq . some commentators say that it is too late , that iraqis themselves are set into partitioning the country into shiite , sunni and kurdish areas .
are the political differences between these groups fundamentally irreconcilable ? i do n't think that partition is a solution , because there will be no clear cut for the three parts .
the country will totally disintegrate .
i 'd rather see four or five iraq 's emerging .
this is why i think the only hope for us to come to any solution in iraq , in the long term , is a federalization , which might be called soft partition . a referendum is due to take place on the future status of the city of kirkuk , which the kurds regard as kurdish and want to be included in their province , but there is fierce resistance by turkmen and sunnis living there .
how significant is this issue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurds regard the citiy of kirkuk as their own it is extremely significant .
i argue in my study that it might be the most significant topic in the coming months .
what we are witnessing already is an escalation of violence .
it is exactly the territories where kurds , turkmen and arabs live together .
i think this is a deliberant attempt on the part of al qaeda in iraq and other terrorist organizations to provoke a civil war in the north of the country .
i think if the kirkuk issue is not solved between the political parties in baghdad , this second civil war , in the northern part of the country , might take place . the real danger for the rest of the year 2007 and for the year 2008 is for an intervention by the neighbors , because if the conflict escalates in the north of iraq , if the turkmen , for example , are increasingly targeted by the terrorists , it is more likely that the neighbors will try to intervene - if not directly , then indirectly - as iran already does in southern iraq . nathan witkop interviewed guido steinberg -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

steinberg , the author of a recent study on violence in iraq , said he believes a federal solution could help the country move forward peacefully . dw-world.de : what are the conclusions of your study ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido steinberg said a second iraqi civil war in the north was possible guido steinberg : looking at the situation in iraq today , i do n't think that it is that important anymore whether the us security plan in baghdad and central iraq is successful or not .
what i think is important is that the iraqi actors do n't come to terms with each other .
within the next couple of years , i think we will see an escalation of conflict not only in baghdad , but rather in the north and the south of the country : in the north , over the incorporation of the kirkuk into the turkish autonomy zone ; and in the south , over the control of the southern shiite areas .
this is why i think that only a federal solution can smooth this process of breaking off of iraq . some commentators say that it is too late , that iraqis themselves are set into partitioning the country into shiite , sunni and kurdish areas .
are the political differences between these groups fundamentally irreconcilable ? i do n't think that partition is a solution , because there will be no clear cut for the three parts .
the country will totally disintegrate .
i 'd rather see four or five iraq 's emerging .
this is why i think the only hope for us to come to any solution in iraq , in the long term , is a federalization , which might be called soft partition . a referendum is due to take place on the future status of the city of kirkuk , which the kurds regard as kurdish and want to be included in their province , but there is fierce resistance by turkmen and sunnis living there .
how significant is this issue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurds regard the citiy of kirkuk as their own it is extremely significant .
i argue in my study that it might be the most significant topic in the coming months .
what we are witnessing already is an escalation of violence .
it is exactly the territories where kurds , turkmen and arabs live together .
i think this is a deliberant attempt on the part of al qaeda in iraq and other terrorist organizations to provoke a civil war in the north of the country .
i think if the kirkuk issue is not solved between the political parties in baghdad , this second civil war , in the northern part of the country , might take place . the real danger for the rest of the year 2007 and for the year 2008 is for an intervention by the neighbors , because if the conflict escalates in the north of iraq , if the turkmen , for example , are increasingly targeted by the terrorists , it is more likely that the neighbors will try to intervene - if not directly , then indirectly - as iran already does in southern iraq . nathan witkop interviewed guido steinberg -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the chancellor 's not alone in her interest in the arctic : ever more states are attracted by the region 's resources . german chancellor angela merkel heads to greenland on thursday for a two-day visit with danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen .
the two politicians will ply the ilulissat fjord , over 300 kilometers -lrb- 186 miles -rrb- above the arctic circle , where one of the world 's biggest glaciers is gradually melting .
global warming is especially evident on the danish island , where the temperatures have been increasing twice as quickly as the world average .
" it 's good that a german chancellor examines the issues of climate change where its effects are especially easy to recognize , " said german climate expert peter lemke .
" politicians should also see for themselves where and how climate change occurs . "
merkel 's not the first politician to visit the spot .
she follows in the footsteps of italian prime minister romano prodi , european commission chief jose manuel barroso , nancy pelosi , speaker of the us house of representatives , and presidential candidate john mccain .
international interest and the region has n't only drawn attention due to growing concern about climate change .
the arctic is believed to be rich in resources .
however , until the ice started to melt , they were inaccessible .
climate researchers now say that the arctic could be ice-free by the summer of 2040 .
shipping is likely to take off , and it may then be affordable to excavate the gas and oil thought to be buried there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the russians will have to do more to cement their claims in early august , russian researchers planted a rust-free titanium russian flag on the ocean floor beneath the north pole to mark their country 's claim to the area .
denmark has also sent an arctic mission to back up its claims to the region .
and canadian premier stephen harper announced plans last week to establish a deep-sea port and a military base in the arctic .
a study by the us geological survey estimates the arctic has as much as 25 percent of the world 's undiscovered oil and gas .
but some say that 's just speculation .
geophysicist wilfried jodak of germany 's alfred wegener institute for polar and marine research -lrb- awi -rrb- is one of the skeptics .
the geo-scientific data from the area north of the arctic circle was too meager to identify any deposits , he said .
claims deadline looms " arctic research is expensive and was so unattractive until a few years ago , that hardly any public means were provided for research , " he said , adding that expanding territorial claims had not previously been a factor at all .
" the russians got that rolling . "
moscow is in a hurry to prove that the lomonosov ridge in the northern arctic ocean is a continuation of the russian mainland .
the 1982 un convention on law of the sea allows states to use the waters up to 200 sea miles -lrb- 370 kilometers -rrb- off their coasts as economic areas .
those governments that want to make further claims must submit requests to the un by may 2009 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arctic could be ice-free by 2040 any state missing the 2009 deadline risks losing un recognition of the claim .
countries that have not yet ratifed the law of the sea convention , including the united states , are not bound by the 2009 deadline .
the arctic push is a result of this deadline , according to jodak of the awi : " so that the claims have been resolved if at some point it turns out that there really are rich resource deposits in the northern arctic . "
shared heritage ?
thus , the clock is ticking for russia , denmark and canada , all of which view themselves as having the ultimate claim to the arctic sea .
" the arctic does n't belong to any state alone , " said moscow sea expert anatoly kolodkin of the un 's international tribunal of the law of the sea .
the arctic sea was part of " man 's common heritage , " he said , adding that the issue was , nevertheless , about who had the rights to explore and develop the resources there . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

global warming is especially evident on the danish island , where the temperatures have been increasing twice as quickly as the world average .
" it 's good that a german chancellor examines the issues of climate change where its effects are especially easy to recognize , " said german climate expert peter lemke .
" politicians should also see for themselves where and how climate change occurs . "
merkel 's not the first politician to visit the spot .
she follows in the footsteps of italian prime minister romano prodi , european commission chief jose manuel barroso , nancy pelosi , speaker of the us house of representatives , and presidential candidate john mccain .
international interest and the region has n't only drawn attention due to growing concern about climate change .
the arctic is believed to be rich in resources .
however , until the ice started to melt , they were inaccessible .
climate researchers now say that the arctic could be ice-free by the summer of 2040 .
shipping is likely to take off , and it may then be affordable to excavate the gas and oil thought to be buried there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the russians will have to do more to cement their claims in early august , russian researchers planted a rust-free titanium russian flag on the ocean floor beneath the north pole to mark their country 's claim to the area .
denmark has also sent an arctic mission to back up its claims to the region .
and canadian premier stephen harper announced plans last week to establish a deep-sea port and a military base in the arctic .
a study by the us geological survey estimates the arctic has as much as 25 percent of the world 's undiscovered oil and gas .
but some say that 's just speculation .
geophysicist wilfried jodak of germany 's alfred wegener institute for polar and marine research -lrb- awi -rrb- is one of the skeptics .
the geo-scientific data from the area north of the arctic circle was too meager to identify any deposits , he said .
claims deadline looms " arctic research is expensive and was so unattractive until a few years ago , that hardly any public means were provided for research , " he said , adding that expanding territorial claims had not previously been a factor at all .
" the russians got that rolling . "
moscow is in a hurry to prove that the lomonosov ridge in the northern arctic ocean is a continuation of the russian mainland .
the 1982 un convention on law of the sea allows states to use the waters up to 200 sea miles -lrb- 370 kilometers -rrb- off their coasts as economic areas .
those governments that want to make further claims must submit requests to the un by may 2009 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arctic could be ice-free by 2040 any state missing the 2009 deadline risks losing un recognition of the claim .
countries that have not yet ratifed the law of the sea convention , including the united states , are not bound by the 2009 deadline .
the arctic push is a result of this deadline , according to jodak of the awi : " so that the claims have been resolved if at some point it turns out that there really are rich resource deposits in the northern arctic . "

the chancellor 's not alone in her interest in the arctic : ever more states are attracted by the region 's resources . german chancellor angela merkel heads to greenland on thursday for a two-day visit with danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen .
the two politicians will ply the ilulissat fjord , over 300 kilometers -lrb- 186 miles -rrb- above the arctic circle , where one of the world 's biggest glaciers is gradually melting .
global warming is especially evident on the danish island , where the temperatures have been increasing twice as quickly as the world average .
" it 's good that a german chancellor examines the issues of climate change where its effects are especially easy to recognize , " said german climate expert peter lemke .
" politicians should also see for themselves where and how climate change occurs . "
merkel 's not the first politician to visit the spot .
she follows in the footsteps of italian prime minister romano prodi , european commission chief jose manuel barroso , nancy pelosi , speaker of the us house of representatives , and presidential candidate john mccain .
international interest and the region has n't only drawn attention due to growing concern about climate change .
the arctic is believed to be rich in resources .
however , until the ice started to melt , they were inaccessible .
climate researchers now say that the arctic could be ice-free by the summer of 2040 .
shipping is likely to take off , and it may then be affordable to excavate the gas and oil thought to be buried there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the russians will have to do more to cement their claims in early august , russian researchers planted a rust-free titanium russian flag on the ocean floor beneath the north pole to mark their country 's claim to the area .
denmark has also sent an arctic mission to back up its claims to the region .
and canadian premier stephen harper announced plans last week to establish a deep-sea port and a military base in the arctic .
a study by the us geological survey estimates the arctic has as much as 25 percent of the world 's undiscovered oil and gas .
but some say that 's just speculation .

he spoke to dw about moral courage , discrimination and the media . günter wallraff has been a thorn in the side of german business for decades .
now 64 , the investigative reporter from cologne has made a name for himself trying to expose injustice .
his books have sold millions of copies and been translated into 30 languages .
sweden even created a word in the writer 's name : wallraffa , which means " to expose misconduct from the inside by assuming a role . "
his most recent expose dealt with the travails of people working in german call centers .
he recently courted controversy by proposing to read salman rushdie 's " the satanic verses " in the community center of a cologne mosque .
deutsche welle : what pronouncement about you has annoyed you the most ?
günter wallraff : oh , i 'll have to think about that for a while - there are so many insults .
i 'd say : i insist on certain enmities !
when they start to praise me , i have to ask : have i been taken in ?
when bild-zeitung -lsb- germany 's largest-selling tabloid newspaper , which was the target of his 1977 book " lead story " -rsb- calls me the " pen of evil , " i feel i 've been practically knighted .
when die welt -lsb- newspaper -rsb- now came and started an article with " respect for wallraff " - in connection with my suggestion to hold a discussion of " the satanic verses " in a mosque 's community center - i was slightly bewildered , i asked myself : did i do something wrong ?
for you , it 's also an issue of having the right enemies .
you became famous at a time when the concept of the bad guy was somewhat simpler , in the 1970s and ' 80s .
where are your bogeymen today ?
i do n't have any eternal bogeymen .
i wish they would one day become civilized or democratized .
i believe in the ability to change , not just in people , but also in societal structures .
and even such an inhuman paper as bild-zeitung - which can still be called the central organ of character assassination - could possibly develop differently in another social environment and at least let up with this aggressiveness .
it always has to do with personalities - who 's currently editor in chief ?
so , i do n't have any eternal bogeymen ; i also do n't speak of enemies , i speak of opponents , and such a thing as hatred is totally foreign to me .
i do n't hate anyone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bild is known for its bombastic front page what do you consider to be moral courage ? i think moral courage should be a compulsory subject in the schools instead of certain virtues that have returned to the forefront , such as industriousness , punctuality , etc .
i think that in germany of all places , moral courage should take that place instead , that is , that children should already learn in school to respect other cultures , other ways of life , minorities and also to stand up for them - also if it means taking risks .
that 's why i 'm often in schools - especially in eastern germany .
in the last 10 years , i 've given almost 100 presentations - in places where right-wing radicals are often quite dominant .
here and there , i 've even changed people 's attitudes . " lowest of the low , " the book for which you spent two years disguised as a turkish guest worker , was a huge success in germany in 1985 .
it was , according to one critic , the first time the germans realized that the turks , who were working hard for little money in the country 's factories and being treated like dirt , were real people .
is there now less discrimination against turks and others foreigners in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social standing has replaced origin as a basis if discrimination , wallraff says today it 's not the turks who are at the very bottom of society - it 's the workers from eastern europe : poles , romanians , construction workers who have no rights , who , where we used to earn six , eight deutschmarks -lsb- 3-4 euros -rsb- , now do it for two euros an hour .
every third construction worker is illegal or only partly legal , and they are really treated like commodities , hired and fired according to the situation .
germans are among them , too , no difference is made anymore .
the long-term unemployed , especially from eastern germany , also end up in such crews .
discrimination ca n't necessarily be attributed to an individual 's origins anymore , but to their social standing .
we have already firmly embedded so-called third-world standards in germany . you plan to start working in a factory again soon .
nowadays personal reports have become a standard feature in the media .
there 's no need to glue on a fake beard anymore .
now that anyone can make their own personal experiences public - on youtube , for example - has n't undercover journalism become old hat ? i 've just provided proof of the opposite , to my own astonishment .
the short time i spent in two call centers drew so much public attention to the topic that politicians are now responding and business groups are anxious .
trying it out for yourself has a very different authenticity and force of expression than when you assert something from the outside or even investigate it .
and i think it 's essential for many more people to do it .

" this is a tragic case , but we must assume that it will be repeated , " gdp chairman konrad freiberg said in the daily hannoversche allgemeine zeitung .
" we are in the sights of the taliban and other islamist terrorist organizations . "
three german police officers responsible for protecting the german ambassador to afghanistan died and a fourth was injured when their vehicles were blown up on a road to the east of kabul on wednesday .
freiberg said terrorists were aiming to influence germany 's decision on whether to renew its deployment of german military and police in afghanistan , which parliament will consider in the coming months .
tanks for police ?
freiberg disagreed with proposals from the rival german police union , the dpolg , to outfit police in afghanistan with military equipment . dpolg chief wolfgang speck had called for them to be provided with tanks , armored vehicles and equipment to jam remote signals that could detonate bombs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police are helping to train their afghan colleagues " we do not want the police to be militarized , " freiberg said .
but he said security arrangements for the police should be reviewed .
the calls for reviewing the measures taken to protect german troops and officials in afghanistan were backed up by politicians from merkel 's christian democratic party and the opposition green party .
there was a broad consensus not to allow such attacks to influence germany 's commitment to afghanistan , deputy foreign minister gernot erler , a social democrat , said of the bombing .
germans not necessarily targeted contrary to initial reports from the afghan police , the slain germans ' all-terrain vehicles were not marked with any national emblems , such as flags , ard television said .
thus , it was unlikely the attacks were intended to hit germans in particular .
the four had been driving to a training session when the bomb exploded .
the road they took to reach the shooting range , and the range itself , were known as places frequently used by foreign security services .
police authorities were preparing to hold a memorial service for the three men in berlin 's central cathedral , the dom , on saturday .
all of them were between the ages of 30 and 40 .
merkel 's former bodyguard among those killed bild newspaper reported thursday that one of the victims had been a long-serving bodyguard to chancellor angela merkel .
the 31-year-old officer from nuremberg had planned to return to duties guarding merkel in december after a stint in the german embassy in kabul , the paper wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the men killed worked for the german embassy the officers , all of whom worked as security staff for the embassy , were the first german police to die in afghanistan since the beginning of germany 's mandate there . the deaths brought to 24 the number of germans who have been killed in afghanistan since german troops joined the nato-led international security assisstance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in 2001 .
some 3,000 german troops are engaged in reconstruction in northern afghanistan as part of the isaf . german politicians have vowed to continue with their peacekeeping mission in afghanistan despite the latest attacks .
german defense minister franz josef jung said on thursday , the taliban were trying to sway political debate by " underhanded , one-sided attacks . "
if we give in now , the terrorists will acheive their goal , he added .

" this is a tragic case , but we must assume that it will be repeated , " gdp chairman konrad freiberg said in the daily hannoversche allgemeine zeitung .
" we are in the sights of the taliban and other islamist terrorist organizations . "
three german police officers responsible for protecting the german ambassador to afghanistan died and a fourth was injured when their vehicles were blown up on a road to the east of kabul on wednesday .
freiberg said terrorists were aiming to influence germany 's decision on whether to renew its deployment of german military and police in afghanistan , which parliament will consider in the coming months .
tanks for police ?
freiberg disagreed with proposals from the rival german police union , the dpolg , to outfit police in afghanistan with military equipment . dpolg chief wolfgang speck had called for them to be provided with tanks , armored vehicles and equipment to jam remote signals that could detonate bombs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police are helping to train their afghan colleagues " we do not want the police to be militarized , " freiberg said .
but he said security arrangements for the police should be reviewed .
the calls for reviewing the measures taken to protect german troops and officials in afghanistan were backed up by politicians from merkel 's christian democratic party and the opposition green party .
there was a broad consensus not to allow such attacks to influence germany 's commitment to afghanistan , deputy foreign minister gernot erler , a social democrat , said of the bombing .
germans not necessarily targeted contrary to initial reports from the afghan police , the slain germans ' all-terrain vehicles were not marked with any national emblems , such as flags , ard television said .
thus , it was unlikely the attacks were intended to hit germans in particular .
the four had been driving to a training session when the bomb exploded .
the road they took to reach the shooting range , and the range itself , were known as places frequently used by foreign security services .
police authorities were preparing to hold a memorial service for the three men in berlin 's central cathedral , the dom , on saturday .
all of them were between the ages of 30 and 40 .

many young people reject their elders ' political claims for compensation but embrace their cultural roots . there is likely to be a generational divide when german expellees and their families commemorate tag der heimat or day of the homeland on saturday .
represented in large part by the league of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , a controversial group that lobbies and seeks compensation for ethnic germans and their descendants , the aging expellees themselves reflect on the injustices that occurred as the third reich crumbled and millions of ethnic germans were expelled from their homelands in eastern europe .
younger people , on the other hand , said they will be paying more attention to their cultural heritage .
leaving controversy behind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can expellee groups keep young people interested ?
for 17-year-old veronika moll , the day of remembrance is not about international relations but about dancing .
moll , a high school student in munich , is part of a silesian folk dancing group that performs at events like tag der heimat , as well as at her hometown 's famous oktoberfest .
she also takes part in conferences about expellee issues and other cultural activities .
both of moll 's grandmothers were expelled from silesia , in southwestern poland , at the end of world war ii .
while some people of the older generation feel silesia belongs to them , moll said she does n't feel that way at all . although she still feels special ties to silesia , munich is home .
" it 's simply not the situation that you can go back to silesia , " she said .
" it 's too long ago .
it 's important to not forget the history and to make sure that everyone knows what happened and that an injustice occurred .
but you ca n't displace all of the polish or other people who have lived in these houses or on this land for 60 years . "
youth groups focus on future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the average age for many groups is getting older this type of attitude is typical among the descendants of expellees , said thomas hoffmann , who heads the organization german youth in europe .
while the first generation of expellees dreamed of returning home , their grandchildren are uninterested in going back , hoffmann said .
the first part of german youth in europe 's harkens back to its foundation in 1951 as a group to fight for the rights of german expellee youths .
over the years it has evolved into a more progressive organization which promotes reconciliation and integration .
the group has approximately 90,000 members .
janna keberlein , a member of the youth organization and 28-year-old student at the university of düsseldorf , said that while her ethnic german grandparents still get angry about being deported from the volga region to kazakhstan during the war , she thinks the issue needs to be closed .
" young people do n't have to be drawn into this history of suffering , " the 28-year-old düsseldorf university student said , adding that she has no interest in being politically involved in the league of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- .

many young people reject their elders ' political claims for compensation but embrace their cultural roots . there is likely to be a generational divide when german expellees and their families commemorate tag der heimat or day of the homeland on saturday .
represented in large part by the league of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , a controversial group that lobbies and seeks compensation for ethnic germans and their descendants , the aging expellees themselves reflect on the injustices that occurred as the third reich crumbled and millions of ethnic germans were expelled from their homelands in eastern europe .
younger people , on the other hand , said they will be paying more attention to their cultural heritage .
leaving controversy behind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can expellee groups keep young people interested ?
for 17-year-old veronika moll , the day of remembrance is not about international relations but about dancing .
moll , a high school student in munich , is part of a silesian folk dancing group that performs at events like tag der heimat , as well as at her hometown 's famous oktoberfest .
she also takes part in conferences about expellee issues and other cultural activities .
both of moll 's grandmothers were expelled from silesia , in southwestern poland , at the end of world war ii .
while some people of the older generation feel silesia belongs to them , moll said she does n't feel that way at all . although she still feels special ties to silesia , munich is home .
" it 's simply not the situation that you can go back to silesia , " she said .
" it 's too long ago .
it 's important to not forget the history and to make sure that everyone knows what happened and that an injustice occurred .
but you ca n't displace all of the polish or other people who have lived in these houses or on this land for 60 years . "
youth groups focus on future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the average age for many groups is getting older this type of attitude is typical among the descendants of expellees , said thomas hoffmann , who heads the organization german youth in europe .
while the first generation of expellees dreamed of returning home , their grandchildren are uninterested in going back , hoffmann said .
the first part of german youth in europe 's harkens back to its foundation in 1951 as a group to fight for the rights of german expellee youths .
over the years it has evolved into a more progressive organization which promotes reconciliation and integration .
the group has approximately 90,000 members .
janna keberlein , a member of the youth organization and 28-year-old student at the university of düsseldorf , said that while her ethnic german grandparents still get angry about being deported from the volga region to kazakhstan during the war , she thinks the issue needs to be closed .
" young people do n't have to be drawn into this history of suffering , " the 28-year-old düsseldorf university student said , adding that she has no interest in being politically involved in the league of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- .

many young people reject their elders ' political claims for compensation but embrace their cultural roots . there is likely to be a generational divide when german expellees and their families commemorate tag der heimat or day of the homeland on saturday .
represented in large part by the league of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , a controversial group that lobbies and seeks compensation for ethnic germans and their descendants , the aging expellees themselves reflect on the injustices that occurred as the third reich crumbled and millions of ethnic germans were expelled from their homelands in eastern europe .
younger people , on the other hand , said they will be paying more attention to their cultural heritage .
leaving controversy behind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can expellee groups keep young people interested ?
for 17-year-old veronika moll , the day of remembrance is not about international relations but about dancing .
moll , a high school student in munich , is part of a silesian folk dancing group that performs at events like tag der heimat , as well as at her hometown 's famous oktoberfest .
she also takes part in conferences about expellee issues and other cultural activities .
both of moll 's grandmothers were expelled from silesia , in southwestern poland , at the end of world war ii .
while some people of the older generation feel silesia belongs to them , moll said she does n't feel that way at all . although she still feels special ties to silesia , munich is home .
" it 's simply not the situation that you can go back to silesia , " she said .
" it 's too long ago .
it 's important to not forget the history and to make sure that everyone knows what happened and that an injustice occurred .
but you ca n't displace all of the polish or other people who have lived in these houses or on this land for 60 years . "
youth groups focus on future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the average age for many groups is getting older this type of attitude is typical among the descendants of expellees , said thomas hoffmann , who heads the organization german youth in europe .
while the first generation of expellees dreamed of returning home , their grandchildren are uninterested in going back , hoffmann said .
the first part of german youth in europe 's harkens back to its foundation in 1951 as a group to fight for the rights of german expellee youths .
over the years it has evolved into a more progressive organization which promotes reconciliation and integration .
the group has approximately 90,000 members .
janna keberlein , a member of the youth organization and 28-year-old student at the university of düsseldorf , said that while her ethnic german grandparents still get angry about being deported from the volga region to kazakhstan during the war , she thinks the issue needs to be closed .
" young people do n't have to be drawn into this history of suffering , " the 28-year-old düsseldorf university student said , adding that she has no interest in being politically involved in the league of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- .
a taboo subject bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the silesian traditions remain important to some youth for many young people , the bdv focuses too much on the past , a fact seen in the graying of the organization , said alfred de zayas , a leading scholar on germen expellees .
when he gives talks to expellee groups , the average age is usually 60 , he said .
de zayas served for years as a lawyer for the united nations high commissioner for human rights .
he is currently a professor of international law at the geneva school of diplomacy .
he wrote the first scholarly work on german expellees to appear in english , breaking what had long been a taboo topic .
the post-war expulsions were the largest forced movement of europeans in the 20th century .
historians estimate that between 12 and 15 million people were expelled during the forced migrations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 16.08.2007 legendary reporter decries " third-world standards " in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wallraff has spent his life doing undercover exposes investigative journalist günter wallraff has made history with his exposes about turkish guest workers , tabloid journalism and call centers .
he spoke to dw about moral courage , discrimination and the media . günter wallraff has been a thorn in the side of german business for decades .
now 64 , the investigative reporter from cologne has made a name for himself trying to expose injustice .
his books have sold millions of copies and been translated into 30 languages .
sweden even created a word in the writer 's name : wallraffa , which means " to expose misconduct from the inside by assuming a role . "
his most recent expose dealt with the travails of people working in german call centers .
he recently courted controversy by proposing to read salman rushdie 's " the satanic verses " in the community center of a cologne mosque .
deutsche welle : what pronouncement about you has annoyed you the most ?
günter wallraff : oh , i 'll have to think about that for a while - there are so many insults .
i 'd say : i insist on certain enmities !
when they start to praise me , i have to ask : have i been taken in ?
when bild-zeitung -lsb- germany 's largest-selling tabloid newspaper , which was the target of his 1977 book " lead story " -rsb- calls me the " pen of evil , " i feel i 've been practically knighted .
when die welt -lsb- newspaper -rsb- now came and started an article with " respect for wallraff " - in connection with my suggestion to hold a discussion of " the satanic verses " in a mosque 's community center - i was slightly bewildered , i asked myself : did i do something wrong ?
for you , it 's also an issue of having the right enemies .
you became famous at a time when the concept of the bad guy was somewhat simpler , in the 1970s and ' 80s .
where are your bogeymen today ?
i do n't have any eternal bogeymen .
i wish they would one day become civilized or democratized .
i believe in the ability to change , not just in people , but also in societal structures .
and even such an inhuman paper as bild-zeitung - which can still be called the central organ of character assassination - could possibly develop differently in another social environment and at least let up with this aggressiveness .
it always has to do with personalities - who 's currently editor in chief ?
so , i do n't have any eternal bogeymen ; i also do n't speak of enemies , i speak of opponents , and such a thing as hatred is totally foreign to me .
i do n't hate anyone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bild is known for its bombastic front page what do you consider to be moral courage ? i think moral courage should be a compulsory subject in the schools instead of certain virtues that have returned to the forefront , such as industriousness , punctuality , etc .
i think that in germany of all places , moral courage should take that place instead , that is , that children should already learn in school to respect other cultures , other ways of life , minorities and also to stand up for them - also if it means taking risks .
that 's why i 'm often in schools - especially in eastern germany .
in the last 10 years , i 've given almost 100 presentations - in places where right-wing radicals are often quite dominant .
here and there , i 've even changed people 's attitudes . " lowest of the low , " the book for which you spent two years disguised as a turkish guest worker , was a huge success in germany in 1985 .
it was , according to one critic , the first time the germans realized that the turks , who were working hard for little money in the country 's factories and being treated like dirt , were real people .
is there now less discrimination against turks and others foreigners in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social standing has replaced origin as a basis if discrimination , wallraff says today it 's not the turks who are at the very bottom of society - it 's the workers from eastern europe : poles , romanians , construction workers who have no rights , who , where we used to earn six , eight deutschmarks -lsb- 3-4 euros -rsb- , now do it for two euros an hour .
every third construction worker is illegal or only partly legal , and they are really treated like commodities , hired and fired according to the situation .
germans are among them , too , no difference is made anymore .
the long-term unemployed , especially from eastern germany , also end up in such crews .
discrimination ca n't necessarily be attributed to an individual 's origins anymore , but to their social standing .
we have already firmly embedded so-called third-world standards in germany . you plan to start working in a factory again soon .
nowadays personal reports have become a standard feature in the media .
there 's no need to glue on a fake beard anymore .
now that anyone can make their own personal experiences public - on youtube , for example - has n't undercover journalism become old hat ? i 've just provided proof of the opposite , to my own astonishment .
the short time i spent in two call centers drew so much public attention to the topic that politicians are now responding and business groups are anxious .
trying it out for yourself has a very different authenticity and force of expression than when you assert something from the outside or even investigate it .
and i think it 's essential for many more people to do it .

she knows every crook and cranny of germany 's favorite landmark . dw : what is the allure of the cologne cathedral in your opinion ? barbara schock-werner : there are two things : the first is the building itself , its size , its perfection and its beauty .
but it 's also the visitor-friendly management that ’ s behind it .
for example , there 's no entry fee - it 's a church and everyone 's welcome .
we have very long opening hours , from 6:00 am to 7:30 pm .
and we make a large effort to have friendly management , group tours , not too many tours at the same time , etc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the sheer size of the cathedral that many find impressive what about the building itself attracts people ? the overwhelming space .
go in , sit down - and your heart rises .
it 's something that really has an effect on your body and soul .
you have imagine that the people in the middle ages lived in much smaller spaces and they were n't used to theaters and cinemas , which are matter-of-fact for us today .
for them it must have seemed even bigger . the purpose behind the building was less to glorify the archbishop of cologne and much more an effort to give the christians a picture of heaven .
when you take your time , sit down and take in the building , you can experience that today as well . many people ask why the cathedral constantly seems to be under construction .
what do you say to that ? all historical buildings have to be taken care of if they are to be preserved .
the gothic ones are unfortunately the most fragile because their surfaces are so complicated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cathedral 's towers are about 157 meters -lrb- 515 feet -rrb- tall the cathedral building foundation and cathedral workshop , which i have overseen since 1999 , are there to manage the preservation of the church .
these incorporate a staff of 80 people .
thirty of these are craftspeople , including stonemasons , scaffold makers , roofers , locksmiths , carpenters , blacksmiths , electricians and painters . the cathedral has 8,000 square meters -lrb- about 86,000 square feet -rrb- of historical glass windows and we have our own glass restoration workshop with 10 staff members .
underneath the cathedral there is an archaeological dig going on and we also have a small team of archaeologists .
i 'm also in charge of the treasure chamber , the library and the administrators . what 's your annual budget ? between six and seven million euros -lrb- between eight and 9.4 million dollars -rrb- a year .
that mostly goes for the staff .
but the staff is the guarantee that the cathedral will be preserved .
they know every crack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steam engines so near to the cathedral damaged its facade , said schock-werner why is the cologne cathedral so black ? weathering of the stone began around the middle of the 19th century when the majority of the population began heating with coal .
before that , the poor people heated with wood and nothing happened .
but when everyone started heating with coal , the sulphur content in the air increased dramatically .
that happened in all cities . in cologne , in addition , train tracks were laid in direct proximity to the cathedral and for nearly 100 years steam engines drove by the cathedral every day and blew their smoke on the building .
that 's why the damage to the stone is greater here than in other places .
add to that the brown coal power plants in the western part of the city . today , there are n't any steam engines any more , the power plants have been moved and practically no one has individual heating since the whole city uses district heating .
the air today is much better and we can be sure that what we replace now will last longer . the renowned german artist gerhard richter recently completed a new stained glass window for the south wing of the cathedral that will be unveiled later this month .
why was gerhard richter chosen for the job ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard richter 's stained glass window consists of 11,250 squares of color in the field of contemporary glass painting , i could n't find a solution to the window that fit the cathedral 's status .
i had n't initially thought of richter for the project , because he 's not generally associated with glass windows .
but then we met at a reception and suddenly i thought , gerhard richter must be able to do it .
he has a relationship to the catholic church , he lives in cologne , and he 's worked both representationally and ornamentally .
he 's extremely sensitive and his work is of an incredibly high quality .
i asked him , he said yes and now we 've been working on the project for five years .
we 're very pleased that it 's nearly completed . legend has it that the cathedral was n't destroyed during world war two .
is this true ? no , that 's one of the cathedral 's pious legends .
the fact is , it was hit hard 14 times and suffered heavy damages but stayed standing .
that must have been an incredible symbol for the people .
they came out of their basements and shelters and the cathedral was still standing , even though the rest of the city had been flattened . what 's it like to be a woman in your job ? i had the better qualifications .
i am an architect and an art historian and that ’ s why they chose me .
i 'm the first woman with my special title , but i 'm not the first woman doing this job .
there are women in similar positions at the churches in ulm , freiburg , strasbourg , nuremberg and magdeburg , but they have different titles . my predecessor was quite respected in his position and i think it was easier for a woman to follow him than for a man , because we were n't in direct competition . bildunterschrift : cologne 's greatest landmark was constructed over six centuries click on the link below to read what visitors had to say about the cologne cathedral . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she knows every crook and cranny of germany 's favorite landmark . dw : what is the allure of the cologne cathedral in your opinion ? barbara schock-werner : there are two things : the first is the building itself , its size , its perfection and its beauty .
but it 's also the visitor-friendly management that ’ s behind it .
for example , there 's no entry fee - it 's a church and everyone 's welcome .
we have very long opening hours , from 6:00 am to 7:30 pm .
and we make a large effort to have friendly management , group tours , not too many tours at the same time , etc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the sheer size of the cathedral that many find impressive what about the building itself attracts people ? the overwhelming space .
go in , sit down - and your heart rises .
it 's something that really has an effect on your body and soul .
you have imagine that the people in the middle ages lived in much smaller spaces and they were n't used to theaters and cinemas , which are matter-of-fact for us today .
for them it must have seemed even bigger . the purpose behind the building was less to glorify the archbishop of cologne and much more an effort to give the christians a picture of heaven .
when you take your time , sit down and take in the building , you can experience that today as well . many people ask why the cathedral constantly seems to be under construction .
what do you say to that ? all historical buildings have to be taken care of if they are to be preserved .
the gothic ones are unfortunately the most fragile because their surfaces are so complicated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cathedral 's towers are about 157 meters -lrb- 515 feet -rrb- tall the cathedral building foundation and cathedral workshop , which i have overseen since 1999 , are there to manage the preservation of the church .
these incorporate a staff of 80 people .
thirty of these are craftspeople , including stonemasons , scaffold makers , roofers , locksmiths , carpenters , blacksmiths , electricians and painters . the cathedral has 8,000 square meters -lrb- about 86,000 square feet -rrb- of historical glass windows and we have our own glass restoration workshop with 10 staff members .
underneath the cathedral there is an archaeological dig going on and we also have a small team of archaeologists .
i 'm also in charge of the treasure chamber , the library and the administrators . what 's your annual budget ? between six and seven million euros -lrb- between eight and 9.4 million dollars -rrb- a year .
that mostly goes for the staff .
but the staff is the guarantee that the cathedral will be preserved .
they know every crack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steam engines so near to the cathedral damaged its facade , said schock-werner why is the cologne cathedral so black ? weathering of the stone began around the middle of the 19th century when the majority of the population began heating with coal .
before that , the poor people heated with wood and nothing happened .
but when everyone started heating with coal , the sulphur content in the air increased dramatically .
that happened in all cities . in cologne , in addition , train tracks were laid in direct proximity to the cathedral and for nearly 100 years steam engines drove by the cathedral every day and blew their smoke on the building .
that 's why the damage to the stone is greater here than in other places .
add to that the brown coal power plants in the western part of the city . today , there are n't any steam engines any more , the power plants have been moved and practically no one has individual heating since the whole city uses district heating .
the air today is much better and we can be sure that what we replace now will last longer . the renowned german artist gerhard richter recently completed a new stained glass window for the south wing of the cathedral that will be unveiled later this month .
why was gerhard richter chosen for the job ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard richter 's stained glass window consists of 11,250 squares of color in the field of contemporary glass painting , i could n't find a solution to the window that fit the cathedral 's status .
i had n't initially thought of richter for the project , because he 's not generally associated with glass windows .
but then we met at a reception and suddenly i thought , gerhard richter must be able to do it .
he has a relationship to the catholic church , he lives in cologne , and he 's worked both representationally and ornamentally .
he 's extremely sensitive and his work is of an incredibly high quality .
i asked him , he said yes and now we 've been working on the project for five years .
we 're very pleased that it 's nearly completed . legend has it that the cathedral was n't destroyed during world war two .
is this true ? no , that 's one of the cathedral 's pious legends .
the fact is , it was hit hard 14 times and suffered heavy damages but stayed standing .
that must have been an incredible symbol for the people .
they came out of their basements and shelters and the cathedral was still standing , even though the rest of the city had been flattened . what 's it like to be a woman in your job ? i had the better qualifications .
i am an architect and an art historian and that ’ s why they chose me .
i 'm the first woman with my special title , but i 'm not the first woman doing this job .
there are women in similar positions at the churches in ulm , freiburg , strasbourg , nuremberg and magdeburg , but they have different titles . my predecessor was quite respected in his position and i think it was easier for a woman to follow him than for a man , because we were n't in direct competition . bildunterschrift : cologne 's greatest landmark was constructed over six centuries click on the link below to read what visitors had to say about the cologne cathedral . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

politicians have called for a new effort to educate young people about the true nature of east germany after recently surfaced shoot-to-kill orders have rekindled a debate about conditions in the communist country . volker kauder , the parliamentary leader for germany 's governing christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , told the berliner zeitung on thursday that his party would take steps to raise awareness about eastern germany 's communist past . " we have worked enormously hard to deal with the past of the third reich 's terror system and continue to do so , but we 've done much too little when it comes to dealing with the gdr dictatorship , " he said .
" when looking at the alarming lack of knowledge about the gdr past among the younger generation , we should use the current debate to clarify who was responsible . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonners may be surprised to learn that some think the former west german capital was in the gdr on wednesday , germany 's mass tabloid bild had asked young germans what they knew about the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- .
while some said that east germans were n't allowed to travel , others pointed out that there was a high level of unemployment , that people liked to bathe in the nude and that no one was able to buy fashionable clothes .
one 22-year-old man said that bonn served as the gdr 's capital .
" hitler was the boss and he had a wall build around his empire , " he added . second document found the current debate surrounding life in the gdr was sparked by a shoot-to-kill order that resurfaced over the weekend .
it called on members of the east german secret police , the stasi , to use their weapons to prevent people from fleeing across the german-german border , even if women and children were involved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stasi file agency head marianne birthler is feeling the heat the federal agency that administers the stasi files came under pressure for presenting the document as a sensational find after it became obvious that the order had been known to researchers and state prosecutors for years .
on wednesday , agency officials uncovered a similar document .

its museums are now worried that a new directive from russia 's culture ministry will make it tougher to track down the works . tucked away in the secret vaults of russian museums are a number of priceless works of art that germany says belong to it . the country 's museum directors believe that about 180,000 works taken from collections in berlin are in russia and poland .
the hague convention regulating wars on land requires art treasures seized by occupying forces to be returned .
but germany has had limited success in regaining such trophy art , and museum directors fear russia may be making it even more difficult since the country 's culture ministry purportedly issued a directive that calls for the creation of new inventory lists of everything that 's been stored in secret depots so far .
" the russian government is rewriting inventories because it wants to incorporate these items permanently in its own collections , " said klaus-dieter lehmann , head of the prussian cultural heritage foundation .
he said it would make it much harder to track works that were once looted from germany .
but contradictory reports have been commonplace in the decades-long dispute over art looted by the soviets during world war ii .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dürer 's drawing is again part of bremen 's city collection russian officials say they have dealt with the issue with transparency .
moscow historical museum 's deputy director , vadim leonidovitsch yegorov , denied the existence of a directive to rewrite russia 's inventories .
" i think negative people have thought it up so they can present russian researchers and museum people as greedy and miserly and not only restricting access to their own , but also to other people 's treasures , " he said .
spoils of war ?
in 1990 , germany and the soviet union expressly committed themselves to returning art objects that had been looted during the war .
but just a few years later , the russian government declared that artworks taken from germany were russian property .
" we ca n't give them back to germany , " said yegorov .
" because back then germany did n't respect russia and russian art treasures ; it treated them barbarically . "
one of the main bones of contention is the baldin collection .
bremen 's city art museum has demanded the return of the works by dürer , rembrandt and van gogh .
germany cites international law as well as the german-soviet agreement .
but the russians have remained intransigent on the issue .
" we are keeping it as part of a world cultural heritage that should be accessible to all , to researchers from all countries and the entire world , " yegorov said .
barrier to cooperation germany , however , refuses to accept that position .
and the dispute over looted art has become a hindrance to working with russian institutions , said lehmann of the prussian cultural heritage foundation .
" we are simply interested in cooperating with the russians in matters of art and culture , and this unresolved issue of looted art always gets in the way , " he said .
bildunterschrift : russian museums showed objects from the merovingian era that had been thought lost still , russian and german institutions have managed to work together on some research and exhibitions .
german museums regarded as a milestone this spring 's joint german-russian merovingian exhibition shown in moscow and st. petersburg which displayed objects art experts had considered lost .
meanwhile , the germans have demanded russia finally open its secret depots .
berlin 's museums have been drawing up new lists of lost artworks - partly in the hope that colleagues who gain access to the russian depots can pass on information .
and their efforts have already borne fruit , according to berlin 's museum of decorative arts .
" the catalogue of losses to the sculpture collection was only published a few weeks ago , and , despite everything , we have already been able to identify one of the objects in one of the russian depots in moscow , " the museum 's deputy director , lothar lambacher , said .
tit-for-tat but the real issue is getting negotiations over the return of looted art back on track .
berlin 's museum directors have received some backing from political quarters in calling for germany to stand up for its rights vis-a-vis the russian museums and government .
bildunterschrift : the merovingian show was an eye-opener for german art experts " for a while , the russian government seemed quite willing to discuss returning the works , " said steffen reiche , a member of the german parliament 's culture commission . "

steinberg , the author of a recent study on violence in iraq , said he believes a federal solution could help the country move forward peacefully . dw-world.de : what are the conclusions of your study ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido steinberg said a second iraqi civil war in the north was possible guido steinberg : looking at the situation in iraq today , i do n't think that it is that important anymore whether the us security plan in baghdad and central iraq is successful or not .
what i think is important is that the iraqi actors do n't come to terms with each other .
within the next couple of years , i think we will see an escalation of conflict not only in baghdad , but rather in the north and the south of the country : in the north , over the incorporation of the kirkuk into the turkish autonomy zone ; and in the south , over the control of the southern shiite areas .
this is why i think that only a federal solution can smooth this process of breaking off of iraq . some commentators say that it is too late , that iraqis themselves are set into partitioning the country into shiite , sunni and kurdish areas .
are the political differences between these groups fundamentally irreconcilable ? i do n't think that partition is a solution , because there will be no clear cut for the three parts .
the country will totally disintegrate .
i 'd rather see four or five iraq 's emerging .
this is why i think the only hope for us to come to any solution in iraq , in the long term , is a federalization , which might be called soft partition . a referendum is due to take place on the future status of the city of kirkuk , which the kurds regard as kurdish and want to be included in their province , but there is fierce resistance by turkmen and sunnis living there .
how significant is this issue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurds regard the citiy of kirkuk as their own it is extremely significant .
i argue in my study that it might be the most significant topic in the coming months .
what we are witnessing already is an escalation of violence .
it is exactly the territories where kurds , turkmen and arabs live together .
i think this is a deliberant attempt on the part of al qaeda in iraq and other terrorist organizations to provoke a civil war in the north of the country .
i think if the kirkuk issue is not solved between the political parties in baghdad , this second civil war , in the northern part of the country , might take place . the real danger for the rest of the year 2007 and for the year 2008 is for an intervention by the neighbors , because if the conflict escalates in the north of iraq , if the turkmen , for example , are increasingly targeted by the terrorists , it is more likely that the neighbors will try to intervene - if not directly , then indirectly - as iran already does in southern iraq . nathan witkop interviewed guido steinberg -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this is why i think that only a federal solution can smooth this process of breaking off of iraq . some commentators say that it is too late , that iraqis themselves are set into partitioning the country into shiite , sunni and kurdish areas .
are the political differences between these groups fundamentally irreconcilable ? i do n't think that partition is a solution , because there will be no clear cut for the three parts .
the country will totally disintegrate .
i 'd rather see four or five iraq 's emerging .
this is why i think the only hope for us to come to any solution in iraq , in the long term , is a federalization , which might be called soft partition . a referendum is due to take place on the future status of the city of kirkuk , which the kurds regard as kurdish and want to be included in their province , but there is fierce resistance by turkmen and sunnis living there .
how significant is this issue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurds regard the citiy of kirkuk as their own it is extremely significant .
i argue in my study that it might be the most significant topic in the coming months .
what we are witnessing already is an escalation of violence .
it is exactly the territories where kurds , turkmen and arabs live together .
i think this is a deliberant attempt on the part of al qaeda in iraq and other terrorist organizations to provoke a civil war in the north of the country .
i think if the kirkuk issue is not solved between the political parties in baghdad , this second civil war , in the northern part of the country , might take place . the real danger for the rest of the year 2007 and for the year 2008 is for an intervention by the neighbors , because if the conflict escalates in the north of iraq , if the turkmen , for example , are increasingly targeted by the terrorists , it is more likely that the neighbors will try to intervene - if not directly , then indirectly - as iran already does in southern iraq . nathan witkop interviewed guido steinberg -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but peter beines is more than an average enthusiast - he 's the head elvis ' largest german-language fan club . peter beines has not only fills his living room with a huge collection of elvis posters and records - one of which bears elvis ' original signature - he 's also the head of the largest german-language fan club devoted to the king . " i 've been an elvis fan since 1974 , " the 44-year-old said from his bonn apartment before leaving for the memorial in graceland .
" back then i was 11 years old and found out about a concert he played in las vegas through a magazine article . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans have not forgotten elvis , some are even convinced he 's still alive the amount of charisma that elvis was able to get across in just a magazine photo impressed beines so much that he began collecting elvis records and clipping news articles about the king throughout his teenage years .
the collection grew to the point that his apartment now resembles an elvis museum . " most of all it was about his music , " beines said .
" then about his vibrancy , his charisma .
especially the things he did on stage during his concerts .
third i liked his human characteristics . " elvis ' last song , " way down , " recorded in his home in august 1977 , is perhaps indicative of the last few years of his career .
while professionally he suffered as hit bands the beatles and the rolling stones drew more attention , privately he battled obesity and drug dependency . fans continue to remember their king at the age of 42 , elvis was found dead in the bathroom of his graceland mansion in memphis on aug .
16 , 1977 .
doctors said his death was caused by heart failure , likely brought on by obesity and years of abusing medications .
biographer alanna nash characterized his dependency as an inability to accept what had become of himself , leading him to attempt to kill the pain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : half of graceland 's visitors are under 35 years old even as the rumors of elvis being spotted at deserted gas stations around the world continue to spread , impersonators who dress , swing and croon like the king himself pay regular tribute to the rock and roll legend .
fans have also created over 500 official elvis fan clubs in over 45 countries . on the 20th anniversary of his death in 1997 a video elvis appeared on stage with over thirty of his former band mates in the production elvis in concert ' 97 at the mid-south coliseum in memphis , tenn .
the show went on to tour the us and in 1999 the european tour opened in london , marking elvis ' first-ever concert outside of north america . an international sensation since 1954 more than one billion elvis records have been sold - a feat no other artist is yet to accomplish - and he won three grammy awards from 14 nominations . however , his fame did n't just hit american airwaves .
elvis ' trophy room at graceland is filled with gold and platinum records from around the world - including germany , although five concerts in canada in were his only performances outside the united states . with a song catalog of over 1,000 titles , german fan beines said it 's nearly impossible to pick just one favorite song . " if i had to choose one , then for me it 'd be ' an american trilogy , " ' beines said .
" but like nearly all fans , i could name 50 songs and always think of another that should be on the list .
it 'd be better just to choose 100 favorites . " a less glittery private life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elvis preseley served the us military in friedberg where he met his wife priscilla while his career was all glitz and gold , elvis ' private life was less than easy .
the son of a laborer and seamstress , he was born in tupelo , mississippi , and grew up alone after his twin brother was stillborn .
on his 10th birthday , instead of the bicycle he had hoped for , elvis was given a guitar and he taught himself to play . unlike today 's pop sensations , elvis served his country at the us ray barracks in friedberg , germany between 1958 and 1960 .
it was during this time that he met his future bride , priscilla beaulieu , the daughter of a us air force officer . elvis and priscilla married in las vegas in 1967 and nine months later daughter lisa marie was born .
however , priscilla complained that elvis had little time for his family and of a destructive cycle of sleeping pills , stimulants and sedatives .
the couple divorced in 1973 . although his earnings continued to climb and still do even after his death -lrb- for decades elvis led forbes magazine 's list of the biggest earning deceased celebrities -rrb- , by the mid-1970 's he could barely bring himself to swing his hips on stage . article based on news reports -lrb- sjr -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he spoke to dw about moral courage , discrimination and the media . günter wallraff has been a thorn in the side of german business for decades .
now 64 , the investigative reporter from cologne has made a name for himself trying to expose injustice .
his books have sold millions of copies and been translated into 30 languages .
sweden even created a word in the writer 's name : wallraffa , which means " to expose misconduct from the inside by assuming a role . "
his most recent expose dealt with the travails of people working in german call centers .
he recently courted controversy by proposing to read salman rushdie 's " the satanic verses " in the community center of a cologne mosque .
deutsche welle : what pronouncement about you has annoyed you the most ?
günter wallraff : oh , i 'll have to think about that for a while - there are so many insults .
i 'd say : i insist on certain enmities !
when they start to praise me , i have to ask : have i been taken in ?
when bild-zeitung -lsb- germany 's largest-selling tabloid newspaper , which was the target of his 1977 book " lead story " -rsb- calls me the " pen of evil , " i feel i 've been practically knighted .
when die welt -lsb- newspaper -rsb- now came and started an article with " respect for wallraff " - in connection with my suggestion to hold a discussion of " the satanic verses " in a mosque 's community center - i was slightly bewildered , i asked myself : did i do something wrong ?
for you , it 's also an issue of having the right enemies .
you became famous at a time when the concept of the bad guy was somewhat simpler , in the 1970s and ' 80s .
where are your bogeymen today ?
i do n't have any eternal bogeymen .
i wish they would one day become civilized or democratized .
i believe in the ability to change , not just in people , but also in societal structures .
and even such an inhuman paper as bild-zeitung - which can still be called the central organ of character assassination - could possibly develop differently in another social environment and at least let up with this aggressiveness .
it always has to do with personalities - who 's currently editor in chief ?
so , i do n't have any eternal bogeymen ; i also do n't speak of enemies , i speak of opponents , and such a thing as hatred is totally foreign to me .
i do n't hate anyone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bild is known for its bombastic front page what do you consider to be moral courage ? i think moral courage should be a compulsory subject in the schools instead of certain virtues that have returned to the forefront , such as industriousness , punctuality , etc .
i think that in germany of all places , moral courage should take that place instead , that is , that children should already learn in school to respect other cultures , other ways of life , minorities and also to stand up for them - also if it means taking risks .
that 's why i 'm often in schools - especially in eastern germany .
in the last 10 years , i 've given almost 100 presentations - in places where right-wing radicals are often quite dominant .
here and there , i 've even changed people 's attitudes . " lowest of the low , " the book for which you spent two years disguised as a turkish guest worker , was a huge success in germany in 1985 .
it was , according to one critic , the first time the germans realized that the turks , who were working hard for little money in the country 's factories and being treated like dirt , were real people .
is there now less discrimination against turks and others foreigners in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social standing has replaced origin as a basis if discrimination , wallraff says today it 's not the turks who are at the very bottom of society - it 's the workers from eastern europe : poles , romanians , construction workers who have no rights , who , where we used to earn six , eight deutschmarks -lsb- 3-4 euros -rsb- , now do it for two euros an hour .
every third construction worker is illegal or only partly legal , and they are really treated like commodities , hired and fired according to the situation .
germans are among them , too , no difference is made anymore .
the long-term unemployed , especially from eastern germany , also end up in such crews .
discrimination ca n't necessarily be attributed to an individual 's origins anymore , but to their social standing .
we have already firmly embedded so-called third-world standards in germany . you plan to start working in a factory again soon .
nowadays personal reports have become a standard feature in the media .
there 's no need to glue on a fake beard anymore .
now that anyone can make their own personal experiences public - on youtube , for example - has n't undercover journalism become old hat ? i 've just provided proof of the opposite , to my own astonishment .
the short time i spent in two call centers drew so much public attention to the topic that politicians are now responding and business groups are anxious .
trying it out for yourself has a very different authenticity and force of expression than when you assert something from the outside or even investigate it .
and i think it 's essential for many more people to do it .

he spoke to dw about moral courage , discrimination and the media . günter wallraff has been a thorn in the side of german business for decades .
now 64 , the investigative reporter from cologne has made a name for himself trying to expose injustice .
his books have sold millions of copies and been translated into 30 languages .
sweden even created a word in the writer 's name : wallraffa , which means " to expose misconduct from the inside by assuming a role . "
his most recent expose dealt with the travails of people working in german call centers .
he recently courted controversy by proposing to read salman rushdie 's " the satanic verses " in the community center of a cologne mosque .
deutsche welle : what pronouncement about you has annoyed you the most ?
günter wallraff : oh , i 'll have to think about that for a while - there are so many insults .
i 'd say : i insist on certain enmities !
when they start to praise me , i have to ask : have i been taken in ?
when bild-zeitung -lsb- germany 's largest-selling tabloid newspaper , which was the target of his 1977 book " lead story " -rsb- calls me the " pen of evil , " i feel i 've been practically knighted .
when die welt -lsb- newspaper -rsb- now came and started an article with " respect for wallraff " - in connection with my suggestion to hold a discussion of " the satanic verses " in a mosque 's community center - i was slightly bewildered , i asked myself : did i do something wrong ?
for you , it 's also an issue of having the right enemies .
you became famous at a time when the concept of the bad guy was somewhat simpler , in the 1970s and ' 80s .
where are your bogeymen today ?
i do n't have any eternal bogeymen .
i wish they would one day become civilized or democratized .
i believe in the ability to change , not just in people , but also in societal structures .
and even such an inhuman paper as bild-zeitung - which can still be called the central organ of character assassination - could possibly develop differently in another social environment and at least let up with this aggressiveness .
it always has to do with personalities - who 's currently editor in chief ?
so , i do n't have any eternal bogeymen ; i also do n't speak of enemies , i speak of opponents , and such a thing as hatred is totally foreign to me .
i do n't hate anyone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bild is known for its bombastic front page what do you consider to be moral courage ? i think moral courage should be a compulsory subject in the schools instead of certain virtues that have returned to the forefront , such as industriousness , punctuality , etc .
i think that in germany of all places , moral courage should take that place instead , that is , that children should already learn in school to respect other cultures , other ways of life , minorities and also to stand up for them - also if it means taking risks .
that 's why i 'm often in schools - especially in eastern germany .
in the last 10 years , i 've given almost 100 presentations - in places where right-wing radicals are often quite dominant .
here and there , i 've even changed people 's attitudes . " lowest of the low , " the book for which you spent two years disguised as a turkish guest worker , was a huge success in germany in 1985 .
it was , according to one critic , the first time the germans realized that the turks , who were working hard for little money in the country 's factories and being treated like dirt , were real people .
is there now less discrimination against turks and others foreigners in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social standing has replaced origin as a basis if discrimination , wallraff says today it 's not the turks who are at the very bottom of society - it 's the workers from eastern europe : poles , romanians , construction workers who have no rights , who , where we used to earn six , eight deutschmarks -lsb- 3-4 euros -rsb- , now do it for two euros an hour .
every third construction worker is illegal or only partly legal , and they are really treated like commodities , hired and fired according to the situation .
germans are among them , too , no difference is made anymore .

discrimination ca n't necessarily be attributed to an individual 's origins anymore , but to their social standing .
we have already firmly embedded so-called third-world standards in germany . you plan to start working in a factory again soon .

trying it out for yourself has a very different authenticity and force of expression than when you assert something from the outside or even investigate it .

sweden even created a word in the writer 's name : wallraffa , which means " to expose misconduct from the inside by assuming a role . "
his most recent expose dealt with the travails of people working in german call centers .
he recently courted controversy by proposing to read salman rushdie 's " the satanic verses " in the community center of a cologne mosque .
deutsche welle : what pronouncement about you has annoyed you the most ?
günter wallraff : oh , i 'll have to think about that for a while - there are so many insults .
i 'd say : i insist on certain enmities !
when they start to praise me , i have to ask : have i been taken in ?
when bild-zeitung -lsb- germany 's largest-selling tabloid newspaper , which was the target of his 1977 book " lead story " -rsb- calls me the " pen of evil , " i feel i 've been practically knighted .
when die welt -lsb- newspaper -rsb- now came and started an article with " respect for wallraff " - in connection with my suggestion to hold a discussion of " the satanic verses " in a mosque 's community center - i was slightly bewildered , i asked myself : did i do something wrong ?
for you , it 's also an issue of having the right enemies .
you became famous at a time when the concept of the bad guy was somewhat simpler , in the 1970s and ' 80s .
where are your bogeymen today ?
i do n't have any eternal bogeymen .
i wish they would one day become civilized or democratized .
i believe in the ability to change , not just in people , but also in societal structures .
and even such an inhuman paper as bild-zeitung - which can still be called the central organ of character assassination - could possibly develop differently in another social environment and at least let up with this aggressiveness .
it always has to do with personalities - who 's currently editor in chief ?
so , i do n't have any eternal bogeymen ; i also do n't speak of enemies , i speak of opponents , and such a thing as hatred is totally foreign to me .
i do n't hate anyone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bild is known for its bombastic front page what do you consider to be moral courage ? i think moral courage should be a compulsory subject in the schools instead of certain virtues that have returned to the forefront , such as industriousness , punctuality , etc .
i think that in germany of all places , moral courage should take that place instead , that is , that children should already learn in school to respect other cultures , other ways of life , minorities and also to stand up for them - also if it means taking risks .
that 's why i 'm often in schools - especially in eastern germany .
in the last 10 years , i 've given almost 100 presentations - in places where right-wing radicals are often quite dominant .
here and there , i 've even changed people 's attitudes . " lowest of the low , " the book for which you spent two years disguised as a turkish guest worker , was a huge success in germany in 1985 .
it was , according to one critic , the first time the germans realized that the turks , who were working hard for little money in the country 's factories and being treated like dirt , were real people .
is there now less discrimination against turks and others foreigners in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social standing has replaced origin as a basis if discrimination , wallraff says today it 's not the turks who are at the very bottom of society - it 's the workers from eastern europe : poles , romanians , construction workers who have no rights , who , where we used to earn six , eight deutschmarks -lsb- 3-4 euros -rsb- , now do it for two euros an hour .
every third construction worker is illegal or only partly legal , and they are really treated like commodities , hired and fired according to the situation .
germans are among them , too , no difference is made anymore .
the long-term unemployed , especially from eastern germany , also end up in such crews .
discrimination ca n't necessarily be attributed to an individual 's origins anymore , but to their social standing .
we have already firmly embedded so-called third-world standards in germany . you plan to start working in a factory again soon .
nowadays personal reports have become a standard feature in the media .
there 's no need to glue on a fake beard anymore .
now that anyone can make their own personal experiences public - on youtube , for example - has n't undercover journalism become old hat ? i 've just provided proof of the opposite , to my own astonishment .
the short time i spent in two call centers drew so much public attention to the topic that politicians are now responding and business groups are anxious .
trying it out for yourself has a very different authenticity and force of expression than when you assert something from the outside or even investigate it .
and i think it 's essential for many more people to do it .

" this is a tragic case , but we must assume that it will be repeated , " gdp chairman konrad freiberg said in the daily hannoversche allgemeine zeitung .
" we are in the sights of the taliban and other islamist terrorist organizations . "
three german police officers responsible for protecting the german ambassador to afghanistan died and a fourth was injured when their vehicles were blown up on a road to the east of kabul on wednesday .
freiberg said terrorists were aiming to influence germany 's decision on whether to renew its deployment of german military and police in afghanistan , which parliament will consider in the coming months .
tanks for police ?
freiberg disagreed with proposals from the rival german police union , the dpolg , to outfit police in afghanistan with military equipment . dpolg chief wolfgang speck had called for them to be provided with tanks , armored vehicles and equipment to jam remote signals that could detonate bombs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police are helping to train their afghan colleagues " we do not want the police to be militarized , " freiberg said .
but he said security arrangements for the police should be reviewed .
the calls for reviewing the measures taken to protect german troops and officials in afghanistan were backed up by politicians from merkel 's christian democratic party and the opposition green party .
there was a broad consensus not to allow such attacks to influence germany 's commitment to afghanistan , deputy foreign minister gernot erler , a social democrat , said of the bombing .
germans not necessarily targeted contrary to initial reports from the afghan police , the slain germans ' all-terrain vehicles were not marked with any national emblems , such as flags , ard television said .
thus , it was unlikely the attacks were intended to hit germans in particular .
the four had been driving to a training session when the bomb exploded .
the road they took to reach the shooting range , and the range itself , were known as places frequently used by foreign security services .
police authorities were preparing to hold a memorial service for the three men in berlin 's central cathedral , the dom , on saturday .
all of them were between the ages of 30 and 40 .
merkel 's former bodyguard among those killed bild newspaper reported thursday that one of the victims had been a long-serving bodyguard to chancellor angela merkel .
the 31-year-old officer from nuremberg had planned to return to duties guarding merkel in december after a stint in the german embassy in kabul , the paper wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the men killed worked for the german embassy the officers , all of whom worked as security staff for the embassy , were the first german police to die in afghanistan since the beginning of germany 's mandate there . the deaths brought to 24 the number of germans who have been killed in afghanistan since german troops joined the nato-led international security assisstance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in 2001 .

the chancellor 's not alone in her interest in the arctic : ever more states are attracted by the region 's resources . german chancellor angela merkel heads to greenland on thursday for a two-day visit with danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen .
the two politicians will ply the ilulissat fjord , over 300 kilometers -lrb- 186 miles -rrb- above the arctic circle , where one of the world 's biggest glaciers is gradually melting .
global warming is especially evident on the danish island , where the temperatures have been increasing twice as quickly as the world average .
" it 's good that a german chancellor examines the issues of climate change where its effects are especially easy to recognize , " said german climate expert peter lemke .
" politicians should also see for themselves where and how climate change occurs . "
merkel 's not the first politician to visit the spot .
she follows in the footsteps of italian prime minister romano prodi , european commission chief jose manuel barroso , nancy pelosi , speaker of the us house of representatives , and presidential candidate john mccain .
international interest and the region has n't only drawn attention due to growing concern about climate change .
the arctic is believed to be rich in resources .
however , until the ice started to melt , they were inaccessible .
climate researchers now say that the arctic could be ice-free by the summer of 2040 .
shipping is likely to take off , and it may then be affordable to excavate the gas and oil thought to be buried there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the russians will have to do more to cement their claims in early august , russian researchers planted a rust-free titanium russian flag on the ocean floor beneath the north pole to mark their country 's claim to the area .
denmark has also sent an arctic mission to back up its claims to the region .
and canadian premier stephen harper announced plans last week to establish a deep-sea port and a military base in the arctic .
a study by the us geological survey estimates the arctic has as much as 25 percent of the world 's undiscovered oil and gas .
but some say that 's just speculation .
geophysicist wilfried jodak of germany 's alfred wegener institute for polar and marine research -lrb- awi -rrb- is one of the skeptics .
the geo-scientific data from the area north of the arctic circle was too meager to identify any deposits , he said .
claims deadline looms " arctic research is expensive and was so unattractive until a few years ago , that hardly any public means were provided for research , " he said , adding that expanding territorial claims had not previously been a factor at all .
" the russians got that rolling . "
moscow is in a hurry to prove that the lomonosov ridge in the northern arctic ocean is a continuation of the russian mainland .
the 1982 un convention on law of the sea allows states to use the waters up to 200 sea miles -lrb- 370 kilometers -rrb- off their coasts as economic areas .
those governments that want to make further claims must submit requests to the un by may 2009 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arctic could be ice-free by 2040 any state missing the 2009 deadline risks losing un recognition of the claim .
countries that have not yet ratifed the law of the sea convention , including the united states , are not bound by the 2009 deadline .
the arctic push is a result of this deadline , according to jodak of the awi : " so that the claims have been resolved if at some point it turns out that there really are rich resource deposits in the northern arctic . "
shared heritage ?
thus , the clock is ticking for russia , denmark and canada , all of which view themselves as having the ultimate claim to the arctic sea .
" the arctic does n't belong to any state alone , " said moscow sea expert anatoly kolodkin of the un 's international tribunal of the law of the sea .
the arctic sea was part of " man 's common heritage , " he said , adding that the issue was , nevertheless , about who had the rights to explore and develop the resources there . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the chancellor 's not alone in her interest in the arctic : ever more states are attracted by the region 's resources . german chancellor angela merkel heads to greenland on thursday for a two-day visit with danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen .
the two politicians will ply the ilulissat fjord , over 300 kilometers -lrb- 186 miles -rrb- above the arctic circle , where one of the world 's biggest glaciers is gradually melting .
global warming is especially evident on the danish island , where the temperatures have been increasing twice as quickly as the world average .
" it 's good that a german chancellor examines the issues of climate change where its effects are especially easy to recognize , " said german climate expert peter lemke .
" politicians should also see for themselves where and how climate change occurs . "
merkel 's not the first politician to visit the spot .
she follows in the footsteps of italian prime minister romano prodi , european commission chief jose manuel barroso , nancy pelosi , speaker of the us house of representatives , and presidential candidate john mccain .
international interest and the region has n't only drawn attention due to growing concern about climate change .
the arctic is believed to be rich in resources .
however , until the ice started to melt , they were inaccessible .
climate researchers now say that the arctic could be ice-free by the summer of 2040 .
shipping is likely to take off , and it may then be affordable to excavate the gas and oil thought to be buried there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the russians will have to do more to cement their claims in early august , russian researchers planted a rust-free titanium russian flag on the ocean floor beneath the north pole to mark their country 's claim to the area .
denmark has also sent an arctic mission to back up its claims to the region .
and canadian premier stephen harper announced plans last week to establish a deep-sea port and a military base in the arctic .
a study by the us geological survey estimates the arctic has as much as 25 percent of the world 's undiscovered oil and gas .
but some say that 's just speculation .
geophysicist wilfried jodak of germany 's alfred wegener institute for polar and marine research -lrb- awi -rrb- is one of the skeptics .
the geo-scientific data from the area north of the arctic circle was too meager to identify any deposits , he said .
claims deadline looms " arctic research is expensive and was so unattractive until a few years ago , that hardly any public means were provided for research , " he said , adding that expanding territorial claims had not previously been a factor at all .
" the russians got that rolling . "
moscow is in a hurry to prove that the lomonosov ridge in the northern arctic ocean is a continuation of the russian mainland .
the 1982 un convention on law of the sea allows states to use the waters up to 200 sea miles -lrb- 370 kilometers -rrb- off their coasts as economic areas .
those governments that want to make further claims must submit requests to the un by may 2009 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arctic could be ice-free by 2040 any state missing the 2009 deadline risks losing un recognition of the claim .
countries that have not yet ratifed the law of the sea convention , including the united states , are not bound by the 2009 deadline .
the arctic push is a result of this deadline , according to jodak of the awi : " so that the claims have been resolved if at some point it turns out that there really are rich resource deposits in the northern arctic . "
shared heritage ?
thus , the clock is ticking for russia , denmark and canada , all of which view themselves as having the ultimate claim to the arctic sea .
" the arctic does n't belong to any state alone , " said moscow sea expert anatoly kolodkin of the un 's international tribunal of the law of the sea .
the arctic sea was part of " man 's common heritage , " he said , adding that the issue was , nevertheless , about who had the rights to explore and develop the resources there . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many young people reject their elders ' political claims for compensation but embrace their cultural roots . there is likely to be a generational divide when german expellees and their families commemorate tag der heimat or day of the homeland on saturday .
represented in large part by the league of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , a controversial group that lobbies and seeks compensation for ethnic germans and their descendants , the aging expellees themselves reflect on the injustices that occurred as the third reich crumbled and millions of ethnic germans were expelled from their homelands in eastern europe .
younger people , on the other hand , said they will be paying more attention to their cultural heritage .
leaving controversy behind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can expellee groups keep young people interested ?
for 17-year-old veronika moll , the day of remembrance is not about international relations but about dancing .
moll , a high school student in munich , is part of a silesian folk dancing group that performs at events like tag der heimat , as well as at her hometown 's famous oktoberfest .
she also takes part in conferences about expellee issues and other cultural activities .
both of moll 's grandmothers were expelled from silesia , in southwestern poland , at the end of world war ii .
while some people of the older generation feel silesia belongs to them , moll said she does n't feel that way at all . although she still feels special ties to silesia , munich is home .
" it 's simply not the situation that you can go back to silesia , " she said .
" it 's too long ago .
it 's important to not forget the history and to make sure that everyone knows what happened and that an injustice occurred .
but you ca n't displace all of the polish or other people who have lived in these houses or on this land for 60 years . "
youth groups focus on future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the average age for many groups is getting older this type of attitude is typical among the descendants of expellees , said thomas hoffmann , who heads the organization german youth in europe .
while the first generation of expellees dreamed of returning home , their grandchildren are uninterested in going back , hoffmann said .
the first part of german youth in europe 's harkens back to its foundation in 1951 as a group to fight for the rights of german expellee youths .
over the years it has evolved into a more progressive organization which promotes reconciliation and integration .
the group has approximately 90,000 members .
janna keberlein , a member of the youth organization and 28-year-old student at the university of düsseldorf , said that while her ethnic german grandparents still get angry about being deported from the volga region to kazakhstan during the war , she thinks the issue needs to be closed .
" young people do n't have to be drawn into this history of suffering , " the 28-year-old düsseldorf university student said , adding that she has no interest in being politically involved in the league of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- .
a taboo subject bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the silesian traditions remain important to some youth for many young people , the bdv focuses too much on the past , a fact seen in the graying of the organization , said alfred de zayas , a leading scholar on germen expellees .
when he gives talks to expellee groups , the average age is usually 60 , he said .
de zayas served for years as a lawyer for the united nations high commissioner for human rights .
he is currently a professor of international law at the geneva school of diplomacy .
he wrote the first scholarly work on german expellees to appear in english , breaking what had long been a taboo topic .
the post-war expulsions were the largest forced movement of europeans in the 20th century .
historians estimate that between 12 and 15 million people were expelled during the forced migrations .
finding an interest in cultural heritage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expellees on the road to germany de zayas ' books have been controversial in germany because he feels expellees have legal rights to reclaim lost property .
but that 's a claim he said he doubts younger generations will pursue as most are simply not interested in the debate 's political dimensions .
instead young people from expellee backgrounds are only just now becoming interested in their cultural heritage to find out more about themselves , de zayas said , adding that he expects that interest to grow .
" it 's important for your identity that you know where you come from , " de zayas said .

many young people reject their elders ' political claims for compensation but embrace their cultural roots . there is likely to be a generational divide when german expellees and their families commemorate tag der heimat or day of the homeland on saturday .
represented in large part by the league of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , a controversial group that lobbies and seeks compensation for ethnic germans and their descendants , the aging expellees themselves reflect on the injustices that occurred as the third reich crumbled and millions of ethnic germans were expelled from their homelands in eastern europe .
younger people , on the other hand , said they will be paying more attention to their cultural heritage .
leaving controversy behind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can expellee groups keep young people interested ?
for 17-year-old veronika moll , the day of remembrance is not about international relations but about dancing .
moll , a high school student in munich , is part of a silesian folk dancing group that performs at events like tag der heimat , as well as at her hometown 's famous oktoberfest .
she also takes part in conferences about expellee issues and other cultural activities .
both of moll 's grandmothers were expelled from silesia , in southwestern poland , at the end of world war ii .
while some people of the older generation feel silesia belongs to them , moll said she does n't feel that way at all . although she still feels special ties to silesia , munich is home .
" it 's simply not the situation that you can go back to silesia , " she said .
" it 's too long ago .
it 's important to not forget the history and to make sure that everyone knows what happened and that an injustice occurred .
but you ca n't displace all of the polish or other people who have lived in these houses or on this land for 60 years . "
youth groups focus on future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the average age for many groups is getting older this type of attitude is typical among the descendants of expellees , said thomas hoffmann , who heads the organization german youth in europe .
while the first generation of expellees dreamed of returning home , their grandchildren are uninterested in going back , hoffmann said .
the first part of german youth in europe 's harkens back to its foundation in 1951 as a group to fight for the rights of german expellee youths .
over the years it has evolved into a more progressive organization which promotes reconciliation and integration .
the group has approximately 90,000 members .
janna keberlein , a member of the youth organization and 28-year-old student at the university of düsseldorf , said that while her ethnic german grandparents still get angry about being deported from the volga region to kazakhstan during the war , she thinks the issue needs to be closed .
" young people do n't have to be drawn into this history of suffering , " the 28-year-old düsseldorf university student said , adding that she has no interest in being politically involved in the league of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- .

when he gives talks to expellee groups , the average age is usually 60 , he said .
de zayas served for years as a lawyer for the united nations high commissioner for human rights .
he is currently a professor of international law at the geneva school of diplomacy .
he wrote the first scholarly work on german expellees to appear in english , breaking what had long been a taboo topic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de architecture -pipe- 16.08.2007 cologne cathedral is a picture of heaven , says its master builder großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the sheer size of the cathedral that many find impressive barbara schock-werner , a respected architect and art historian , is the first woman to become master builder of a german cathedral .
she knows every crook and cranny of germany 's favorite landmark . dw : what is the allure of the cologne cathedral in your opinion ? barbara schock-werner : there are two things : the first is the building itself , its size , its perfection and its beauty .
but it 's also the visitor-friendly management that ’ s behind it .
for example , there 's no entry fee - it 's a church and everyone 's welcome .
we have very long opening hours , from 6:00 am to 7:30 pm .
and we make a large effort to have friendly management , group tours , not too many tours at the same time , etc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the sheer size of the cathedral that many find impressive what about the building itself attracts people ? the overwhelming space .
go in , sit down - and your heart rises .
it 's something that really has an effect on your body and soul .
you have imagine that the people in the middle ages lived in much smaller spaces and they were n't used to theaters and cinemas , which are matter-of-fact for us today .
for them it must have seemed even bigger . the purpose behind the building was less to glorify the archbishop of cologne and much more an effort to give the christians a picture of heaven .
when you take your time , sit down and take in the building , you can experience that today as well . many people ask why the cathedral constantly seems to be under construction .
what do you say to that ? all historical buildings have to be taken care of if they are to be preserved .
the gothic ones are unfortunately the most fragile because their surfaces are so complicated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cathedral 's towers are about 157 meters -lrb- 515 feet -rrb- tall the cathedral building foundation and cathedral workshop , which i have overseen since 1999 , are there to manage the preservation of the church .
these incorporate a staff of 80 people .
thirty of these are craftspeople , including stonemasons , scaffold makers , roofers , locksmiths , carpenters , blacksmiths , electricians and painters . the cathedral has 8,000 square meters -lrb- about 86,000 square feet -rrb- of historical glass windows and we have our own glass restoration workshop with 10 staff members .
underneath the cathedral there is an archaeological dig going on and we also have a small team of archaeologists .
i 'm also in charge of the treasure chamber , the library and the administrators . what 's your annual budget ? between six and seven million euros -lrb- between eight and 9.4 million dollars -rrb- a year .
that mostly goes for the staff .
but the staff is the guarantee that the cathedral will be preserved .
they know every crack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steam engines so near to the cathedral damaged its facade , said schock-werner why is the cologne cathedral so black ? weathering of the stone began around the middle of the 19th century when the majority of the population began heating with coal .
before that , the poor people heated with wood and nothing happened .
but when everyone started heating with coal , the sulphur content in the air increased dramatically .
that happened in all cities . in cologne , in addition , train tracks were laid in direct proximity to the cathedral and for nearly 100 years steam engines drove by the cathedral every day and blew their smoke on the building .
that 's why the damage to the stone is greater here than in other places .
add to that the brown coal power plants in the western part of the city . today , there are n't any steam engines any more , the power plants have been moved and practically no one has individual heating since the whole city uses district heating .
the air today is much better and we can be sure that what we replace now will last longer . the renowned german artist gerhard richter recently completed a new stained glass window for the south wing of the cathedral that will be unveiled later this month .
why was gerhard richter chosen for the job ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard richter 's stained glass window consists of 11,250 squares of color in the field of contemporary glass painting , i could n't find a solution to the window that fit the cathedral 's status .
i had n't initially thought of richter for the project , because he 's not generally associated with glass windows .
but then we met at a reception and suddenly i thought , gerhard richter must be able to do it .
he has a relationship to the catholic church , he lives in cologne , and he 's worked both representationally and ornamentally .
he 's extremely sensitive and his work is of an incredibly high quality .
i asked him , he said yes and now we 've been working on the project for five years .
we 're very pleased that it 's nearly completed . legend has it that the cathedral was n't destroyed during world war two .
is this true ? no , that 's one of the cathedral 's pious legends .
the fact is , it was hit hard 14 times and suffered heavy damages but stayed standing .
that must have been an incredible symbol for the people .
they came out of their basements and shelters and the cathedral was still standing , even though the rest of the city had been flattened . what 's it like to be a woman in your job ? i had the better qualifications .
i am an architect and an art historian and that ’ s why they chose me .
i 'm the first woman with my special title , but i 'm not the first woman doing this job .
there are women in similar positions at the churches in ulm , freiburg , strasbourg , nuremberg and magdeburg , but they have different titles . my predecessor was quite respected in his position and i think it was easier for a woman to follow him than for a man , because we were n't in direct competition . bildunterschrift : cologne 's greatest landmark was constructed over six centuries click on the link below to read what visitors had to say about the cologne cathedral . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the chancellor 's not alone in her interest in the arctic : ever more states are attracted by the region 's resources . german chancellor angela merkel heads to greenland on thursday for a two-day visit with danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen .
the two politicians will ply the ilulissat fjord , over 300 kilometers -lrb- 186 miles -rrb- above the arctic circle , where one of the world 's biggest glaciers is gradually melting .

politicians have called for a new effort to educate young people about the true nature of east germany after recently surfaced shoot-to-kill orders have rekindled a debate about conditions in the communist country . volker kauder , the parliamentary leader for germany 's governing christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , told the berliner zeitung on thursday that his party would take steps to raise awareness about eastern germany 's communist past . " we have worked enormously hard to deal with the past of the third reich 's terror system and continue to do so , but we 've done much too little when it comes to dealing with the gdr dictatorship , " he said .
" when looking at the alarming lack of knowledge about the gdr past among the younger generation , we should use the current debate to clarify who was responsible . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonners may be surprised to learn that some think the former west german capital was in the gdr on wednesday , germany 's mass tabloid bild had asked young germans what they knew about the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- .
while some said that east germans were n't allowed to travel , others pointed out that there was a high level of unemployment , that people liked to bathe in the nude and that no one was able to buy fashionable clothes .
one 22-year-old man said that bonn served as the gdr 's capital .
" hitler was the boss and he had a wall build around his empire , " he added . second document found the current debate surrounding life in the gdr was sparked by a shoot-to-kill order that resurfaced over the weekend .
it called on members of the east german secret police , the stasi , to use their weapons to prevent people from fleeing across the german-german border , even if women and children were involved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stasi file agency head marianne birthler is feeling the heat the federal agency that administers the stasi files came under pressure for presenting the document as a sensational find after it became obvious that the order had been known to researchers and state prosecutors for years .
on wednesday , agency officials uncovered a similar document .
unlike the first one , however , it was signed by a high-ranking stasi official , making it potentially more significant for a criminal investigation .
a legal expert said that the second document might have led to different rulings in previous border shooting trials , where guards , who claimed that they had acted in self-defense , were acquitted . " but it 's unlikely that the cases will be reopened now , " ferdinand von schirach , who defended a top-level gdr official in the 1990s , told dw-world.de. agency under pressure the stasi file agency 's head , marianne birthler , has faced intense pressure in recent days for her handling of the situation , with some saying that she is trying to prevent the swift dismantling of her office and the transfer of the stasi files into germany 's federal archives .
birthler has suggested the year 2019 for such a merger .
members of the opposition free-market liberal free democrats and the cdu 's junior coalition partner , the social democrats , have called for quick reforms of the birthler agency as a result of the recent developments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the files will eventually be transferred to the federal archives wolfgang böhmer , the state premier of saxony-anhalt , where the first shoot-to-kill order was found , said he saw a continued need to research the stasi files .
" the fact that a belittlement and minimization of the gdr 's problems can be seen in the public justifies further research and public debate about what happened , " böhmer told the german press agency dpa , adding that the he saw no need to rush a merger of the stasi agency with the federal archives . kauder agreed and added that a merger could be initiated during the next legislative period , which is likely to start in 2009 . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

its museums are now worried that a new directive from russia 's culture ministry will make it tougher to track down the works . tucked away in the secret vaults of russian museums are a number of priceless works of art that germany says belong to it . the country 's museum directors believe that about 180,000 works taken from collections in berlin are in russia and poland .
the hague convention regulating wars on land requires art treasures seized by occupying forces to be returned .
but germany has had limited success in regaining such trophy art , and museum directors fear russia may be making it even more difficult since the country 's culture ministry purportedly issued a directive that calls for the creation of new inventory lists of everything that 's been stored in secret depots so far .
" the russian government is rewriting inventories because it wants to incorporate these items permanently in its own collections , " said klaus-dieter lehmann , head of the prussian cultural heritage foundation .
he said it would make it much harder to track works that were once looted from germany .
but contradictory reports have been commonplace in the decades-long dispute over art looted by the soviets during world war ii .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dürer 's drawing is again part of bremen 's city collection russian officials say they have dealt with the issue with transparency .
moscow historical museum 's deputy director , vadim leonidovitsch yegorov , denied the existence of a directive to rewrite russia 's inventories .
" i think negative people have thought it up so they can present russian researchers and museum people as greedy and miserly and not only restricting access to their own , but also to other people 's treasures , " he said .
spoils of war ?
in 1990 , germany and the soviet union expressly committed themselves to returning art objects that had been looted during the war .
but just a few years later , the russian government declared that artworks taken from germany were russian property .
" we ca n't give them back to germany , " said yegorov .
" because back then germany did n't respect russia and russian art treasures ; it treated them barbarically . "
one of the main bones of contention is the baldin collection .
bremen 's city art museum has demanded the return of the works by dürer , rembrandt and van gogh .
germany cites international law as well as the german-soviet agreement .
but the russians have remained intransigent on the issue .
" we are keeping it as part of a world cultural heritage that should be accessible to all , to researchers from all countries and the entire world , " yegorov said .
barrier to cooperation germany , however , refuses to accept that position .
and the dispute over looted art has become a hindrance to working with russian institutions , said lehmann of the prussian cultural heritage foundation .
" we are simply interested in cooperating with the russians in matters of art and culture , and this unresolved issue of looted art always gets in the way , " he said .
bildunterschrift : russian museums showed objects from the merovingian era that had been thought lost still , russian and german institutions have managed to work together on some research and exhibitions .
german museums regarded as a milestone this spring 's joint german-russian merovingian exhibition shown in moscow and st. petersburg which displayed objects art experts had considered lost .
meanwhile , the germans have demanded russia finally open its secret depots .
berlin 's museums have been drawing up new lists of lost artworks - partly in the hope that colleagues who gain access to the russian depots can pass on information .
and their efforts have already borne fruit , according to berlin 's museum of decorative arts .
" the catalogue of losses to the sculpture collection was only published a few weeks ago , and , despite everything , we have already been able to identify one of the objects in one of the russian depots in moscow , " the museum 's deputy director , lothar lambacher , said .
tit-for-tat but the real issue is getting negotiations over the return of looted art back on track .
berlin 's museum directors have received some backing from political quarters in calling for germany to stand up for its rights vis-a-vis the russian museums and government .
bildunterschrift : the merovingian show was an eye-opener for german art experts " for a while , the russian government seemed quite willing to discuss returning the works , " said steffen reiche , a member of the german parliament 's culture commission . "
then the russian parliament , the duma , put a stop to that .
and so here the german parliament should take a stance that is just as clear as the russian parliament 's position . " dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

politicians have called for a new effort to educate young people about the true nature of east germany after recently surfaced shoot-to-kill orders have rekindled a debate about conditions in the communist country . volker kauder , the parliamentary leader for germany 's governing christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , told the berliner zeitung on thursday that his party would take steps to raise awareness about eastern germany 's communist past . " we have worked enormously hard to deal with the past of the third reich 's terror system and continue to do so , but we 've done much too little when it comes to dealing with the gdr dictatorship , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 16.08.2007 opinion : it 's time to review germany 's afghan mission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : following the murder of three police officers in afghanistan , germany 's government should heed criticism of its reconstruction efforts in the country and pause to figure out how to proceed , says dw 's nina werkhäuser . whenever germans are murdered in afghanistan , politicians unload a bag of reassurances : they say that it 's tragic and sad , but certainly no reason to reduce germany 's mission in afghanistan . # b # despite the fact that - in addition to the three police officers - a german aid worker , a german businessman and three german soldiers have already been murdered in afghanistan this year , the federal government has not wasted a single thought on coming up with an exit strategy .
quite to the contrary : the costly deployment of tornado reconnaissance jets was added this year and an expansion of training afghan security personnel is under consideration .
by doing so , the government is avoiding an important question : what price are we ready to pay fort he reconstruction of afghanistan ?
this question gets even more explosive as it becomes clearer that influential forces in afghanistan are not interested in a stabilization of the country and fight this with all their might .
that 's a fundamental difference to what 's happening in other countries , where germany sends soldiers or aid workers .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the fact that - in addition to the three police officers - a german aid worker , a german businessman and three german soldiers have already been murdered in afghanistan this year , the federal government has not wasted a single thought on coming up with an exit strategy .
quite to the contrary : the costly deployment of tornado reconnaissance jets was added this year and an expansion of training afghan security personnel is under consideration .
by doing so , the government is avoiding an important question : what price are we ready to pay fort he reconstruction of afghanistan ?
this question gets even more explosive as it becomes clearer that influential forces in afghanistan are not interested in a stabilization of the country and fight this with all their might .
that 's a fundamental difference to what 's happening in other countries , where germany sends soldiers or aid workers .
it 's expensive and it costs a lot of lives to try and bring peace to afghanistan when the taliban are fighting it .
the murder of three police officers who guarded the german embassy in kabul shows that the perpetrators are now directly targeting the government .
it 's safe to assume that the taliban are trying to influence the political debate in germany as all three afghanistan mandates for the german military are up for renewal the fall .
of course it would be wrong to bend one 's knees because of the taliban 's terror .
but this argument must not be used to brush off justified doubts regarding the international reconstruction effort .
the afghan government bears some of the responsibility for the fact that not enough was accomplished during the past five years .
but the many tens of thousands of foreign soldiers and aid workers have also , in part , acted incorrectly and without coordination .
precious time and resources have been wasted as a result .
the german government has so far failed to honestly weigh the mission 's chances and risks .
while surveys show that a majority of germans is now against the deployment of more than 3,000 soldiers in afghanistan , most politicians continue to preach that it 's necessary to endure .
but following the murder of three german police officers , the government should no longer stall a factual discussion .
as long as every german in afghanistan has to fear for his life , reconstruction efforts ca n't be effective , anyway .

many young people reject their elders ' political claims for compensation but embrace their cultural roots . there is likely to be a generational divide when german expellees and their families commemorate tag der heimat or day of the homeland on saturday .
represented in large part by the league of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , a controversial group that lobbies and seeks compensation for ethnic germans and their descendants , the aging expellees themselves reflect on the injustices that occurred as the third reich crumbled and millions of ethnic germans were expelled from their homelands in eastern europe .
younger people , on the other hand , said they will be paying more attention to their cultural heritage .
leaving controversy behind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can expellee groups keep young people interested ?
for 17-year-old veronika moll , the day of remembrance is not about international relations but about dancing .
moll , a high school student in munich , is part of a silesian folk dancing group that performs at events like tag der heimat , as well as at her hometown 's famous oktoberfest .
she also takes part in conferences about expellee issues and other cultural activities .
both of moll 's grandmothers were expelled from silesia , in southwestern poland , at the end of world war ii .
while some people of the older generation feel silesia belongs to them , moll said she does n't feel that way at all . although she still feels special ties to silesia , munich is home .
" it 's simply not the situation that you can go back to silesia , " she said .
" it 's too long ago .
it 's important to not forget the history and to make sure that everyone knows what happened and that an injustice occurred .
but you ca n't displace all of the polish or other people who have lived in these houses or on this land for 60 years . "
youth groups focus on future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the average age for many groups is getting older this type of attitude is typical among the descendants of expellees , said thomas hoffmann , who heads the organization german youth in europe .
while the first generation of expellees dreamed of returning home , their grandchildren are uninterested in going back , hoffmann said .
the first part of german youth in europe 's harkens back to its foundation in 1951 as a group to fight for the rights of german expellee youths .
over the years it has evolved into a more progressive organization which promotes reconciliation and integration .
the group has approximately 90,000 members .
janna keberlein , a member of the youth organization and 28-year-old student at the university of düsseldorf , said that while her ethnic german grandparents still get angry about being deported from the volga region to kazakhstan during the war , she thinks the issue needs to be closed .
" young people do n't have to be drawn into this history of suffering , " the 28-year-old düsseldorf university student said , adding that she has no interest in being politically involved in the league of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- .
a taboo subject bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the silesian traditions remain important to some youth for many young people , the bdv focuses too much on the past , a fact seen in the graying of the organization , said alfred de zayas , a leading scholar on germen expellees .
when he gives talks to expellee groups , the average age is usually 60 , he said .
de zayas served for years as a lawyer for the united nations high commissioner for human rights .
he is currently a professor of international law at the geneva school of diplomacy .
he wrote the first scholarly work on german expellees to appear in english , breaking what had long been a taboo topic .
the post-war expulsions were the largest forced movement of europeans in the 20th century .
historians estimate that between 12 and 15 million people were expelled during the forced migrations .
finding an interest in cultural heritage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expellees on the road to germany de zayas ' books have been controversial in germany because he feels expellees have legal rights to reclaim lost property .
but that 's a claim he said he doubts younger generations will pursue as most are simply not interested in the debate 's political dimensions .
instead young people from expellee backgrounds are only just now becoming interested in their cultural heritage to find out more about themselves , de zayas said , adding that he expects that interest to grow .

" this is a tragic case , but we must assume that it will be repeated , " gdp chairman konrad freiberg said in the daily hannoversche allgemeine zeitung .
" we are in the sights of the taliban and other islamist terrorist organizations . "
three german police officers responsible for protecting the german ambassador to afghanistan died and a fourth was injured when their vehicles were blown up on a road to the east of kabul on wednesday .
freiberg said terrorists were aiming to influence germany 's decision on whether to renew its deployment of german military and police in afghanistan , which parliament will consider in the coming months .
tanks for police ?
freiberg disagreed with proposals from the rival german police union , the dpolg , to outfit police in afghanistan with military equipment . dpolg chief wolfgang speck had called for them to be provided with tanks , armored vehicles and equipment to jam remote signals that could detonate bombs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police are helping to train their afghan colleagues " we do not want the police to be militarized , " freiberg said .
but he said security arrangements for the police should be reviewed .
the calls for reviewing the measures taken to protect german troops and officials in afghanistan were backed up by politicians from merkel 's christian democratic party and the opposition green party .
there was a broad consensus not to allow such attacks to influence germany 's commitment to afghanistan , deputy foreign minister gernot erler , a social democrat , said of the bombing .

the road they took to reach the shooting range , and the range itself , were known as places frequently used by foreign security services .
police authorities were preparing to hold a memorial service for the three men in berlin 's central cathedral , the dom , on saturday .
all of them were between the ages of 30 and 40 .
merkel 's former bodyguard among those killed bild newspaper reported thursday that one of the victims had been a long-serving bodyguard to chancellor angela merkel .
the 31-year-old officer from nuremberg had planned to return to duties guarding merkel in december after a stint in the german embassy in kabul , the paper wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the men killed worked for the german embassy the officers , all of whom worked as security staff for the embassy , were the first german police to die in afghanistan since the beginning of germany 's mandate there . the deaths brought to 24 the number of germans who have been killed in afghanistan since german troops joined the nato-led international security assisstance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in 2001 .
some 3,000 german troops are engaged in reconstruction in northern afghanistan as part of the isaf . german politicians have vowed to continue with their peacekeeping mission in afghanistan despite the latest attacks .
german defense minister franz josef jung said on thursday , the taliban were trying to sway political debate by " underhanded , one-sided attacks . "

" this is a tragic case , but we must assume that it will be repeated , " gdp chairman konrad freiberg said in the daily hannoversche allgemeine zeitung .
" we are in the sights of the taliban and other islamist terrorist organizations . "
three german police officers responsible for protecting the german ambassador to afghanistan died and a fourth was injured when their vehicles were blown up on a road to the east of kabul on wednesday .
freiberg said terrorists were aiming to influence germany 's decision on whether to renew its deployment of german military and police in afghanistan , which parliament will consider in the coming months .
tanks for police ?
freiberg disagreed with proposals from the rival german police union , the dpolg , to outfit police in afghanistan with military equipment . dpolg chief wolfgang speck had called for them to be provided with tanks , armored vehicles and equipment to jam remote signals that could detonate bombs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police are helping to train their afghan colleagues " we do not want the police to be militarized , " freiberg said .
but he said security arrangements for the police should be reviewed .
the calls for reviewing the measures taken to protect german troops and officials in afghanistan were backed up by politicians from merkel 's christian democratic party and the opposition green party .
there was a broad consensus not to allow such attacks to influence germany 's commitment to afghanistan , deputy foreign minister gernot erler , a social democrat , said of the bombing .
germans not necessarily targeted contrary to initial reports from the afghan police , the slain germans ' all-terrain vehicles were not marked with any national emblems , such as flags , ard television said .
thus , it was unlikely the attacks were intended to hit germans in particular .
the four had been driving to a training session when the bomb exploded .
the road they took to reach the shooting range , and the range itself , were known as places frequently used by foreign security services .
police authorities were preparing to hold a memorial service for the three men in berlin 's central cathedral , the dom , on saturday .
all of them were between the ages of 30 and 40 .

she knows every crook and cranny of germany 's favorite landmark . dw : what is the allure of the cologne cathedral in your opinion ? barbara schock-werner : there are two things : the first is the building itself , its size , its perfection and its beauty .
but it 's also the visitor-friendly management that ’ s behind it .
for example , there 's no entry fee - it 's a church and everyone 's welcome .
we have very long opening hours , from 6:00 am to 7:30 pm .
and we make a large effort to have friendly management , group tours , not too many tours at the same time , etc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the sheer size of the cathedral that many find impressive what about the building itself attracts people ? the overwhelming space .
go in , sit down - and your heart rises .
it 's something that really has an effect on your body and soul .
you have imagine that the people in the middle ages lived in much smaller spaces and they were n't used to theaters and cinemas , which are matter-of-fact for us today .
for them it must have seemed even bigger . the purpose behind the building was less to glorify the archbishop of cologne and much more an effort to give the christians a picture of heaven .
when you take your time , sit down and take in the building , you can experience that today as well . many people ask why the cathedral constantly seems to be under construction .
what do you say to that ? all historical buildings have to be taken care of if they are to be preserved .
the gothic ones are unfortunately the most fragile because their surfaces are so complicated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cathedral 's towers are about 157 meters -lrb- 515 feet -rrb- tall the cathedral building foundation and cathedral workshop , which i have overseen since 1999 , are there to manage the preservation of the church .
these incorporate a staff of 80 people .
thirty of these are craftspeople , including stonemasons , scaffold makers , roofers , locksmiths , carpenters , blacksmiths , electricians and painters . the cathedral has 8,000 square meters -lrb- about 86,000 square feet -rrb- of historical glass windows and we have our own glass restoration workshop with 10 staff members .
underneath the cathedral there is an archaeological dig going on and we also have a small team of archaeologists .
i 'm also in charge of the treasure chamber , the library and the administrators . what 's your annual budget ? between six and seven million euros -lrb- between eight and 9.4 million dollars -rrb- a year .
that mostly goes for the staff .
but the staff is the guarantee that the cathedral will be preserved .
they know every crack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steam engines so near to the cathedral damaged its facade , said schock-werner why is the cologne cathedral so black ? weathering of the stone began around the middle of the 19th century when the majority of the population began heating with coal .
before that , the poor people heated with wood and nothing happened .
but when everyone started heating with coal , the sulphur content in the air increased dramatically .
that happened in all cities . in cologne , in addition , train tracks were laid in direct proximity to the cathedral and for nearly 100 years steam engines drove by the cathedral every day and blew their smoke on the building .
that 's why the damage to the stone is greater here than in other places .
add to that the brown coal power plants in the western part of the city . today , there are n't any steam engines any more , the power plants have been moved and practically no one has individual heating since the whole city uses district heating .
the air today is much better and we can be sure that what we replace now will last longer . the renowned german artist gerhard richter recently completed a new stained glass window for the south wing of the cathedral that will be unveiled later this month .
why was gerhard richter chosen for the job ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard richter 's stained glass window consists of 11,250 squares of color in the field of contemporary glass painting , i could n't find a solution to the window that fit the cathedral 's status .
i had n't initially thought of richter for the project , because he 's not generally associated with glass windows .
but then we met at a reception and suddenly i thought , gerhard richter must be able to do it .
he has a relationship to the catholic church , he lives in cologne , and he 's worked both representationally and ornamentally .
he 's extremely sensitive and his work is of an incredibly high quality .
i asked him , he said yes and now we 've been working on the project for five years .
we 're very pleased that it 's nearly completed . legend has it that the cathedral was n't destroyed during world war two .
is this true ? no , that 's one of the cathedral 's pious legends .
the fact is , it was hit hard 14 times and suffered heavy damages but stayed standing .
that must have been an incredible symbol for the people .
they came out of their basements and shelters and the cathedral was still standing , even though the rest of the city had been flattened . what 's it like to be a woman in your job ? i had the better qualifications .
i am an architect and an art historian and that ’ s why they chose me .
i 'm the first woman with my special title , but i 'm not the first woman doing this job .
there are women in similar positions at the churches in ulm , freiburg , strasbourg , nuremberg and magdeburg , but they have different titles . my predecessor was quite respected in his position and i think it was easier for a woman to follow him than for a man , because we were n't in direct competition . bildunterschrift : cologne 's greatest landmark was constructed over six centuries click on the link below to read what visitors had to say about the cologne cathedral . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 16.08.2007 opinion : it 's time to review germany 's afghan mission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : following the murder of three police officers in afghanistan , germany 's government should heed criticism of its reconstruction efforts in the country and pause to figure out how to proceed , says dw 's nina werkhäuser . whenever germans are murdered in afghanistan , politicians unload a bag of reassurances : they say that it 's tragic and sad , but certainly no reason to reduce germany 's mission in afghanistan . # b # despite the fact that - in addition to the three police officers - a german aid worker , a german businessman and three german soldiers have already been murdered in afghanistan this year , the federal government has not wasted a single thought on coming up with an exit strategy .
quite to the contrary : the costly deployment of tornado reconnaissance jets was added this year and an expansion of training afghan security personnel is under consideration .
by doing so , the government is avoiding an important question : what price are we ready to pay fort he reconstruction of afghanistan ?
this question gets even more explosive as it becomes clearer that influential forces in afghanistan are not interested in a stabilization of the country and fight this with all their might .
that 's a fundamental difference to what 's happening in other countries , where germany sends soldiers or aid workers .
it 's expensive and it costs a lot of lives to try and bring peace to afghanistan when the taliban are fighting it .
the murder of three police officers who guarded the german embassy in kabul shows that the perpetrators are now directly targeting the government .
it 's safe to assume that the taliban are trying to influence the political debate in germany as all three afghanistan mandates for the german military are up for renewal the fall .
of course it would be wrong to bend one 's knees because of the taliban 's terror .
but this argument must not be used to brush off justified doubts regarding the international reconstruction effort .
the afghan government bears some of the responsibility for the fact that not enough was accomplished during the past five years .
but the many tens of thousands of foreign soldiers and aid workers have also , in part , acted incorrectly and without coordination .
precious time and resources have been wasted as a result .
the german government has so far failed to honestly weigh the mission 's chances and risks .
while surveys show that a majority of germans is now against the deployment of more than 3,000 soldiers in afghanistan , most politicians continue to preach that it 's necessary to endure .
but following the murder of three german police officers , the government should no longer stall a factual discussion .
as long as every german in afghanistan has to fear for his life , reconstruction efforts ca n't be effective , anyway .

he spoke to dw about moral courage , discrimination and the media . günter wallraff has been a thorn in the side of german business for decades .
now 64 , the investigative reporter from cologne has made a name for himself trying to expose injustice .
his books have sold millions of copies and been translated into 30 languages .
sweden even created a word in the writer 's name : wallraffa , which means " to expose misconduct from the inside by assuming a role . "
his most recent expose dealt with the travails of people working in german call centers .
he recently courted controversy by proposing to read salman rushdie 's " the satanic verses " in the community center of a cologne mosque .
deutsche welle : what pronouncement about you has annoyed you the most ?
günter wallraff : oh , i 'll have to think about that for a while - there are so many insults .
i 'd say : i insist on certain enmities !
when they start to praise me , i have to ask : have i been taken in ?
when bild-zeitung -lsb- germany 's largest-selling tabloid newspaper , which was the target of his 1977 book " lead story " -rsb- calls me the " pen of evil , " i feel i 've been practically knighted .
when die welt -lsb- newspaper -rsb- now came and started an article with " respect for wallraff " - in connection with my suggestion to hold a discussion of " the satanic verses " in a mosque 's community center - i was slightly bewildered , i asked myself : did i do something wrong ?
for you , it 's also an issue of having the right enemies .
you became famous at a time when the concept of the bad guy was somewhat simpler , in the 1970s and ' 80s .
where are your bogeymen today ?
i do n't have any eternal bogeymen .
i wish they would one day become civilized or democratized .
i believe in the ability to change , not just in people , but also in societal structures .
and even such an inhuman paper as bild-zeitung - which can still be called the central organ of character assassination - could possibly develop differently in another social environment and at least let up with this aggressiveness .
it always has to do with personalities - who 's currently editor in chief ?
so , i do n't have any eternal bogeymen ; i also do n't speak of enemies , i speak of opponents , and such a thing as hatred is totally foreign to me .
i do n't hate anyone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bild is known for its bombastic front page what do you consider to be moral courage ? i think moral courage should be a compulsory subject in the schools instead of certain virtues that have returned to the forefront , such as industriousness , punctuality , etc .
i think that in germany of all places , moral courage should take that place instead , that is , that children should already learn in school to respect other cultures , other ways of life , minorities and also to stand up for them - also if it means taking risks .
that 's why i 'm often in schools - especially in eastern germany .
in the last 10 years , i 've given almost 100 presentations - in places where right-wing radicals are often quite dominant .
here and there , i 've even changed people 's attitudes . " lowest of the low , " the book for which you spent two years disguised as a turkish guest worker , was a huge success in germany in 1985 .
it was , according to one critic , the first time the germans realized that the turks , who were working hard for little money in the country 's factories and being treated like dirt , were real people .
is there now less discrimination against turks and others foreigners in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social standing has replaced origin as a basis if discrimination , wallraff says today it 's not the turks who are at the very bottom of society - it 's the workers from eastern europe : poles , romanians , construction workers who have no rights , who , where we used to earn six , eight deutschmarks -lsb- 3-4 euros -rsb- , now do it for two euros an hour .
every third construction worker is illegal or only partly legal , and they are really treated like commodities , hired and fired according to the situation .
germans are among them , too , no difference is made anymore .
the long-term unemployed , especially from eastern germany , also end up in such crews .
discrimination ca n't necessarily be attributed to an individual 's origins anymore , but to their social standing .
we have already firmly embedded so-called third-world standards in germany . you plan to start working in a factory again soon .
nowadays personal reports have become a standard feature in the media .
there 's no need to glue on a fake beard anymore .
now that anyone can make their own personal experiences public - on youtube , for example - has n't undercover journalism become old hat ? i 've just provided proof of the opposite , to my own astonishment .
the short time i spent in two call centers drew so much public attention to the topic that politicians are now responding and business groups are anxious .
trying it out for yourself has a very different authenticity and force of expression than when you assert something from the outside or even investigate it .
and i think it 's essential for many more people to do it .

steinberg , the author of a recent study on violence in iraq , said he believes a federal solution could help the country move forward peacefully . dw-world.de : what are the conclusions of your study ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido steinberg said a second iraqi civil war in the north was possible guido steinberg : looking at the situation in iraq today , i do n't think that it is that important anymore whether the us security plan in baghdad and central iraq is successful or not .
what i think is important is that the iraqi actors do n't come to terms with each other .
within the next couple of years , i think we will see an escalation of conflict not only in baghdad , but rather in the north and the south of the country : in the north , over the incorporation of the kirkuk into the turkish autonomy zone ; and in the south , over the control of the southern shiite areas .
this is why i think that only a federal solution can smooth this process of breaking off of iraq . some commentators say that it is too late , that iraqis themselves are set into partitioning the country into shiite , sunni and kurdish areas .
are the political differences between these groups fundamentally irreconcilable ? i do n't think that partition is a solution , because there will be no clear cut for the three parts .
the country will totally disintegrate .
i 'd rather see four or five iraq 's emerging .
this is why i think the only hope for us to come to any solution in iraq , in the long term , is a federalization , which might be called soft partition . a referendum is due to take place on the future status of the city of kirkuk , which the kurds regard as kurdish and want to be included in their province , but there is fierce resistance by turkmen and sunnis living there .
how significant is this issue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurds regard the citiy of kirkuk as their own it is extremely significant .
i argue in my study that it might be the most significant topic in the coming months .
what we are witnessing already is an escalation of violence .
it is exactly the territories where kurds , turkmen and arabs live together .
i think this is a deliberant attempt on the part of al qaeda in iraq and other terrorist organizations to provoke a civil war in the north of the country .
i think if the kirkuk issue is not solved between the political parties in baghdad , this second civil war , in the northern part of the country , might take place . the real danger for the rest of the year 2007 and for the year 2008 is for an intervention by the neighbors , because if the conflict escalates in the north of iraq , if the turkmen , for example , are increasingly targeted by the terrorists , it is more likely that the neighbors will try to intervene - if not directly , then indirectly - as iran already does in southern iraq . nathan witkop interviewed guido steinberg -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

steinberg , the author of a recent study on violence in iraq , said he believes a federal solution could help the country move forward peacefully . dw-world.de : what are the conclusions of your study ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido steinberg said a second iraqi civil war in the north was possible guido steinberg : looking at the situation in iraq today , i do n't think that it is that important anymore whether the us security plan in baghdad and central iraq is successful or not .
what i think is important is that the iraqi actors do n't come to terms with each other .
within the next couple of years , i think we will see an escalation of conflict not only in baghdad , but rather in the north and the south of the country : in the north , over the incorporation of the kirkuk into the turkish autonomy zone ; and in the south , over the control of the southern shiite areas .
this is why i think that only a federal solution can smooth this process of breaking off of iraq . some commentators say that it is too late , that iraqis themselves are set into partitioning the country into shiite , sunni and kurdish areas .
are the political differences between these groups fundamentally irreconcilable ? i do n't think that partition is a solution , because there will be no clear cut for the three parts .
the country will totally disintegrate .
i 'd rather see four or five iraq 's emerging .
this is why i think the only hope for us to come to any solution in iraq , in the long term , is a federalization , which might be called soft partition . a referendum is due to take place on the future status of the city of kirkuk , which the kurds regard as kurdish and want to be included in their province , but there is fierce resistance by turkmen and sunnis living there .
how significant is this issue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurds regard the citiy of kirkuk as their own it is extremely significant .
i argue in my study that it might be the most significant topic in the coming months .
what we are witnessing already is an escalation of violence .
it is exactly the territories where kurds , turkmen and arabs live together .
i think this is a deliberant attempt on the part of al qaeda in iraq and other terrorist organizations to provoke a civil war in the north of the country .
i think if the kirkuk issue is not solved between the political parties in baghdad , this second civil war , in the northern part of the country , might take place . the real danger for the rest of the year 2007 and for the year 2008 is for an intervention by the neighbors , because if the conflict escalates in the north of iraq , if the turkmen , for example , are increasingly targeted by the terrorists , it is more likely that the neighbors will try to intervene - if not directly , then indirectly - as iran already does in southern iraq . nathan witkop interviewed guido steinberg -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he spoke to dw about moral courage , discrimination and the media . günter wallraff has been a thorn in the side of german business for decades .
now 64 , the investigative reporter from cologne has made a name for himself trying to expose injustice .
his books have sold millions of copies and been translated into 30 languages .
sweden even created a word in the writer 's name : wallraffa , which means " to expose misconduct from the inside by assuming a role . "
his most recent expose dealt with the travails of people working in german call centers .
he recently courted controversy by proposing to read salman rushdie 's " the satanic verses " in the community center of a cologne mosque .
deutsche welle : what pronouncement about you has annoyed you the most ?
günter wallraff : oh , i 'll have to think about that for a while - there are so many insults .
i 'd say : i insist on certain enmities !
when they start to praise me , i have to ask : have i been taken in ?
when bild-zeitung -lsb- germany 's largest-selling tabloid newspaper , which was the target of his 1977 book " lead story " -rsb- calls me the " pen of evil , " i feel i 've been practically knighted .
when die welt -lsb- newspaper -rsb- now came and started an article with " respect for wallraff " - in connection with my suggestion to hold a discussion of " the satanic verses " in a mosque 's community center - i was slightly bewildered , i asked myself : did i do something wrong ?
for you , it 's also an issue of having the right enemies .
you became famous at a time when the concept of the bad guy was somewhat simpler , in the 1970s and ' 80s .
where are your bogeymen today ?
i do n't have any eternal bogeymen .
i wish they would one day become civilized or democratized .
i believe in the ability to change , not just in people , but also in societal structures .
and even such an inhuman paper as bild-zeitung - which can still be called the central organ of character assassination - could possibly develop differently in another social environment and at least let up with this aggressiveness .
it always has to do with personalities - who 's currently editor in chief ?
so , i do n't have any eternal bogeymen ; i also do n't speak of enemies , i speak of opponents , and such a thing as hatred is totally foreign to me .
i do n't hate anyone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bild is known for its bombastic front page what do you consider to be moral courage ? i think moral courage should be a compulsory subject in the schools instead of certain virtues that have returned to the forefront , such as industriousness , punctuality , etc .
i think that in germany of all places , moral courage should take that place instead , that is , that children should already learn in school to respect other cultures , other ways of life , minorities and also to stand up for them - also if it means taking risks .
that 's why i 'm often in schools - especially in eastern germany .
in the last 10 years , i 've given almost 100 presentations - in places where right-wing radicals are often quite dominant .
here and there , i 've even changed people 's attitudes . " lowest of the low , " the book for which you spent two years disguised as a turkish guest worker , was a huge success in germany in 1985 .
it was , according to one critic , the first time the germans realized that the turks , who were working hard for little money in the country 's factories and being treated like dirt , were real people .
is there now less discrimination against turks and others foreigners in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social standing has replaced origin as a basis if discrimination , wallraff says today it 's not the turks who are at the very bottom of society - it 's the workers from eastern europe : poles , romanians , construction workers who have no rights , who , where we used to earn six , eight deutschmarks -lsb- 3-4 euros -rsb- , now do it for two euros an hour .
every third construction worker is illegal or only partly legal , and they are really treated like commodities , hired and fired according to the situation .
germans are among them , too , no difference is made anymore .
the long-term unemployed , especially from eastern germany , also end up in such crews .
discrimination ca n't necessarily be attributed to an individual 's origins anymore , but to their social standing .
we have already firmly embedded so-called third-world standards in germany . you plan to start working in a factory again soon .
nowadays personal reports have become a standard feature in the media .
there 's no need to glue on a fake beard anymore .
now that anyone can make their own personal experiences public - on youtube , for example - has n't undercover journalism become old hat ? i 've just provided proof of the opposite , to my own astonishment .
the short time i spent in two call centers drew so much public attention to the topic that politicians are now responding and business groups are anxious .
trying it out for yourself has a very different authenticity and force of expression than when you assert something from the outside or even investigate it .
and i think it 's essential for many more people to do it .

he spoke to dw about moral courage , discrimination and the media . günter wallraff has been a thorn in the side of german business for decades .
now 64 , the investigative reporter from cologne has made a name for himself trying to expose injustice .
his books have sold millions of copies and been translated into 30 languages .
sweden even created a word in the writer 's name : wallraffa , which means " to expose misconduct from the inside by assuming a role . "
his most recent expose dealt with the travails of people working in german call centers .
he recently courted controversy by proposing to read salman rushdie 's " the satanic verses " in the community center of a cologne mosque .
deutsche welle : what pronouncement about you has annoyed you the most ?
günter wallraff : oh , i 'll have to think about that for a while - there are so many insults .
i 'd say : i insist on certain enmities !
when they start to praise me , i have to ask : have i been taken in ?
when bild-zeitung -lsb- germany 's largest-selling tabloid newspaper , which was the target of his 1977 book " lead story " -rsb- calls me the " pen of evil , " i feel i 've been practically knighted .
when die welt -lsb- newspaper -rsb- now came and started an article with " respect for wallraff " - in connection with my suggestion to hold a discussion of " the satanic verses " in a mosque 's community center - i was slightly bewildered , i asked myself : did i do something wrong ?
for you , it 's also an issue of having the right enemies .
you became famous at a time when the concept of the bad guy was somewhat simpler , in the 1970s and ' 80s .
where are your bogeymen today ?
i do n't have any eternal bogeymen .
i wish they would one day become civilized or democratized .
i believe in the ability to change , not just in people , but also in societal structures .
and even such an inhuman paper as bild-zeitung - which can still be called the central organ of character assassination - could possibly develop differently in another social environment and at least let up with this aggressiveness .
it always has to do with personalities - who 's currently editor in chief ?
so , i do n't have any eternal bogeymen ; i also do n't speak of enemies , i speak of opponents , and such a thing as hatred is totally foreign to me .
i do n't hate anyone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bild is known for its bombastic front page what do you consider to be moral courage ? i think moral courage should be a compulsory subject in the schools instead of certain virtues that have returned to the forefront , such as industriousness , punctuality , etc .
i think that in germany of all places , moral courage should take that place instead , that is , that children should already learn in school to respect other cultures , other ways of life , minorities and also to stand up for them - also if it means taking risks .
that 's why i 'm often in schools - especially in eastern germany .
in the last 10 years , i 've given almost 100 presentations - in places where right-wing radicals are often quite dominant .
here and there , i 've even changed people 's attitudes . " lowest of the low , " the book for which you spent two years disguised as a turkish guest worker , was a huge success in germany in 1985 .
it was , according to one critic , the first time the germans realized that the turks , who were working hard for little money in the country 's factories and being treated like dirt , were real people .
is there now less discrimination against turks and others foreigners in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social standing has replaced origin as a basis if discrimination , wallraff says today it 's not the turks who are at the very bottom of society - it 's the workers from eastern europe : poles , romanians , construction workers who have no rights , who , where we used to earn six , eight deutschmarks -lsb- 3-4 euros -rsb- , now do it for two euros an hour .
every third construction worker is illegal or only partly legal , and they are really treated like commodities , hired and fired according to the situation .
germans are among them , too , no difference is made anymore .
the long-term unemployed , especially from eastern germany , also end up in such crews .
discrimination ca n't necessarily be attributed to an individual 's origins anymore , but to their social standing .
we have already firmly embedded so-called third-world standards in germany . you plan to start working in a factory again soon .
nowadays personal reports have become a standard feature in the media .
there 's no need to glue on a fake beard anymore .
now that anyone can make their own personal experiences public - on youtube , for example - has n't undercover journalism become old hat ? i 've just provided proof of the opposite , to my own astonishment .
the short time i spent in two call centers drew so much public attention to the topic that politicians are now responding and business groups are anxious .
trying it out for yourself has a very different authenticity and force of expression than when you assert something from the outside or even investigate it .
and i think it 's essential for many more people to do it .

" i 've been an elvis fan since 1974 , " the 44-year-old said from his bonn apartment before leaving for the memorial in graceland .
" back then i was 11 years old and found out about a concert he played in las vegas through a magazine article . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans have not forgotten elvis , some are even convinced he 's still alive the amount of charisma that elvis was able to get across in just a magazine photo impressed beines so much that he began collecting elvis records and clipping news articles about the king throughout his teenage years .
the collection grew to the point that his apartment now resembles an elvis museum . " most of all it was about his music , " beines said .
" then about his vibrancy , his charisma .
especially the things he did on stage during his concerts .
third i liked his human characteristics . " elvis ' last song , " way down , " recorded in his home in august 1977 , is perhaps indicative of the last few years of his career .
while professionally he suffered as hit bands the beatles and the rolling stones drew more attention , privately he battled obesity and drug dependency . fans continue to remember their king at the age of 42 , elvis was found dead in the bathroom of his graceland mansion in memphis on aug .
16 , 1977 .
doctors said his death was caused by heart failure , likely brought on by obesity and years of abusing medications .
biographer alanna nash characterized his dependency as an inability to accept what had become of himself , leading him to attempt to kill the pain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : half of graceland 's visitors are under 35 years old even as the rumors of elvis being spotted at deserted gas stations around the world continue to spread , impersonators who dress , swing and croon like the king himself pay regular tribute to the rock and roll legend .
fans have also created over 500 official elvis fan clubs in over 45 countries . on the 20th anniversary of his death in 1997 a video elvis appeared on stage with over thirty of his former band mates in the production elvis in concert ' 97 at the mid-south coliseum in memphis , tenn .
the show went on to tour the us and in 1999 the european tour opened in london , marking elvis ' first-ever concert outside of north america . an international sensation since 1954 more than one billion elvis records have been sold - a feat no other artist is yet to accomplish - and he won three grammy awards from 14 nominations . however , his fame did n't just hit american airwaves .
elvis ' trophy room at graceland is filled with gold and platinum records from around the world - including germany , although five concerts in canada in were his only performances outside the united states . with a song catalog of over 1,000 titles , german fan beines said it 's nearly impossible to pick just one favorite song . " if i had to choose one , then for me it 'd be ' an american trilogy , " ' beines said .
" but like nearly all fans , i could name 50 songs and always think of another that should be on the list .
it 'd be better just to choose 100 favorites .

the son of a laborer and seamstress , he was born in tupelo , mississippi , and grew up alone after his twin brother was stillborn .
on his 10th birthday , instead of the bicycle he had hoped for , elvis was given a guitar and he taught himself to play . unlike today 's pop sensations , elvis served his country at the us ray barracks in friedberg , germany between 1958 and 1960 .
it was during this time that he met his future bride , priscilla beaulieu , the daughter of a us air force officer . elvis and priscilla married in las vegas in 1967 and nine months later daughter lisa marie was born .
however , priscilla complained that elvis had little time for his family and of a destructive cycle of sleeping pills , stimulants and sedatives .
the couple divorced in 1973 . although his earnings continued to climb and still do even after his death -lrb- for decades elvis led forbes magazine 's list of the biggest earning deceased celebrities -rrb- , by the mid-1970 's he could barely bring himself to swing his hips on stage . article based on news reports -lrb- sjr -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

16 , 1977 .
doctors said his death was caused by heart failure , likely brought on by obesity and years of abusing medications .
biographer alanna nash characterized his dependency as an inability to accept what had become of himself , leading him to attempt to kill the pain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : half of graceland 's visitors are under 35 years old even as the rumors of elvis being spotted at deserted gas stations around the world continue to spread , impersonators who dress , swing and croon like the king himself pay regular tribute to the rock and roll legend .
fans have also created over 500 official elvis fan clubs in over 45 countries . on the 20th anniversary of his death in 1997 a video elvis appeared on stage with over thirty of his former band mates in the production elvis in concert ' 97 at the mid-south coliseum in memphis , tenn .
the show went on to tour the us and in 1999 the european tour opened in london , marking elvis ' first-ever concert outside of north america . an international sensation since 1954 more than one billion elvis records have been sold - a feat no other artist is yet to accomplish - and he won three grammy awards from 14 nominations . however , his fame did n't just hit american airwaves .
elvis ' trophy room at graceland is filled with gold and platinum records from around the world - including germany , although five concerts in canada in were his only performances outside the united states . with a song catalog of over 1,000 titles , german fan beines said it 's nearly impossible to pick just one favorite song . " if i had to choose one , then for me it 'd be ' an american trilogy , " ' beines said .
" but like nearly all fans , i could name 50 songs and always think of another that should be on the list .
it 'd be better just to choose 100 favorites . " a less glittery private life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elvis preseley served the us military in friedberg where he met his wife priscilla while his career was all glitz and gold , elvis ' private life was less than easy .
the son of a laborer and seamstress , he was born in tupelo , mississippi , and grew up alone after his twin brother was stillborn .
on his 10th birthday , instead of the bicycle he had hoped for , elvis was given a guitar and he taught himself to play . unlike today 's pop sensations , elvis served his country at the us ray barracks in friedberg , germany between 1958 and 1960 .
it was during this time that he met his future bride , priscilla beaulieu , the daughter of a us air force officer . elvis and priscilla married in las vegas in 1967 and nine months later daughter lisa marie was born .
however , priscilla complained that elvis had little time for his family and of a destructive cycle of sleeping pills , stimulants and sedatives .
the couple divorced in 1973 . although his earnings continued to climb and still do even after his death -lrb- for decades elvis led forbes magazine 's list of the biggest earning deceased celebrities -rrb- , by the mid-1970 's he could barely bring himself to swing his hips on stage . article based on news reports -lrb- sjr -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sinn added that expectations for the coming six months were positive in all euro zone countries with the exceptions of ireland and spain , where experts forecast a slowdown in the second half of the year .

the chancellor 's not alone in her interest in the arctic : ever more states are attracted by the region 's resources . german chancellor angela merkel heads to greenland on thursday for a two-day visit with danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen .
the two politicians will ply the ilulissat fjord , over 300 kilometers -lrb- 186 miles -rrb- above the arctic circle , where one of the world 's biggest glaciers is gradually melting .
global warming is especially evident on the danish island , where the temperatures have been increasing twice as quickly as the world average .
" it 's good that a german chancellor examines the issues of climate change where its effects are especially easy to recognize , " said german climate expert peter lemke .
" politicians should also see for themselves where and how climate change occurs . "
merkel 's not the first politician to visit the spot .
she follows in the footsteps of italian prime minister romano prodi , european commission chief jose manuel barroso , nancy pelosi , speaker of the us house of representatives , and presidential candidate john mccain .
international interest and the region has n't only drawn attention due to growing concern about climate change .
the arctic is believed to be rich in resources .
however , until the ice started to melt , they were inaccessible .
climate researchers now say that the arctic could be ice-free by the summer of 2040 .
shipping is likely to take off , and it may then be affordable to excavate the gas and oil thought to be buried there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the russians will have to do more to cement their claims in early august , russian researchers planted a rust-free titanium russian flag on the ocean floor beneath the north pole to mark their country 's claim to the area .
denmark has also sent an arctic mission to back up its claims to the region .
and canadian premier stephen harper announced plans last week to establish a deep-sea port and a military base in the arctic .
a study by the us geological survey estimates the arctic has as much as 25 percent of the world 's undiscovered oil and gas .
but some say that 's just speculation .
geophysicist wilfried jodak of germany 's alfred wegener institute for polar and marine research -lrb- awi -rrb- is one of the skeptics .
the geo-scientific data from the area north of the arctic circle was too meager to identify any deposits , he said .
claims deadline looms " arctic research is expensive and was so unattractive until a few years ago , that hardly any public means were provided for research , " he said , adding that expanding territorial claims had not previously been a factor at all .
" the russians got that rolling . "
moscow is in a hurry to prove that the lomonosov ridge in the northern arctic ocean is a continuation of the russian mainland .
the 1982 un convention on law of the sea allows states to use the waters up to 200 sea miles -lrb- 370 kilometers -rrb- off their coasts as economic areas .
those governments that want to make further claims must submit requests to the un by may 2009 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arctic could be ice-free by 2040 any state missing the 2009 deadline risks losing un recognition of the claim .
countries that have not yet ratifed the law of the sea convention , including the united states , are not bound by the 2009 deadline .
the arctic push is a result of this deadline , according to jodak of the awi : " so that the claims have been resolved if at some point it turns out that there really are rich resource deposits in the northern arctic . "
shared heritage ?
thus , the clock is ticking for russia , denmark and canada , all of which view themselves as having the ultimate claim to the arctic sea .
" the arctic does n't belong to any state alone , " said moscow sea expert anatoly kolodkin of the un 's international tribunal of the law of the sea .
the arctic sea was part of " man 's common heritage , " he said , adding that the issue was , nevertheless , about who had the rights to explore and develop the resources there . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" such an undertaking was supposed to be used to free the stammheim prisoners , " wrote the stuttgart judges who heard the pair 's case , referring to the maximum-security jail where several raf terrorists , including the group 's leaders , andreas baader and ulrike meinhof , were being held .
the prosecutors determined that , at a meeting in the dutch city of utrecht on april 16 , 1977 , mohnhaupt and four other raf members discussed the possibility of abducting brandt .

politicians have called for a new effort to educate young people about the true nature of east germany after recently surfaced shoot-to-kill orders have rekindled a debate about conditions in the communist country . volker kauder , the parliamentary leader for germany 's governing christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , told the berliner zeitung on thursday that his party would take steps to raise awareness about eastern germany 's communist past . " we have worked enormously hard to deal with the past of the third reich 's terror system and continue to do so , but we 've done much too little when it comes to dealing with the gdr dictatorship , " he said .
" when looking at the alarming lack of knowledge about the gdr past among the younger generation , we should use the current debate to clarify who was responsible . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonners may be surprised to learn that some think the former west german capital was in the gdr on wednesday , germany 's mass tabloid bild had asked young germans what they knew about the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- .
while some said that east germans were n't allowed to travel , others pointed out that there was a high level of unemployment , that people liked to bathe in the nude and that no one was able to buy fashionable clothes .
one 22-year-old man said that bonn served as the gdr 's capital .
" hitler was the boss and he had a wall build around his empire , " he added . second document found the current debate surrounding life in the gdr was sparked by a shoot-to-kill order that resurfaced over the weekend .
it called on members of the east german secret police , the stasi , to use their weapons to prevent people from fleeing across the german-german border , even if women and children were involved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stasi file agency head marianne birthler is feeling the heat the federal agency that administers the stasi files came under pressure for presenting the document as a sensational find after it became obvious that the order had been known to researchers and state prosecutors for years .
on wednesday , agency officials uncovered a similar document .
unlike the first one , however , it was signed by a high-ranking stasi official , making it potentially more significant for a criminal investigation .
a legal expert said that the second document might have led to different rulings in previous border shooting trials , where guards , who claimed that they had acted in self-defense , were acquitted . " but it 's unlikely that the cases will be reopened now , " ferdinand von schirach , who defended a top-level gdr official in the 1990s , told dw-world.de. agency under pressure the stasi file agency 's head , marianne birthler , has faced intense pressure in recent days for her handling of the situation , with some saying that she is trying to prevent the swift dismantling of her office and the transfer of the stasi files into germany 's federal archives .
birthler has suggested the year 2019 for such a merger .
members of the opposition free-market liberal free democrats and the cdu 's junior coalition partner , the social democrats , have called for quick reforms of the birthler agency as a result of the recent developments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the files will eventually be transferred to the federal archives wolfgang böhmer , the state premier of saxony-anhalt , where the first shoot-to-kill order was found , said he saw a continued need to research the stasi files .
" the fact that a belittlement and minimization of the gdr 's problems can be seen in the public justifies further research and public debate about what happened , " böhmer told the german press agency dpa , adding that the he saw no need to rush a merger of the stasi agency with the federal archives . kauder agreed and added that a merger could be initiated during the next legislative period , which is likely to start in 2009 . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

politicians have called for a new effort to educate young people about the true nature of east germany after recently surfaced shoot-to-kill orders have rekindled a debate about conditions in the communist country . volker kauder , the parliamentary leader for germany 's governing christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , told the berliner zeitung on thursday that his party would take steps to raise awareness about eastern germany 's communist past . " we have worked enormously hard to deal with the past of the third reich 's terror system and continue to do so , but we 've done much too little when it comes to dealing with the gdr dictatorship , " he said .
" when looking at the alarming lack of knowledge about the gdr past among the younger generation , we should use the current debate to clarify who was responsible . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonners may be surprised to learn that some think the former west german capital was in the gdr on wednesday , germany 's mass tabloid bild had asked young germans what they knew about the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- .
while some said that east germans were n't allowed to travel , others pointed out that there was a high level of unemployment , that people liked to bathe in the nude and that no one was able to buy fashionable clothes .
one 22-year-old man said that bonn served as the gdr 's capital .
" hitler was the boss and he had a wall build around his empire , " he added . second document found the current debate surrounding life in the gdr was sparked by a shoot-to-kill order that resurfaced over the weekend .
it called on members of the east german secret police , the stasi , to use their weapons to prevent people from fleeing across the german-german border , even if women and children were involved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stasi file agency head marianne birthler is feeling the heat the federal agency that administers the stasi files came under pressure for presenting the document as a sensational find after it became obvious that the order had been known to researchers and state prosecutors for years .
on wednesday , agency officials uncovered a similar document .
unlike the first one , however , it was signed by a high-ranking stasi official , making it potentially more significant for a criminal investigation .
a legal expert said that the second document might have led to different rulings in previous border shooting trials , where guards , who claimed that they had acted in self-defense , were acquitted . " but it 's unlikely that the cases will be reopened now , " ferdinand von schirach , who defended a top-level gdr official in the 1990s , told dw-world.de. agency under pressure the stasi file agency 's head , marianne birthler , has faced intense pressure in recent days for her handling of the situation , with some saying that she is trying to prevent the swift dismantling of her office and the transfer of the stasi files into germany 's federal archives .
birthler has suggested the year 2019 for such a merger .
members of the opposition free-market liberal free democrats and the cdu 's junior coalition partner , the social democrats , have called for quick reforms of the birthler agency as a result of the recent developments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the files will eventually be transferred to the federal archives wolfgang böhmer , the state premier of saxony-anhalt , where the first shoot-to-kill order was found , said he saw a continued need to research the stasi files .
" the fact that a belittlement and minimization of the gdr 's problems can be seen in the public justifies further research and public debate about what happened , " böhmer told the german press agency dpa , adding that the he saw no need to rush a merger of the stasi agency with the federal archives . kauder agreed and added that a merger could be initiated during the next legislative period , which is likely to start in 2009 . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the survey is based on interviews with 258 experts from multinational companies and institutes .

sinn added that expectations for the coming six months were positive in all euro zone countries with the exceptions of ireland and spain , where experts forecast a slowdown in the second half of the year .
the interviews were conducted at the end of july and the beginning of august and do not take into consideration the last 10 days .

she knows every crook and cranny of germany 's favorite landmark . dw : what is the allure of the cologne cathedral in your opinion ? barbara schock-werner : there are two things : the first is the building itself , its size , its perfection and its beauty .
but it 's also the visitor-friendly management that ’ s behind it .
for example , there 's no entry fee - it 's a church and everyone 's welcome .
we have very long opening hours , from 6:00 am to 7:30 pm .
and we make a large effort to have friendly management , group tours , not too many tours at the same time , etc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the sheer size of the cathedral that many find impressive what about the building itself attracts people ? the overwhelming space .
go in , sit down - and your heart rises .
it 's something that really has an effect on your body and soul .
you have imagine that the people in the middle ages lived in much smaller spaces and they were n't used to theaters and cinemas , which are matter-of-fact for us today .
for them it must have seemed even bigger . the purpose behind the building was less to glorify the archbishop of cologne and much more an effort to give the christians a picture of heaven .
when you take your time , sit down and take in the building , you can experience that today as well . many people ask why the cathedral constantly seems to be under construction .
what do you say to that ? all historical buildings have to be taken care of if they are to be preserved .
the gothic ones are unfortunately the most fragile because their surfaces are so complicated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cathedral 's towers are about 157 meters -lrb- 515 feet -rrb- tall the cathedral building foundation and cathedral workshop , which i have overseen since 1999 , are there to manage the preservation of the church .
these incorporate a staff of 80 people .
thirty of these are craftspeople , including stonemasons , scaffold makers , roofers , locksmiths , carpenters , blacksmiths , electricians and painters . the cathedral has 8,000 square meters -lrb- about 86,000 square feet -rrb- of historical glass windows and we have our own glass restoration workshop with 10 staff members .
underneath the cathedral there is an archaeological dig going on and we also have a small team of archaeologists .
i 'm also in charge of the treasure chamber , the library and the administrators . what 's your annual budget ? between six and seven million euros -lrb- between eight and 9.4 million dollars -rrb- a year .
that mostly goes for the staff .
but the staff is the guarantee that the cathedral will be preserved .
they know every crack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steam engines so near to the cathedral damaged its facade , said schock-werner why is the cologne cathedral so black ? weathering of the stone began around the middle of the 19th century when the majority of the population began heating with coal .
before that , the poor people heated with wood and nothing happened .
but when everyone started heating with coal , the sulphur content in the air increased dramatically .
that happened in all cities . in cologne , in addition , train tracks were laid in direct proximity to the cathedral and for nearly 100 years steam engines drove by the cathedral every day and blew their smoke on the building .
that 's why the damage to the stone is greater here than in other places .
add to that the brown coal power plants in the western part of the city . today , there are n't any steam engines any more , the power plants have been moved and practically no one has individual heating since the whole city uses district heating .
the air today is much better and we can be sure that what we replace now will last longer . the renowned german artist gerhard richter recently completed a new stained glass window for the south wing of the cathedral that will be unveiled later this month .
why was gerhard richter chosen for the job ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard richter 's stained glass window consists of 11,250 squares of color in the field of contemporary glass painting , i could n't find a solution to the window that fit the cathedral 's status .
i had n't initially thought of richter for the project , because he 's not generally associated with glass windows .
but then we met at a reception and suddenly i thought , gerhard richter must be able to do it .
he has a relationship to the catholic church , he lives in cologne , and he 's worked both representationally and ornamentally .
he 's extremely sensitive and his work is of an incredibly high quality .
i asked him , he said yes and now we 've been working on the project for five years .
we 're very pleased that it 's nearly completed . legend has it that the cathedral was n't destroyed during world war two .
is this true ? no , that 's one of the cathedral 's pious legends .
the fact is , it was hit hard 14 times and suffered heavy damages but stayed standing .
that must have been an incredible symbol for the people .
they came out of their basements and shelters and the cathedral was still standing , even though the rest of the city had been flattened . what 's it like to be a woman in your job ? i had the better qualifications .
i am an architect and an art historian and that ’ s why they chose me .
i 'm the first woman with my special title , but i 'm not the first woman doing this job .
there are women in similar positions at the churches in ulm , freiburg , strasbourg , nuremberg and magdeburg , but they have different titles . my predecessor was quite respected in his position and i think it was easier for a woman to follow him than for a man , because we were n't in direct competition . bildunterschrift : cologne 's greatest landmark was constructed over six centuries click on the link below to read what visitors had to say about the cologne cathedral . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she knows every crook and cranny of germany 's favorite landmark . dw : what is the allure of the cologne cathedral in your opinion ? barbara schock-werner : there are two things : the first is the building itself , its size , its perfection and its beauty .
but it 's also the visitor-friendly management that ’ s behind it .
for example , there 's no entry fee - it 's a church and everyone 's welcome .
we have very long opening hours , from 6:00 am to 7:30 pm .
and we make a large effort to have friendly management , group tours , not too many tours at the same time , etc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the sheer size of the cathedral that many find impressive what about the building itself attracts people ? the overwhelming space .
go in , sit down - and your heart rises .
it 's something that really has an effect on your body and soul .
you have imagine that the people in the middle ages lived in much smaller spaces and they were n't used to theaters and cinemas , which are matter-of-fact for us today .
for them it must have seemed even bigger . the purpose behind the building was less to glorify the archbishop of cologne and much more an effort to give the christians a picture of heaven .
when you take your time , sit down and take in the building , you can experience that today as well . many people ask why the cathedral constantly seems to be under construction .
what do you say to that ? all historical buildings have to be taken care of if they are to be preserved .
the gothic ones are unfortunately the most fragile because their surfaces are so complicated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cathedral 's towers are about 157 meters -lrb- 515 feet -rrb- tall the cathedral building foundation and cathedral workshop , which i have overseen since 1999 , are there to manage the preservation of the church .
these incorporate a staff of 80 people .
thirty of these are craftspeople , including stonemasons , scaffold makers , roofers , locksmiths , carpenters , blacksmiths , electricians and painters . the cathedral has 8,000 square meters -lrb- about 86,000 square feet -rrb- of historical glass windows and we have our own glass restoration workshop with 10 staff members .
underneath the cathedral there is an archaeological dig going on and we also have a small team of archaeologists .
i 'm also in charge of the treasure chamber , the library and the administrators . what 's your annual budget ? between six and seven million euros -lrb- between eight and 9.4 million dollars -rrb- a year .
that mostly goes for the staff .
but the staff is the guarantee that the cathedral will be preserved .
they know every crack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steam engines so near to the cathedral damaged its facade , said schock-werner why is the cologne cathedral so black ? weathering of the stone began around the middle of the 19th century when the majority of the population began heating with coal .
before that , the poor people heated with wood and nothing happened .
but when everyone started heating with coal , the sulphur content in the air increased dramatically .
that happened in all cities . in cologne , in addition , train tracks were laid in direct proximity to the cathedral and for nearly 100 years steam engines drove by the cathedral every day and blew their smoke on the building .
that 's why the damage to the stone is greater here than in other places .
add to that the brown coal power plants in the western part of the city . today , there are n't any steam engines any more , the power plants have been moved and practically no one has individual heating since the whole city uses district heating .
the air today is much better and we can be sure that what we replace now will last longer . the renowned german artist gerhard richter recently completed a new stained glass window for the south wing of the cathedral that will be unveiled later this month .
why was gerhard richter chosen for the job ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard richter 's stained glass window consists of 11,250 squares of color in the field of contemporary glass painting , i could n't find a solution to the window that fit the cathedral 's status .
i had n't initially thought of richter for the project , because he 's not generally associated with glass windows .
but then we met at a reception and suddenly i thought , gerhard richter must be able to do it .
he has a relationship to the catholic church , he lives in cologne , and he 's worked both representationally and ornamentally .
he 's extremely sensitive and his work is of an incredibly high quality .
i asked him , he said yes and now we 've been working on the project for five years .
we 're very pleased that it 's nearly completed . legend has it that the cathedral was n't destroyed during world war two .
is this true ? no , that 's one of the cathedral 's pious legends .
the fact is , it was hit hard 14 times and suffered heavy damages but stayed standing .
that must have been an incredible symbol for the people .
they came out of their basements and shelters and the cathedral was still standing , even though the rest of the city had been flattened . what 's it like to be a woman in your job ? i had the better qualifications .
i am an architect and an art historian and that ’ s why they chose me .
i 'm the first woman with my special title , but i 'm not the first woman doing this job .
there are women in similar positions at the churches in ulm , freiburg , strasbourg , nuremberg and magdeburg , but they have different titles . my predecessor was quite respected in his position and i think it was easier for a woman to follow him than for a man , because we were n't in direct competition . bildunterschrift : cologne 's greatest landmark was constructed over six centuries click on the link below to read what visitors had to say about the cologne cathedral . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

politicians have called for a new effort to educate young people about the true nature of east germany after recently surfaced shoot-to-kill orders have rekindled a debate about conditions in the communist country . volker kauder , the parliamentary leader for germany 's governing christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , told the berliner zeitung on thursday that his party would take steps to raise awareness about eastern germany 's communist past . " we have worked enormously hard to deal with the past of the third reich 's terror system and continue to do so , but we 've done much too little when it comes to dealing with the gdr dictatorship , " he said .
" when looking at the alarming lack of knowledge about the gdr past among the younger generation , we should use the current debate to clarify who was responsible . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonners may be surprised to learn that some think the former west german capital was in the gdr on wednesday , germany 's mass tabloid bild had asked young germans what they knew about the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- .
while some said that east germans were n't allowed to travel , others pointed out that there was a high level of unemployment , that people liked to bathe in the nude and that no one was able to buy fashionable clothes .
one 22-year-old man said that bonn served as the gdr 's capital .
" hitler was the boss and he had a wall build around his empire , " he added . second document found the current debate surrounding life in the gdr was sparked by a shoot-to-kill order that resurfaced over the weekend .
it called on members of the east german secret police , the stasi , to use their weapons to prevent people from fleeing across the german-german border , even if women and children were involved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stasi file agency head marianne birthler is feeling the heat the federal agency that administers the stasi files came under pressure for presenting the document as a sensational find after it became obvious that the order had been known to researchers and state prosecutors for years .
on wednesday , agency officials uncovered a similar document .
unlike the first one , however , it was signed by a high-ranking stasi official , making it potentially more significant for a criminal investigation .
a legal expert said that the second document might have led to different rulings in previous border shooting trials , where guards , who claimed that they had acted in self-defense , were acquitted . " but it 's unlikely that the cases will be reopened now , " ferdinand von schirach , who defended a top-level gdr official in the 1990s , told dw-world.de. agency under pressure the stasi file agency 's head , marianne birthler , has faced intense pressure in recent days for her handling of the situation , with some saying that she is trying to prevent the swift dismantling of her office and the transfer of the stasi files into germany 's federal archives .
birthler has suggested the year 2019 for such a merger .
members of the opposition free-market liberal free democrats and the cdu 's junior coalition partner , the social democrats , have called for quick reforms of the birthler agency as a result of the recent developments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the files will eventually be transferred to the federal archives wolfgang böhmer , the state premier of saxony-anhalt , where the first shoot-to-kill order was found , said he saw a continued need to research the stasi files .
" the fact that a belittlement and minimization of the gdr 's problems can be seen in the public justifies further research and public debate about what happened , " böhmer told the german press agency dpa , adding that the he saw no need to rush a merger of the stasi agency with the federal archives . kauder agreed and added that a merger could be initiated during the next legislative period , which is likely to start in 2009 . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the latest survey results indicate that the economic upswing will continue in the second half of 2007 , " said hans-werner sinn , the institute 's president , in a statement .

within the euro zone , only portugal 's economic situation was described as poor .
sinn added that expectations for the coming six months were positive in all euro zone countries with the exceptions of ireland and spain , where experts forecast a slowdown in the second half of the year .
the interviews were conducted at the end of july and the beginning of august and do not take into consideration the last 10 days .

the survey is based on interviews with 258 experts from multinational companies and institutes .
" the latest survey results indicate that the economic upswing will continue in the second half of 2007 , " said hans-werner sinn , the institute 's president , in a statement .
boom time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal 's not doing that well sinn added that the economic situation in austria , finland , germany , ireland , luxembourg and the netherlands was considered extremely favorable and comparable to the mood during the new economy boom in 2001 .
within the euro zone , only portugal 's economic situation was described as poor .
sinn added that expectations for the coming six months were positive in all euro zone countries with the exceptions of ireland and spain , where experts forecast a slowdown in the second half of the year .
the interviews were conducted at the end of july and the beginning of august and do not take into consideration the last 10 days .
institute officials pointed out , however , that the stock market downturn cause by the us real estate crisis had already begun at the time the experts were surveyed .

younger people , on the other hand , said they will be paying more attention to their cultural heritage .
leaving controversy behind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can expellee groups keep young people interested ?

moll , a high school student in munich , is part of a silesian folk dancing group that performs at events like tag der heimat , as well as at her hometown 's famous oktoberfest .
she also takes part in conferences about expellee issues and other cultural activities .
both of moll 's grandmothers were expelled from silesia , in southwestern poland , at the end of world war ii .
while some people of the older generation feel silesia belongs to them , moll said she does n't feel that way at all . although she still feels special ties to silesia , munich is home .
" it 's simply not the situation that you can go back to silesia , " she said .
" it 's too long ago .
it 's important to not forget the history and to make sure that everyone knows what happened and that an injustice occurred .
but you ca n't displace all of the polish or other people who have lived in these houses or on this land for 60 years . "
youth groups focus on future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the average age for many groups is getting older this type of attitude is typical among the descendants of expellees , said thomas hoffmann , who heads the organization german youth in europe .
while the first generation of expellees dreamed of returning home , their grandchildren are uninterested in going back , hoffmann said .
the first part of german youth in europe 's harkens back to its foundation in 1951 as a group to fight for the rights of german expellee youths .
over the years it has evolved into a more progressive organization which promotes reconciliation and integration .
the group has approximately 90,000 members .
janna keberlein , a member of the youth organization and 28-year-old student at the university of düsseldorf , said that while her ethnic german grandparents still get angry about being deported from the volga region to kazakhstan during the war , she thinks the issue needs to be closed .
" young people do n't have to be drawn into this history of suffering , " the 28-year-old düsseldorf university student said , adding that she has no interest in being politically involved in the league of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- .
a taboo subject bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the silesian traditions remain important to some youth for many young people , the bdv focuses too much on the past , a fact seen in the graying of the organization , said alfred de zayas , a leading scholar on germen expellees .
when he gives talks to expellee groups , the average age is usually 60 , he said .
de zayas served for years as a lawyer for the united nations high commissioner for human rights .
he is currently a professor of international law at the geneva school of diplomacy .
he wrote the first scholarly work on german expellees to appear in english , breaking what had long been a taboo topic .
the post-war expulsions were the largest forced movement of europeans in the 20th century .
historians estimate that between 12 and 15 million people were expelled during the forced migrations .
finding an interest in cultural heritage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expellees on the road to germany de zayas ' books have been controversial in germany because he feels expellees have legal rights to reclaim lost property .
but that 's a claim he said he doubts younger generations will pursue as most are simply not interested in the debate 's political dimensions .
instead young people from expellee backgrounds are only just now becoming interested in their cultural heritage to find out more about themselves , de zayas said , adding that he expects that interest to grow .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 16.08.2007 opinion : it 's time to review germany 's afghan mission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : following the murder of three police officers in afghanistan , germany 's government should heed criticism of its reconstruction efforts in the country and pause to figure out how to proceed , says dw 's nina werkhäuser . whenever germans are murdered in afghanistan , politicians unload a bag of reassurances : they say that it 's tragic and sad , but certainly no reason to reduce germany 's mission in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the fact that - in addition to the three police officers - a german aid worker , a german businessman and three german soldiers have already been murdered in afghanistan this year , the federal government has not wasted a single thought on coming up with an exit strategy .
quite to the contrary : the costly deployment of tornado reconnaissance jets was added this year and an expansion of training afghan security personnel is under consideration .
by doing so , the government is avoiding an important question : what price are we ready to pay fort he reconstruction of afghanistan ?
this question gets even more explosive as it becomes clearer that influential forces in afghanistan are not interested in a stabilization of the country and fight this with all their might .
that 's a fundamental difference to what 's happening in other countries , where germany sends soldiers or aid workers .
it 's expensive and it costs a lot of lives to try and bring peace to afghanistan when the taliban are fighting it .
the murder of three police officers who guarded the german embassy in kabul shows that the perpetrators are now directly targeting the government .
it 's safe to assume that the taliban are trying to influence the political debate in germany as all three afghanistan mandates for the german military are up for renewal the fall .
of course it would be wrong to bend one 's knees because of the taliban 's terror .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 16.08.2007 opinion : it 's time to review germany 's afghan mission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : following the murder of three police officers in afghanistan , germany 's government should heed criticism of its reconstruction efforts in the country and pause to figure out how to proceed , says dw 's nina werkhäuser . whenever germans are murdered in afghanistan , politicians unload a bag of reassurances : they say that it 's tragic and sad , but certainly no reason to reduce germany 's mission in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the fact that - in addition to the three police officers - a german aid worker , a german businessman and three german soldiers have already been murdered in afghanistan this year , the federal government has not wasted a single thought on coming up with an exit strategy .
quite to the contrary : the costly deployment of tornado reconnaissance jets was added this year and an expansion of training afghan security personnel is under consideration .
by doing so , the government is avoiding an important question : what price are we ready to pay fort he reconstruction of afghanistan ?
this question gets even more explosive as it becomes clearer that influential forces in afghanistan are not interested in a stabilization of the country and fight this with all their might .
that 's a fundamental difference to what 's happening in other countries , where germany sends soldiers or aid workers .
it 's expensive and it costs a lot of lives to try and bring peace to afghanistan when the taliban are fighting it .
the murder of three police officers who guarded the german embassy in kabul shows that the perpetrators are now directly targeting the government .
it 's safe to assume that the taliban are trying to influence the political debate in germany as all three afghanistan mandates for the german military are up for renewal the fall .
of course it would be wrong to bend one 's knees because of the taliban 's terror .
but this argument must not be used to brush off justified doubts regarding the international reconstruction effort .
the afghan government bears some of the responsibility for the fact that not enough was accomplished during the past five years .
but the many tens of thousands of foreign soldiers and aid workers have also , in part , acted incorrectly and without coordination .
precious time and resources have been wasted as a result .
the german government has so far failed to honestly weigh the mission 's chances and risks .
while surveys show that a majority of germans is now against the deployment of more than 3,000 soldiers in afghanistan , most politicians continue to preach that it 's necessary to endure .

steinberg , the author of a recent study on violence in iraq , said he believes a federal solution could help the country move forward peacefully . dw-world.de : what are the conclusions of your study ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido steinberg said a second iraqi civil war in the north was possible guido steinberg : looking at the situation in iraq today , i do n't think that it is that important anymore whether the us security plan in baghdad and central iraq is successful or not .
what i think is important is that the iraqi actors do n't come to terms with each other .
within the next couple of years , i think we will see an escalation of conflict not only in baghdad , but rather in the north and the south of the country : in the north , over the incorporation of the kirkuk into the turkish autonomy zone ; and in the south , over the control of the southern shiite areas .
this is why i think that only a federal solution can smooth this process of breaking off of iraq . some commentators say that it is too late , that iraqis themselves are set into partitioning the country into shiite , sunni and kurdish areas .
are the political differences between these groups fundamentally irreconcilable ? i do n't think that partition is a solution , because there will be no clear cut for the three parts .
the country will totally disintegrate .
i 'd rather see four or five iraq 's emerging .
this is why i think the only hope for us to come to any solution in iraq , in the long term , is a federalization , which might be called soft partition . a referendum is due to take place on the future status of the city of kirkuk , which the kurds regard as kurdish and want to be included in their province , but there is fierce resistance by turkmen and sunnis living there .
how significant is this issue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurds regard the citiy of kirkuk as their own it is extremely significant .
i argue in my study that it might be the most significant topic in the coming months .
what we are witnessing already is an escalation of violence .
it is exactly the territories where kurds , turkmen and arabs live together .
i think this is a deliberant attempt on the part of al qaeda in iraq and other terrorist organizations to provoke a civil war in the north of the country .
i think if the kirkuk issue is not solved between the political parties in baghdad , this second civil war , in the northern part of the country , might take place . the real danger for the rest of the year 2007 and for the year 2008 is for an intervention by the neighbors , because if the conflict escalates in the north of iraq , if the turkmen , for example , are increasingly targeted by the terrorists , it is more likely that the neighbors will try to intervene - if not directly , then indirectly - as iran already does in southern iraq . nathan witkop interviewed guido steinberg -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she knows every crook and cranny of germany 's favorite landmark . dw : what is the allure of the cologne cathedral in your opinion ? barbara schock-werner : there are two things : the first is the building itself , its size , its perfection and its beauty .
but it 's also the visitor-friendly management that ’ s behind it .
for example , there 's no entry fee - it 's a church and everyone 's welcome .
we have very long opening hours , from 6:00 am to 7:30 pm .
and we make a large effort to have friendly management , group tours , not too many tours at the same time , etc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the sheer size of the cathedral that many find impressive what about the building itself attracts people ? the overwhelming space .
go in , sit down - and your heart rises .
it 's something that really has an effect on your body and soul .
you have imagine that the people in the middle ages lived in much smaller spaces and they were n't used to theaters and cinemas , which are matter-of-fact for us today .
for them it must have seemed even bigger . the purpose behind the building was less to glorify the archbishop of cologne and much more an effort to give the christians a picture of heaven .
when you take your time , sit down and take in the building , you can experience that today as well . many people ask why the cathedral constantly seems to be under construction .
what do you say to that ? all historical buildings have to be taken care of if they are to be preserved .
the gothic ones are unfortunately the most fragile because their surfaces are so complicated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cathedral 's towers are about 157 meters -lrb- 515 feet -rrb- tall the cathedral building foundation and cathedral workshop , which i have overseen since 1999 , are there to manage the preservation of the church .
these incorporate a staff of 80 people .
thirty of these are craftspeople , including stonemasons , scaffold makers , roofers , locksmiths , carpenters , blacksmiths , electricians and painters . the cathedral has 8,000 square meters -lrb- about 86,000 square feet -rrb- of historical glass windows and we have our own glass restoration workshop with 10 staff members .
underneath the cathedral there is an archaeological dig going on and we also have a small team of archaeologists .
i 'm also in charge of the treasure chamber , the library and the administrators . what 's your annual budget ? between six and seven million euros -lrb- between eight and 9.4 million dollars -rrb- a year .
that mostly goes for the staff .
but the staff is the guarantee that the cathedral will be preserved .
they know every crack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steam engines so near to the cathedral damaged its facade , said schock-werner why is the cologne cathedral so black ? weathering of the stone began around the middle of the 19th century when the majority of the population began heating with coal .
before that , the poor people heated with wood and nothing happened .
but when everyone started heating with coal , the sulphur content in the air increased dramatically .
that happened in all cities . in cologne , in addition , train tracks were laid in direct proximity to the cathedral and for nearly 100 years steam engines drove by the cathedral every day and blew their smoke on the building .
that 's why the damage to the stone is greater here than in other places .
add to that the brown coal power plants in the western part of the city . today , there are n't any steam engines any more , the power plants have been moved and practically no one has individual heating since the whole city uses district heating .
the air today is much better and we can be sure that what we replace now will last longer . the renowned german artist gerhard richter recently completed a new stained glass window for the south wing of the cathedral that will be unveiled later this month .
why was gerhard richter chosen for the job ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard richter 's stained glass window consists of 11,250 squares of color in the field of contemporary glass painting , i could n't find a solution to the window that fit the cathedral 's status .
i had n't initially thought of richter for the project , because he 's not generally associated with glass windows .
but then we met at a reception and suddenly i thought , gerhard richter must be able to do it .
he has a relationship to the catholic church , he lives in cologne , and he 's worked both representationally and ornamentally .
he 's extremely sensitive and his work is of an incredibly high quality .
i asked him , he said yes and now we 've been working on the project for five years .
we 're very pleased that it 's nearly completed . legend has it that the cathedral was n't destroyed during world war two .
is this true ? no , that 's one of the cathedral 's pious legends .
the fact is , it was hit hard 14 times and suffered heavy damages but stayed standing .
that must have been an incredible symbol for the people .
they came out of their basements and shelters and the cathedral was still standing , even though the rest of the city had been flattened . what 's it like to be a woman in your job ? i had the better qualifications .
i am an architect and an art historian and that ’ s why they chose me .
i 'm the first woman with my special title , but i 'm not the first woman doing this job .
there are women in similar positions at the churches in ulm , freiburg , strasbourg , nuremberg and magdeburg , but they have different titles . my predecessor was quite respected in his position and i think it was easier for a woman to follow him than for a man , because we were n't in direct competition . bildunterschrift : cologne 's greatest landmark was constructed over six centuries click on the link below to read what visitors had to say about the cologne cathedral . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

here 's was visitors had to say about the third tallest gothic church in the world . it 's great .
it 's the third time we 've been here .
i belong to an organization that keeps up the cathedral , because it needs a lot of repairs . - carmen , seville , spain you get a first impression and you 're very impressed .
but when you analyze the details you 're more impressed .
you can imagine all the work and energy people needed to fulfil the project .
i think i need a week to see the cathedral - to come every day and get more information about the history , and details about the windows and sculptures .
it 's fascinating ! - carmen , germany it 's beautiful , absolutely lovely .
just the size of it - it 's so gorgeous . - jenny and bill , adelaide , australia it 's quite tall .
i 've seen it many times now because i live here .

he spoke to dw about moral courage , discrimination and the media . günter wallraff has been a thorn in the side of german business for decades .
now 64 , the investigative reporter from cologne has made a name for himself trying to expose injustice .
his books have sold millions of copies and been translated into 30 languages .
sweden even created a word in the writer 's name : wallraffa , which means " to expose misconduct from the inside by assuming a role . "
his most recent expose dealt with the travails of people working in german call centers .
he recently courted controversy by proposing to read salman rushdie 's " the satanic verses " in the community center of a cologne mosque .
deutsche welle : what pronouncement about you has annoyed you the most ?
günter wallraff : oh , i 'll have to think about that for a while - there are so many insults .
i 'd say : i insist on certain enmities !
when they start to praise me , i have to ask : have i been taken in ?
when bild-zeitung -lsb- germany 's largest-selling tabloid newspaper , which was the target of his 1977 book " lead story " -rsb- calls me the " pen of evil , " i feel i 've been practically knighted .
when die welt -lsb- newspaper -rsb- now came and started an article with " respect for wallraff " - in connection with my suggestion to hold a discussion of " the satanic verses " in a mosque 's community center - i was slightly bewildered , i asked myself : did i do something wrong ?
for you , it 's also an issue of having the right enemies .
you became famous at a time when the concept of the bad guy was somewhat simpler , in the 1970s and ' 80s .
where are your bogeymen today ?
i do n't have any eternal bogeymen .
i wish they would one day become civilized or democratized .
i believe in the ability to change , not just in people , but also in societal structures .
and even such an inhuman paper as bild-zeitung - which can still be called the central organ of character assassination - could possibly develop differently in another social environment and at least let up with this aggressiveness .
it always has to do with personalities - who 's currently editor in chief ?
so , i do n't have any eternal bogeymen ; i also do n't speak of enemies , i speak of opponents , and such a thing as hatred is totally foreign to me .
i do n't hate anyone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bild is known for its bombastic front page what do you consider to be moral courage ? i think moral courage should be a compulsory subject in the schools instead of certain virtues that have returned to the forefront , such as industriousness , punctuality , etc .
i think that in germany of all places , moral courage should take that place instead , that is , that children should already learn in school to respect other cultures , other ways of life , minorities and also to stand up for them - also if it means taking risks .
that 's why i 'm often in schools - especially in eastern germany .
in the last 10 years , i 've given almost 100 presentations - in places where right-wing radicals are often quite dominant .
here and there , i 've even changed people 's attitudes . " lowest of the low , " the book for which you spent two years disguised as a turkish guest worker , was a huge success in germany in 1985 .
it was , according to one critic , the first time the germans realized that the turks , who were working hard for little money in the country 's factories and being treated like dirt , were real people .
is there now less discrimination against turks and others foreigners in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social standing has replaced origin as a basis if discrimination , wallraff says today it 's not the turks who are at the very bottom of society - it 's the workers from eastern europe : poles , romanians , construction workers who have no rights , who , where we used to earn six , eight deutschmarks -lsb- 3-4 euros -rsb- , now do it for two euros an hour .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the fact that - in addition to the three police officers - a german aid worker , a german businessman and three german soldiers have already been murdered in afghanistan this year , the federal government has not wasted a single thought on coming up with an exit strategy .
quite to the contrary : the costly deployment of tornado reconnaissance jets was added this year and an expansion of training afghan security personnel is under consideration .
by doing so , the government is avoiding an important question : what price are we ready to pay fort he reconstruction of afghanistan ?
this question gets even more explosive as it becomes clearer that influential forces in afghanistan are not interested in a stabilization of the country and fight this with all their might .
that 's a fundamental difference to what 's happening in other countries , where germany sends soldiers or aid workers .
it 's expensive and it costs a lot of lives to try and bring peace to afghanistan when the taliban are fighting it .
the murder of three police officers who guarded the german embassy in kabul shows that the perpetrators are now directly targeting the government .
it 's safe to assume that the taliban are trying to influence the political debate in germany as all three afghanistan mandates for the german military are up for renewal the fall .
of course it would be wrong to bend one 's knees because of the taliban 's terror .
but this argument must not be used to brush off justified doubts regarding the international reconstruction effort .
the afghan government bears some of the responsibility for the fact that not enough was accomplished during the past five years .
but the many tens of thousands of foreign soldiers and aid workers have also , in part , acted incorrectly and without coordination .
precious time and resources have been wasted as a result .
the german government has so far failed to honestly weigh the mission 's chances and risks .
while surveys show that a majority of germans is now against the deployment of more than 3,000 soldiers in afghanistan , most politicians continue to preach that it 's necessary to endure .
but following the murder of three german police officers , the government should no longer stall a factual discussion .
as long as every german in afghanistan has to fear for his life , reconstruction efforts ca n't be effective , anyway .

" this is a tragic case , but we must assume that it will be repeated , " gdp chairman konrad freiberg said in the daily hannoversche allgemeine zeitung .
" we are in the sights of the taliban and other islamist terrorist organizations . "
three german police officers responsible for protecting the german ambassador to afghanistan died and a fourth was injured when their vehicles were blown up on a road to the east of kabul on wednesday .
freiberg said terrorists were aiming to influence germany 's decision on whether to renew its deployment of german military and police in afghanistan , which parliament will consider in the coming months .
tanks for police ?
freiberg disagreed with proposals from the rival german police union , the dpolg , to outfit police in afghanistan with military equipment . dpolg chief wolfgang speck had called for them to be provided with tanks , armored vehicles and equipment to jam remote signals that could detonate bombs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police are helping to train their afghan colleagues " we do not want the police to be militarized , " freiberg said .
but he said security arrangements for the police should be reviewed .
the calls for reviewing the measures taken to protect german troops and officials in afghanistan were backed up by politicians from merkel 's christian democratic party and the opposition green party .
there was a broad consensus not to allow such attacks to influence germany 's commitment to afghanistan , deputy foreign minister gernot erler , a social democrat , said of the bombing .
germans not necessarily targeted contrary to initial reports from the afghan police , the slain germans ' all-terrain vehicles were not marked with any national emblems , such as flags , ard television said .

the road they took to reach the shooting range , and the range itself , were known as places frequently used by foreign security services .
police authorities were preparing to hold a memorial service for the three men in berlin 's central cathedral , the dom , on saturday .
all of them were between the ages of 30 and 40 .
merkel 's former bodyguard among those killed bild newspaper reported thursday that one of the victims had been a long-serving bodyguard to chancellor angela merkel .
the 31-year-old officer from nuremberg had planned to return to duties guarding merkel in december after a stint in the german embassy in kabul , the paper wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the men killed worked for the german embassy the officers , all of whom worked as security staff for the embassy , were the first german police to die in afghanistan since the beginning of germany 's mandate there . the deaths brought to 24 the number of germans who have been killed in afghanistan since german troops joined the nato-led international security assisstance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in 2001 .
some 3,000 german troops are engaged in reconstruction in northern afghanistan as part of the isaf . german politicians have vowed to continue with their peacekeeping mission in afghanistan despite the latest attacks .
german defense minister franz josef jung said on thursday , the taliban were trying to sway political debate by " underhanded , one-sided attacks . "

leaving controversy behind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can expellee groups keep young people interested ?
for 17-year-old veronika moll , the day of remembrance is not about international relations but about dancing .
moll , a high school student in munich , is part of a silesian folk dancing group that performs at events like tag der heimat , as well as at her hometown 's famous oktoberfest .
she also takes part in conferences about expellee issues and other cultural activities .
both of moll 's grandmothers were expelled from silesia , in southwestern poland , at the end of world war ii .
while some people of the older generation feel silesia belongs to them , moll said she does n't feel that way at all . although she still feels special ties to silesia , munich is home .
" it 's simply not the situation that you can go back to silesia , " she said .
" it 's too long ago .
it 's important to not forget the history and to make sure that everyone knows what happened and that an injustice occurred .

over the years it has evolved into a more progressive organization which promotes reconciliation and integration .

its museums are now worried that a new directive from russia 's culture ministry will make it tougher to track down the works . tucked away in the secret vaults of russian museums are a number of priceless works of art that germany says belong to it . the country 's museum directors believe that about 180,000 works taken from collections in berlin are in russia and poland .
the hague convention regulating wars on land requires art treasures seized by occupying forces to be returned .
but germany has had limited success in regaining such trophy art , and museum directors fear russia may be making it even more difficult since the country 's culture ministry purportedly issued a directive that calls for the creation of new inventory lists of everything that 's been stored in secret depots so far .
" the russian government is rewriting inventories because it wants to incorporate these items permanently in its own collections , " said klaus-dieter lehmann , head of the prussian cultural heritage foundation .
he said it would make it much harder to track works that were once looted from germany .
but contradictory reports have been commonplace in the decades-long dispute over art looted by the soviets during world war ii .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dürer 's drawing is again part of bremen 's city collection russian officials say they have dealt with the issue with transparency .
moscow historical museum 's deputy director , vadim leonidovitsch yegorov , denied the existence of a directive to rewrite russia 's inventories .
" i think negative people have thought it up so they can present russian researchers and museum people as greedy and miserly and not only restricting access to their own , but also to other people 's treasures , " he said .
spoils of war ?
in 1990 , germany and the soviet union expressly committed themselves to returning art objects that had been looted during the war .
but just a few years later , the russian government declared that artworks taken from germany were russian property .
" we ca n't give them back to germany , " said yegorov .
" because back then germany did n't respect russia and russian art treasures ; it treated them barbarically . "
one of the main bones of contention is the baldin collection .
bremen 's city art museum has demanded the return of the works by dürer , rembrandt and van gogh .
germany cites international law as well as the german-soviet agreement .
but the russians have remained intransigent on the issue .
" we are keeping it as part of a world cultural heritage that should be accessible to all , to researchers from all countries and the entire world , " yegorov said .
barrier to cooperation germany , however , refuses to accept that position .
and the dispute over looted art has become a hindrance to working with russian institutions , said lehmann of the prussian cultural heritage foundation .
" we are simply interested in cooperating with the russians in matters of art and culture , and this unresolved issue of looted art always gets in the way , " he said .
bildunterschrift : russian museums showed objects from the merovingian era that had been thought lost still , russian and german institutions have managed to work together on some research and exhibitions .
german museums regarded as a milestone this spring 's joint german-russian merovingian exhibition shown in moscow and st. petersburg which displayed objects art experts had considered lost .
meanwhile , the germans have demanded russia finally open its secret depots .
berlin 's museums have been drawing up new lists of lost artworks - partly in the hope that colleagues who gain access to the russian depots can pass on information .
and their efforts have already borne fruit , according to berlin 's museum of decorative arts .
" the catalogue of losses to the sculpture collection was only published a few weeks ago , and , despite everything , we have already been able to identify one of the objects in one of the russian depots in moscow , " the museum 's deputy director , lothar lambacher , said .
tit-for-tat but the real issue is getting negotiations over the return of looted art back on track .
berlin 's museum directors have received some backing from political quarters in calling for germany to stand up for its rights vis-a-vis the russian museums and government .
bildunterschrift : the merovingian show was an eye-opener for german art experts " for a while , the russian government seemed quite willing to discuss returning the works , " said steffen reiche , a member of the german parliament 's culture commission . "
then the russian parliament , the duma , put a stop to that .
and so here the german parliament should take a stance that is just as clear as the russian parliament 's position . " dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

its museums are now worried that a new directive from russia 's culture ministry will make it tougher to track down the works . tucked away in the secret vaults of russian museums are a number of priceless works of art that germany says belong to it . the country 's museum directors believe that about 180,000 works taken from collections in berlin are in russia and poland .

but germany has had limited success in regaining such trophy art , and museum directors fear russia may be making it even more difficult since the country 's culture ministry purportedly issued a directive that calls for the creation of new inventory lists of everything that 's been stored in secret depots so far .
" the russian government is rewriting inventories because it wants to incorporate these items permanently in its own collections , " said klaus-dieter lehmann , head of the prussian cultural heritage foundation .
he said it would make it much harder to track works that were once looted from germany .

spoils of war ?
in 1990 , germany and the soviet union expressly committed themselves to returning art objects that had been looted during the war .
but just a few years later , the russian government declared that artworks taken from germany were russian property .
" we ca n't give them back to germany , " said yegorov .
" because back then germany did n't respect russia and russian art treasures ; it treated them barbarically . "
one of the main bones of contention is the baldin collection .
bremen 's city art museum has demanded the return of the works by dürer , rembrandt and van gogh .
germany cites international law as well as the german-soviet agreement .
but the russians have remained intransigent on the issue .
" we are keeping it as part of a world cultural heritage that should be accessible to all , to researchers from all countries and the entire world , " yegorov said .
barrier to cooperation germany , however , refuses to accept that position .
and the dispute over looted art has become a hindrance to working with russian institutions , said lehmann of the prussian cultural heritage foundation .
" we are simply interested in cooperating with the russians in matters of art and culture , and this unresolved issue of looted art always gets in the way , " he said .
bildunterschrift : russian museums showed objects from the merovingian era that had been thought lost still , russian and german institutions have managed to work together on some research and exhibitions .

berlin 's museums have been drawing up new lists of lost artworks - partly in the hope that colleagues who gain access to the russian depots can pass on information .

politicians have called for a new effort to educate young people about the true nature of east germany after recently surfaced shoot-to-kill orders have rekindled a debate about conditions in the communist country . volker kauder , the parliamentary leader for germany 's governing christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , told the berliner zeitung on thursday that his party would take steps to raise awareness about eastern germany 's communist past . " we have worked enormously hard to deal with the past of the third reich 's terror system and continue to do so , but we 've done much too little when it comes to dealing with the gdr dictatorship , " he said .
" when looking at the alarming lack of knowledge about the gdr past among the younger generation , we should use the current debate to clarify who was responsible . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonners may be surprised to learn that some think the former west german capital was in the gdr on wednesday , germany 's mass tabloid bild had asked young germans what they knew about the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- .
while some said that east germans were n't allowed to travel , others pointed out that there was a high level of unemployment , that people liked to bathe in the nude and that no one was able to buy fashionable clothes .

on wednesday , agency officials uncovered a similar document .
unlike the first one , however , it was signed by a high-ranking stasi official , making it potentially more significant for a criminal investigation .
a legal expert said that the second document might have led to different rulings in previous border shooting trials , where guards , who claimed that they had acted in self-defense , were acquitted . " but it 's unlikely that the cases will be reopened now , " ferdinand von schirach , who defended a top-level gdr official in the 1990s , told dw-world.de. agency under pressure the stasi file agency 's head , marianne birthler , has faced intense pressure in recent days for her handling of the situation , with some saying that she is trying to prevent the swift dismantling of her office and the transfer of the stasi files into germany 's federal archives .

politicians have called for a new effort to educate young people about the true nature of east germany after recently surfaced shoot-to-kill orders have rekindled a debate about conditions in the communist country . volker kauder , the parliamentary leader for germany 's governing christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , told the berliner zeitung on thursday that his party would take steps to raise awareness about eastern germany 's communist past .

but peter beines is more than an average enthusiast - he 's the head elvis ' largest german-language fan club . peter beines has not only fills his living room with a huge collection of elvis posters and records - one of which bears elvis ' original signature - he 's also the head of the largest german-language fan club devoted to the king . " i 've been an elvis fan since 1974 , " the 44-year-old said from his bonn apartment before leaving for the memorial in graceland .
" back then i was 11 years old and found out about a concert he played in las vegas through a magazine article . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans have not forgotten elvis , some are even convinced he 's still alive the amount of charisma that elvis was able to get across in just a magazine photo impressed beines so much that he began collecting elvis records and clipping news articles about the king throughout his teenage years .
the collection grew to the point that his apartment now resembles an elvis museum . " most of all it was about his music , " beines said .
" then about his vibrancy , his charisma .
especially the things he did on stage during his concerts .
third i liked his human characteristics . " elvis ' last song , " way down , " recorded in his home in august 1977 , is perhaps indicative of the last few years of his career .
while professionally he suffered as hit bands the beatles and the rolling stones drew more attention , privately he battled obesity and drug dependency . fans continue to remember their king at the age of 42 , elvis was found dead in the bathroom of his graceland mansion in memphis on aug .
16 , 1977 .
doctors said his death was caused by heart failure , likely brought on by obesity and years of abusing medications .
biographer alanna nash characterized his dependency as an inability to accept what had become of himself , leading him to attempt to kill the pain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : half of graceland 's visitors are under 35 years old even as the rumors of elvis being spotted at deserted gas stations around the world continue to spread , impersonators who dress , swing and croon like the king himself pay regular tribute to the rock and roll legend .
fans have also created over 500 official elvis fan clubs in over 45 countries . on the 20th anniversary of his death in 1997 a video elvis appeared on stage with over thirty of his former band mates in the production elvis in concert ' 97 at the mid-south coliseum in memphis , tenn .
the show went on to tour the us and in 1999 the european tour opened in london , marking elvis ' first-ever concert outside of north america . an international sensation since 1954 more than one billion elvis records have been sold - a feat no other artist is yet to accomplish - and he won three grammy awards from 14 nominations . however , his fame did n't just hit american airwaves .
elvis ' trophy room at graceland is filled with gold and platinum records from around the world - including germany , although five concerts in canada in were his only performances outside the united states . with a song catalog of over 1,000 titles , german fan beines said it 's nearly impossible to pick just one favorite song . " if i had to choose one , then for me it 'd be ' an american trilogy , " ' beines said .
" but like nearly all fans , i could name 50 songs and always think of another that should be on the list .
it 'd be better just to choose 100 favorites . " a less glittery private life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elvis preseley served the us military in friedberg where he met his wife priscilla while his career was all glitz and gold , elvis ' private life was less than easy .
the son of a laborer and seamstress , he was born in tupelo , mississippi , and grew up alone after his twin brother was stillborn .
on his 10th birthday , instead of the bicycle he had hoped for , elvis was given a guitar and he taught himself to play . unlike today 's pop sensations , elvis served his country at the us ray barracks in friedberg , germany between 1958 and 1960 .
it was during this time that he met his future bride , priscilla beaulieu , the daughter of a us air force officer . elvis and priscilla married in las vegas in 1967 and nine months later daughter lisa marie was born .
however , priscilla complained that elvis had little time for his family and of a destructive cycle of sleeping pills , stimulants and sedatives .
the couple divorced in 1973 . although his earnings continued to climb and still do even after his death -lrb- for decades elvis led forbes magazine 's list of the biggest earning deceased celebrities -rrb- , by the mid-1970 's he could barely bring himself to swing his hips on stage . article based on news reports -lrb- sjr -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the chancellor 's not alone in her interest in the arctic : ever more states are attracted by the region 's resources . german chancellor angela merkel heads to greenland on thursday for a two-day visit with danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen .
the two politicians will ply the ilulissat fjord , over 300 kilometers -lrb- 186 miles -rrb- above the arctic circle , where one of the world 's biggest glaciers is gradually melting .
global warming is especially evident on the danish island , where the temperatures have been increasing twice as quickly as the world average .
" it 's good that a german chancellor examines the issues of climate change where its effects are especially easy to recognize , " said german climate expert peter lemke .
" politicians should also see for themselves where and how climate change occurs . "
merkel 's not the first politician to visit the spot .
she follows in the footsteps of italian prime minister romano prodi , european commission chief jose manuel barroso , nancy pelosi , speaker of the us house of representatives , and presidential candidate john mccain .
international interest and the region has n't only drawn attention due to growing concern about climate change .
the arctic is believed to be rich in resources .
however , until the ice started to melt , they were inaccessible .
climate researchers now say that the arctic could be ice-free by the summer of 2040 .
shipping is likely to take off , and it may then be affordable to excavate the gas and oil thought to be buried there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the russians will have to do more to cement their claims in early august , russian researchers planted a rust-free titanium russian flag on the ocean floor beneath the north pole to mark their country 's claim to the area .
denmark has also sent an arctic mission to back up its claims to the region .
and canadian premier stephen harper announced plans last week to establish a deep-sea port and a military base in the arctic .
a study by the us geological survey estimates the arctic has as much as 25 percent of the world 's undiscovered oil and gas .
but some say that 's just speculation .
geophysicist wilfried jodak of germany 's alfred wegener institute for polar and marine research -lrb- awi -rrb- is one of the skeptics .
the geo-scientific data from the area north of the arctic circle was too meager to identify any deposits , he said .
claims deadline looms " arctic research is expensive and was so unattractive until a few years ago , that hardly any public means were provided for research , " he said , adding that expanding territorial claims had not previously been a factor at all .
" the russians got that rolling . "
moscow is in a hurry to prove that the lomonosov ridge in the northern arctic ocean is a continuation of the russian mainland .
the 1982 un convention on law of the sea allows states to use the waters up to 200 sea miles -lrb- 370 kilometers -rrb- off their coasts as economic areas .
those governments that want to make further claims must submit requests to the un by may 2009 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arctic could be ice-free by 2040 any state missing the 2009 deadline risks losing un recognition of the claim .
countries that have not yet ratifed the law of the sea convention , including the united states , are not bound by the 2009 deadline .
the arctic push is a result of this deadline , according to jodak of the awi : " so that the claims have been resolved if at some point it turns out that there really are rich resource deposits in the northern arctic . "
shared heritage ?
thus , the clock is ticking for russia , denmark and canada , all of which view themselves as having the ultimate claim to the arctic sea .
" the arctic does n't belong to any state alone , " said moscow sea expert anatoly kolodkin of the un 's international tribunal of the law of the sea .
the arctic sea was part of " man 's common heritage , " he said , adding that the issue was , nevertheless , about who had the rights to explore and develop the resources there . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said fertilizer nitrates are leaking into the baltic sea from farms and estuaries . in addition , across one sixth of the baltic , algae flowers now bloom where plants and animals once lived - with serious consequences for the ecosystem . " on the top of the water it looks like a normal sea , but on the bottom , there is very little which still lives , " he said . waste being dumped into baltic sea however , dietrich schulz of the german federal environment agency said that fertilization runoff from crops is not the biggest issue . schulz , who is part of a group working on ways to lessen the impact of animal by-products on the baltic , said that the water near the new eu states in eastern europe , and in belarus and russia , suffers from another problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " death zone " paradise ?
" the bigger problem is that the animal farms in the area have no place to discard their waste , so the farmers tend to just discharge it into the water , " he said . in november , experts will present the baltic action plan to the helsinki commission , a collaboration of all the countries that surround the baltic , in november . calls for sustainable practices good agricultural practices could be binding for eu members , but we also have russia and belarus as members of the helsinki commission and they are not within the eu schemes , schulz said .

within the euro zone , only portugal 's economic situation was described as poor .
sinn added that expectations for the coming six months were positive in all euro zone countries with the exceptions of ireland and spain , where experts forecast a slowdown in the second half of the year .
the interviews were conducted at the end of july and the beginning of august and do not take into consideration the last 10 days .

the chancellor 's not alone in her interest in the arctic : ever more states are attracted by the region 's resources . german chancellor angela merkel heads to greenland on thursday for a two-day visit with danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen .
the two politicians will ply the ilulissat fjord , over 300 kilometers -lrb- 186 miles -rrb- above the arctic circle , where one of the world 's biggest glaciers is gradually melting .
global warming is especially evident on the danish island , where the temperatures have been increasing twice as quickly as the world average .
" it 's good that a german chancellor examines the issues of climate change where its effects are especially easy to recognize , " said german climate expert peter lemke .
" politicians should also see for themselves where and how climate change occurs . "
merkel 's not the first politician to visit the spot .
she follows in the footsteps of italian prime minister romano prodi , european commission chief jose manuel barroso , nancy pelosi , speaker of the us house of representatives , and presidential candidate john mccain .
international interest and the region has n't only drawn attention due to growing concern about climate change .
the arctic is believed to be rich in resources .
however , until the ice started to melt , they were inaccessible .
climate researchers now say that the arctic could be ice-free by the summer of 2040 .
shipping is likely to take off , and it may then be affordable to excavate the gas and oil thought to be buried there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the russians will have to do more to cement their claims in early august , russian researchers planted a rust-free titanium russian flag on the ocean floor beneath the north pole to mark their country 's claim to the area .
denmark has also sent an arctic mission to back up its claims to the region .
and canadian premier stephen harper announced plans last week to establish a deep-sea port and a military base in the arctic .
a study by the us geological survey estimates the arctic has as much as 25 percent of the world 's undiscovered oil and gas .
but some say that 's just speculation .
geophysicist wilfried jodak of germany 's alfred wegener institute for polar and marine research -lrb- awi -rrb- is one of the skeptics .
the geo-scientific data from the area north of the arctic circle was too meager to identify any deposits , he said .
claims deadline looms " arctic research is expensive and was so unattractive until a few years ago , that hardly any public means were provided for research , " he said , adding that expanding territorial claims had not previously been a factor at all .
" the russians got that rolling . "
moscow is in a hurry to prove that the lomonosov ridge in the northern arctic ocean is a continuation of the russian mainland .
the 1982 un convention on law of the sea allows states to use the waters up to 200 sea miles -lrb- 370 kilometers -rrb- off their coasts as economic areas .
those governments that want to make further claims must submit requests to the un by may 2009 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arctic could be ice-free by 2040 any state missing the 2009 deadline risks losing un recognition of the claim .
countries that have not yet ratifed the law of the sea convention , including the united states , are not bound by the 2009 deadline .
the arctic push is a result of this deadline , according to jodak of the awi : " so that the claims have been resolved if at some point it turns out that there really are rich resource deposits in the northern arctic . "
shared heritage ?
thus , the clock is ticking for russia , denmark and canada , all of which view themselves as having the ultimate claim to the arctic sea .
" the arctic does n't belong to any state alone , " said moscow sea expert anatoly kolodkin of the un 's international tribunal of the law of the sea .
the arctic sea was part of " man 's common heritage , " he said , adding that the issue was , nevertheless , about who had the rights to explore and develop the resources there . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

its museums are now worried that a new directive from russia 's culture ministry will make it tougher to track down the works . tucked away in the secret vaults of russian museums are a number of priceless works of art that germany says belong to it . the country 's museum directors believe that about 180,000 works taken from collections in berlin are in russia and poland .
the hague convention regulating wars on land requires art treasures seized by occupying forces to be returned .
but germany has had limited success in regaining such trophy art , and museum directors fear russia may be making it even more difficult since the country 's culture ministry purportedly issued a directive that calls for the creation of new inventory lists of everything that 's been stored in secret depots so far .
" the russian government is rewriting inventories because it wants to incorporate these items permanently in its own collections , " said klaus-dieter lehmann , head of the prussian cultural heritage foundation .
he said it would make it much harder to track works that were once looted from germany .
but contradictory reports have been commonplace in the decades-long dispute over art looted by the soviets during world war ii .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dürer 's drawing is again part of bremen 's city collection russian officials say they have dealt with the issue with transparency .
moscow historical museum 's deputy director , vadim leonidovitsch yegorov , denied the existence of a directive to rewrite russia 's inventories .
" i think negative people have thought it up so they can present russian researchers and museum people as greedy and miserly and not only restricting access to their own , but also to other people 's treasures , " he said .
spoils of war ?
in 1990 , germany and the soviet union expressly committed themselves to returning art objects that had been looted during the war .
but just a few years later , the russian government declared that artworks taken from germany were russian property .
" we ca n't give them back to germany , " said yegorov .
" because back then germany did n't respect russia and russian art treasures ; it treated them barbarically . "
one of the main bones of contention is the baldin collection .
bremen 's city art museum has demanded the return of the works by dürer , rembrandt and van gogh .
germany cites international law as well as the german-soviet agreement .
but the russians have remained intransigent on the issue .
" we are keeping it as part of a world cultural heritage that should be accessible to all , to researchers from all countries and the entire world , " yegorov said .
barrier to cooperation germany , however , refuses to accept that position .
and the dispute over looted art has become a hindrance to working with russian institutions , said lehmann of the prussian cultural heritage foundation .
" we are simply interested in cooperating with the russians in matters of art and culture , and this unresolved issue of looted art always gets in the way , " he said .
bildunterschrift : russian museums showed objects from the merovingian era that had been thought lost still , russian and german institutions have managed to work together on some research and exhibitions .
german museums regarded as a milestone this spring 's joint german-russian merovingian exhibition shown in moscow and st. petersburg which displayed objects art experts had considered lost .
meanwhile , the germans have demanded russia finally open its secret depots .
berlin 's museums have been drawing up new lists of lost artworks - partly in the hope that colleagues who gain access to the russian depots can pass on information .
and their efforts have already borne fruit , according to berlin 's museum of decorative arts .
" the catalogue of losses to the sculpture collection was only published a few weeks ago , and , despite everything , we have already been able to identify one of the objects in one of the russian depots in moscow , " the museum 's deputy director , lothar lambacher , said .
tit-for-tat but the real issue is getting negotiations over the return of looted art back on track .
berlin 's museum directors have received some backing from political quarters in calling for germany to stand up for its rights vis-a-vis the russian museums and government .
bildunterschrift : the merovingian show was an eye-opener for german art experts " for a while , the russian government seemed quite willing to discuss returning the works , " said steffen reiche , a member of the german parliament 's culture commission . "
then the russian parliament , the duma , put a stop to that .
and so here the german parliament should take a stance that is just as clear as the russian parliament 's position . " dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

its museums are now worried that a new directive from russia 's culture ministry will make it tougher to track down the works . tucked away in the secret vaults of russian museums are a number of priceless works of art that germany says belong to it . the country 's museum directors believe that about 180,000 works taken from collections in berlin are in russia and poland .
the hague convention regulating wars on land requires art treasures seized by occupying forces to be returned .
but germany has had limited success in regaining such trophy art , and museum directors fear russia may be making it even more difficult since the country 's culture ministry purportedly issued a directive that calls for the creation of new inventory lists of everything that 's been stored in secret depots so far .
" the russian government is rewriting inventories because it wants to incorporate these items permanently in its own collections , " said klaus-dieter lehmann , head of the prussian cultural heritage foundation .
he said it would make it much harder to track works that were once looted from germany .
but contradictory reports have been commonplace in the decades-long dispute over art looted by the soviets during world war ii .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dürer 's drawing is again part of bremen 's city collection russian officials say they have dealt with the issue with transparency .
moscow historical museum 's deputy director , vadim leonidovitsch yegorov , denied the existence of a directive to rewrite russia 's inventories .
" i think negative people have thought it up so they can present russian researchers and museum people as greedy and miserly and not only restricting access to their own , but also to other people 's treasures , " he said .
spoils of war ?
in 1990 , germany and the soviet union expressly committed themselves to returning art objects that had been looted during the war .
but just a few years later , the russian government declared that artworks taken from germany were russian property .
" we ca n't give them back to germany , " said yegorov .
" because back then germany did n't respect russia and russian art treasures ; it treated them barbarically . "
one of the main bones of contention is the baldin collection .
bremen 's city art museum has demanded the return of the works by dürer , rembrandt and van gogh .
germany cites international law as well as the german-soviet agreement .
but the russians have remained intransigent on the issue .
" we are keeping it as part of a world cultural heritage that should be accessible to all , to researchers from all countries and the entire world , " yegorov said .
barrier to cooperation germany , however , refuses to accept that position .
and the dispute over looted art has become a hindrance to working with russian institutions , said lehmann of the prussian cultural heritage foundation .
" we are simply interested in cooperating with the russians in matters of art and culture , and this unresolved issue of looted art always gets in the way , " he said .
bildunterschrift : russian museums showed objects from the merovingian era that had been thought lost still , russian and german institutions have managed to work together on some research and exhibitions .
german museums regarded as a milestone this spring 's joint german-russian merovingian exhibition shown in moscow and st. petersburg which displayed objects art experts had considered lost .
meanwhile , the germans have demanded russia finally open its secret depots .
berlin 's museums have been drawing up new lists of lost artworks - partly in the hope that colleagues who gain access to the russian depots can pass on information .
and their efforts have already borne fruit , according to berlin 's museum of decorative arts .
" the catalogue of losses to the sculpture collection was only published a few weeks ago , and , despite everything , we have already been able to identify one of the objects in one of the russian depots in moscow , " the museum 's deputy director , lothar lambacher , said .
tit-for-tat but the real issue is getting negotiations over the return of looted art back on track .
berlin 's museum directors have received some backing from political quarters in calling for germany to stand up for its rights vis-a-vis the russian museums and government .
bildunterschrift : the merovingian show was an eye-opener for german art experts " for a while , the russian government seemed quite willing to discuss returning the works , " said steffen reiche , a member of the german parliament 's culture commission . "
then the russian parliament , the duma , put a stop to that .
and so here the german parliament should take a stance that is just as clear as the russian parliament 's position . " dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 16.08.2007 opinion : it 's time to review germany 's afghan mission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : following the murder of three police officers in afghanistan , germany 's government should heed criticism of its reconstruction efforts in the country and pause to figure out how to proceed , says dw 's nina werkhäuser . whenever germans are murdered in afghanistan , politicians unload a bag of reassurances : they say that it 's tragic and sad , but certainly no reason to reduce germany 's mission in afghanistan . # b # despite the fact that - in addition to the three police officers - a german aid worker , a german businessman and three german soldiers have already been murdered in afghanistan this year , the federal government has not wasted a single thought on coming up with an exit strategy .
quite to the contrary : the costly deployment of tornado reconnaissance jets was added this year and an expansion of training afghan security personnel is under consideration .
by doing so , the government is avoiding an important question : what price are we ready to pay fort he reconstruction of afghanistan ?
this question gets even more explosive as it becomes clearer that influential forces in afghanistan are not interested in a stabilization of the country and fight this with all their might .
that 's a fundamental difference to what 's happening in other countries , where germany sends soldiers or aid workers .
it 's expensive and it costs a lot of lives to try and bring peace to afghanistan when the taliban are fighting it .
the murder of three police officers who guarded the german embassy in kabul shows that the perpetrators are now directly targeting the government .
it 's safe to assume that the taliban are trying to influence the political debate in germany as all three afghanistan mandates for the german military are up for renewal the fall .
of course it would be wrong to bend one 's knees because of the taliban 's terror .
but this argument must not be used to brush off justified doubts regarding the international reconstruction effort .
the afghan government bears some of the responsibility for the fact that not enough was accomplished during the past five years .
but the many tens of thousands of foreign soldiers and aid workers have also , in part , acted incorrectly and without coordination .
precious time and resources have been wasted as a result .
the german government has so far failed to honestly weigh the mission 's chances and risks .
while surveys show that a majority of germans is now against the deployment of more than 3,000 soldiers in afghanistan , most politicians continue to preach that it 's necessary to endure .
but following the murder of three german police officers , the government should no longer stall a factual discussion .
as long as every german in afghanistan has to fear for his life , reconstruction efforts ca n't be effective , anyway .

steinberg , the author of a recent study on violence in iraq , said he believes a federal solution could help the country move forward peacefully . dw-world.de : what are the conclusions of your study ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido steinberg said a second iraqi civil war in the north was possible guido steinberg : looking at the situation in iraq today , i do n't think that it is that important anymore whether the us security plan in baghdad and central iraq is successful or not .
what i think is important is that the iraqi actors do n't come to terms with each other .
within the next couple of years , i think we will see an escalation of conflict not only in baghdad , but rather in the north and the south of the country : in the north , over the incorporation of the kirkuk into the turkish autonomy zone ; and in the south , over the control of the southern shiite areas .
this is why i think that only a federal solution can smooth this process of breaking off of iraq . some commentators say that it is too late , that iraqis themselves are set into partitioning the country into shiite , sunni and kurdish areas .
are the political differences between these groups fundamentally irreconcilable ? i do n't think that partition is a solution , because there will be no clear cut for the three parts .
the country will totally disintegrate .
i 'd rather see four or five iraq 's emerging .
this is why i think the only hope for us to come to any solution in iraq , in the long term , is a federalization , which might be called soft partition . a referendum is due to take place on the future status of the city of kirkuk , which the kurds regard as kurdish and want to be included in their province , but there is fierce resistance by turkmen and sunnis living there .
how significant is this issue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurds regard the citiy of kirkuk as their own it is extremely significant .
i argue in my study that it might be the most significant topic in the coming months .
what we are witnessing already is an escalation of violence .
it is exactly the territories where kurds , turkmen and arabs live together .
i think this is a deliberant attempt on the part of al qaeda in iraq and other terrorist organizations to provoke a civil war in the north of the country .
i think if the kirkuk issue is not solved between the political parties in baghdad , this second civil war , in the northern part of the country , might take place . the real danger for the rest of the year 2007 and for the year 2008 is for an intervention by the neighbors , because if the conflict escalates in the north of iraq , if the turkmen , for example , are increasingly targeted by the terrorists , it is more likely that the neighbors will try to intervene - if not directly , then indirectly - as iran already does in southern iraq . nathan witkop interviewed guido steinberg -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 16.08.2007 thirty years without the king großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands pay tribute to elvis on the anniversaries of his birth and death there was at least one german among the 75,000 in graceland to pay tribute to the king of rock and roll .
but peter beines is more than an average enthusiast - he 's the head elvis ' largest german-language fan club . peter beines has not only fills his living room with a huge collection of elvis posters and records - one of which bears elvis ' original signature - he 's also the head of the largest german-language fan club devoted to the king . " i 've been an elvis fan since 1974 , " the 44-year-old said from his bonn apartment before leaving for the memorial in graceland .
" back then i was 11 years old and found out about a concert he played in las vegas through a magazine article . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans have not forgotten elvis , some are even convinced he 's still alive the amount of charisma that elvis was able to get across in just a magazine photo impressed beines so much that he began collecting elvis records and clipping news articles about the king throughout his teenage years .
the collection grew to the point that his apartment now resembles an elvis museum . " most of all it was about his music , " beines said .
" then about his vibrancy , his charisma .
especially the things he did on stage during his concerts .
third i liked his human characteristics . " elvis ' last song , " way down , " recorded in his home in august 1977 , is perhaps indicative of the last few years of his career .
while professionally he suffered as hit bands the beatles and the rolling stones drew more attention , privately he battled obesity and drug dependency . fans continue to remember their king at the age of 42 , elvis was found dead in the bathroom of his graceland mansion in memphis on aug .
16 , 1977 .
doctors said his death was caused by heart failure , likely brought on by obesity and years of abusing medications .
biographer alanna nash characterized his dependency as an inability to accept what had become of himself , leading him to attempt to kill the pain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : half of graceland 's visitors are under 35 years old even as the rumors of elvis being spotted at deserted gas stations around the world continue to spread , impersonators who dress , swing and croon like the king himself pay regular tribute to the rock and roll legend .
fans have also created over 500 official elvis fan clubs in over 45 countries . on the 20th anniversary of his death in 1997 a video elvis appeared on stage with over thirty of his former band mates in the production elvis in concert ' 97 at the mid-south coliseum in memphis , tenn .
the show went on to tour the us and in 1999 the european tour opened in london , marking elvis ' first-ever concert outside of north america . an international sensation since 1954 more than one billion elvis records have been sold - a feat no other artist is yet to accomplish - and he won three grammy awards from 14 nominations . however , his fame did n't just hit american airwaves .
elvis ' trophy room at graceland is filled with gold and platinum records from around the world - including germany , although five concerts in canada in were his only performances outside the united states . with a song catalog of over 1,000 titles , german fan beines said it 's nearly impossible to pick just one favorite song . " if i had to choose one , then for me it 'd be ' an american trilogy , " ' beines said .
" but like nearly all fans , i could name 50 songs and always think of another that should be on the list .
it 'd be better just to choose 100 favorites . " a less glittery private life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elvis preseley served the us military in friedberg where he met his wife priscilla while his career was all glitz and gold , elvis ' private life was less than easy .
the son of a laborer and seamstress , he was born in tupelo , mississippi , and grew up alone after his twin brother was stillborn .
on his 10th birthday , instead of the bicycle he had hoped for , elvis was given a guitar and he taught himself to play . unlike today 's pop sensations , elvis served his country at the us ray barracks in friedberg , germany between 1958 and 1960 .

doctors said his death was caused by heart failure , likely brought on by obesity and years of abusing medications .
biographer alanna nash characterized his dependency as an inability to accept what had become of himself , leading him to attempt to kill the pain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : half of graceland 's visitors are under 35 years old even as the rumors of elvis being spotted at deserted gas stations around the world continue to spread , impersonators who dress , swing and croon like the king himself pay regular tribute to the rock and roll legend .
fans have also created over 500 official elvis fan clubs in over 45 countries . on the 20th anniversary of his death in 1997 a video elvis appeared on stage with over thirty of his former band mates in the production elvis in concert ' 97 at the mid-south coliseum in memphis , tenn .
the show went on to tour the us and in 1999 the european tour opened in london , marking elvis ' first-ever concert outside of north america . an international sensation since 1954 more than one billion elvis records have been sold - a feat no other artist is yet to accomplish - and he won three grammy awards from 14 nominations . however , his fame did n't just hit american airwaves .
elvis ' trophy room at graceland is filled with gold and platinum records from around the world - including germany , although five concerts in canada in were his only performances outside the united states . with a song catalog of over 1,000 titles , german fan beines said it 's nearly impossible to pick just one favorite song . " if i had to choose one , then for me it 'd be ' an american trilogy , " ' beines said .
" but like nearly all fans , i could name 50 songs and always think of another that should be on the list .
it 'd be better just to choose 100 favorites . " a less glittery private life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elvis preseley served the us military in friedberg where he met his wife priscilla while his career was all glitz and gold , elvis ' private life was less than easy .
the son of a laborer and seamstress , he was born in tupelo , mississippi , and grew up alone after his twin brother was stillborn .
on his 10th birthday , instead of the bicycle he had hoped for , elvis was given a guitar and he taught himself to play . unlike today 's pop sensations , elvis served his country at the us ray barracks in friedberg , germany between 1958 and 1960 .
it was during this time that he met his future bride , priscilla beaulieu , the daughter of a us air force officer . elvis and priscilla married in las vegas in 1967 and nine months later daughter lisa marie was born .
however , priscilla complained that elvis had little time for his family and of a destructive cycle of sleeping pills , stimulants and sedatives .
the couple divorced in 1973 . although his earnings continued to climb and still do even after his death -lrb- for decades elvis led forbes magazine 's list of the biggest earning deceased celebrities -rrb- , by the mid-1970 's he could barely bring himself to swing his hips on stage . article based on news reports -lrb- sjr -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

steinberg , the author of a recent study on violence in iraq , said he believes a federal solution could help the country move forward peacefully . dw-world.de : what are the conclusions of your study ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido steinberg said a second iraqi civil war in the north was possible guido steinberg : looking at the situation in iraq today , i do n't think that it is that important anymore whether the us security plan in baghdad and central iraq is successful or not .
what i think is important is that the iraqi actors do n't come to terms with each other .
within the next couple of years , i think we will see an escalation of conflict not only in baghdad , but rather in the north and the south of the country : in the north , over the incorporation of the kirkuk into the turkish autonomy zone ; and in the south , over the control of the southern shiite areas .
this is why i think that only a federal solution can smooth this process of breaking off of iraq . some commentators say that it is too late , that iraqis themselves are set into partitioning the country into shiite , sunni and kurdish areas .
are the political differences between these groups fundamentally irreconcilable ? i do n't think that partition is a solution , because there will be no clear cut for the three parts .
the country will totally disintegrate .
i 'd rather see four or five iraq 's emerging .
this is why i think the only hope for us to come to any solution in iraq , in the long term , is a federalization , which might be called soft partition . a referendum is due to take place on the future status of the city of kirkuk , which the kurds regard as kurdish and want to be included in their province , but there is fierce resistance by turkmen and sunnis living there .
how significant is this issue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurds regard the citiy of kirkuk as their own it is extremely significant .
i argue in my study that it might be the most significant topic in the coming months .
what we are witnessing already is an escalation of violence .
it is exactly the territories where kurds , turkmen and arabs live together .
i think this is a deliberant attempt on the part of al qaeda in iraq and other terrorist organizations to provoke a civil war in the north of the country .
i think if the kirkuk issue is not solved between the political parties in baghdad , this second civil war , in the northern part of the country , might take place . the real danger for the rest of the year 2007 and for the year 2008 is for an intervention by the neighbors , because if the conflict escalates in the north of iraq , if the turkmen , for example , are increasingly targeted by the terrorists , it is more likely that the neighbors will try to intervene - if not directly , then indirectly - as iran already does in southern iraq . nathan witkop interviewed guido steinberg -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the chancellor 's not alone in her interest in the arctic : ever more states are attracted by the region 's resources . german chancellor angela merkel heads to greenland on thursday for a two-day visit with danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen .
the two politicians will ply the ilulissat fjord , over 300 kilometers -lrb- 186 miles -rrb- above the arctic circle , where one of the world 's biggest glaciers is gradually melting .
global warming is especially evident on the danish island , where the temperatures have been increasing twice as quickly as the world average .
" it 's good that a german chancellor examines the issues of climate change where its effects are especially easy to recognize , " said german climate expert peter lemke .
" politicians should also see for themselves where and how climate change occurs . "
merkel 's not the first politician to visit the spot .
she follows in the footsteps of italian prime minister romano prodi , european commission chief jose manuel barroso , nancy pelosi , speaker of the us house of representatives , and presidential candidate john mccain .
international interest and the region has n't only drawn attention due to growing concern about climate change .
the arctic is believed to be rich in resources .
however , until the ice started to melt , they were inaccessible .
climate researchers now say that the arctic could be ice-free by the summer of 2040 .
shipping is likely to take off , and it may then be affordable to excavate the gas and oil thought to be buried there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the russians will have to do more to cement their claims in early august , russian researchers planted a rust-free titanium russian flag on the ocean floor beneath the north pole to mark their country 's claim to the area .
denmark has also sent an arctic mission to back up its claims to the region .
and canadian premier stephen harper announced plans last week to establish a deep-sea port and a military base in the arctic .
a study by the us geological survey estimates the arctic has as much as 25 percent of the world 's undiscovered oil and gas .
but some say that 's just speculation .
geophysicist wilfried jodak of germany 's alfred wegener institute for polar and marine research -lrb- awi -rrb- is one of the skeptics .
the geo-scientific data from the area north of the arctic circle was too meager to identify any deposits , he said .
claims deadline looms " arctic research is expensive and was so unattractive until a few years ago , that hardly any public means were provided for research , " he said , adding that expanding territorial claims had not previously been a factor at all .
" the russians got that rolling . "
moscow is in a hurry to prove that the lomonosov ridge in the northern arctic ocean is a continuation of the russian mainland .
the 1982 un convention on law of the sea allows states to use the waters up to 200 sea miles -lrb- 370 kilometers -rrb- off their coasts as economic areas .
those governments that want to make further claims must submit requests to the un by may 2009 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arctic could be ice-free by 2040 any state missing the 2009 deadline risks losing un recognition of the claim .
countries that have not yet ratifed the law of the sea convention , including the united states , are not bound by the 2009 deadline .
the arctic push is a result of this deadline , according to jodak of the awi : " so that the claims have been resolved if at some point it turns out that there really are rich resource deposits in the northern arctic . "
shared heritage ?
thus , the clock is ticking for russia , denmark and canada , all of which view themselves as having the ultimate claim to the arctic sea .
" the arctic does n't belong to any state alone , " said moscow sea expert anatoly kolodkin of the un 's international tribunal of the law of the sea .
the arctic sea was part of " man 's common heritage , " he said , adding that the issue was , nevertheless , about who had the rights to explore and develop the resources there . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

politicians have called for a new effort to educate young people about the true nature of east germany after recently surfaced shoot-to-kill orders have rekindled a debate about conditions in the communist country . volker kauder , the parliamentary leader for germany 's governing christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , told the berliner zeitung on thursday that his party would take steps to raise awareness about eastern germany 's communist past . " we have worked enormously hard to deal with the past of the third reich 's terror system and continue to do so , but we 've done much too little when it comes to dealing with the gdr dictatorship , " he said .
" when looking at the alarming lack of knowledge about the gdr past among the younger generation , we should use the current debate to clarify who was responsible . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonners may be surprised to learn that some think the former west german capital was in the gdr on wednesday , germany 's mass tabloid bild had asked young germans what they knew about the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- .
while some said that east germans were n't allowed to travel , others pointed out that there was a high level of unemployment , that people liked to bathe in the nude and that no one was able to buy fashionable clothes .

" hitler was the boss and he had a wall build around his empire , " he added . second document found the current debate surrounding life in the gdr was sparked by a shoot-to-kill order that resurfaced over the weekend .
it called on members of the east german secret police , the stasi , to use their weapons to prevent people from fleeing across the german-german border , even if women and children were involved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stasi file agency head marianne birthler is feeling the heat the federal agency that administers the stasi files came under pressure for presenting the document as a sensational find after it became obvious that the order had been known to researchers and state prosecutors for years .
on wednesday , agency officials uncovered a similar document .
unlike the first one , however , it was signed by a high-ranking stasi official , making it potentially more significant for a criminal investigation .
a legal expert said that the second document might have led to different rulings in previous border shooting trials , where guards , who claimed that they had acted in self-defense , were acquitted .

birthler has suggested the year 2019 for such a merger .
members of the opposition free-market liberal free democrats and the cdu 's junior coalition partner , the social democrats , have called for quick reforms of the birthler agency as a result of the recent developments .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the fact that - in addition to the three police officers - a german aid worker , a german businessman and three german soldiers have already been murdered in afghanistan this year , the federal government has not wasted a single thought on coming up with an exit strategy .
quite to the contrary : the costly deployment of tornado reconnaissance jets was added this year and an expansion of training afghan security personnel is under consideration .
by doing so , the government is avoiding an important question : what price are we ready to pay fort he reconstruction of afghanistan ?
this question gets even more explosive as it becomes clearer that influential forces in afghanistan are not interested in a stabilization of the country and fight this with all their might .
that 's a fundamental difference to what 's happening in other countries , where germany sends soldiers or aid workers .
it 's expensive and it costs a lot of lives to try and bring peace to afghanistan when the taliban are fighting it .
the murder of three police officers who guarded the german embassy in kabul shows that the perpetrators are now directly targeting the government .
it 's safe to assume that the taliban are trying to influence the political debate in germany as all three afghanistan mandates for the german military are up for renewal the fall .
of course it would be wrong to bend one 's knees because of the taliban 's terror .
but this argument must not be used to brush off justified doubts regarding the international reconstruction effort .
the afghan government bears some of the responsibility for the fact that not enough was accomplished during the past five years .
but the many tens of thousands of foreign soldiers and aid workers have also , in part , acted incorrectly and without coordination .
precious time and resources have been wasted as a result .
the german government has so far failed to honestly weigh the mission 's chances and risks .
while surveys show that a majority of germans is now against the deployment of more than 3,000 soldiers in afghanistan , most politicians continue to preach that it 's necessary to endure .
but following the murder of three german police officers , the government should no longer stall a factual discussion .
as long as every german in afghanistan has to fear for his life , reconstruction efforts ca n't be effective , anyway .

the chancellor 's not alone in her interest in the arctic : ever more states are attracted by the region 's resources . german chancellor angela merkel heads to greenland on thursday for a two-day visit with danish prime minister anders fogh rasmussen .
the two politicians will ply the ilulissat fjord , over 300 kilometers -lrb- 186 miles -rrb- above the arctic circle , where one of the world 's biggest glaciers is gradually melting .
global warming is especially evident on the danish island , where the temperatures have been increasing twice as quickly as the world average .
" it 's good that a german chancellor examines the issues of climate change where its effects are especially easy to recognize , " said german climate expert peter lemke .
" politicians should also see for themselves where and how climate change occurs . "
merkel 's not the first politician to visit the spot .
she follows in the footsteps of italian prime minister romano prodi , european commission chief jose manuel barroso , nancy pelosi , speaker of the us house of representatives , and presidential candidate john mccain .
international interest and the region has n't only drawn attention due to growing concern about climate change .
the arctic is believed to be rich in resources .
however , until the ice started to melt , they were inaccessible .
climate researchers now say that the arctic could be ice-free by the summer of 2040 .
shipping is likely to take off , and it may then be affordable to excavate the gas and oil thought to be buried there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the russians will have to do more to cement their claims in early august , russian researchers planted a rust-free titanium russian flag on the ocean floor beneath the north pole to mark their country 's claim to the area .
denmark has also sent an arctic mission to back up its claims to the region .
and canadian premier stephen harper announced plans last week to establish a deep-sea port and a military base in the arctic .
a study by the us geological survey estimates the arctic has as much as 25 percent of the world 's undiscovered oil and gas .
but some say that 's just speculation .
geophysicist wilfried jodak of germany 's alfred wegener institute for polar and marine research -lrb- awi -rrb- is one of the skeptics .
the geo-scientific data from the area north of the arctic circle was too meager to identify any deposits , he said .
claims deadline looms " arctic research is expensive and was so unattractive until a few years ago , that hardly any public means were provided for research , " he said , adding that expanding territorial claims had not previously been a factor at all .
" the russians got that rolling . "
moscow is in a hurry to prove that the lomonosov ridge in the northern arctic ocean is a continuation of the russian mainland .
the 1982 un convention on law of the sea allows states to use the waters up to 200 sea miles -lrb- 370 kilometers -rrb- off their coasts as economic areas .
those governments that want to make further claims must submit requests to the un by may 2009 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arctic could be ice-free by 2040 any state missing the 2009 deadline risks losing un recognition of the claim .
countries that have not yet ratifed the law of the sea convention , including the united states , are not bound by the 2009 deadline .
the arctic push is a result of this deadline , according to jodak of the awi : " so that the claims have been resolved if at some point it turns out that there really are rich resource deposits in the northern arctic . "
shared heritage ?
thus , the clock is ticking for russia , denmark and canada , all of which view themselves as having the ultimate claim to the arctic sea .
" the arctic does n't belong to any state alone , " said moscow sea expert anatoly kolodkin of the un 's international tribunal of the law of the sea .
the arctic sea was part of " man 's common heritage , " he said , adding that the issue was , nevertheless , about who had the rights to explore and develop the resources there . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this is a tragic case , but we must assume that it will be repeated , " gdp chairman konrad freiberg said in the daily hannoversche allgemeine zeitung .
" we are in the sights of the taliban and other islamist terrorist organizations . "
three german police officers responsible for protecting the german ambassador to afghanistan died and a fourth was injured when their vehicles were blown up on a road to the east of kabul on wednesday .
freiberg said terrorists were aiming to influence germany 's decision on whether to renew its deployment of german military and police in afghanistan , which parliament will consider in the coming months .
tanks for police ?
freiberg disagreed with proposals from the rival german police union , the dpolg , to outfit police in afghanistan with military equipment . dpolg chief wolfgang speck had called for them to be provided with tanks , armored vehicles and equipment to jam remote signals that could detonate bombs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police are helping to train their afghan colleagues " we do not want the police to be militarized , " freiberg said .
but he said security arrangements for the police should be reviewed .
the calls for reviewing the measures taken to protect german troops and officials in afghanistan were backed up by politicians from merkel 's christian democratic party and the opposition green party .
there was a broad consensus not to allow such attacks to influence germany 's commitment to afghanistan , deputy foreign minister gernot erler , a social democrat , said of the bombing .
germans not necessarily targeted contrary to initial reports from the afghan police , the slain germans ' all-terrain vehicles were not marked with any national emblems , such as flags , ard television said .
thus , it was unlikely the attacks were intended to hit germans in particular .
the four had been driving to a training session when the bomb exploded .
the road they took to reach the shooting range , and the range itself , were known as places frequently used by foreign security services .
police authorities were preparing to hold a memorial service for the three men in berlin 's central cathedral , the dom , on saturday .
all of them were between the ages of 30 and 40 .
merkel 's former bodyguard among those killed bild newspaper reported thursday that one of the victims had been a long-serving bodyguard to chancellor angela merkel .
the 31-year-old officer from nuremberg had planned to return to duties guarding merkel in december after a stint in the german embassy in kabul , the paper wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the men killed worked for the german embassy the officers , all of whom worked as security staff for the embassy , were the first german police to die in afghanistan since the beginning of germany 's mandate there . the deaths brought to 24 the number of germans who have been killed in afghanistan since german troops joined the nato-led international security assisstance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in 2001 .
some 3,000 german troops are engaged in reconstruction in northern afghanistan as part of the isaf . german politicians have vowed to continue with their peacekeeping mission in afghanistan despite the latest attacks .
german defense minister franz josef jung said on thursday , the taliban were trying to sway political debate by " underhanded , one-sided attacks . "
if we give in now , the terrorists will acheive their goal , he added .

" this is a tragic case , but we must assume that it will be repeated , " gdp chairman konrad freiberg said in the daily hannoversche allgemeine zeitung .
" we are in the sights of the taliban and other islamist terrorist organizations . "
three german police officers responsible for protecting the german ambassador to afghanistan died and a fourth was injured when their vehicles were blown up on a road to the east of kabul on wednesday .
freiberg said terrorists were aiming to influence germany 's decision on whether to renew its deployment of german military and police in afghanistan , which parliament will consider in the coming months .
tanks for police ?
freiberg disagreed with proposals from the rival german police union , the dpolg , to outfit police in afghanistan with military equipment . dpolg chief wolfgang speck had called for them to be provided with tanks , armored vehicles and equipment to jam remote signals that could detonate bombs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police are helping to train their afghan colleagues " we do not want the police to be militarized , " freiberg said .
but he said security arrangements for the police should be reviewed .
the calls for reviewing the measures taken to protect german troops and officials in afghanistan were backed up by politicians from merkel 's christian democratic party and the opposition green party .
there was a broad consensus not to allow such attacks to influence germany 's commitment to afghanistan , deputy foreign minister gernot erler , a social democrat , said of the bombing .

its museums are now worried that a new directive from russia 's culture ministry will make it tougher to track down the works . tucked away in the secret vaults of russian museums are a number of priceless works of art that germany says belong to it . the country 's museum directors believe that about 180,000 works taken from collections in berlin are in russia and poland .
the hague convention regulating wars on land requires art treasures seized by occupying forces to be returned .
but germany has had limited success in regaining such trophy art , and museum directors fear russia may be making it even more difficult since the country 's culture ministry purportedly issued a directive that calls for the creation of new inventory lists of everything that 's been stored in secret depots so far .
" the russian government is rewriting inventories because it wants to incorporate these items permanently in its own collections , " said klaus-dieter lehmann , head of the prussian cultural heritage foundation .
he said it would make it much harder to track works that were once looted from germany .
but contradictory reports have been commonplace in the decades-long dispute over art looted by the soviets during world war ii .

moscow historical museum 's deputy director , vadim leonidovitsch yegorov , denied the existence of a directive to rewrite russia 's inventories .
" i think negative people have thought it up so they can present russian researchers and museum people as greedy and miserly and not only restricting access to their own , but also to other people 's treasures , " he said .
spoils of war ?
in 1990 , germany and the soviet union expressly committed themselves to returning art objects that had been looted during the war .
but just a few years later , the russian government declared that artworks taken from germany were russian property .
" we ca n't give them back to germany , " said yegorov .
" because back then germany did n't respect russia and russian art treasures ; it treated them barbarically . "
one of the main bones of contention is the baldin collection .
bremen 's city art museum has demanded the return of the works by dürer , rembrandt and van gogh .
germany cites international law as well as the german-soviet agreement .
but the russians have remained intransigent on the issue .
" we are keeping it as part of a world cultural heritage that should be accessible to all , to researchers from all countries and the entire world , " yegorov said .
barrier to cooperation germany , however , refuses to accept that position .
and the dispute over looted art has become a hindrance to working with russian institutions , said lehmann of the prussian cultural heritage foundation .
" we are simply interested in cooperating with the russians in matters of art and culture , and this unresolved issue of looted art always gets in the way , " he said .
bildunterschrift : russian museums showed objects from the merovingian era that had been thought lost still , russian and german institutions have managed to work together on some research and exhibitions .
german museums regarded as a milestone this spring 's joint german-russian merovingian exhibition shown in moscow and st. petersburg which displayed objects art experts had considered lost .
meanwhile , the germans have demanded russia finally open its secret depots .
berlin 's museums have been drawing up new lists of lost artworks - partly in the hope that colleagues who gain access to the russian depots can pass on information .
and their efforts have already borne fruit , according to berlin 's museum of decorative arts .
" the catalogue of losses to the sculpture collection was only published a few weeks ago , and , despite everything , we have already been able to identify one of the objects in one of the russian depots in moscow , " the museum 's deputy director , lothar lambacher , said .

the two politicians will ply the ilulissat fjord , over 300 kilometers -lrb- 186 miles -rrb- above the arctic circle , where one of the world 's biggest glaciers is gradually melting .

she knows every crook and cranny of germany 's favorite landmark . dw : what is the allure of the cologne cathedral in your opinion ? barbara schock-werner : there are two things : the first is the building itself , its size , its perfection and its beauty .
but it 's also the visitor-friendly management that ’ s behind it .
for example , there 's no entry fee - it 's a church and everyone 's welcome .
we have very long opening hours , from 6:00 am to 7:30 pm .
and we make a large effort to have friendly management , group tours , not too many tours at the same time , etc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the sheer size of the cathedral that many find impressive what about the building itself attracts people ? the overwhelming space .
go in , sit down - and your heart rises .
it 's something that really has an effect on your body and soul .
you have imagine that the people in the middle ages lived in much smaller spaces and they were n't used to theaters and cinemas , which are matter-of-fact for us today .
for them it must have seemed even bigger . the purpose behind the building was less to glorify the archbishop of cologne and much more an effort to give the christians a picture of heaven .
when you take your time , sit down and take in the building , you can experience that today as well . many people ask why the cathedral constantly seems to be under construction .
what do you say to that ? all historical buildings have to be taken care of if they are to be preserved .
the gothic ones are unfortunately the most fragile because their surfaces are so complicated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cathedral 's towers are about 157 meters -lrb- 515 feet -rrb- tall the cathedral building foundation and cathedral workshop , which i have overseen since 1999 , are there to manage the preservation of the church .
these incorporate a staff of 80 people .
thirty of these are craftspeople , including stonemasons , scaffold makers , roofers , locksmiths , carpenters , blacksmiths , electricians and painters . the cathedral has 8,000 square meters -lrb- about 86,000 square feet -rrb- of historical glass windows and we have our own glass restoration workshop with 10 staff members .
underneath the cathedral there is an archaeological dig going on and we also have a small team of archaeologists .
i 'm also in charge of the treasure chamber , the library and the administrators . what 's your annual budget ? between six and seven million euros -lrb- between eight and 9.4 million dollars -rrb- a year .
that mostly goes for the staff .
but the staff is the guarantee that the cathedral will be preserved .
they know every crack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steam engines so near to the cathedral damaged its facade , said schock-werner why is the cologne cathedral so black ? weathering of the stone began around the middle of the 19th century when the majority of the population began heating with coal .
before that , the poor people heated with wood and nothing happened .
but when everyone started heating with coal , the sulphur content in the air increased dramatically .
that happened in all cities . in cologne , in addition , train tracks were laid in direct proximity to the cathedral and for nearly 100 years steam engines drove by the cathedral every day and blew their smoke on the building .
that 's why the damage to the stone is greater here than in other places .
add to that the brown coal power plants in the western part of the city . today , there are n't any steam engines any more , the power plants have been moved and practically no one has individual heating since the whole city uses district heating .
the air today is much better and we can be sure that what we replace now will last longer . the renowned german artist gerhard richter recently completed a new stained glass window for the south wing of the cathedral that will be unveiled later this month .
why was gerhard richter chosen for the job ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard richter 's stained glass window consists of 11,250 squares of color in the field of contemporary glass painting , i could n't find a solution to the window that fit the cathedral 's status .
i had n't initially thought of richter for the project , because he 's not generally associated with glass windows .
but then we met at a reception and suddenly i thought , gerhard richter must be able to do it .
he has a relationship to the catholic church , he lives in cologne , and he 's worked both representationally and ornamentally .
he 's extremely sensitive and his work is of an incredibly high quality .
i asked him , he said yes and now we 've been working on the project for five years .
we 're very pleased that it 's nearly completed . legend has it that the cathedral was n't destroyed during world war two .
is this true ? no , that 's one of the cathedral 's pious legends .
the fact is , it was hit hard 14 times and suffered heavy damages but stayed standing .
that must have been an incredible symbol for the people .
they came out of their basements and shelters and the cathedral was still standing , even though the rest of the city had been flattened . what 's it like to be a woman in your job ? i had the better qualifications .
i am an architect and an art historian and that ’ s why they chose me .
i 'm the first woman with my special title , but i 'm not the first woman doing this job .
there are women in similar positions at the churches in ulm , freiburg , strasbourg , nuremberg and magdeburg , but they have different titles . my predecessor was quite respected in his position and i think it was easier for a woman to follow him than for a man , because we were n't in direct competition . bildunterschrift : cologne 's greatest landmark was constructed over six centuries click on the link below to read what visitors had to say about the cologne cathedral . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she knows every crook and cranny of germany 's favorite landmark . dw : what is the allure of the cologne cathedral in your opinion ? barbara schock-werner : there are two things : the first is the building itself , its size , its perfection and its beauty .
but it 's also the visitor-friendly management that ’ s behind it .
for example , there 's no entry fee - it 's a church and everyone 's welcome .
we have very long opening hours , from 6:00 am to 7:30 pm .
and we make a large effort to have friendly management , group tours , not too many tours at the same time , etc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the sheer size of the cathedral that many find impressive what about the building itself attracts people ? the overwhelming space .
go in , sit down - and your heart rises .
it 's something that really has an effect on your body and soul .
you have imagine that the people in the middle ages lived in much smaller spaces and they were n't used to theaters and cinemas , which are matter-of-fact for us today .
for them it must have seemed even bigger . the purpose behind the building was less to glorify the archbishop of cologne and much more an effort to give the christians a picture of heaven .
when you take your time , sit down and take in the building , you can experience that today as well . many people ask why the cathedral constantly seems to be under construction .
what do you say to that ? all historical buildings have to be taken care of if they are to be preserved .
the gothic ones are unfortunately the most fragile because their surfaces are so complicated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cathedral 's towers are about 157 meters -lrb- 515 feet -rrb- tall the cathedral building foundation and cathedral workshop , which i have overseen since 1999 , are there to manage the preservation of the church .
these incorporate a staff of 80 people .
thirty of these are craftspeople , including stonemasons , scaffold makers , roofers , locksmiths , carpenters , blacksmiths , electricians and painters . the cathedral has 8,000 square meters -lrb- about 86,000 square feet -rrb- of historical glass windows and we have our own glass restoration workshop with 10 staff members .
underneath the cathedral there is an archaeological dig going on and we also have a small team of archaeologists .
i 'm also in charge of the treasure chamber , the library and the administrators . what 's your annual budget ? between six and seven million euros -lrb- between eight and 9.4 million dollars -rrb- a year .
that mostly goes for the staff .
but the staff is the guarantee that the cathedral will be preserved .
they know every crack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steam engines so near to the cathedral damaged its facade , said schock-werner why is the cologne cathedral so black ? weathering of the stone began around the middle of the 19th century when the majority of the population began heating with coal .
before that , the poor people heated with wood and nothing happened .
but when everyone started heating with coal , the sulphur content in the air increased dramatically .
that happened in all cities . in cologne , in addition , train tracks were laid in direct proximity to the cathedral and for nearly 100 years steam engines drove by the cathedral every day and blew their smoke on the building .
that 's why the damage to the stone is greater here than in other places .
add to that the brown coal power plants in the western part of the city . today , there are n't any steam engines any more , the power plants have been moved and practically no one has individual heating since the whole city uses district heating .

" this is a tragic case , but we must assume that it will be repeated , " gdp chairman konrad freiberg said in the daily hannoversche allgemeine zeitung .
" we are in the sights of the taliban and other islamist terrorist organizations . "
three german police officers responsible for protecting the german ambassador to afghanistan died and a fourth was injured when their vehicles were blown up on a road to the east of kabul on wednesday .
freiberg said terrorists were aiming to influence germany 's decision on whether to renew its deployment of german military and police in afghanistan , which parliament will consider in the coming months .
tanks for police ?
freiberg disagreed with proposals from the rival german police union , the dpolg , to outfit police in afghanistan with military equipment . dpolg chief wolfgang speck had called for them to be provided with tanks , armored vehicles and equipment to jam remote signals that could detonate bombs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police are helping to train their afghan colleagues " we do not want the police to be militarized , " freiberg said .
but he said security arrangements for the police should be reviewed .
the calls for reviewing the measures taken to protect german troops and officials in afghanistan were backed up by politicians from merkel 's christian democratic party and the opposition green party .
there was a broad consensus not to allow such attacks to influence germany 's commitment to afghanistan , deputy foreign minister gernot erler , a social democrat , said of the bombing .
germans not necessarily targeted contrary to initial reports from the afghan police , the slain germans ' all-terrain vehicles were not marked with any national emblems , such as flags , ard television said .
thus , it was unlikely the attacks were intended to hit germans in particular .
the four had been driving to a training session when the bomb exploded .
the road they took to reach the shooting range , and the range itself , were known as places frequently used by foreign security services .
police authorities were preparing to hold a memorial service for the three men in berlin 's central cathedral , the dom , on saturday .
all of them were between the ages of 30 and 40 .
merkel 's former bodyguard among those killed bild newspaper reported thursday that one of the victims had been a long-serving bodyguard to chancellor angela merkel .
the 31-year-old officer from nuremberg had planned to return to duties guarding merkel in december after a stint in the german embassy in kabul , the paper wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the men killed worked for the german embassy the officers , all of whom worked as security staff for the embassy , were the first german police to die in afghanistan since the beginning of germany 's mandate there . the deaths brought to 24 the number of germans who have been killed in afghanistan since german troops joined the nato-led international security assisstance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in 2001 .
some 3,000 german troops are engaged in reconstruction in northern afghanistan as part of the isaf . german politicians have vowed to continue with their peacekeeping mission in afghanistan despite the latest attacks .
german defense minister franz josef jung said on thursday , the taliban were trying to sway political debate by " underhanded , one-sided attacks . "
if we give in now , the terrorists will acheive their goal , he added .
the latest german casualties have however raised deeper questions of germany 's involvement in afghanistan and exposed strains within the governing coalition of chancellor merkel . article based on news reports -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he spoke to dw about moral courage , discrimination and the media . günter wallraff has been a thorn in the side of german business for decades .
now 64 , the investigative reporter from cologne has made a name for himself trying to expose injustice .
his books have sold millions of copies and been translated into 30 languages .
sweden even created a word in the writer 's name : wallraffa , which means " to expose misconduct from the inside by assuming a role . "
his most recent expose dealt with the travails of people working in german call centers .
he recently courted controversy by proposing to read salman rushdie 's " the satanic verses " in the community center of a cologne mosque .
deutsche welle : what pronouncement about you has annoyed you the most ?
günter wallraff : oh , i 'll have to think about that for a while - there are so many insults .
i 'd say : i insist on certain enmities !
when they start to praise me , i have to ask : have i been taken in ?
when bild-zeitung -lsb- germany 's largest-selling tabloid newspaper , which was the target of his 1977 book " lead story " -rsb- calls me the " pen of evil , " i feel i 've been practically knighted .
when die welt -lsb- newspaper -rsb- now came and started an article with " respect for wallraff " - in connection with my suggestion to hold a discussion of " the satanic verses " in a mosque 's community center - i was slightly bewildered , i asked myself : did i do something wrong ?
for you , it 's also an issue of having the right enemies .
you became famous at a time when the concept of the bad guy was somewhat simpler , in the 1970s and ' 80s .
where are your bogeymen today ?
i do n't have any eternal bogeymen .
i wish they would one day become civilized or democratized .
i believe in the ability to change , not just in people , but also in societal structures .
and even such an inhuman paper as bild-zeitung - which can still be called the central organ of character assassination - could possibly develop differently in another social environment and at least let up with this aggressiveness .
it always has to do with personalities - who 's currently editor in chief ?
so , i do n't have any eternal bogeymen ; i also do n't speak of enemies , i speak of opponents , and such a thing as hatred is totally foreign to me .
i do n't hate anyone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bild is known for its bombastic front page what do you consider to be moral courage ? i think moral courage should be a compulsory subject in the schools instead of certain virtues that have returned to the forefront , such as industriousness , punctuality , etc .
i think that in germany of all places , moral courage should take that place instead , that is , that children should already learn in school to respect other cultures , other ways of life , minorities and also to stand up for them - also if it means taking risks .
that 's why i 'm often in schools - especially in eastern germany .
in the last 10 years , i 've given almost 100 presentations - in places where right-wing radicals are often quite dominant .
here and there , i 've even changed people 's attitudes . " lowest of the low , " the book for which you spent two years disguised as a turkish guest worker , was a huge success in germany in 1985 .
it was , according to one critic , the first time the germans realized that the turks , who were working hard for little money in the country 's factories and being treated like dirt , were real people .
is there now less discrimination against turks and others foreigners in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social standing has replaced origin as a basis if discrimination , wallraff says today it 's not the turks who are at the very bottom of society - it 's the workers from eastern europe : poles , romanians , construction workers who have no rights , who , where we used to earn six , eight deutschmarks -lsb- 3-4 euros -rsb- , now do it for two euros an hour .
every third construction worker is illegal or only partly legal , and they are really treated like commodities , hired and fired according to the situation .
germans are among them , too , no difference is made anymore .
the long-term unemployed , especially from eastern germany , also end up in such crews .
discrimination ca n't necessarily be attributed to an individual 's origins anymore , but to their social standing .

he spoke to dw about moral courage , discrimination and the media . günter wallraff has been a thorn in the side of german business for decades .
now 64 , the investigative reporter from cologne has made a name for himself trying to expose injustice .
his books have sold millions of copies and been translated into 30 languages .
sweden even created a word in the writer 's name : wallraffa , which means " to expose misconduct from the inside by assuming a role . "
his most recent expose dealt with the travails of people working in german call centers .
he recently courted controversy by proposing to read salman rushdie 's " the satanic verses " in the community center of a cologne mosque .
deutsche welle : what pronouncement about you has annoyed you the most ?
günter wallraff : oh , i 'll have to think about that for a while - there are so many insults .
i 'd say : i insist on certain enmities !
when they start to praise me , i have to ask : have i been taken in ?
when bild-zeitung -lsb- germany 's largest-selling tabloid newspaper , which was the target of his 1977 book " lead story " -rsb- calls me the " pen of evil , " i feel i 've been practically knighted .
when die welt -lsb- newspaper -rsb- now came and started an article with " respect for wallraff " - in connection with my suggestion to hold a discussion of " the satanic verses " in a mosque 's community center - i was slightly bewildered , i asked myself : did i do something wrong ?
for you , it 's also an issue of having the right enemies .
you became famous at a time when the concept of the bad guy was somewhat simpler , in the 1970s and ' 80s .
where are your bogeymen today ?
i do n't have any eternal bogeymen .
i wish they would one day become civilized or democratized .
i believe in the ability to change , not just in people , but also in societal structures .
and even such an inhuman paper as bild-zeitung - which can still be called the central organ of character assassination - could possibly develop differently in another social environment and at least let up with this aggressiveness .
it always has to do with personalities - who 's currently editor in chief ?
so , i do n't have any eternal bogeymen ; i also do n't speak of enemies , i speak of opponents , and such a thing as hatred is totally foreign to me .
i do n't hate anyone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bild is known for its bombastic front page what do you consider to be moral courage ? i think moral courage should be a compulsory subject in the schools instead of certain virtues that have returned to the forefront , such as industriousness , punctuality , etc .
i think that in germany of all places , moral courage should take that place instead , that is , that children should already learn in school to respect other cultures , other ways of life , minorities and also to stand up for them - also if it means taking risks .
that 's why i 'm often in schools - especially in eastern germany .
in the last 10 years , i 've given almost 100 presentations - in places where right-wing radicals are often quite dominant .
here and there , i 've even changed people 's attitudes . " lowest of the low , " the book for which you spent two years disguised as a turkish guest worker , was a huge success in germany in 1985 .
it was , according to one critic , the first time the germans realized that the turks , who were working hard for little money in the country 's factories and being treated like dirt , were real people .
is there now less discrimination against turks and others foreigners in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social standing has replaced origin as a basis if discrimination , wallraff says today it 's not the turks who are at the very bottom of society - it 's the workers from eastern europe : poles , romanians , construction workers who have no rights , who , where we used to earn six , eight deutschmarks -lsb- 3-4 euros -rsb- , now do it for two euros an hour .
every third construction worker is illegal or only partly legal , and they are really treated like commodities , hired and fired according to the situation .
germans are among them , too , no difference is made anymore .
the long-term unemployed , especially from eastern germany , also end up in such crews .
discrimination ca n't necessarily be attributed to an individual 's origins anymore , but to their social standing .
we have already firmly embedded so-called third-world standards in germany . you plan to start working in a factory again soon .
nowadays personal reports have become a standard feature in the media .
there 's no need to glue on a fake beard anymore .
now that anyone can make their own personal experiences public - on youtube , for example - has n't undercover journalism become old hat ? i 've just provided proof of the opposite , to my own astonishment .
the short time i spent in two call centers drew so much public attention to the topic that politicians are now responding and business groups are anxious .
trying it out for yourself has a very different authenticity and force of expression than when you assert something from the outside or even investigate it .
and i think it 's essential for many more people to do it .

many young people reject their elders ' political claims for compensation but embrace their cultural roots . there is likely to be a generational divide when german expellees and their families commemorate tag der heimat or day of the homeland on saturday .
represented in large part by the league of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , a controversial group that lobbies and seeks compensation for ethnic germans and their descendants , the aging expellees themselves reflect on the injustices that occurred as the third reich crumbled and millions of ethnic germans were expelled from their homelands in eastern europe .
younger people , on the other hand , said they will be paying more attention to their cultural heritage .
leaving controversy behind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can expellee groups keep young people interested ?
for 17-year-old veronika moll , the day of remembrance is not about international relations but about dancing .
moll , a high school student in munich , is part of a silesian folk dancing group that performs at events like tag der heimat , as well as at her hometown 's famous oktoberfest .
she also takes part in conferences about expellee issues and other cultural activities .
both of moll 's grandmothers were expelled from silesia , in southwestern poland , at the end of world war ii .
while some people of the older generation feel silesia belongs to them , moll said she does n't feel that way at all . although she still feels special ties to silesia , munich is home .
" it 's simply not the situation that you can go back to silesia , " she said .
" it 's too long ago .
it 's important to not forget the history and to make sure that everyone knows what happened and that an injustice occurred .
but you ca n't displace all of the polish or other people who have lived in these houses or on this land for 60 years . "
youth groups focus on future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the average age for many groups is getting older this type of attitude is typical among the descendants of expellees , said thomas hoffmann , who heads the organization german youth in europe .
while the first generation of expellees dreamed of returning home , their grandchildren are uninterested in going back , hoffmann said .
the first part of german youth in europe 's harkens back to its foundation in 1951 as a group to fight for the rights of german expellee youths .
over the years it has evolved into a more progressive organization which promotes reconciliation and integration .
the group has approximately 90,000 members .
janna keberlein , a member of the youth organization and 28-year-old student at the university of düsseldorf , said that while her ethnic german grandparents still get angry about being deported from the volga region to kazakhstan during the war , she thinks the issue needs to be closed .
" young people do n't have to be drawn into this history of suffering , " the 28-year-old düsseldorf university student said , adding that she has no interest in being politically involved in the league of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- .
a taboo subject bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the silesian traditions remain important to some youth for many young people , the bdv focuses too much on the past , a fact seen in the graying of the organization , said alfred de zayas , a leading scholar on germen expellees .
when he gives talks to expellee groups , the average age is usually 60 , he said .
de zayas served for years as a lawyer for the united nations high commissioner for human rights .
he is currently a professor of international law at the geneva school of diplomacy .
he wrote the first scholarly work on german expellees to appear in english , breaking what had long been a taboo topic .
the post-war expulsions were the largest forced movement of europeans in the 20th century .
historians estimate that between 12 and 15 million people were expelled during the forced migrations .
finding an interest in cultural heritage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expellees on the road to germany de zayas ' books have been controversial in germany because he feels expellees have legal rights to reclaim lost property .
but that 's a claim he said he doubts younger generations will pursue as most are simply not interested in the debate 's political dimensions .
instead young people from expellee backgrounds are only just now becoming interested in their cultural heritage to find out more about themselves , de zayas said , adding that he expects that interest to grow .
" it 's important for your identity that you know where you come from , " de zayas said .
" it 's a peaceful activity .
that 's a good thing , and i 'm persuaded that will happen . " trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

represented in large part by the league of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , a controversial group that lobbies and seeks compensation for ethnic germans and their descendants , the aging expellees themselves reflect on the injustices that occurred as the third reich crumbled and millions of ethnic germans were expelled from their homelands in eastern europe .
younger people , on the other hand , said they will be paying more attention to their cultural heritage .
leaving controversy behind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can expellee groups keep young people interested ?
for 17-year-old veronika moll , the day of remembrance is not about international relations but about dancing .
moll , a high school student in munich , is part of a silesian folk dancing group that performs at events like tag der heimat , as well as at her hometown 's famous oktoberfest .
she also takes part in conferences about expellee issues and other cultural activities .
both of moll 's grandmothers were expelled from silesia , in southwestern poland , at the end of world war ii .
while some people of the older generation feel silesia belongs to them , moll said she does n't feel that way at all . although she still feels special ties to silesia , munich is home .
" it 's simply not the situation that you can go back to silesia , " she said .
" it 's too long ago .
it 's important to not forget the history and to make sure that everyone knows what happened and that an injustice occurred .
but you ca n't displace all of the polish or other people who have lived in these houses or on this land for 60 years . "
youth groups focus on future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the average age for many groups is getting older this type of attitude is typical among the descendants of expellees , said thomas hoffmann , who heads the organization german youth in europe .
while the first generation of expellees dreamed of returning home , their grandchildren are uninterested in going back , hoffmann said .
the first part of german youth in europe 's harkens back to its foundation in 1951 as a group to fight for the rights of german expellee youths .
over the years it has evolved into a more progressive organization which promotes reconciliation and integration .
the group has approximately 90,000 members .
janna keberlein , a member of the youth organization and 28-year-old student at the university of düsseldorf , said that while her ethnic german grandparents still get angry about being deported from the volga region to kazakhstan during the war , she thinks the issue needs to be closed .
" young people do n't have to be drawn into this history of suffering , " the 28-year-old düsseldorf university student said , adding that she has no interest in being politically involved in the league of german expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- .
a taboo subject bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the silesian traditions remain important to some youth for many young people , the bdv focuses too much on the past , a fact seen in the graying of the organization , said alfred de zayas , a leading scholar on germen expellees .
when he gives talks to expellee groups , the average age is usually 60 , he said .
de zayas served for years as a lawyer for the united nations high commissioner for human rights .
he is currently a professor of international law at the geneva school of diplomacy .
he wrote the first scholarly work on german expellees to appear in english , breaking what had long been a taboo topic .
the post-war expulsions were the largest forced movement of europeans in the 20th century .
historians estimate that between 12 and 15 million people were expelled during the forced migrations .
finding an interest in cultural heritage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expellees on the road to germany de zayas ' books have been controversial in germany because he feels expellees have legal rights to reclaim lost property .
but that 's a claim he said he doubts younger generations will pursue as most are simply not interested in the debate 's political dimensions .
instead young people from expellee backgrounds are only just now becoming interested in their cultural heritage to find out more about themselves , de zayas said , adding that he expects that interest to grow .

the survey is based on interviews with 258 experts from multinational companies and institutes .

sinn added that expectations for the coming six months were positive in all euro zone countries with the exceptions of ireland and spain , where experts forecast a slowdown in the second half of the year .
the interviews were conducted at the end of july and the beginning of august and do not take into consideration the last 10 days .

he spoke to dw about moral courage , discrimination and the media . günter wallraff has been a thorn in the side of german business for decades .
now 64 , the investigative reporter from cologne has made a name for himself trying to expose injustice .
his books have sold millions of copies and been translated into 30 languages .
sweden even created a word in the writer 's name : wallraffa , which means " to expose misconduct from the inside by assuming a role . "
his most recent expose dealt with the travails of people working in german call centers .
he recently courted controversy by proposing to read salman rushdie 's " the satanic verses " in the community center of a cologne mosque .
deutsche welle : what pronouncement about you has annoyed you the most ?
günter wallraff : oh , i 'll have to think about that for a while - there are so many insults .
i 'd say : i insist on certain enmities !
when they start to praise me , i have to ask : have i been taken in ?
when bild-zeitung -lsb- germany 's largest-selling tabloid newspaper , which was the target of his 1977 book " lead story " -rsb- calls me the " pen of evil , " i feel i 've been practically knighted .
when die welt -lsb- newspaper -rsb- now came and started an article with " respect for wallraff " - in connection with my suggestion to hold a discussion of " the satanic verses " in a mosque 's community center - i was slightly bewildered , i asked myself : did i do something wrong ?
for you , it 's also an issue of having the right enemies .
you became famous at a time when the concept of the bad guy was somewhat simpler , in the 1970s and ' 80s .
where are your bogeymen today ?
i do n't have any eternal bogeymen .
i wish they would one day become civilized or democratized .
i believe in the ability to change , not just in people , but also in societal structures .
and even such an inhuman paper as bild-zeitung - which can still be called the central organ of character assassination - could possibly develop differently in another social environment and at least let up with this aggressiveness .
it always has to do with personalities - who 's currently editor in chief ?
so , i do n't have any eternal bogeymen ; i also do n't speak of enemies , i speak of opponents , and such a thing as hatred is totally foreign to me .
i do n't hate anyone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bild is known for its bombastic front page what do you consider to be moral courage ? i think moral courage should be a compulsory subject in the schools instead of certain virtues that have returned to the forefront , such as industriousness , punctuality , etc .
i think that in germany of all places , moral courage should take that place instead , that is , that children should already learn in school to respect other cultures , other ways of life , minorities and also to stand up for them - also if it means taking risks .
that 's why i 'm often in schools - especially in eastern germany .
in the last 10 years , i 've given almost 100 presentations - in places where right-wing radicals are often quite dominant .
here and there , i 've even changed people 's attitudes . " lowest of the low , " the book for which you spent two years disguised as a turkish guest worker , was a huge success in germany in 1985 .
it was , according to one critic , the first time the germans realized that the turks , who were working hard for little money in the country 's factories and being treated like dirt , were real people .
is there now less discrimination against turks and others foreigners in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social standing has replaced origin as a basis if discrimination , wallraff says today it 's not the turks who are at the very bottom of society - it 's the workers from eastern europe : poles , romanians , construction workers who have no rights , who , where we used to earn six , eight deutschmarks -lsb- 3-4 euros -rsb- , now do it for two euros an hour .
every third construction worker is illegal or only partly legal , and they are really treated like commodities , hired and fired according to the situation .
germans are among them , too , no difference is made anymore .
the long-term unemployed , especially from eastern germany , also end up in such crews .
discrimination ca n't necessarily be attributed to an individual 's origins anymore , but to their social standing .
we have already firmly embedded so-called third-world standards in germany . you plan to start working in a factory again soon .
nowadays personal reports have become a standard feature in the media .
there 's no need to glue on a fake beard anymore .
now that anyone can make their own personal experiences public - on youtube , for example - has n't undercover journalism become old hat ? i 've just provided proof of the opposite , to my own astonishment .
the short time i spent in two call centers drew so much public attention to the topic that politicians are now responding and business groups are anxious .
trying it out for yourself has a very different authenticity and force of expression than when you assert something from the outside or even investigate it .
and i think it 's essential for many more people to do it .

politicians have called for a new effort to educate young people about the true nature of east germany after recently surfaced shoot-to-kill orders have rekindled a debate about conditions in the communist country . volker kauder , the parliamentary leader for germany 's governing christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , told the berliner zeitung on thursday that his party would take steps to raise awareness about eastern germany 's communist past . " we have worked enormously hard to deal with the past of the third reich 's terror system and continue to do so , but we 've done much too little when it comes to dealing with the gdr dictatorship , " he said .
" when looking at the alarming lack of knowledge about the gdr past among the younger generation , we should use the current debate to clarify who was responsible . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonners may be surprised to learn that some think the former west german capital was in the gdr on wednesday , germany 's mass tabloid bild had asked young germans what they knew about the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- .
while some said that east germans were n't allowed to travel , others pointed out that there was a high level of unemployment , that people liked to bathe in the nude and that no one was able to buy fashionable clothes .
one 22-year-old man said that bonn served as the gdr 's capital .
" hitler was the boss and he had a wall build around his empire , " he added . second document found the current debate surrounding life in the gdr was sparked by a shoot-to-kill order that resurfaced over the weekend .
it called on members of the east german secret police , the stasi , to use their weapons to prevent people from fleeing across the german-german border , even if women and children were involved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stasi file agency head marianne birthler is feeling the heat the federal agency that administers the stasi files came under pressure for presenting the document as a sensational find after it became obvious that the order had been known to researchers and state prosecutors for years .
on wednesday , agency officials uncovered a similar document .
unlike the first one , however , it was signed by a high-ranking stasi official , making it potentially more significant for a criminal investigation .
a legal expert said that the second document might have led to different rulings in previous border shooting trials , where guards , who claimed that they had acted in self-defense , were acquitted . " but it 's unlikely that the cases will be reopened now , " ferdinand von schirach , who defended a top-level gdr official in the 1990s , told dw-world.de. agency under pressure the stasi file agency 's head , marianne birthler , has faced intense pressure in recent days for her handling of the situation , with some saying that she is trying to prevent the swift dismantling of her office and the transfer of the stasi files into germany 's federal archives .
birthler has suggested the year 2019 for such a merger .
members of the opposition free-market liberal free democrats and the cdu 's junior coalition partner , the social democrats , have called for quick reforms of the birthler agency as a result of the recent developments .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the files will eventually be transferred to the federal archives wolfgang böhmer , the state premier of saxony-anhalt , where the first shoot-to-kill order was found , said he saw a continued need to research the stasi files .
" the fact that a belittlement and minimization of the gdr 's problems can be seen in the public justifies further research and public debate about what happened , " böhmer told the german press agency dpa , adding that the he saw no need to rush a merger of the stasi agency with the federal archives . kauder agreed and added that a merger could be initiated during the next legislative period , which is likely to start in 2009 . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

its museums are now worried that a new directive from russia 's culture ministry will make it tougher to track down the works . tucked away in the secret vaults of russian museums are a number of priceless works of art that germany says belong to it . the country 's museum directors believe that about 180,000 works taken from collections in berlin are in russia and poland .
the hague convention regulating wars on land requires art treasures seized by occupying forces to be returned .
but germany has had limited success in regaining such trophy art , and museum directors fear russia may be making it even more difficult since the country 's culture ministry purportedly issued a directive that calls for the creation of new inventory lists of everything that 's been stored in secret depots so far .
" the russian government is rewriting inventories because it wants to incorporate these items permanently in its own collections , " said klaus-dieter lehmann , head of the prussian cultural heritage foundation .
he said it would make it much harder to track works that were once looted from germany .
but contradictory reports have been commonplace in the decades-long dispute over art looted by the soviets during world war ii .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dürer 's drawing is again part of bremen 's city collection russian officials say they have dealt with the issue with transparency .
moscow historical museum 's deputy director , vadim leonidovitsch yegorov , denied the existence of a directive to rewrite russia 's inventories .
" i think negative people have thought it up so they can present russian researchers and museum people as greedy and miserly and not only restricting access to their own , but also to other people 's treasures , " he said .
spoils of war ?
in 1990 , germany and the soviet union expressly committed themselves to returning art objects that had been looted during the war .
but just a few years later , the russian government declared that artworks taken from germany were russian property .
" we ca n't give them back to germany , " said yegorov .
" because back then germany did n't respect russia and russian art treasures ; it treated them barbarically . "
one of the main bones of contention is the baldin collection .
bremen 's city art museum has demanded the return of the works by dürer , rembrandt and van gogh .
germany cites international law as well as the german-soviet agreement .
but the russians have remained intransigent on the issue .
" we are keeping it as part of a world cultural heritage that should be accessible to all , to researchers from all countries and the entire world , " yegorov said .
barrier to cooperation germany , however , refuses to accept that position .
and the dispute over looted art has become a hindrance to working with russian institutions , said lehmann of the prussian cultural heritage foundation .
" we are simply interested in cooperating with the russians in matters of art and culture , and this unresolved issue of looted art always gets in the way , " he said .
bildunterschrift : russian museums showed objects from the merovingian era that had been thought lost still , russian and german institutions have managed to work together on some research and exhibitions .
german museums regarded as a milestone this spring 's joint german-russian merovingian exhibition shown in moscow and st. petersburg which displayed objects art experts had considered lost .
meanwhile , the germans have demanded russia finally open its secret depots .
berlin 's museums have been drawing up new lists of lost artworks - partly in the hope that colleagues who gain access to the russian depots can pass on information .
and their efforts have already borne fruit , according to berlin 's museum of decorative arts .
" the catalogue of losses to the sculpture collection was only published a few weeks ago , and , despite everything , we have already been able to identify one of the objects in one of the russian depots in moscow , " the museum 's deputy director , lothar lambacher , said .
tit-for-tat but the real issue is getting negotiations over the return of looted art back on track .
berlin 's museum directors have received some backing from political quarters in calling for germany to stand up for its rights vis-a-vis the russian museums and government .
bildunterschrift : the merovingian show was an eye-opener for german art experts " for a while , the russian government seemed quite willing to discuss returning the works , " said steffen reiche , a member of the german parliament 's culture commission . "
then the russian parliament , the duma , put a stop to that .
and so here the german parliament should take a stance that is just as clear as the russian parliament 's position . " dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

its museums are now worried that a new directive from russia 's culture ministry will make it tougher to track down the works . tucked away in the secret vaults of russian museums are a number of priceless works of art that germany says belong to it . the country 's museum directors believe that about 180,000 works taken from collections in berlin are in russia and poland .
the hague convention regulating wars on land requires art treasures seized by occupying forces to be returned .
but germany has had limited success in regaining such trophy art , and museum directors fear russia may be making it even more difficult since the country 's culture ministry purportedly issued a directive that calls for the creation of new inventory lists of everything that 's been stored in secret depots so far .
" the russian government is rewriting inventories because it wants to incorporate these items permanently in its own collections , " said klaus-dieter lehmann , head of the prussian cultural heritage foundation .
he said it would make it much harder to track works that were once looted from germany .
but contradictory reports have been commonplace in the decades-long dispute over art looted by the soviets during world war ii .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dürer 's drawing is again part of bremen 's city collection russian officials say they have dealt with the issue with transparency .
moscow historical museum 's deputy director , vadim leonidovitsch yegorov , denied the existence of a directive to rewrite russia 's inventories .
" i think negative people have thought it up so they can present russian researchers and museum people as greedy and miserly and not only restricting access to their own , but also to other people 's treasures , " he said .
spoils of war ?
in 1990 , germany and the soviet union expressly committed themselves to returning art objects that had been looted during the war .
but just a few years later , the russian government declared that artworks taken from germany were russian property .
" we ca n't give them back to germany , " said yegorov .
" because back then germany did n't respect russia and russian art treasures ; it treated them barbarically . "
one of the main bones of contention is the baldin collection .
bremen 's city art museum has demanded the return of the works by dürer , rembrandt and van gogh .
germany cites international law as well as the german-soviet agreement .
but the russians have remained intransigent on the issue .
" we are keeping it as part of a world cultural heritage that should be accessible to all , to researchers from all countries and the entire world , " yegorov said .
barrier to cooperation germany , however , refuses to accept that position .
and the dispute over looted art has become a hindrance to working with russian institutions , said lehmann of the prussian cultural heritage foundation .
" we are simply interested in cooperating with the russians in matters of art and culture , and this unresolved issue of looted art always gets in the way , " he said .
bildunterschrift : russian museums showed objects from the merovingian era that had been thought lost still , russian and german institutions have managed to work together on some research and exhibitions .
german museums regarded as a milestone this spring 's joint german-russian merovingian exhibition shown in moscow and st. petersburg which displayed objects art experts had considered lost .
meanwhile , the germans have demanded russia finally open its secret depots .
berlin 's museums have been drawing up new lists of lost artworks - partly in the hope that colleagues who gain access to the russian depots can pass on information .
and their efforts have already borne fruit , according to berlin 's museum of decorative arts .
" the catalogue of losses to the sculpture collection was only published a few weeks ago , and , despite everything , we have already been able to identify one of the objects in one of the russian depots in moscow , " the museum 's deputy director , lothar lambacher , said .
tit-for-tat but the real issue is getting negotiations over the return of looted art back on track .
berlin 's museum directors have received some backing from political quarters in calling for germany to stand up for its rights vis-a-vis the russian museums and government .
bildunterschrift : the merovingian show was an eye-opener for german art experts " for a while , the russian government seemed quite willing to discuss returning the works , " said steffen reiche , a member of the german parliament 's culture commission . "
then the russian parliament , the duma , put a stop to that .
and so here the german parliament should take a stance that is just as clear as the russian parliament 's position . " dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

its museums are now worried that a new directive from russia 's culture ministry will make it tougher to track down the works . tucked away in the secret vaults of russian museums are a number of priceless works of art that germany says belong to it . the country 's museum directors believe that about 180,000 works taken from collections in berlin are in russia and poland .
the hague convention regulating wars on land requires art treasures seized by occupying forces to be returned .
but germany has had limited success in regaining such trophy art , and museum directors fear russia may be making it even more difficult since the country 's culture ministry purportedly issued a directive that calls for the creation of new inventory lists of everything that 's been stored in secret depots so far .
" the russian government is rewriting inventories because it wants to incorporate these items permanently in its own collections , " said klaus-dieter lehmann , head of the prussian cultural heritage foundation .
he said it would make it much harder to track works that were once looted from germany .
but contradictory reports have been commonplace in the decades-long dispute over art looted by the soviets during world war ii .

he said fertilizer nitrates are leaking into the baltic sea from farms and estuaries . in addition , across one sixth of the baltic , algae flowers now bloom where plants and animals once lived - with serious consequences for the ecosystem . " on the top of the water it looks like a normal sea , but on the bottom , there is very little which still lives , " he said . waste being dumped into baltic sea however , dietrich schulz of the german federal environment agency said that fertilization runoff from crops is not the biggest issue . schulz , who is part of a group working on ways to lessen the impact of animal by-products on the baltic , said that the water near the new eu states in eastern europe , and in belarus and russia , suffers from another problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " death zone " paradise ?
" the bigger problem is that the animal farms in the area have no place to discard their waste , so the farmers tend to just discharge it into the water , " he said . in november , experts will present the baltic action plan to the helsinki commission , a collaboration of all the countries that surround the baltic , in november . calls for sustainable practices good agricultural practices could be binding for eu members , but we also have russia and belarus as members of the helsinki commission and they are not within the eu schemes , schulz said .

he spoke to dw about moral courage , discrimination and the media . günter wallraff has been a thorn in the side of german business for decades .
now 64 , the investigative reporter from cologne has made a name for himself trying to expose injustice .
his books have sold millions of copies and been translated into 30 languages .
sweden even created a word in the writer 's name : wallraffa , which means " to expose misconduct from the inside by assuming a role . "
his most recent expose dealt with the travails of people working in german call centers .
he recently courted controversy by proposing to read salman rushdie 's " the satanic verses " in the community center of a cologne mosque .
deutsche welle : what pronouncement about you has annoyed you the most ?
günter wallraff : oh , i 'll have to think about that for a while - there are so many insults .
i 'd say : i insist on certain enmities !
when they start to praise me , i have to ask : have i been taken in ?
when bild-zeitung -lsb- germany 's largest-selling tabloid newspaper , which was the target of his 1977 book " lead story " -rsb- calls me the " pen of evil , " i feel i 've been practically knighted .
when die welt -lsb- newspaper -rsb- now came and started an article with " respect for wallraff " - in connection with my suggestion to hold a discussion of " the satanic verses " in a mosque 's community center - i was slightly bewildered , i asked myself : did i do something wrong ?
for you , it 's also an issue of having the right enemies .
you became famous at a time when the concept of the bad guy was somewhat simpler , in the 1970s and ' 80s .
where are your bogeymen today ?
i do n't have any eternal bogeymen .
i wish they would one day become civilized or democratized .
i believe in the ability to change , not just in people , but also in societal structures .
and even such an inhuman paper as bild-zeitung - which can still be called the central organ of character assassination - could possibly develop differently in another social environment and at least let up with this aggressiveness .
it always has to do with personalities - who 's currently editor in chief ?
so , i do n't have any eternal bogeymen ; i also do n't speak of enemies , i speak of opponents , and such a thing as hatred is totally foreign to me .
i do n't hate anyone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bild is known for its bombastic front page what do you consider to be moral courage ? i think moral courage should be a compulsory subject in the schools instead of certain virtues that have returned to the forefront , such as industriousness , punctuality , etc .
i think that in germany of all places , moral courage should take that place instead , that is , that children should already learn in school to respect other cultures , other ways of life , minorities and also to stand up for them - also if it means taking risks .
that 's why i 'm often in schools - especially in eastern germany .
in the last 10 years , i 've given almost 100 presentations - in places where right-wing radicals are often quite dominant .
here and there , i 've even changed people 's attitudes . " lowest of the low , " the book for which you spent two years disguised as a turkish guest worker , was a huge success in germany in 1985 .
it was , according to one critic , the first time the germans realized that the turks , who were working hard for little money in the country 's factories and being treated like dirt , were real people .
is there now less discrimination against turks and others foreigners in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social standing has replaced origin as a basis if discrimination , wallraff says today it 's not the turks who are at the very bottom of society - it 's the workers from eastern europe : poles , romanians , construction workers who have no rights , who , where we used to earn six , eight deutschmarks -lsb- 3-4 euros -rsb- , now do it for two euros an hour .
every third construction worker is illegal or only partly legal , and they are really treated like commodities , hired and fired according to the situation .
germans are among them , too , no difference is made anymore .
the long-term unemployed , especially from eastern germany , also end up in such crews .
discrimination ca n't necessarily be attributed to an individual 's origins anymore , but to their social standing .
we have already firmly embedded so-called third-world standards in germany . you plan to start working in a factory again soon .
nowadays personal reports have become a standard feature in the media .
there 's no need to glue on a fake beard anymore .
now that anyone can make their own personal experiences public - on youtube , for example - has n't undercover journalism become old hat ? i 've just provided proof of the opposite , to my own astonishment .
the short time i spent in two call centers drew so much public attention to the topic that politicians are now responding and business groups are anxious .
trying it out for yourself has a very different authenticity and force of expression than when you assert something from the outside or even investigate it .
and i think it 's essential for many more people to do it .

i think that in germany of all places , moral courage should take that place instead , that is , that children should already learn in school to respect other cultures , other ways of life , minorities and also to stand up for them - also if it means taking risks .
that 's why i 'm often in schools - especially in eastern germany .
in the last 10 years , i 've given almost 100 presentations - in places where right-wing radicals are often quite dominant .
here and there , i 've even changed people 's attitudes . " lowest of the low , " the book for which you spent two years disguised as a turkish guest worker , was a huge success in germany in 1985 .
it was , according to one critic , the first time the germans realized that the turks , who were working hard for little money in the country 's factories and being treated like dirt , were real people .
is there now less discrimination against turks and others foreigners in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social standing has replaced origin as a basis if discrimination , wallraff says today it 's not the turks who are at the very bottom of society - it 's the workers from eastern europe : poles , romanians , construction workers who have no rights , who , where we used to earn six , eight deutschmarks -lsb- 3-4 euros -rsb- , now do it for two euros an hour .
every third construction worker is illegal or only partly legal , and they are really treated like commodities , hired and fired according to the situation .
germans are among them , too , no difference is made anymore .
the long-term unemployed , especially from eastern germany , also end up in such crews .
discrimination ca n't necessarily be attributed to an individual 's origins anymore , but to their social standing .
we have already firmly embedded so-called third-world standards in germany . you plan to start working in a factory again soon .
nowadays personal reports have become a standard feature in the media .
there 's no need to glue on a fake beard anymore .
now that anyone can make their own personal experiences public - on youtube , for example - has n't undercover journalism become old hat ? i 've just provided proof of the opposite , to my own astonishment .

he spoke to dw about moral courage , discrimination and the media . günter wallraff has been a thorn in the side of german business for decades .
now 64 , the investigative reporter from cologne has made a name for himself trying to expose injustice .
his books have sold millions of copies and been translated into 30 languages .
sweden even created a word in the writer 's name : wallraffa , which means " to expose misconduct from the inside by assuming a role . "
his most recent expose dealt with the travails of people working in german call centers .
he recently courted controversy by proposing to read salman rushdie 's " the satanic verses " in the community center of a cologne mosque .
deutsche welle : what pronouncement about you has annoyed you the most ?
günter wallraff : oh , i 'll have to think about that for a while - there are so many insults .
i 'd say : i insist on certain enmities !
when they start to praise me , i have to ask : have i been taken in ?
when bild-zeitung -lsb- germany 's largest-selling tabloid newspaper , which was the target of his 1977 book " lead story " -rsb- calls me the " pen of evil , " i feel i 've been practically knighted .
when die welt -lsb- newspaper -rsb- now came and started an article with " respect for wallraff " - in connection with my suggestion to hold a discussion of " the satanic verses " in a mosque 's community center - i was slightly bewildered , i asked myself : did i do something wrong ?
for you , it 's also an issue of having the right enemies .
you became famous at a time when the concept of the bad guy was somewhat simpler , in the 1970s and ' 80s .
where are your bogeymen today ?
i do n't have any eternal bogeymen .
i wish they would one day become civilized or democratized .
i believe in the ability to change , not just in people , but also in societal structures .
and even such an inhuman paper as bild-zeitung - which can still be called the central organ of character assassination - could possibly develop differently in another social environment and at least let up with this aggressiveness .
it always has to do with personalities - who 's currently editor in chief ?
so , i do n't have any eternal bogeymen ; i also do n't speak of enemies , i speak of opponents , and such a thing as hatred is totally foreign to me .
i do n't hate anyone .

he spoke to dw about moral courage , discrimination and the media . günter wallraff has been a thorn in the side of german business for decades .
now 64 , the investigative reporter from cologne has made a name for himself trying to expose injustice .
his books have sold millions of copies and been translated into 30 languages .
sweden even created a word in the writer 's name : wallraffa , which means " to expose misconduct from the inside by assuming a role . "
his most recent expose dealt with the travails of people working in german call centers .
he recently courted controversy by proposing to read salman rushdie 's " the satanic verses " in the community center of a cologne mosque .
deutsche welle : what pronouncement about you has annoyed you the most ?
günter wallraff : oh , i 'll have to think about that for a while - there are so many insults .
i 'd say : i insist on certain enmities !
when they start to praise me , i have to ask : have i been taken in ?
when bild-zeitung -lsb- germany 's largest-selling tabloid newspaper , which was the target of his 1977 book " lead story " -rsb- calls me the " pen of evil , " i feel i 've been practically knighted .
when die welt -lsb- newspaper -rsb- now came and started an article with " respect for wallraff " - in connection with my suggestion to hold a discussion of " the satanic verses " in a mosque 's community center - i was slightly bewildered , i asked myself : did i do something wrong ?
for you , it 's also an issue of having the right enemies .
you became famous at a time when the concept of the bad guy was somewhat simpler , in the 1970s and ' 80s .
where are your bogeymen today ?
i do n't have any eternal bogeymen .
i wish they would one day become civilized or democratized .
i believe in the ability to change , not just in people , but also in societal structures .
and even such an inhuman paper as bild-zeitung - which can still be called the central organ of character assassination - could possibly develop differently in another social environment and at least let up with this aggressiveness .
it always has to do with personalities - who 's currently editor in chief ?
so , i do n't have any eternal bogeymen ; i also do n't speak of enemies , i speak of opponents , and such a thing as hatred is totally foreign to me .
i do n't hate anyone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bild is known for its bombastic front page what do you consider to be moral courage ? i think moral courage should be a compulsory subject in the schools instead of certain virtues that have returned to the forefront , such as industriousness , punctuality , etc .
i think that in germany of all places , moral courage should take that place instead , that is , that children should already learn in school to respect other cultures , other ways of life , minorities and also to stand up for them - also if it means taking risks .
that 's why i 'm often in schools - especially in eastern germany .
in the last 10 years , i 've given almost 100 presentations - in places where right-wing radicals are often quite dominant .
here and there , i 've even changed people 's attitudes . " lowest of the low , " the book for which you spent two years disguised as a turkish guest worker , was a huge success in germany in 1985 .
it was , according to one critic , the first time the germans realized that the turks , who were working hard for little money in the country 's factories and being treated like dirt , were real people .
is there now less discrimination against turks and others foreigners in germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social standing has replaced origin as a basis if discrimination , wallraff says today it 's not the turks who are at the very bottom of society - it 's the workers from eastern europe : poles , romanians , construction workers who have no rights , who , where we used to earn six , eight deutschmarks -lsb- 3-4 euros -rsb- , now do it for two euros an hour .
every third construction worker is illegal or only partly legal , and they are really treated like commodities , hired and fired according to the situation .
germans are among them , too , no difference is made anymore .
the long-term unemployed , especially from eastern germany , also end up in such crews .
discrimination ca n't necessarily be attributed to an individual 's origins anymore , but to their social standing .
we have already firmly embedded so-called third-world standards in germany . you plan to start working in a factory again soon .
nowadays personal reports have become a standard feature in the media .
there 's no need to glue on a fake beard anymore .
now that anyone can make their own personal experiences public - on youtube , for example - has n't undercover journalism become old hat ? i 've just provided proof of the opposite , to my own astonishment .
the short time i spent in two call centers drew so much public attention to the topic that politicians are now responding and business groups are anxious .
trying it out for yourself has a very different authenticity and force of expression than when you assert something from the outside or even investigate it .
and i think it 's essential for many more people to do it .

" such an undertaking was supposed to be used to free the stammheim prisoners , " wrote the stuttgart judges who heard the pair 's case , referring to the maximum-security jail where several raf terrorists , including the group 's leaders , andreas baader and ulrike meinhof , were being held .
the prosecutors determined that , at a meeting in the dutch city of utrecht on april 16 , 1977 , mohnhaupt and four other raf members discussed the possibility of abducting brandt .
at the time , brandt , then head of germany 's social democratic party and the socialist international , was in amsterdam .

politicians have called for a new effort to educate young people about the true nature of east germany after recently surfaced shoot-to-kill orders have rekindled a debate about conditions in the communist country . volker kauder , the parliamentary leader for germany 's governing christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , told the berliner zeitung on thursday that his party would take steps to raise awareness about eastern germany 's communist past . " we have worked enormously hard to deal with the past of the third reich 's terror system and continue to do so , but we 've done much too little when it comes to dealing with the gdr dictatorship , " he said .
" when looking at the alarming lack of knowledge about the gdr past among the younger generation , we should use the current debate to clarify who was responsible . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonners may be surprised to learn that some think the former west german capital was in the gdr on wednesday , germany 's mass tabloid bild had asked young germans what they knew about the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- .
while some said that east germans were n't allowed to travel , others pointed out that there was a high level of unemployment , that people liked to bathe in the nude and that no one was able to buy fashionable clothes .

on wednesday , agency officials uncovered a similar document .
unlike the first one , however , it was signed by a high-ranking stasi official , making it potentially more significant for a criminal investigation .
a legal expert said that the second document might have led to different rulings in previous border shooting trials , where guards , who claimed that they had acted in self-defense , were acquitted . " but it 's unlikely that the cases will be reopened now , " ferdinand von schirach , who defended a top-level gdr official in the 1990s , told dw-world.de. agency under pressure the stasi file agency 's head , marianne birthler , has faced intense pressure in recent days for her handling of the situation , with some saying that she is trying to prevent the swift dismantling of her office and the transfer of the stasi files into germany 's federal archives .

but peter beines is more than an average enthusiast - he 's the head elvis ' largest german-language fan club . peter beines has not only fills his living room with a huge collection of elvis posters and records - one of which bears elvis ' original signature - he 's also the head of the largest german-language fan club devoted to the king . " i 've been an elvis fan since 1974 , " the 44-year-old said from his bonn apartment before leaving for the memorial in graceland .
" back then i was 11 years old and found out about a concert he played in las vegas through a magazine article . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans have not forgotten elvis , some are even convinced he 's still alive the amount of charisma that elvis was able to get across in just a magazine photo impressed beines so much that he began collecting elvis records and clipping news articles about the king throughout his teenage years .
the collection grew to the point that his apartment now resembles an elvis museum . " most of all it was about his music , " beines said .
" then about his vibrancy , his charisma .
especially the things he did on stage during his concerts .
third i liked his human characteristics . " elvis ' last song , " way down , " recorded in his home in august 1977 , is perhaps indicative of the last few years of his career .
while professionally he suffered as hit bands the beatles and the rolling stones drew more attention , privately he battled obesity and drug dependency . fans continue to remember their king at the age of 42 , elvis was found dead in the bathroom of his graceland mansion in memphis on aug .
16 , 1977 .
doctors said his death was caused by heart failure , likely brought on by obesity and years of abusing medications .
biographer alanna nash characterized his dependency as an inability to accept what had become of himself , leading him to attempt to kill the pain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : half of graceland 's visitors are under 35 years old even as the rumors of elvis being spotted at deserted gas stations around the world continue to spread , impersonators who dress , swing and croon like the king himself pay regular tribute to the rock and roll legend .
fans have also created over 500 official elvis fan clubs in over 45 countries . on the 20th anniversary of his death in 1997 a video elvis appeared on stage with over thirty of his former band mates in the production elvis in concert ' 97 at the mid-south coliseum in memphis , tenn .
the show went on to tour the us and in 1999 the european tour opened in london , marking elvis ' first-ever concert outside of north america . an international sensation since 1954 more than one billion elvis records have been sold - a feat no other artist is yet to accomplish - and he won three grammy awards from 14 nominations . however , his fame did n't just hit american airwaves .
elvis ' trophy room at graceland is filled with gold and platinum records from around the world - including germany , although five concerts in canada in were his only performances outside the united states . with a song catalog of over 1,000 titles , german fan beines said it 's nearly impossible to pick just one favorite song . " if i had to choose one , then for me it 'd be ' an american trilogy , " ' beines said .
" but like nearly all fans , i could name 50 songs and always think of another that should be on the list .
it 'd be better just to choose 100 favorites . " a less glittery private life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elvis preseley served the us military in friedberg where he met his wife priscilla while his career was all glitz and gold , elvis ' private life was less than easy .
the son of a laborer and seamstress , he was born in tupelo , mississippi , and grew up alone after his twin brother was stillborn .
on his 10th birthday , instead of the bicycle he had hoped for , elvis was given a guitar and he taught himself to play . unlike today 's pop sensations , elvis served his country at the us ray barracks in friedberg , germany between 1958 and 1960 .
it was during this time that he met his future bride , priscilla beaulieu , the daughter of a us air force officer . elvis and priscilla married in las vegas in 1967 and nine months later daughter lisa marie was born .
however , priscilla complained that elvis had little time for his family and of a destructive cycle of sleeping pills , stimulants and sedatives .
the couple divorced in 1973 . although his earnings continued to climb and still do even after his death -lrb- for decades elvis led forbes magazine 's list of the biggest earning deceased celebrities -rrb- , by the mid-1970 's he could barely bring himself to swing his hips on stage . article based on news reports -lrb- sjr -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she knows every crook and cranny of germany 's favorite landmark . dw : what is the allure of the cologne cathedral in your opinion ? barbara schock-werner : there are two things : the first is the building itself , its size , its perfection and its beauty .
but it 's also the visitor-friendly management that ’ s behind it .
for example , there 's no entry fee - it 's a church and everyone 's welcome .
we have very long opening hours , from 6:00 am to 7:30 pm .
and we make a large effort to have friendly management , group tours , not too many tours at the same time , etc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's the sheer size of the cathedral that many find impressive what about the building itself attracts people ? the overwhelming space .
go in , sit down - and your heart rises .
it 's something that really has an effect on your body and soul .
you have imagine that the people in the middle ages lived in much smaller spaces and they were n't used to theaters and cinemas , which are matter-of-fact for us today .
for them it must have seemed even bigger . the purpose behind the building was less to glorify the archbishop of cologne and much more an effort to give the christians a picture of heaven .
when you take your time , sit down and take in the building , you can experience that today as well . many people ask why the cathedral constantly seems to be under construction .
what do you say to that ? all historical buildings have to be taken care of if they are to be preserved .
the gothic ones are unfortunately the most fragile because their surfaces are so complicated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cathedral 's towers are about 157 meters -lrb- 515 feet -rrb- tall the cathedral building foundation and cathedral workshop , which i have overseen since 1999 , are there to manage the preservation of the church .
these incorporate a staff of 80 people .
thirty of these are craftspeople , including stonemasons , scaffold makers , roofers , locksmiths , carpenters , blacksmiths , electricians and painters . the cathedral has 8,000 square meters -lrb- about 86,000 square feet -rrb- of historical glass windows and we have our own glass restoration workshop with 10 staff members .
underneath the cathedral there is an archaeological dig going on and we also have a small team of archaeologists .
i 'm also in charge of the treasure chamber , the library and the administrators . what 's your annual budget ? between six and seven million euros -lrb- between eight and 9.4 million dollars -rrb- a year .
that mostly goes for the staff .
but the staff is the guarantee that the cathedral will be preserved .
they know every crack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steam engines so near to the cathedral damaged its facade , said schock-werner why is the cologne cathedral so black ? weathering of the stone began around the middle of the 19th century when the majority of the population began heating with coal .
before that , the poor people heated with wood and nothing happened .
but when everyone started heating with coal , the sulphur content in the air increased dramatically .
that happened in all cities . in cologne , in addition , train tracks were laid in direct proximity to the cathedral and for nearly 100 years steam engines drove by the cathedral every day and blew their smoke on the building .
that 's why the damage to the stone is greater here than in other places .
add to that the brown coal power plants in the western part of the city . today , there are n't any steam engines any more , the power plants have been moved and practically no one has individual heating since the whole city uses district heating .
the air today is much better and we can be sure that what we replace now will last longer . the renowned german artist gerhard richter recently completed a new stained glass window for the south wing of the cathedral that will be unveiled later this month .
why was gerhard richter chosen for the job ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard richter 's stained glass window consists of 11,250 squares of color in the field of contemporary glass painting , i could n't find a solution to the window that fit the cathedral 's status .
i had n't initially thought of richter for the project , because he 's not generally associated with glass windows .
but then we met at a reception and suddenly i thought , gerhard richter must be able to do it .
he has a relationship to the catholic church , he lives in cologne , and he 's worked both representationally and ornamentally .
he 's extremely sensitive and his work is of an incredibly high quality .
i asked him , he said yes and now we 've been working on the project for five years .
we 're very pleased that it 's nearly completed . legend has it that the cathedral was n't destroyed during world war two .
is this true ? no , that 's one of the cathedral 's pious legends .
the fact is , it was hit hard 14 times and suffered heavy damages but stayed standing .
that must have been an incredible symbol for the people .
they came out of their basements and shelters and the cathedral was still standing , even though the rest of the city had been flattened . what 's it like to be a woman in your job ? i had the better qualifications .
i am an architect and an art historian and that ’ s why they chose me .
i 'm the first woman with my special title , but i 'm not the first woman doing this job .
there are women in similar positions at the churches in ulm , freiburg , strasbourg , nuremberg and magdeburg , but they have different titles . my predecessor was quite respected in his position and i think it was easier for a woman to follow him than for a man , because we were n't in direct competition . bildunterschrift : cologne 's greatest landmark was constructed over six centuries click on the link below to read what visitors had to say about the cologne cathedral . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but peter beines is more than an average enthusiast - he 's the head elvis ' largest german-language fan club . peter beines has not only fills his living room with a huge collection of elvis posters and records - one of which bears elvis ' original signature - he 's also the head of the largest german-language fan club devoted to the king . " i 've been an elvis fan since 1974 , " the 44-year-old said from his bonn apartment before leaving for the memorial in graceland .
" back then i was 11 years old and found out about a concert he played in las vegas through a magazine article . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans have not forgotten elvis , some are even convinced he 's still alive the amount of charisma that elvis was able to get across in just a magazine photo impressed beines so much that he began collecting elvis records and clipping news articles about the king throughout his teenage years .
the collection grew to the point that his apartment now resembles an elvis museum . " most of all it was about his music , " beines said .
" then about his vibrancy , his charisma .
especially the things he did on stage during his concerts .
third i liked his human characteristics . " elvis ' last song , " way down , " recorded in his home in august 1977 , is perhaps indicative of the last few years of his career .
while professionally he suffered as hit bands the beatles and the rolling stones drew more attention , privately he battled obesity and drug dependency . fans continue to remember their king at the age of 42 , elvis was found dead in the bathroom of his graceland mansion in memphis on aug .
16 , 1977 .
doctors said his death was caused by heart failure , likely brought on by obesity and years of abusing medications .
biographer alanna nash characterized his dependency as an inability to accept what had become of himself , leading him to attempt to kill the pain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : half of graceland 's visitors are under 35 years old even as the rumors of elvis being spotted at deserted gas stations around the world continue to spread , impersonators who dress , swing and croon like the king himself pay regular tribute to the rock and roll legend .
fans have also created over 500 official elvis fan clubs in over 45 countries . on the 20th anniversary of his death in 1997 a video elvis appeared on stage with over thirty of his former band mates in the production elvis in concert ' 97 at the mid-south coliseum in memphis , tenn .
the show went on to tour the us and in 1999 the european tour opened in london , marking elvis ' first-ever concert outside of north america . an international sensation since 1954 more than one billion elvis records have been sold - a feat no other artist is yet to accomplish - and he won three grammy awards from 14 nominations . however , his fame did n't just hit american airwaves .
elvis ' trophy room at graceland is filled with gold and platinum records from around the world - including germany , although five concerts in canada in were his only performances outside the united states . with a song catalog of over 1,000 titles , german fan beines said it 's nearly impossible to pick just one favorite song . " if i had to choose one , then for me it 'd be ' an american trilogy , " ' beines said .
" but like nearly all fans , i could name 50 songs and always think of another that should be on the list .
it 'd be better just to choose 100 favorites . " a less glittery private life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elvis preseley served the us military in friedberg where he met his wife priscilla while his career was all glitz and gold , elvis ' private life was less than easy .
the son of a laborer and seamstress , he was born in tupelo , mississippi , and grew up alone after his twin brother was stillborn .
on his 10th birthday , instead of the bicycle he had hoped for , elvis was given a guitar and he taught himself to play . unlike today 's pop sensations , elvis served his country at the us ray barracks in friedberg , germany between 1958 and 1960 .
it was during this time that he met his future bride , priscilla beaulieu , the daughter of a us air force officer . elvis and priscilla married in las vegas in 1967 and nine months later daughter lisa marie was born .
however , priscilla complained that elvis had little time for his family and of a destructive cycle of sleeping pills , stimulants and sedatives .
the couple divorced in 1973 . although his earnings continued to climb and still do even after his death -lrb- for decades elvis led forbes magazine 's list of the biggest earning deceased celebrities -rrb- , by the mid-1970 's he could barely bring himself to swing his hips on stage . article based on news reports -lrb- sjr -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

its museums are now worried that a new directive from russia 's culture ministry will make it tougher to track down the works . tucked away in the secret vaults of russian museums are a number of priceless works of art that germany says belong to it . the country 's museum directors believe that about 180,000 works taken from collections in berlin are in russia and poland .
the hague convention regulating wars on land requires art treasures seized by occupying forces to be returned .
but germany has had limited success in regaining such trophy art , and museum directors fear russia may be making it even more difficult since the country 's culture ministry purportedly issued a directive that calls for the creation of new inventory lists of everything that 's been stored in secret depots so far .
" the russian government is rewriting inventories because it wants to incorporate these items permanently in its own collections , " said klaus-dieter lehmann , head of the prussian cultural heritage foundation .
he said it would make it much harder to track works that were once looted from germany .
but contradictory reports have been commonplace in the decades-long dispute over art looted by the soviets during world war ii .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dürer 's drawing is again part of bremen 's city collection russian officials say they have dealt with the issue with transparency .
moscow historical museum 's deputy director , vadim leonidovitsch yegorov , denied the existence of a directive to rewrite russia 's inventories .
" i think negative people have thought it up so they can present russian researchers and museum people as greedy and miserly and not only restricting access to their own , but also to other people 's treasures , " he said .
spoils of war ?
in 1990 , germany and the soviet union expressly committed themselves to returning art objects that had been looted during the war .
but just a few years later , the russian government declared that artworks taken from germany were russian property .
" we ca n't give them back to germany , " said yegorov .
" because back then germany did n't respect russia and russian art treasures ; it treated them barbarically . "
one of the main bones of contention is the baldin collection .
bremen 's city art museum has demanded the return of the works by dürer , rembrandt and van gogh .
germany cites international law as well as the german-soviet agreement .
but the russians have remained intransigent on the issue .
" we are keeping it as part of a world cultural heritage that should be accessible to all , to researchers from all countries and the entire world , " yegorov said .
barrier to cooperation germany , however , refuses to accept that position .
and the dispute over looted art has become a hindrance to working with russian institutions , said lehmann of the prussian cultural heritage foundation .
" we are simply interested in cooperating with the russians in matters of art and culture , and this unresolved issue of looted art always gets in the way , " he said .
bildunterschrift : russian museums showed objects from the merovingian era that had been thought lost still , russian and german institutions have managed to work together on some research and exhibitions .
german museums regarded as a milestone this spring 's joint german-russian merovingian exhibition shown in moscow and st. petersburg which displayed objects art experts had considered lost .
meanwhile , the germans have demanded russia finally open its secret depots .
berlin 's museums have been drawing up new lists of lost artworks - partly in the hope that colleagues who gain access to the russian depots can pass on information .
and their efforts have already borne fruit , according to berlin 's museum of decorative arts .
" the catalogue of losses to the sculpture collection was only published a few weeks ago , and , despite everything , we have already been able to identify one of the objects in one of the russian depots in moscow , " the museum 's deputy director , lothar lambacher , said .

but will the wave of takeovers of foreign companies succeed ?
it was a dramatic phone call in the early hours of wednesday , 31 january that finally signalled a new era for indian companies .
the call was from the chief communications officer at the tata group . "
something has changed in the psyche of the indian businessman " lakshman vashdev , independent economist " we won " , she whispered , her voice faint with the exhaustion of being awake all night .
" we won the bid .
the tata group now owns corus . "
it was too early for the newspapers , but indian television went wild .
record takeover india 's tata steel , run by the man so many in the indian business community see as the superman of indian business , ratan tata , had gained control of british steel maker corus , the former british steel . "
many thought this was an audacious move for an indian company " ratan tata , chairman , tata group it was , to date , india 's largest ever foreign takeover .
it made the tata group the world 's fifth largest steel maker , and catapulted them to the global league .
but perhaps more significantly , the winning of the bid symbolised the coming of age for indian business , a fact ratan tata was well aware of when he spoke later that morning to the press and his executives at the taj mahal hotel in mumbai " many thought this was an audacious move for an indian company to takeover a british steel firm so much bigger than itself .
" for it has never been done before . "
but alongside the elation was some caution .
over-paid ?
many analysts said the tatas had paid too much for corus - a price tag of almost £ 6bn -lrb- $ 12bn -rrb- .
some chided the tatas for putting national pride and emotion before financial sense and shareholder interest .
shares of tata steel fell sharply that day .
but the tatas have a history of taking on challenges .
the hotel in which ratan tata announced his conquest to the world - the taj mahal hotel in mumbai - had an unusual beginnings .
legend has it that the founder of the tata group , jamsetji tata , was turned away from a european establishment during the time of the raj because of his indian roots .
according to the story , his pride was hurt , and he decided he 'd build a hotel that anyone could walk into regardless of their race or colour .
now taj hotel flag flies in cities as far away as boston , london and sydney .
the tata group reportedly has set its sights on another conquest : british car brands jaguar and landrover , currently owned by ford .
aggressive expansion but aggressive expansion for indian companies seems to be the order of the day , according to the executive director of the tata 's international business , r gopalakrishnan .
" what has changed the most about indian businesses today is that we have more options to finance our overseas deals .

but will the wave of takeovers of foreign companies succeed ?
it was a dramatic phone call in the early hours of wednesday , 31 january that finally signalled a new era for indian companies .
the call was from the chief communications officer at the tata group .
something has changed in the psyche of the indian businessman lakshman vashdev , independent economist " we won " , she whispered , her voice faint with the exhaustion of being awake all night .
" we won the bid .
the tata group now owns corus . "
it was too early for the newspapers , but indian television went wild .
record takeover india 's tata steel , run by the man so many in the indian business community see as the superman of indian business , ratan tata , had gained control of british steel maker corus , the former british steel .
many thought this was an audacious move for an indian company ratan tata , chairman , tata group it was , to date , india 's largest ever foreign takeover .
it made the tata group the world 's fifth largest steel maker , and catapulted them to the global league .
but perhaps more significantly , the winning of the bid symbolised the coming of age for indian business , a fact ratan tata was well aware of when he spoke later that morning to the press and his executives at the taj mahal hotel in mumbai " many thought this was an audacious move for an indian company to takeover a british steel firm so much bigger than itself .
" for it has never been done before . "
but alongside the elation was some caution .
over-paid ?
many analysts said the tatas had paid too much for corus - a price tag of almost £ 6bn -lrb- $ 12bn -rrb- .
some chided the tatas for putting national pride and emotion before financial sense and shareholder interest .
shares of tata steel fell sharply that day .
the tata group owns hotels around the world but the tatas have a history of taking on challenges .
the hotel in which ratan tata announced his conquest to the world - the taj mahal hotel in mumbai - had an unusual beginnings .
legend has it that the founder of the tata group , jamsetji tata , was turned away from a european establishment during the time of the raj because of his indian roots .
according to the story , his pride was hurt , and he decided he 'd build a hotel that anyone could walk into regardless of their race or colour .
now taj hotel flag flies in cities as far away as boston , london and sydney .
the tata group reportedly has set its sights on another conquest : british car brands jaguar and landrover , currently owned by ford .
aggressive expansion but aggressive expansion for indian companies seems to be the order of the day , according to the executive director of the tata 's international business , r gopalakrishnan .
foreign investment in india 's car industry is rising fast " what has changed the most about indian businesses today is that we have more options to finance our overseas deals .

jenny willott 's comments came as it emerged no trains are planned after a vital rugby world cup tie on 6 october .
transport minister ieuan wyn jones said assembly officials were asking first great western about extra trains .
the train operator blamed engineering works but network rail said it hoped to be able to " work something out " .
cardiff 's millennium stadium is hosting four games of the 2007 rugby tournament , including a quarter-final on the evening of saturday 6 october .
concerns have been raised about the arrangements for the international supporters travelling home after the game , as the last train to london pulls out of cardiff half an hour after the match kicks off .
it will be an international showcase for wales and i 'm very keen to see that travel - and all other arrangements - work as smoothly as possible transport minister ieuan wyn jones welsh secretary peter hain said he has asked his officials to write to rail operator first great western and network rail , claiming it was " essential that transport links are in place to deal with visiting fans " .
ms willott said she would also be writing to the organisations over an apparent " serious and inexplicable breakdown in communication " between them .

jenny willott 's comments came as it emerged no trains are planned after a vital rugby world cup tie on 6 october .
transport minister ieuan wyn jones said assembly officials were asking first great western about extra trains .
the train operator blamed engineering works but network rail said it hoped to be able to " work something out " .
cardiff 's millennium stadium is hosting four games of the 2007 rugby tournament , including a quarter-final on the evening of saturday 6 october .
concerns have been raised about the arrangements for the international supporters travelling home after the game , as the last train to london pulls out of cardiff half an hour after the match kicks off .
it will be an international showcase for wales and i 'm very keen to see that travel - and all other arrangements - work as smoothly as possible transport minister ieuan wyn jones welsh secretary peter hain said he has asked his officials to write to rail operator first great western and network rail , claiming it was " essential that transport links are in place to deal with visiting fans " .
ms willott said she would also be writing to the organisations over an apparent " serious and inexplicable breakdown in communication " between them .
she said : " over the last 10 years , cardiff has rapidly become a sporting centre and one of the most popular cities in the uk .
' restricted ' " but basic transport problems that are the result of poor planning , bad management and a lack of communication , threaten to damage this excellent reputation .

it is hoped the reward offered by the trio , who wish to remain anonymous , may save the bells from being melted down and sold for scrap .
parishioners from all saints church at merton near hatherleigh had raised thousands to have them restored .
the three bells , made from 70 % copper , were taken on monday night .
a forklift belonging to the workshop was used to hold open a shutter door while the bells were dragged out .
the vicar of all saints , the reverend christian merryvale , said parishioners were in a " state of deep shock " over the theft .

his mother gladys worked as a cotton picker , while his father vernon drifted from job to job .
with his rebellious style , provocative moves and a new sound that fused blues with country , elvis is credited with inventing rock ' n ' roll .
elvis released his first single in 1955 and scored his first chart-topper with heartbreak hotel the following year .
he went on to sell almost 120 million records in the us alone .
the singer soon became a global phenomenon , and is seen here swapping personal trademark items with liberace , another of america 's cultural icons from the era .
despite being a worldwide star , elvis was called up to do military service .
he was drafted in 1958 for two years and sent to germany , where he rose to the rank of sergeant .
elvis joined fellow superstars dean martin -lrb- second left -rrb- and shirley maclaine to celebrate martin 's birthday in 1961 on the set of martin 's movie all in a night 's work .
as well as being a musical phenomenon , elvis also enjoyed a prolific and successful movie career .
he is seen here with ursula andress in 1963 's fun in acapulco .
in 1967 , elvis married priscilla ann beaulieu in las vegas after meeting her while in the army .
their daughter lisa-marie was born in 1968 , but the couple divorced five years later .
elvis met us president richard nixon in 1970 , when the singer suggested he be made a federal agent-at-large in the fight against drugs and " communist brainwashing " .
in the 1970s , his chart hits and movie smashes dried up - but elvis reinvigorated his career as a touring artist .
he played almost 1,100 concerts between 1969 and 1977 .
but greasy foods and prescription drugs took their toll on elvis ' health .
he died of a heart attack brought on largely by drug abuse on 16 august 1977 , aged 42 .

the report highlighted outstanding issues relating to coverage and timing of the rollout of the airwave radios .
in june 2006 an assembly report said poor communication had hampered rescuers during operations on 7 july .
but the latest review also said major improvements to emergency plans and procedures had been put in place .
it noted that of the 54 recommendations made in the initial investigation , 40 have been either accepted , fully or partially implemented , or seen significant progress in addressing the issues raised .
londoners can be reassured that ... no one is being complacent about their ability to respond to such a horrific incident richard barnes , review committee chairman chairman of the review committee richard barnes said more work was needed to build on the significant improvements that had been made in the city 's ability to respond to a major incident .
" londoners can be reassured that ... no one is being complacent about their ability to respond to such a horrific incident .
" our report highlights continuing problems with airwave that need to be tackled to ensure emergency service personnel have access to the robust and effective communications systems they need .
" anything less would sell them and the londoners they serve short . "
capacity issues new digital radios are being rolled out to the police , fire and ambulance services to reduce reliance on mobile phones .
but the review found there had been serious delays with the introduction of the equipment and significant concerns relating to the capacity in london .
all of the metropolitan police 's 32 boroughs are on course to be using the airwave system by next month .
however , the london fire brigade and london ambulance service said a number of " contractual and technical changes " meant they would not have the system up and running until nearer the end of 2008 .
a transport for london spokesman said it is investing more than £ 2bn over 20 years in a new digital radio network , called connect , which will provide a platform for airwave radios .

londoners can be reassured that ... no one is being complacent about their ability to respond to such a horrific incident richard barnes , review committee chairman chairman of the review committee richard barnes said more work was needed to build on the significant improvements that had been made in the city 's ability to respond to a major incident .
" londoners can be reassured that ... no one is being complacent about their ability to respond to such a horrific incident .

capacity issues new digital radios are being rolled out to the police , fire and ambulance services to reduce reliance on mobile phones .
but the review found there had been serious delays with the introduction of the equipment and significant concerns relating to the capacity in london .
all of the metropolitan police 's 32 boroughs are on course to be using the airwave system by next month .
however , the london fire brigade and london ambulance service said a number of " contractual and technical changes " meant they would not have the system up and running until nearer the end of 2008 .

bbc wales has been with teenagers at penglais school in aberystwyth .
lauren babcock is one of those students who has just discovered whether she has achieved the grades she needs for university .
this is her story ...
i 've done it !
i 'm sitting here trying to explain the multitude of emotions that are tumbling around inside my stomach .
it just seems impossible .
three as !
three as !
i 'm absolutely dumbfounded !
a massive weight has been lifted off my shoulders - live on national television no less .
in previous years i 've never even opened my results in front of anyone , i 've forced my parents to stay at home and wait in anticipation for my call .
yet this year i was persuaded to be given my results live on bbc breakfast , why not start opening them with over a million people watching if you 're going to start now .
i was surrounded by dread and worry for the past fortnight , completely unaware of today 's happy surprise .
i had completely phased out the ' you 'll be fine ' and the ' do n't worry about it ' , having convinced myself that i should n't get my hopes up .
could i have really succeeded ?
was my hard work to pay off ?
last night was sleepless as i went over and over my exams in my head .
could i have gone about it differently ?
did i really do enough revision ?
surely i could not justify two episodes of neighbours a day ?
this definitely feels like the last big hurdle of my school life , terrifyingly exhilarating .
the pupils at school have all rallied together , cheering each other on as we read our results sheets .
i was just as worried to watch a friend read out their three grades as i was being given mine .
we 've gone through the past two years together and the sense of relief is widespread .
i do hope that we do not have to defend our results , i strongly object to claims that the they have been dumbed down .
i challenge anyone who says otherwise .
you should spend two years studying for exams while trying to grow as a person , juggling everything from sport to work .
so the next three years i 'll be at cambridge , becoming a geographer .
the thought feels slightly alien ; i honestly did n't believe this would happen .
what a happy surprise .
tonight will no doubt see a multitude of results .
good luck moving away from home !
safe travels to those hoping on planes to exotic destinations -lrb- beware of dubious-looking meats -rrb- .
take a deep breath - it 's over and well done !
