program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 29.07.2007 switzerland considers gun control großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : every swiss man serves in the army switzerland 's the only country that requires its soldiers to keep guns at home .
but concerns over high suicide rates and killings within families have caused some to ask whether having them there is simply too dangerous . all swiss men must do military service - they all learn to shoot - and when they go home , they take their assault rifles and 50 rounds of ammunition with them .
" for me it 's just routine , " said philippe schaub , heading home after his latest stint in the army .
" we all do military service , we 're all given a gun to take home .
i keep it in my cupboard just like the coats and the snowboard and the vacuum cleaner . "
the idea is to have an army ready for call up anytime .
although neutral switzerland has n't fought a war for centuries , christoph keckeis , chief of the armed forces , said he sees no reason for change .
" the policy is that every single soldier has his weapon at home , a pistol or a gun , " keckeis said .
trust in the citizenry " this is a very robust tradition , " he added .
" we do have enormous confidence in our men , we know they are well-educated , and we are 100 percent sure that they know how to deal with this weapon and the ammunition . "
but not everyone shares that confidence .
tanja vollenweider had a happy family life until four years ago .
she and her husband had just bought a new house .
he was between jobs , so they had a few money worries , but not , she thought , big ones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland has high rates of suicide " it was a normal , happy day , we had taken the kids to the zoo , we had people to dinner in the evening ; " vollenweider said .
" in the middle of the night my daughter woke me - she said my husband had run out of the house with his army gun .
i tried to run after him , but i was too late . "
vollenweider 's husband killed himself .
high rates of suicide , domestic violence the only country with a higher rate of suicide with guns than switzerland is the united states .
and it 's not just suicide : every month or so , a swiss man turns his gun on his family .
the country has the highest rate of domestic violence using guns in europe .
" these deaths that are happening , these slaughters , these murders , are terrible , but there 's much more to the problem than that , " said sabin bieri , a professor of gender politics at the university of berne who is part of a growing campaign to get the guns out of swiss homes .
" the weapon is a constant threat in family life in switzerland , which i think is such a terrible thing for many women and many children . "
a threat to swiss masculinity ?
but it 's hard to challenge tradition .
learning to use a gun has been a rite of passage for young swiss men for centuries .
keckeis sees proposals to take the guns away as a threat to the masculinity of his troops .
" they will really be taken as unserious men , " he said .
" it would be a sign that we do n't have confidence in them any more , after being so confident for many years , and they would be really lost .
it would be a signal that the political power in switzerland is no longer confident in its armed forces and in its population . "
subject to referendum those political considerations are n't much comfort to tanja vollenweider .
she 's convinced she would still have her husband if the gun had n't been so readily available . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : introducing gun control would have to be decided by referendum " this only happened because the gun was right here at home , " she said .
" my husband would n't have gone out looking for one .
if the gun had n't been here i think he 'd still be alive . "
little by little , there are signs that the swiss may be ready for change : this summer , left-wing parties will launch plans for a nationwide referendum to force the army to take the weapons away .
the process will take a while but the current generation of new conscripts may be among the last to take their guns home with them . imogen foulkes -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i definitely think that germany is under-rated as a travel destination .
germany has so much to offer yet people seem to be unaware of it .
many people that i have talked to have only seen frankfurt and think that all of germany looks like frankfurt .
people do n't seem to know that germany has romantic cities , palaces , castles , and river valleys and that it is a very diverse country .
i was talking to someone who was surprised that germany is one of the countries that the alps run through !
what i find frustrating is that german tourism information seems to focus more on frankfurt 's skyscrapers than on cities like heidelberg , rothenburg , or the rhine and moselle valleys .
people from places like vancouver , new york , and hong kong go to europe to see old romantic cities , medieval festivals , and experience the culture .
we do not travel to see skyscrapers in frankfurt .
after all , we get enough of them at home . - yasser al-saadi , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ben donald wrote a book called " springtime for germany - or how i learned to love lederhosen " i agree with ben donald that germany is an overlooked destination .
for clear historical reasons , people in my part of europe -lrb- britain and europe -rrb- have blocked out germany as a place to go to for anything other than business .
germany is simply " hidden " by its past .
what a shame that is !
i have visited four times in the past two years and was very taken with the country .
i was n't surprised or changed in my opinions as i did not have any strong preconceptions .
it 's just that i had not realized that the country can be so interesting and in many areas very beautiful .
i reckon that many germans are pleased if a visitor can speak any german at all and they do not hold out for perfection .
this is because germany , while visited , is not a country that gets any kind of positive objective appreciation from people in english speaking countries .
there is not the same reaction to visiting germany as you would get if you visit france , italy or spain .
ben donald is right : it is a new frontier . - patrick hurley , ireland i plan to return to germany for the third time for vacation .
germany is one of the most beautiful countries i have ever visited , from the alps to the baltic .
the german people are some of the most friendly , funny and intelligent people i have ever met and are eager to continue a conversation , especially since i am from texas .
i am looking forward to my vacation in october to the rhine and the black forest . - mark burrows , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a reader from australia particularly like sababurg castle near kassel on our first trip to europe in 1984 , we fell in love with germany .
the scenery is spectacular , the people helpful and everything " works . "
and , the autobahns are fantastic .
our early trips were spent visiting the traditional tourist destinations but in 1997 and 2000 we found the hidden gems of germany such as sababurg castle .
our children are now totally fluent in german and we will be returning to the fabulous country in 2008 for more exploring . - greg wulff , australia i 've traveled to germany on holiday twice now and think it 's a great travel destination .
germany needs to market itself much more than it does .
from the wine festivals in the rhine river valley to a hike in the black forest near the small town of staufen , the scenery is awesome .
baden-baden has quaint shops where you can stroll along the streets and munich is one of my new favorite cities in the world .

couriering packages around kabul gives them a rare chance to make a living . afghanistan is thought to have more land mines than any other country in the world .
the estimated 30 million mines are a dangerous legacy of decades of war that have maimed approximately half a million people .
those who have lost limbs because of the mines find it nearly impossible to earn a living .
the german development service -lrb- ded -rrb- , which is germany 's foreign development aid agency , has partnered with the afghan amputee bicyclist for rehabilitation and recreation -lrb- aabrar -rrb- organization to give amputees in kabul a chance to earn a living . going without bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life as an amputee is difficult in afghanistan gone to run errands for his mother in kabul , qahar was 11 years old when he stepped on a mine and lost both his legs .
from then on , he was considered a burden on his large family , since he could n't earn money to help his siblings .
he sunk into a deep depression .
" i was mostly unhappy because i saw many people my age who could play volleyball and soccer , " qahar said .
" they went to school and to the university .
sometimes i cried and my mother comforted me .
she told me that i should stop crying , that everything was in god 's hands and that this was my destiny . "
qahar is now 23 and wears prosthetics .
he has found new hope with the aabrar , an afghan non-governmental organization that gets financial support from the ded .
the organization offers war invalids something that would normally be impossible in afghanistan - the chance to work and be independent . employment for amputees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated half million people have been injured by land mines in afghanistan the organization opened afghanistan 's first bicycle messenger service in kabul in november of 2002 , which exclusively employs people with physical disabilities the ded and aabrar came up with the idea while trying to think about what kind of employment opportunities could be given to amputees , said andreas schneider , the ded 's regional director for afghanistan and central asia .
the program employs 15 bicycle couriers .
formerly , these amputees would have spent years sitting at home without jobs .
now , in a normal day they deliver letters , packages and merchandise around the clock through the streets of kabul .
they wear protective masks because of pollution problems in the city , which has a million inhabitants .
they also wear helmets and have specially-designed bicycles .
" these are essentially specially-developed bicycles , " schneider said .
" you could say they 're a type of mountain bike that are designed so that they can be ridden with a prosthesis . " afghan businesses skeptical of service bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biking through kabul qahar has worked as a bicycle messenger for five years .
he brings home approximately 70 euros -lrb- $ 95 -rrb- a month .
qahar has also participated in international competitions for bicycle messengers , competing against those without disabilities .
he said he 's thankful he found this work , but he knows that other afghans are less fortunate .
" in afghanistan there are more than 300,000 disabled people and none of them have jobs , " qahar said .
" our neighbor boy who 's 12 or 13 years old has just lost his legs .
he ca n't work and also does n't have money to go to school and get an education . "
international organizations in kabul use the bicycle messenger service .
local businesses have been more reluctant , although the service is relatively cheap .
delivering a pizza , package or letter costs 25 afghani , approximately 50 euro cents .
until the project can become self-sufficient , the ded will continue to help out financially .

couriering packages around kabul gives them a rare chance to make a living . afghanistan is thought to have more land mines than any other country in the world .
the estimated 30 million mines are a dangerous legacy of decades of war that have maimed approximately half a million people .
those who have lost limbs because of the mines find it nearly impossible to earn a living .
the german development service -lrb- ded -rrb- , which is germany 's foreign development aid agency , has partnered with the afghan amputee bicyclist for rehabilitation and recreation -lrb- aabrar -rrb- organization to give amputees in kabul a chance to earn a living . going without bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life as an amputee is difficult in afghanistan gone to run errands for his mother in kabul , qahar was 11 years old when he stepped on a mine and lost both his legs .
from then on , he was considered a burden on his large family , since he could n't earn money to help his siblings .
he sunk into a deep depression .
" i was mostly unhappy because i saw many people my age who could play volleyball and soccer , " qahar said .
" they went to school and to the university .
sometimes i cried and my mother comforted me .
she told me that i should stop crying , that everything was in god 's hands and that this was my destiny . "
qahar is now 23 and wears prosthetics .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 29.07.2007 switzerland considers gun control großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : every swiss man serves in the army switzerland 's the only country that requires its soldiers to keep guns at home .
but concerns over high suicide rates and killings within families have caused some to ask whether having them there is simply too dangerous . all swiss men must do military service - they all learn to shoot - and when they go home , they take their assault rifles and 50 rounds of ammunition with them .
" for me it 's just routine , " said philippe schaub , heading home after his latest stint in the army .
" we all do military service , we 're all given a gun to take home .
i keep it in my cupboard just like the coats and the snowboard and the vacuum cleaner . "
the idea is to have an army ready for call up anytime .
although neutral switzerland has n't fought a war for centuries , christoph keckeis , chief of the armed forces , said he sees no reason for change .
" the policy is that every single soldier has his weapon at home , a pistol or a gun , " keckeis said .
trust in the citizenry " this is a very robust tradition , " he added .
" we do have enormous confidence in our men , we know they are well-educated , and we are 100 percent sure that they know how to deal with this weapon and the ammunition . "
but not everyone shares that confidence .
tanja vollenweider had a happy family life until four years ago .
she and her husband had just bought a new house .
he was between jobs , so they had a few money worries , but not , she thought , big ones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland has high rates of suicide " it was a normal , happy day , we had taken the kids to the zoo , we had people to dinner in the evening ; " vollenweider said .
" in the middle of the night my daughter woke me - she said my husband had run out of the house with his army gun .
i tried to run after him , but i was too late . "
vollenweider 's husband killed himself .
high rates of suicide , domestic violence the only country with a higher rate of suicide with guns than switzerland is the united states .
and it 's not just suicide : every month or so , a swiss man turns his gun on his family .
the country has the highest rate of domestic violence using guns in europe .
" these deaths that are happening , these slaughters , these murders , are terrible , but there 's much more to the problem than that , " said sabin bieri , a professor of gender politics at the university of berne who is part of a growing campaign to get the guns out of swiss homes .
" the weapon is a constant threat in family life in switzerland , which i think is such a terrible thing for many women and many children . "
a threat to swiss masculinity ?
but it 's hard to challenge tradition .
learning to use a gun has been a rite of passage for young swiss men for centuries .
keckeis sees proposals to take the guns away as a threat to the masculinity of his troops .
" they will really be taken as unserious men , " he said .
" it would be a sign that we do n't have confidence in them any more , after being so confident for many years , and they would be really lost .
it would be a signal that the political power in switzerland is no longer confident in its armed forces and in its population . "
subject to referendum those political considerations are n't much comfort to tanja vollenweider .
she 's convinced she would still have her husband if the gun had n't been so readily available . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : introducing gun control would have to be decided by referendum " this only happened because the gun was right here at home , " she said .
" my husband would n't have gone out looking for one .
if the gun had n't been here i think he 'd still be alive . "
little by little , there are signs that the swiss may be ready for change : this summer , left-wing parties will launch plans for a nationwide referendum to force the army to take the weapons away .
the process will take a while but the current generation of new conscripts may be among the last to take their guns home with them . imogen foulkes -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the policy is that every single soldier has his weapon at home , a pistol or a gun , " keckeis said .
trust in the citizenry " this is a very robust tradition , " he added .
" we do have enormous confidence in our men , we know they are well-educated , and we are 100 percent sure that they know how to deal with this weapon and the ammunition . "
but not everyone shares that confidence .
tanja vollenweider had a happy family life until four years ago .
she and her husband had just bought a new house .
he was between jobs , so they had a few money worries , but not , she thought , big ones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland has high rates of suicide " it was a normal , happy day , we had taken the kids to the zoo , we had people to dinner in the evening ; " vollenweider said .
" in the middle of the night my daughter woke me - she said my husband had run out of the house with his army gun .
i tried to run after him , but i was too late . "
vollenweider 's husband killed himself .
high rates of suicide , domestic violence the only country with a higher rate of suicide with guns than switzerland is the united states .
and it 's not just suicide : every month or so , a swiss man turns his gun on his family .
the country has the highest rate of domestic violence using guns in europe .
" these deaths that are happening , these slaughters , these murders , are terrible , but there 's much more to the problem than that , " said sabin bieri , a professor of gender politics at the university of berne who is part of a growing campaign to get the guns out of swiss homes .
" the weapon is a constant threat in family life in switzerland , which i think is such a terrible thing for many women and many children . "
a threat to swiss masculinity ?
but it 's hard to challenge tradition .
learning to use a gun has been a rite of passage for young swiss men for centuries .
keckeis sees proposals to take the guns away as a threat to the masculinity of his troops .
" they will really be taken as unserious men , " he said .
" it would be a sign that we do n't have confidence in them any more , after being so confident for many years , and they would be really lost .
it would be a signal that the political power in switzerland is no longer confident in its armed forces and in its population . "
subject to referendum those political considerations are n't much comfort to tanja vollenweider .
she 's convinced she would still have her husband if the gun had n't been so readily available . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : introducing gun control would have to be decided by referendum " this only happened because the gun was right here at home , " she said .
" my husband would n't have gone out looking for one .
if the gun had n't been here i think he 'd still be alive . "
little by little , there are signs that the swiss may be ready for change : this summer , left-wing parties will launch plans for a nationwide referendum to force the army to take the weapons away .
the process will take a while but the current generation of new conscripts may be among the last to take their guns home with them . imogen foulkes -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" germany is not an oasis , we are also threatened by terrorism , " he said in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" that has to be responsibly explained to the public .
the tone of the debate is very important . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble , left , and zypries have gone eye-to-eye on several issues but statements from maiziere , who also said that the country should not abandon its democratic principles out of fear , may be coming too late to have much of an effect . german justice minister brigitte zypries was called a " national security risk " by a state interior minister and numerous attacks were mounted against an initiative to allow online computer searches presented by interior minister wolfgang schäuble . zypries , as well as other members of the social democratic party , part of the chancellor 's ruling grand coalition , have come out against the computer search proposal .
in an op-ed published friday in the frankfurter rundschau she said clear limits needed to be placed on security measures in order to protect civil rights . some restrictions apply spd party head kurt beck agreed and added that his party was willing to consider permitting online searches of computer data if certain conditions were met . " we have to carefully weigh whether it is necessary and if it is even legally possible , " beck told the mass-market bild am sonntag newspaper .
" we are dealing with a sensitive area of privacy .
the people affected have to have a legal means to defend themselves from searches of their private information . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a verdict from the constitutional court is expected in early 2008 sebastian edathy an spd parliamentarian said the bundestag should wait until the country 's highest court rules on the constitutionality of a similar law enacted in one germany 's 16 states . germany 's federal constitutional court is scheduled to hear a case dealing with north rhine-westphalia 's online search law in october . " it would be foolish for us to make a decision that , in light of the judges ' verdict , would have to be corrected or revised , " he told the taz newspaper .
" the subject can be discussed , but it 's not ready for a decision . " bavarian interior minister günther beckstein , however , said such online searches should be implemented as soon as possible , calling them an important tool for authorities in fighting terrorism .
he also accused zypries of keeping police from using all the means at their disposal to prevent terror attacks . " i think mrs. zypries ' behavior is indefensible because it creates a hole in the security net and that can be very dangerous for germany , " he told the passauer neuen presse . as opinions on the issue continue to heat up , maiziere said he would do everything in his power to bring the political parties to a compromise by the end of august . article based on news reports -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i definitely think that germany is under-rated as a travel destination .
germany has so much to offer yet people seem to be unaware of it .
many people that i have talked to have only seen frankfurt and think that all of germany looks like frankfurt .
people do n't seem to know that germany has romantic cities , palaces , castles , and river valleys and that it is a very diverse country .
i was talking to someone who was surprised that germany is one of the countries that the alps run through !
what i find frustrating is that german tourism information seems to focus more on frankfurt 's skyscrapers than on cities like heidelberg , rothenburg , or the rhine and moselle valleys .
people from places like vancouver , new york , and hong kong go to europe to see old romantic cities , medieval festivals , and experience the culture .

for clear historical reasons , people in my part of europe -lrb- britain and europe -rrb- have blocked out germany as a place to go to for anything other than business .
germany is simply " hidden " by its past .
what a shame that is !
i have visited four times in the past two years and was very taken with the country .
i was n't surprised or changed in my opinions as i did not have any strong preconceptions .
it 's just that i had not realized that the country can be so interesting and in many areas very beautiful .
i reckon that many germans are pleased if a visitor can speak any german at all and they do not hold out for perfection .
this is because germany , while visited , is not a country that gets any kind of positive objective appreciation from people in english speaking countries .
there is not the same reaction to visiting germany as you would get if you visit france , italy or spain .
ben donald is right : it is a new frontier . - patrick hurley , ireland i plan to return to germany for the third time for vacation .

couriering packages around kabul gives them a rare chance to make a living . afghanistan is thought to have more land mines than any other country in the world .
the estimated 30 million mines are a dangerous legacy of decades of war that have maimed approximately half a million people .
those who have lost limbs because of the mines find it nearly impossible to earn a living .
the german development service -lrb- ded -rrb- , which is germany 's foreign development aid agency , has partnered with the afghan amputee bicyclist for rehabilitation and recreation -lrb- aabrar -rrb- organization to give amputees in kabul a chance to earn a living . going without bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life as an amputee is difficult in afghanistan gone to run errands for his mother in kabul , qahar was 11 years old when he stepped on a mine and lost both his legs .
from then on , he was considered a burden on his large family , since he could n't earn money to help his siblings .
he sunk into a deep depression .
" i was mostly unhappy because i saw many people my age who could play volleyball and soccer , " qahar said .
" they went to school and to the university .
sometimes i cried and my mother comforted me .
she told me that i should stop crying , that everything was in god 's hands and that this was my destiny . "
qahar is now 23 and wears prosthetics .
he has found new hope with the aabrar , an afghan non-governmental organization that gets financial support from the ded .
the organization offers war invalids something that would normally be impossible in afghanistan - the chance to work and be independent . employment for amputees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated half million people have been injured by land mines in afghanistan the organization opened afghanistan 's first bicycle messenger service in kabul in november of 2002 , which exclusively employs people with physical disabilities the ded and aabrar came up with the idea while trying to think about what kind of employment opportunities could be given to amputees , said andreas schneider , the ded 's regional director for afghanistan and central asia .
the program employs 15 bicycle couriers .
formerly , these amputees would have spent years sitting at home without jobs .
now , in a normal day they deliver letters , packages and merchandise around the clock through the streets of kabul .
they wear protective masks because of pollution problems in the city , which has a million inhabitants .
they also wear helmets and have specially-designed bicycles .
" these are essentially specially-developed bicycles , " schneider said .
" you could say they 're a type of mountain bike that are designed so that they can be ridden with a prosthesis . " afghan businesses skeptical of service bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biking through kabul qahar has worked as a bicycle messenger for five years .
he brings home approximately 70 euros -lrb- $ 95 -rrb- a month .
qahar has also participated in international competitions for bicycle messengers , competing against those without disabilities .
he said he 's thankful he found this work , but he knows that other afghans are less fortunate .
" in afghanistan there are more than 300,000 disabled people and none of them have jobs , " qahar said .
" our neighbor boy who 's 12 or 13 years old has just lost his legs .
he ca n't work and also does n't have money to go to school and get an education . "
international organizations in kabul use the bicycle messenger service .
local businesses have been more reluctant , although the service is relatively cheap .
delivering a pizza , package or letter costs 25 afghani , approximately 50 euro cents .
until the project can become self-sufficient , the ded will continue to help out financially .
the program hopes to help more people like qahar get a chance at a new start on life . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 29.07.2007 switzerland considers gun control großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : every swiss man serves in the army switzerland 's the only country that requires its soldiers to keep guns at home .
but concerns over high suicide rates and killings within families have caused some to ask whether having them there is simply too dangerous . all swiss men must do military service - they all learn to shoot - and when they go home , they take their assault rifles and 50 rounds of ammunition with them .
" for me it 's just routine , " said philippe schaub , heading home after his latest stint in the army .
" we all do military service , we 're all given a gun to take home .
i keep it in my cupboard just like the coats and the snowboard and the vacuum cleaner . "
the idea is to have an army ready for call up anytime .
although neutral switzerland has n't fought a war for centuries , christoph keckeis , chief of the armed forces , said he sees no reason for change .
" the policy is that every single soldier has his weapon at home , a pistol or a gun , " keckeis said .
trust in the citizenry " this is a very robust tradition , " he added .
" we do have enormous confidence in our men , we know they are well-educated , and we are 100 percent sure that they know how to deal with this weapon and the ammunition . "
but not everyone shares that confidence .
tanja vollenweider had a happy family life until four years ago .
she and her husband had just bought a new house .
he was between jobs , so they had a few money worries , but not , she thought , big ones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland has high rates of suicide " it was a normal , happy day , we had taken the kids to the zoo , we had people to dinner in the evening ; " vollenweider said .
" in the middle of the night my daughter woke me - she said my husband had run out of the house with his army gun .
i tried to run after him , but i was too late . "
vollenweider 's husband killed himself .
high rates of suicide , domestic violence the only country with a higher rate of suicide with guns than switzerland is the united states .
and it 's not just suicide : every month or so , a swiss man turns his gun on his family .
the country has the highest rate of domestic violence using guns in europe .
" these deaths that are happening , these slaughters , these murders , are terrible , but there 's much more to the problem than that , " said sabin bieri , a professor of gender politics at the university of berne who is part of a growing campaign to get the guns out of swiss homes .
" the weapon is a constant threat in family life in switzerland , which i think is such a terrible thing for many women and many children . "
a threat to swiss masculinity ?
but it 's hard to challenge tradition .
learning to use a gun has been a rite of passage for young swiss men for centuries .
keckeis sees proposals to take the guns away as a threat to the masculinity of his troops .
" they will really be taken as unserious men , " he said .
" it would be a sign that we do n't have confidence in them any more , after being so confident for many years , and they would be really lost .
it would be a signal that the political power in switzerland is no longer confident in its armed forces and in its population . "
subject to referendum those political considerations are n't much comfort to tanja vollenweider .
she 's convinced she would still have her husband if the gun had n't been so readily available . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : introducing gun control would have to be decided by referendum " this only happened because the gun was right here at home , " she said .
" my husband would n't have gone out looking for one .
if the gun had n't been here i think he 'd still be alive . "
little by little , there are signs that the swiss may be ready for change : this summer , left-wing parties will launch plans for a nationwide referendum to force the army to take the weapons away .
the process will take a while but the current generation of new conscripts may be among the last to take their guns home with them . imogen foulkes -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i definitely think that germany is under-rated as a travel destination .
germany has so much to offer yet people seem to be unaware of it .
many people that i have talked to have only seen frankfurt and think that all of germany looks like frankfurt .
people do n't seem to know that germany has romantic cities , palaces , castles , and river valleys and that it is a very diverse country .
i was talking to someone who was surprised that germany is one of the countries that the alps run through !
what i find frustrating is that german tourism information seems to focus more on frankfurt 's skyscrapers than on cities like heidelberg , rothenburg , or the rhine and moselle valleys .
people from places like vancouver , new york , and hong kong go to europe to see old romantic cities , medieval festivals , and experience the culture .
we do not travel to see skyscrapers in frankfurt .
after all , we get enough of them at home . - yasser al-saadi , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ben donald wrote a book called " springtime for germany - or how i learned to love lederhosen " i agree with ben donald that germany is an overlooked destination .
for clear historical reasons , people in my part of europe -lrb- britain and europe -rrb- have blocked out germany as a place to go to for anything other than business .
germany is simply " hidden " by its past .
what a shame that is !
i have visited four times in the past two years and was very taken with the country .
i was n't surprised or changed in my opinions as i did not have any strong preconceptions .
it 's just that i had not realized that the country can be so interesting and in many areas very beautiful .
i reckon that many germans are pleased if a visitor can speak any german at all and they do not hold out for perfection .
this is because germany , while visited , is not a country that gets any kind of positive objective appreciation from people in english speaking countries .
there is not the same reaction to visiting germany as you would get if you visit france , italy or spain .
ben donald is right : it is a new frontier . - patrick hurley , ireland i plan to return to germany for the third time for vacation .
germany is one of the most beautiful countries i have ever visited , from the alps to the baltic .
the german people are some of the most friendly , funny and intelligent people i have ever met and are eager to continue a conversation , especially since i am from texas .
i am looking forward to my vacation in october to the rhine and the black forest . - mark burrows , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a reader from australia particularly like sababurg castle near kassel on our first trip to europe in 1984 , we fell in love with germany .
the scenery is spectacular , the people helpful and everything " works . "
and , the autobahns are fantastic .
our early trips were spent visiting the traditional tourist destinations but in 1997 and 2000 we found the hidden gems of germany such as sababurg castle .
our children are now totally fluent in german and we will be returning to the fabulous country in 2008 for more exploring . - greg wulff , australia i 've traveled to germany on holiday twice now and think it 's a great travel destination .
germany needs to market itself much more than it does .
from the wine festivals in the rhine river valley to a hike in the black forest near the small town of staufen , the scenery is awesome .
baden-baden has quaint shops where you can stroll along the streets and munich is one of my new favorite cities in the world .
adding the medieval charm of rothenburg , you have so many opportunities to attract tourists to your country .
and i have n't even been to berlin yet ! - kris , us compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lost your wanderlust ?

but the meagre 1-0 win left opinions split over the victory 's potential impact on the bundesliga season . after a disappointing fourth-place league finish last season , germany striker miroslav klose netted the winner on saturday as bayern munich defeated schalke and claimed the german preseason title .
klose , one of munich 's major summer newcomers , was on target just before the half-hour mark , tapping into the empty net after confusion in the schalke defense .
munich dominated the match in leipzig and even without their other big-name newcomers , including injured france winger franck ribery and italy forward luca toni , the bavarians showed the creativity and style many observers said the side lacked last season .
" we laid down our marker that we 're back , " said bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld .
spending spree bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn said the victory would be good for the team 's self-confidence bayern laid down much more than a marker over the bundesliga 's summer break .

" we 've now got a team that we hoped to have , " munich goalkeeper oliver kahn said .
" it 'll take a while until we find the best lineup . "
bayern won the six-team league cup , an unofficial pre-season event , by beating all three teams ranked ahead of them in the last bundesliga season : league champions vfb stuttgart , schalke and werder bremen .
" favorites for all the titles " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern fans want their team to start filling the trophy case " if you have the chance to get a title you should win it , " said coach ottmar hitzfeld . "
it 's good to beat all three teams that were ahead of us , one after another . "
bayern also claimed the bundesliga title the last four times they won the league cup , which has been fought over for 11 years .
" this team is an attraction for the bundesliga , " said matthias sammer , the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- sport director said of bayern .
" they 're the favorites for all the titles . "
the german season kicks off next week with the first round of the german cup and the bundesliga start set for aug .

but concerns over high suicide rates and killings within families have caused some to ask whether having them there is simply too dangerous . all swiss men must do military service - they all learn to shoot - and when they go home , they take their assault rifles and 50 rounds of ammunition with them .
" for me it 's just routine , " said philippe schaub , heading home after his latest stint in the army .
" we all do military service , we 're all given a gun to take home .
i keep it in my cupboard just like the coats and the snowboard and the vacuum cleaner . "
the idea is to have an army ready for call up anytime .
although neutral switzerland has n't fought a war for centuries , christoph keckeis , chief of the armed forces , said he sees no reason for change .
" the policy is that every single soldier has his weapon at home , a pistol or a gun , " keckeis said .
trust in the citizenry " this is a very robust tradition , " he added .
" we do have enormous confidence in our men , we know they are well-educated , and we are 100 percent sure that they know how to deal with this weapon and the ammunition . "
but not everyone shares that confidence .
tanja vollenweider had a happy family life until four years ago .
she and her husband had just bought a new house .
he was between jobs , so they had a few money worries , but not , she thought , big ones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland has high rates of suicide " it was a normal , happy day , we had taken the kids to the zoo , we had people to dinner in the evening ; " vollenweider said .
" in the middle of the night my daughter woke me - she said my husband had run out of the house with his army gun .
i tried to run after him , but i was too late . "
vollenweider 's husband killed himself .
high rates of suicide , domestic violence the only country with a higher rate of suicide with guns than switzerland is the united states .
and it 's not just suicide : every month or so , a swiss man turns his gun on his family .
the country has the highest rate of domestic violence using guns in europe .
" these deaths that are happening , these slaughters , these murders , are terrible , but there 's much more to the problem than that , " said sabin bieri , a professor of gender politics at the university of berne who is part of a growing campaign to get the guns out of swiss homes .
" the weapon is a constant threat in family life in switzerland , which i think is such a terrible thing for many women and many children . "
a threat to swiss masculinity ?
but it 's hard to challenge tradition .
learning to use a gun has been a rite of passage for young swiss men for centuries .
keckeis sees proposals to take the guns away as a threat to the masculinity of his troops .
" they will really be taken as unserious men , " he said .
" it would be a sign that we do n't have confidence in them any more , after being so confident for many years , and they would be really lost .
it would be a signal that the political power in switzerland is no longer confident in its armed forces and in its population . "
subject to referendum those political considerations are n't much comfort to tanja vollenweider .
she 's convinced she would still have her husband if the gun had n't been so readily available . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : introducing gun control would have to be decided by referendum " this only happened because the gun was right here at home , " she said .
" my husband would n't have gone out looking for one .
if the gun had n't been here i think he 'd still be alive . "
little by little , there are signs that the swiss may be ready for change : this summer , left-wing parties will launch plans for a nationwide referendum to force the army to take the weapons away .
the process will take a while but the current generation of new conscripts may be among the last to take their guns home with them . imogen foulkes -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it would be a signal that the political power in switzerland is no longer confident in its armed forces and in its population . "
subject to referendum those political considerations are n't much comfort to tanja vollenweider .
she 's convinced she would still have her husband if the gun had n't been so readily available . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : introducing gun control would have to be decided by referendum " this only happened because the gun was right here at home , " she said .
" my husband would n't have gone out looking for one .
if the gun had n't been here i think he 'd still be alive . "
little by little , there are signs that the swiss may be ready for change : this summer , left-wing parties will launch plans for a nationwide referendum to force the army to take the weapons away .
the process will take a while but the current generation of new conscripts may be among the last to take their guns home with them . imogen foulkes -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

couriering packages around kabul gives them a rare chance to make a living . afghanistan is thought to have more land mines than any other country in the world .
the estimated 30 million mines are a dangerous legacy of decades of war that have maimed approximately half a million people .
those who have lost limbs because of the mines find it nearly impossible to earn a living .
the german development service -lrb- ded -rrb- , which is germany 's foreign development aid agency , has partnered with the afghan amputee bicyclist for rehabilitation and recreation -lrb- aabrar -rrb- organization to give amputees in kabul a chance to earn a living . going without bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life as an amputee is difficult in afghanistan gone to run errands for his mother in kabul , qahar was 11 years old when he stepped on a mine and lost both his legs .
from then on , he was considered a burden on his large family , since he could n't earn money to help his siblings .
he sunk into a deep depression .
" i was mostly unhappy because i saw many people my age who could play volleyball and soccer , " qahar said .
" they went to school and to the university .
sometimes i cried and my mother comforted me .
she told me that i should stop crying , that everything was in god 's hands and that this was my destiny . "
qahar is now 23 and wears prosthetics .
he has found new hope with the aabrar , an afghan non-governmental organization that gets financial support from the ded .

the program employs 15 bicycle couriers .
formerly , these amputees would have spent years sitting at home without jobs .
now , in a normal day they deliver letters , packages and merchandise around the clock through the streets of kabul .
they wear protective masks because of pollution problems in the city , which has a million inhabitants .
they also wear helmets and have specially-designed bicycles .
" these are essentially specially-developed bicycles , " schneider said .

he said he 's thankful he found this work , but he knows that other afghans are less fortunate .
" in afghanistan there are more than 300,000 disabled people and none of them have jobs , " qahar said .
" our neighbor boy who 's 12 or 13 years old has just lost his legs .
he ca n't work and also does n't have money to go to school and get an education . "
international organizations in kabul use the bicycle messenger service .
local businesses have been more reluctant , although the service is relatively cheap .
delivering a pizza , package or letter costs 25 afghani , approximately 50 euro cents .

but the meagre 1-0 win left opinions split over the victory 's potential impact on the bundesliga season . after a disappointing fourth-place league finish last season , germany striker miroslav klose netted the winner on saturday as bayern munich defeated schalke and claimed the german preseason title .
klose , one of munich 's major summer newcomers , was on target just before the half-hour mark , tapping into the empty net after confusion in the schalke defense .
munich dominated the match in leipzig and even without their other big-name newcomers , including injured france winger franck ribery and italy forward luca toni , the bavarians showed the creativity and style many observers said the side lacked last season .
" we laid down our marker that we 're back , " said bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld .

munich went on an unprecedented spending spree after coming only fourth last season , dishing out 70 million euros -lrb- $ 95 million -rrb- for new players .
" we 've now got a team that we hoped to have , " munich goalkeeper oliver kahn said .
" it 'll take a while until we find the best lineup . "
bayern won the six-team league cup , an unofficial pre-season event , by beating all three teams ranked ahead of them in the last bundesliga season : league champions vfb stuttgart , schalke and werder bremen .
" favorites for all the titles " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern fans want their team to start filling the trophy case " if you have the chance to get a title you should win it , " said coach ottmar hitzfeld . "
it 's good to beat all three teams that were ahead of us , one after another . "
bayern also claimed the bundesliga title the last four times they won the league cup , which has been fought over for 11 years .
" this team is an attraction for the bundesliga , " said matthias sammer , the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- sport director said of bayern .
" they 're the favorites for all the titles . "
the german season kicks off next week with the first round of the german cup and the bundesliga start set for aug .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 29.07.2007 switzerland considers gun control großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : every swiss man serves in the army switzerland 's the only country that requires its soldiers to keep guns at home .
but concerns over high suicide rates and killings within families have caused some to ask whether having them there is simply too dangerous . all swiss men must do military service - they all learn to shoot - and when they go home , they take their assault rifles and 50 rounds of ammunition with them .
" for me it 's just routine , " said philippe schaub , heading home after his latest stint in the army .
" we all do military service , we 're all given a gun to take home .
i keep it in my cupboard just like the coats and the snowboard and the vacuum cleaner . "
the idea is to have an army ready for call up anytime .
although neutral switzerland has n't fought a war for centuries , christoph keckeis , chief of the armed forces , said he sees no reason for change .
" the policy is that every single soldier has his weapon at home , a pistol or a gun , " keckeis said .
trust in the citizenry " this is a very robust tradition , " he added .
" we do have enormous confidence in our men , we know they are well-educated , and we are 100 percent sure that they know how to deal with this weapon and the ammunition . "
but not everyone shares that confidence .
tanja vollenweider had a happy family life until four years ago .
she and her husband had just bought a new house .
he was between jobs , so they had a few money worries , but not , she thought , big ones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland has high rates of suicide " it was a normal , happy day , we had taken the kids to the zoo , we had people to dinner in the evening ; " vollenweider said .
" in the middle of the night my daughter woke me - she said my husband had run out of the house with his army gun .
i tried to run after him , but i was too late . "
vollenweider 's husband killed himself .
high rates of suicide , domestic violence the only country with a higher rate of suicide with guns than switzerland is the united states .
and it 's not just suicide : every month or so , a swiss man turns his gun on his family .
the country has the highest rate of domestic violence using guns in europe .
" these deaths that are happening , these slaughters , these murders , are terrible , but there 's much more to the problem than that , " said sabin bieri , a professor of gender politics at the university of berne who is part of a growing campaign to get the guns out of swiss homes .
" the weapon is a constant threat in family life in switzerland , which i think is such a terrible thing for many women and many children . "
a threat to swiss masculinity ?
but it 's hard to challenge tradition .
learning to use a gun has been a rite of passage for young swiss men for centuries .
keckeis sees proposals to take the guns away as a threat to the masculinity of his troops .
" they will really be taken as unserious men , " he said .
" it would be a sign that we do n't have confidence in them any more , after being so confident for many years , and they would be really lost .
it would be a signal that the political power in switzerland is no longer confident in its armed forces and in its population . "
subject to referendum those political considerations are n't much comfort to tanja vollenweider .
she 's convinced she would still have her husband if the gun had n't been so readily available . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : introducing gun control would have to be decided by referendum " this only happened because the gun was right here at home , " she said .
" my husband would n't have gone out looking for one .
if the gun had n't been here i think he 'd still be alive . "
little by little , there are signs that the swiss may be ready for change : this summer , left-wing parties will launch plans for a nationwide referendum to force the army to take the weapons away .
the process will take a while but the current generation of new conscripts may be among the last to take their guns home with them . imogen foulkes -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tanja vollenweider had a happy family life until four years ago .
she and her husband had just bought a new house .
he was between jobs , so they had a few money worries , but not , she thought , big ones .

i tried to run after him , but i was too late . "
vollenweider 's husband killed himself .
high rates of suicide , domestic violence the only country with a higher rate of suicide with guns than switzerland is the united states .
and it 's not just suicide : every month or so , a swiss man turns his gun on his family .
the country has the highest rate of domestic violence using guns in europe .
" these deaths that are happening , these slaughters , these murders , are terrible , but there 's much more to the problem than that , " said sabin bieri , a professor of gender politics at the university of berne who is part of a growing campaign to get the guns out of swiss homes .
" the weapon is a constant threat in family life in switzerland , which i think is such a terrible thing for many women and many children . "
a threat to swiss masculinity ?
but it 's hard to challenge tradition .
learning to use a gun has been a rite of passage for young swiss men for centuries .
keckeis sees proposals to take the guns away as a threat to the masculinity of his troops .
" they will really be taken as unserious men , " he said .
" it would be a sign that we do n't have confidence in them any more , after being so confident for many years , and they would be really lost .
it would be a signal that the political power in switzerland is no longer confident in its armed forces and in its population . "
subject to referendum those political considerations are n't much comfort to tanja vollenweider .
she 's convinced she would still have her husband if the gun had n't been so readily available . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : introducing gun control would have to be decided by referendum " this only happened because the gun was right here at home , " she said .
" my husband would n't have gone out looking for one .
if the gun had n't been here i think he 'd still be alive . "
little by little , there are signs that the swiss may be ready for change : this summer , left-wing parties will launch plans for a nationwide referendum to force the army to take the weapons away .
the process will take a while but the current generation of new conscripts may be among the last to take their guns home with them . imogen foulkes -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

couriering packages around kabul gives them a rare chance to make a living . afghanistan is thought to have more land mines than any other country in the world .
the estimated 30 million mines are a dangerous legacy of decades of war that have maimed approximately half a million people .
those who have lost limbs because of the mines find it nearly impossible to earn a living .
the german development service -lrb- ded -rrb- , which is germany 's foreign development aid agency , has partnered with the afghan amputee bicyclist for rehabilitation and recreation -lrb- aabrar -rrb- organization to give amputees in kabul a chance to earn a living . going without bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life as an amputee is difficult in afghanistan gone to run errands for his mother in kabul , qahar was 11 years old when he stepped on a mine and lost both his legs .

he sunk into a deep depression .
" i was mostly unhappy because i saw many people my age who could play volleyball and soccer , " qahar said .
" they went to school and to the university .
sometimes i cried and my mother comforted me .
she told me that i should stop crying , that everything was in god 's hands and that this was my destiny . "
qahar is now 23 and wears prosthetics .

the program employs 15 bicycle couriers .
formerly , these amputees would have spent years sitting at home without jobs .

they wear protective masks because of pollution problems in the city , which has a million inhabitants .
they also wear helmets and have specially-designed bicycles .
" these are essentially specially-developed bicycles , " schneider said .

qahar has also participated in international competitions for bicycle messengers , competing against those without disabilities .
he said he 's thankful he found this work , but he knows that other afghans are less fortunate .
" in afghanistan there are more than 300,000 disabled people and none of them have jobs , " qahar said .
" our neighbor boy who 's 12 or 13 years old has just lost his legs .
he ca n't work and also does n't have money to go to school and get an education . "
international organizations in kabul use the bicycle messenger service .
local businesses have been more reluctant , although the service is relatively cheap .

the estimated 30 million mines are a dangerous legacy of decades of war that have maimed approximately half a million people .
those who have lost limbs because of the mines find it nearly impossible to earn a living .
the german development service -lrb- ded -rrb- , which is germany 's foreign development aid agency , has partnered with the afghan amputee bicyclist for rehabilitation and recreation -lrb- aabrar -rrb- organization to give amputees in kabul a chance to earn a living . going without bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life as an amputee is difficult in afghanistan gone to run errands for his mother in kabul , qahar was 11 years old when he stepped on a mine and lost both his legs .

he sunk into a deep depression .
" i was mostly unhappy because i saw many people my age who could play volleyball and soccer , " qahar said .
" they went to school and to the university .
sometimes i cried and my mother comforted me .
she told me that i should stop crying , that everything was in god 's hands and that this was my destiny . "
qahar is now 23 and wears prosthetics .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 29.07.2007 switzerland considers gun control großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : every swiss man serves in the army switzerland 's the only country that requires its soldiers to keep guns at home .
but concerns over high suicide rates and killings within families have caused some to ask whether having them there is simply too dangerous . all swiss men must do military service - they all learn to shoot - and when they go home , they take their assault rifles and 50 rounds of ammunition with them .
" for me it 's just routine , " said philippe schaub , heading home after his latest stint in the army .
" we all do military service , we 're all given a gun to take home .
i keep it in my cupboard just like the coats and the snowboard and the vacuum cleaner . "
the idea is to have an army ready for call up anytime .
although neutral switzerland has n't fought a war for centuries , christoph keckeis , chief of the armed forces , said he sees no reason for change .
" the policy is that every single soldier has his weapon at home , a pistol or a gun , " keckeis said .
trust in the citizenry " this is a very robust tradition , " he added .
" we do have enormous confidence in our men , we know they are well-educated , and we are 100 percent sure that they know how to deal with this weapon and the ammunition . "
but not everyone shares that confidence .
tanja vollenweider had a happy family life until four years ago .
she and her husband had just bought a new house .
he was between jobs , so they had a few money worries , but not , she thought , big ones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland has high rates of suicide " it was a normal , happy day , we had taken the kids to the zoo , we had people to dinner in the evening ; " vollenweider said .
" in the middle of the night my daughter woke me - she said my husband had run out of the house with his army gun .
i tried to run after him , but i was too late . "
vollenweider 's husband killed himself .
high rates of suicide , domestic violence the only country with a higher rate of suicide with guns than switzerland is the united states .
and it 's not just suicide : every month or so , a swiss man turns his gun on his family .
the country has the highest rate of domestic violence using guns in europe .
" these deaths that are happening , these slaughters , these murders , are terrible , but there 's much more to the problem than that , " said sabin bieri , a professor of gender politics at the university of berne who is part of a growing campaign to get the guns out of swiss homes .
" the weapon is a constant threat in family life in switzerland , which i think is such a terrible thing for many women and many children . "
a threat to swiss masculinity ?
but it 's hard to challenge tradition .
learning to use a gun has been a rite of passage for young swiss men for centuries .
keckeis sees proposals to take the guns away as a threat to the masculinity of his troops .
" they will really be taken as unserious men , " he said .
" it would be a sign that we do n't have confidence in them any more , after being so confident for many years , and they would be really lost .
it would be a signal that the political power in switzerland is no longer confident in its armed forces and in its population . "
subject to referendum those political considerations are n't much comfort to tanja vollenweider .
she 's convinced she would still have her husband if the gun had n't been so readily available . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : introducing gun control would have to be decided by referendum " this only happened because the gun was right here at home , " she said .
" my husband would n't have gone out looking for one .
if the gun had n't been here i think he 'd still be alive . "
little by little , there are signs that the swiss may be ready for change : this summer , left-wing parties will launch plans for a nationwide referendum to force the army to take the weapons away .
the process will take a while but the current generation of new conscripts may be among the last to take their guns home with them . imogen foulkes -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 29.07.2007 switzerland considers gun control großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : every swiss man serves in the army switzerland 's the only country that requires its soldiers to keep guns at home .
but concerns over high suicide rates and killings within families have caused some to ask whether having them there is simply too dangerous . all swiss men must do military service - they all learn to shoot - and when they go home , they take their assault rifles and 50 rounds of ammunition with them .
" for me it 's just routine , " said philippe schaub , heading home after his latest stint in the army .
" we all do military service , we 're all given a gun to take home .
i keep it in my cupboard just like the coats and the snowboard and the vacuum cleaner . "
the idea is to have an army ready for call up anytime .
although neutral switzerland has n't fought a war for centuries , christoph keckeis , chief of the armed forces , said he sees no reason for change .
" the policy is that every single soldier has his weapon at home , a pistol or a gun , " keckeis said .
trust in the citizenry " this is a very robust tradition , " he added .
" we do have enormous confidence in our men , we know they are well-educated , and we are 100 percent sure that they know how to deal with this weapon and the ammunition . "
but not everyone shares that confidence .
tanja vollenweider had a happy family life until four years ago .
she and her husband had just bought a new house .
he was between jobs , so they had a few money worries , but not , she thought , big ones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland has high rates of suicide " it was a normal , happy day , we had taken the kids to the zoo , we had people to dinner in the evening ; " vollenweider said .
" in the middle of the night my daughter woke me - she said my husband had run out of the house with his army gun .
i tried to run after him , but i was too late . "
vollenweider 's husband killed himself .
high rates of suicide , domestic violence the only country with a higher rate of suicide with guns than switzerland is the united states .
and it 's not just suicide : every month or so , a swiss man turns his gun on his family .
the country has the highest rate of domestic violence using guns in europe .
" these deaths that are happening , these slaughters , these murders , are terrible , but there 's much more to the problem than that , " said sabin bieri , a professor of gender politics at the university of berne who is part of a growing campaign to get the guns out of swiss homes .
" the weapon is a constant threat in family life in switzerland , which i think is such a terrible thing for many women and many children . "
a threat to swiss masculinity ?
but it 's hard to challenge tradition .
learning to use a gun has been a rite of passage for young swiss men for centuries .
keckeis sees proposals to take the guns away as a threat to the masculinity of his troops .
" they will really be taken as unserious men , " he said .
" it would be a sign that we do n't have confidence in them any more , after being so confident for many years , and they would be really lost .
it would be a signal that the political power in switzerland is no longer confident in its armed forces and in its population . "
subject to referendum those political considerations are n't much comfort to tanja vollenweider .
she 's convinced she would still have her husband if the gun had n't been so readily available . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : introducing gun control would have to be decided by referendum " this only happened because the gun was right here at home , " she said .
" my husband would n't have gone out looking for one .
if the gun had n't been here i think he 'd still be alive . "
little by little , there are signs that the swiss may be ready for change : this summer , left-wing parties will launch plans for a nationwide referendum to force the army to take the weapons away .
the process will take a while but the current generation of new conscripts may be among the last to take their guns home with them . imogen foulkes -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but concerns over high suicide rates and killings within families have caused some to ask whether having them there is simply too dangerous . all swiss men must do military service - they all learn to shoot - and when they go home , they take their assault rifles and 50 rounds of ammunition with them .
" for me it 's just routine , " said philippe schaub , heading home after his latest stint in the army .
" we all do military service , we 're all given a gun to take home .
i keep it in my cupboard just like the coats and the snowboard and the vacuum cleaner . "
the idea is to have an army ready for call up anytime .
although neutral switzerland has n't fought a war for centuries , christoph keckeis , chief of the armed forces , said he sees no reason for change .
" the policy is that every single soldier has his weapon at home , a pistol or a gun , " keckeis said .
trust in the citizenry " this is a very robust tradition , " he added .
" we do have enormous confidence in our men , we know they are well-educated , and we are 100 percent sure that they know how to deal with this weapon and the ammunition . "
but not everyone shares that confidence .
tanja vollenweider had a happy family life until four years ago .
she and her husband had just bought a new house .
he was between jobs , so they had a few money worries , but not , she thought , big ones .

i tried to run after him , but i was too late . "
vollenweider 's husband killed himself .
high rates of suicide , domestic violence the only country with a higher rate of suicide with guns than switzerland is the united states .
and it 's not just suicide : every month or so , a swiss man turns his gun on his family .
the country has the highest rate of domestic violence using guns in europe .
" these deaths that are happening , these slaughters , these murders , are terrible , but there 's much more to the problem than that , " said sabin bieri , a professor of gender politics at the university of berne who is part of a growing campaign to get the guns out of swiss homes .
" the weapon is a constant threat in family life in switzerland , which i think is such a terrible thing for many women and many children . "
a threat to swiss masculinity ?
but it 's hard to challenge tradition .
learning to use a gun has been a rite of passage for young swiss men for centuries .
keckeis sees proposals to take the guns away as a threat to the masculinity of his troops .
" they will really be taken as unserious men , " he said .
" it would be a sign that we do n't have confidence in them any more , after being so confident for many years , and they would be really lost .
it would be a signal that the political power in switzerland is no longer confident in its armed forces and in its population . "
subject to referendum those political considerations are n't much comfort to tanja vollenweider .
she 's convinced she would still have her husband if the gun had n't been so readily available . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : introducing gun control would have to be decided by referendum " this only happened because the gun was right here at home , " she said .
" my husband would n't have gone out looking for one .

little by little , there are signs that the swiss may be ready for change : this summer , left-wing parties will launch plans for a nationwide referendum to force the army to take the weapons away .

couriering packages around kabul gives them a rare chance to make a living . afghanistan is thought to have more land mines than any other country in the world .
the estimated 30 million mines are a dangerous legacy of decades of war that have maimed approximately half a million people .
those who have lost limbs because of the mines find it nearly impossible to earn a living .
the german development service -lrb- ded -rrb- , which is germany 's foreign development aid agency , has partnered with the afghan amputee bicyclist for rehabilitation and recreation -lrb- aabrar -rrb- organization to give amputees in kabul a chance to earn a living . going without bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life as an amputee is difficult in afghanistan gone to run errands for his mother in kabul , qahar was 11 years old when he stepped on a mine and lost both his legs .
from then on , he was considered a burden on his large family , since he could n't earn money to help his siblings .
he sunk into a deep depression .
" i was mostly unhappy because i saw many people my age who could play volleyball and soccer , " qahar said .
" they went to school and to the university .
sometimes i cried and my mother comforted me .
she told me that i should stop crying , that everything was in god 's hands and that this was my destiny . "
qahar is now 23 and wears prosthetics .
he has found new hope with the aabrar , an afghan non-governmental organization that gets financial support from the ded .
the organization offers war invalids something that would normally be impossible in afghanistan - the chance to work and be independent . employment for amputees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated half million people have been injured by land mines in afghanistan the organization opened afghanistan 's first bicycle messenger service in kabul in november of 2002 , which exclusively employs people with physical disabilities the ded and aabrar came up with the idea while trying to think about what kind of employment opportunities could be given to amputees , said andreas schneider , the ded 's regional director for afghanistan and central asia .
the program employs 15 bicycle couriers .
formerly , these amputees would have spent years sitting at home without jobs .
now , in a normal day they deliver letters , packages and merchandise around the clock through the streets of kabul .
they wear protective masks because of pollution problems in the city , which has a million inhabitants .
they also wear helmets and have specially-designed bicycles .
" these are essentially specially-developed bicycles , " schneider said .
" you could say they 're a type of mountain bike that are designed so that they can be ridden with a prosthesis . " afghan businesses skeptical of service bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biking through kabul qahar has worked as a bicycle messenger for five years .
he brings home approximately 70 euros -lrb- $ 95 -rrb- a month .
qahar has also participated in international competitions for bicycle messengers , competing against those without disabilities .
he said he 's thankful he found this work , but he knows that other afghans are less fortunate .
" in afghanistan there are more than 300,000 disabled people and none of them have jobs , " qahar said .
" our neighbor boy who 's 12 or 13 years old has just lost his legs .
he ca n't work and also does n't have money to go to school and get an education . "
international organizations in kabul use the bicycle messenger service .
local businesses have been more reluctant , although the service is relatively cheap .
delivering a pizza , package or letter costs 25 afghani , approximately 50 euro cents .

it 's just that i had not realized that the country can be so interesting and in many areas very beautiful .
i reckon that many germans are pleased if a visitor can speak any german at all and they do not hold out for perfection .
this is because germany , while visited , is not a country that gets any kind of positive objective appreciation from people in english speaking countries .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i definitely think that germany is under-rated as a travel destination .
germany has so much to offer yet people seem to be unaware of it .
many people that i have talked to have only seen frankfurt and think that all of germany looks like frankfurt .
people do n't seem to know that germany has romantic cities , palaces , castles , and river valleys and that it is a very diverse country .
i was talking to someone who was surprised that germany is one of the countries that the alps run through !
what i find frustrating is that german tourism information seems to focus more on frankfurt 's skyscrapers than on cities like heidelberg , rothenburg , or the rhine and moselle valleys .
people from places like vancouver , new york , and hong kong go to europe to see old romantic cities , medieval festivals , and experience the culture .
we do not travel to see skyscrapers in frankfurt .
after all , we get enough of them at home . - yasser al-saadi , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ben donald wrote a book called " springtime for germany - or how i learned to love lederhosen " i agree with ben donald that germany is an overlooked destination .
for clear historical reasons , people in my part of europe -lrb- britain and europe -rrb- have blocked out germany as a place to go to for anything other than business .
germany is simply " hidden " by its past .
what a shame that is !
i have visited four times in the past two years and was very taken with the country .
i was n't surprised or changed in my opinions as i did not have any strong preconceptions .
it 's just that i had not realized that the country can be so interesting and in many areas very beautiful .
i reckon that many germans are pleased if a visitor can speak any german at all and they do not hold out for perfection .
this is because germany , while visited , is not a country that gets any kind of positive objective appreciation from people in english speaking countries .
there is not the same reaction to visiting germany as you would get if you visit france , italy or spain .
ben donald is right : it is a new frontier . - patrick hurley , ireland i plan to return to germany for the third time for vacation .
germany is one of the most beautiful countries i have ever visited , from the alps to the baltic .
the german people are some of the most friendly , funny and intelligent people i have ever met and are eager to continue a conversation , especially since i am from texas .
i am looking forward to my vacation in october to the rhine and the black forest . - mark burrows , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a reader from australia particularly like sababurg castle near kassel on our first trip to europe in 1984 , we fell in love with germany .
the scenery is spectacular , the people helpful and everything " works . "
and , the autobahns are fantastic .
our early trips were spent visiting the traditional tourist destinations but in 1997 and 2000 we found the hidden gems of germany such as sababurg castle .
our children are now totally fluent in german and we will be returning to the fabulous country in 2008 for more exploring . - greg wulff , australia i 've traveled to germany on holiday twice now and think it 's a great travel destination .
germany needs to market itself much more than it does .
from the wine festivals in the rhine river valley to a hike in the black forest near the small town of staufen , the scenery is awesome .
baden-baden has quaint shops where you can stroll along the streets and munich is one of my new favorite cities in the world .
adding the medieval charm of rothenburg , you have so many opportunities to attract tourists to your country .
and i have n't even been to berlin yet ! - kris , us compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lost your wanderlust ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 29.07.2007 switzerland considers gun control großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : every swiss man serves in the army switzerland 's the only country that requires its soldiers to keep guns at home .
but concerns over high suicide rates and killings within families have caused some to ask whether having them there is simply too dangerous . all swiss men must do military service - they all learn to shoot - and when they go home , they take their assault rifles and 50 rounds of ammunition with them .
" for me it 's just routine , " said philippe schaub , heading home after his latest stint in the army .
" we all do military service , we 're all given a gun to take home .
i keep it in my cupboard just like the coats and the snowboard and the vacuum cleaner . "
the idea is to have an army ready for call up anytime .
although neutral switzerland has n't fought a war for centuries , christoph keckeis , chief of the armed forces , said he sees no reason for change .
" the policy is that every single soldier has his weapon at home , a pistol or a gun , " keckeis said .
trust in the citizenry " this is a very robust tradition , " he added .
" we do have enormous confidence in our men , we know they are well-educated , and we are 100 percent sure that they know how to deal with this weapon and the ammunition . "
but not everyone shares that confidence .
tanja vollenweider had a happy family life until four years ago .
she and her husband had just bought a new house .
he was between jobs , so they had a few money worries , but not , she thought , big ones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland has high rates of suicide " it was a normal , happy day , we had taken the kids to the zoo , we had people to dinner in the evening ; " vollenweider said .
" in the middle of the night my daughter woke me - she said my husband had run out of the house with his army gun .
i tried to run after him , but i was too late . "
vollenweider 's husband killed himself .
high rates of suicide , domestic violence the only country with a higher rate of suicide with guns than switzerland is the united states .
and it 's not just suicide : every month or so , a swiss man turns his gun on his family .
the country has the highest rate of domestic violence using guns in europe .
" these deaths that are happening , these slaughters , these murders , are terrible , but there 's much more to the problem than that , " said sabin bieri , a professor of gender politics at the university of berne who is part of a growing campaign to get the guns out of swiss homes .
" the weapon is a constant threat in family life in switzerland , which i think is such a terrible thing for many women and many children . "
a threat to swiss masculinity ?
but it 's hard to challenge tradition .
learning to use a gun has been a rite of passage for young swiss men for centuries .
keckeis sees proposals to take the guns away as a threat to the masculinity of his troops .
" they will really be taken as unserious men , " he said .
" it would be a sign that we do n't have confidence in them any more , after being so confident for many years , and they would be really lost .
it would be a signal that the political power in switzerland is no longer confident in its armed forces and in its population . "
subject to referendum those political considerations are n't much comfort to tanja vollenweider .
she 's convinced she would still have her husband if the gun had n't been so readily available . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : introducing gun control would have to be decided by referendum " this only happened because the gun was right here at home , " she said .
" my husband would n't have gone out looking for one .
if the gun had n't been here i think he 'd still be alive . "
little by little , there are signs that the swiss may be ready for change : this summer , left-wing parties will launch plans for a nationwide referendum to force the army to take the weapons away .
the process will take a while but the current generation of new conscripts may be among the last to take their guns home with them . imogen foulkes -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" germany is not an oasis , we are also threatened by terrorism , " he said in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" that has to be responsibly explained to the public .
the tone of the debate is very important . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble , left , and zypries have gone eye-to-eye on several issues but statements from maiziere , who also said that the country should not abandon its democratic principles out of fear , may be coming too late to have much of an effect . german justice minister brigitte zypries was called a " national security risk " by a state interior minister and numerous attacks were mounted against an initiative to allow online computer searches presented by interior minister wolfgang schäuble . zypries , as well as other members of the social democratic party , part of the chancellor 's ruling grand coalition , have come out against the computer search proposal .
in an op-ed published friday in the frankfurter rundschau she said clear limits needed to be placed on security measures in order to protect civil rights . some restrictions apply spd party head kurt beck agreed and added that his party was willing to consider permitting online searches of computer data if certain conditions were met . " we have to carefully weigh whether it is necessary and if it is even legally possible , " beck told the mass-market bild am sonntag newspaper .
" we are dealing with a sensitive area of privacy .
the people affected have to have a legal means to defend themselves from searches of their private information . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a verdict from the constitutional court is expected in early 2008 sebastian edathy an spd parliamentarian said the bundestag should wait until the country 's highest court rules on the constitutionality of a similar law enacted in one germany 's 16 states . germany 's federal constitutional court is scheduled to hear a case dealing with north rhine-westphalia 's online search law in october . " it would be foolish for us to make a decision that , in light of the judges ' verdict , would have to be corrected or revised , " he told the taz newspaper .
" the subject can be discussed , but it 's not ready for a decision . " bavarian interior minister günther beckstein , however , said such online searches should be implemented as soon as possible , calling them an important tool for authorities in fighting terrorism .
he also accused zypries of keeping police from using all the means at their disposal to prevent terror attacks . " i think mrs. zypries ' behavior is indefensible because it creates a hole in the security net and that can be very dangerous for germany , " he told the passauer neuen presse . as opinions on the issue continue to heat up , maiziere said he would do everything in his power to bring the political parties to a compromise by the end of august . article based on news reports -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" germany is not an oasis , we are also threatened by terrorism , " he said in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" that has to be responsibly explained to the public .
the tone of the debate is very important . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble , left , and zypries have gone eye-to-eye on several issues but statements from maiziere , who also said that the country should not abandon its democratic principles out of fear , may be coming too late to have much of an effect . german justice minister brigitte zypries was called a " national security risk " by a state interior minister and numerous attacks were mounted against an initiative to allow online computer searches presented by interior minister wolfgang schäuble . zypries , as well as other members of the social democratic party , part of the chancellor 's ruling grand coalition , have come out against the computer search proposal .
in an op-ed published friday in the frankfurter rundschau she said clear limits needed to be placed on security measures in order to protect civil rights . some restrictions apply spd party head kurt beck agreed and added that his party was willing to consider permitting online searches of computer data if certain conditions were met . " we have to carefully weigh whether it is necessary and if it is even legally possible , " beck told the mass-market bild am sonntag newspaper .
" we are dealing with a sensitive area of privacy .
the people affected have to have a legal means to defend themselves from searches of their private information . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a verdict from the constitutional court is expected in early 2008 sebastian edathy an spd parliamentarian said the bundestag should wait until the country 's highest court rules on the constitutionality of a similar law enacted in one germany 's 16 states . germany 's federal constitutional court is scheduled to hear a case dealing with north rhine-westphalia 's online search law in october . " it would be foolish for us to make a decision that , in light of the judges ' verdict , would have to be corrected or revised , " he told the taz newspaper .
" the subject can be discussed , but it 's not ready for a decision . " bavarian interior minister günther beckstein , however , said such online searches should be implemented as soon as possible , calling them an important tool for authorities in fighting terrorism .
he also accused zypries of keeping police from using all the means at their disposal to prevent terror attacks . " i think mrs. zypries ' behavior is indefensible because it creates a hole in the security net and that can be very dangerous for germany , " he told the passauer neuen presse . as opinions on the issue continue to heat up , maiziere said he would do everything in his power to bring the political parties to a compromise by the end of august . article based on news reports -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 29.07.2007 switzerland considers gun control großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : every swiss man serves in the army switzerland 's the only country that requires its soldiers to keep guns at home .
but concerns over high suicide rates and killings within families have caused some to ask whether having them there is simply too dangerous . all swiss men must do military service - they all learn to shoot - and when they go home , they take their assault rifles and 50 rounds of ammunition with them .
" for me it 's just routine , " said philippe schaub , heading home after his latest stint in the army .
" we all do military service , we 're all given a gun to take home .
i keep it in my cupboard just like the coats and the snowboard and the vacuum cleaner . "
the idea is to have an army ready for call up anytime .
although neutral switzerland has n't fought a war for centuries , christoph keckeis , chief of the armed forces , said he sees no reason for change .
" the policy is that every single soldier has his weapon at home , a pistol or a gun , " keckeis said .
trust in the citizenry " this is a very robust tradition , " he added .
" we do have enormous confidence in our men , we know they are well-educated , and we are 100 percent sure that they know how to deal with this weapon and the ammunition . "
but not everyone shares that confidence .
tanja vollenweider had a happy family life until four years ago .
she and her husband had just bought a new house .
he was between jobs , so they had a few money worries , but not , she thought , big ones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland has high rates of suicide " it was a normal , happy day , we had taken the kids to the zoo , we had people to dinner in the evening ; " vollenweider said .
" in the middle of the night my daughter woke me - she said my husband had run out of the house with his army gun .
i tried to run after him , but i was too late . "
vollenweider 's husband killed himself .
high rates of suicide , domestic violence the only country with a higher rate of suicide with guns than switzerland is the united states .
and it 's not just suicide : every month or so , a swiss man turns his gun on his family .
the country has the highest rate of domestic violence using guns in europe .
" these deaths that are happening , these slaughters , these murders , are terrible , but there 's much more to the problem than that , " said sabin bieri , a professor of gender politics at the university of berne who is part of a growing campaign to get the guns out of swiss homes .
" the weapon is a constant threat in family life in switzerland , which i think is such a terrible thing for many women and many children . "
a threat to swiss masculinity ?
but it 's hard to challenge tradition .
learning to use a gun has been a rite of passage for young swiss men for centuries .
keckeis sees proposals to take the guns away as a threat to the masculinity of his troops .
" they will really be taken as unserious men , " he said .
" it would be a sign that we do n't have confidence in them any more , after being so confident for many years , and they would be really lost .
it would be a signal that the political power in switzerland is no longer confident in its armed forces and in its population . "
subject to referendum those political considerations are n't much comfort to tanja vollenweider .
she 's convinced she would still have her husband if the gun had n't been so readily available . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : introducing gun control would have to be decided by referendum " this only happened because the gun was right here at home , " she said .
" my husband would n't have gone out looking for one .
if the gun had n't been here i think he 'd still be alive . "
little by little , there are signs that the swiss may be ready for change : this summer , left-wing parties will launch plans for a nationwide referendum to force the army to take the weapons away .
the process will take a while but the current generation of new conscripts may be among the last to take their guns home with them . imogen foulkes -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the meagre 1-0 win left opinions split over the victory 's potential impact on the bundesliga season . after a disappointing fourth-place league finish last season , germany striker miroslav klose netted the winner on saturday as bayern munich defeated schalke and claimed the german preseason title .
klose , one of munich 's major summer newcomers , was on target just before the half-hour mark , tapping into the empty net after confusion in the schalke defense .
munich dominated the match in leipzig and even without their other big-name newcomers , including injured france winger franck ribery and italy forward luca toni , the bavarians showed the creativity and style many observers said the side lacked last season .
" we laid down our marker that we 're back , " said bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld .
spending spree bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn said the victory would be good for the team 's self-confidence bayern laid down much more than a marker over the bundesliga 's summer break .
munich went on an unprecedented spending spree after coming only fourth last season , dishing out 70 million euros -lrb- $ 95 million -rrb- for new players .
" we 've now got a team that we hoped to have , " munich goalkeeper oliver kahn said .
" it 'll take a while until we find the best lineup . "
bayern won the six-team league cup , an unofficial pre-season event , by beating all three teams ranked ahead of them in the last bundesliga season : league champions vfb stuttgart , schalke and werder bremen .
" favorites for all the titles " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern fans want their team to start filling the trophy case " if you have the chance to get a title you should win it , " said coach ottmar hitzfeld . "
it 's good to beat all three teams that were ahead of us , one after another . "
bayern also claimed the bundesliga title the last four times they won the league cup , which has been fought over for 11 years .
" this team is an attraction for the bundesliga , " said matthias sammer , the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- sport director said of bayern .
" they 're the favorites for all the titles . "
the german season kicks off next week with the first round of the german cup and the bundesliga start set for aug .

but concerns over high suicide rates and killings within families have caused some to ask whether having them there is simply too dangerous . all swiss men must do military service - they all learn to shoot - and when they go home , they take their assault rifles and 50 rounds of ammunition with them .
" for me it 's just routine , " said philippe schaub , heading home after his latest stint in the army .
" we all do military service , we 're all given a gun to take home .
i keep it in my cupboard just like the coats and the snowboard and the vacuum cleaner . "
the idea is to have an army ready for call up anytime .
although neutral switzerland has n't fought a war for centuries , christoph keckeis , chief of the armed forces , said he sees no reason for change .
" the policy is that every single soldier has his weapon at home , a pistol or a gun , " keckeis said .
trust in the citizenry " this is a very robust tradition , " he added .
" we do have enormous confidence in our men , we know they are well-educated , and we are 100 percent sure that they know how to deal with this weapon and the ammunition . "
but not everyone shares that confidence .
tanja vollenweider had a happy family life until four years ago .
she and her husband had just bought a new house .
he was between jobs , so they had a few money worries , but not , she thought , big ones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland has high rates of suicide " it was a normal , happy day , we had taken the kids to the zoo , we had people to dinner in the evening ; " vollenweider said .
" in the middle of the night my daughter woke me - she said my husband had run out of the house with his army gun .
i tried to run after him , but i was too late . "
vollenweider 's husband killed himself .
high rates of suicide , domestic violence the only country with a higher rate of suicide with guns than switzerland is the united states .
and it 's not just suicide : every month or so , a swiss man turns his gun on his family .
the country has the highest rate of domestic violence using guns in europe .
" these deaths that are happening , these slaughters , these murders , are terrible , but there 's much more to the problem than that , " said sabin bieri , a professor of gender politics at the university of berne who is part of a growing campaign to get the guns out of swiss homes .
" the weapon is a constant threat in family life in switzerland , which i think is such a terrible thing for many women and many children . "
a threat to swiss masculinity ?
but it 's hard to challenge tradition .
learning to use a gun has been a rite of passage for young swiss men for centuries .
keckeis sees proposals to take the guns away as a threat to the masculinity of his troops .
" they will really be taken as unserious men , " he said .
" it would be a sign that we do n't have confidence in them any more , after being so confident for many years , and they would be really lost .
it would be a signal that the political power in switzerland is no longer confident in its armed forces and in its population . "
subject to referendum those political considerations are n't much comfort to tanja vollenweider .
she 's convinced she would still have her husband if the gun had n't been so readily available . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : introducing gun control would have to be decided by referendum " this only happened because the gun was right here at home , " she said .
" my husband would n't have gone out looking for one .
if the gun had n't been here i think he 'd still be alive . "
little by little , there are signs that the swiss may be ready for change : this summer , left-wing parties will launch plans for a nationwide referendum to force the army to take the weapons away .
the process will take a while but the current generation of new conscripts may be among the last to take their guns home with them . imogen foulkes -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" germany is not an oasis , we are also threatened by terrorism , " he said in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" that has to be responsibly explained to the public .
the tone of the debate is very important . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble , left , and zypries have gone eye-to-eye on several issues but statements from maiziere , who also said that the country should not abandon its democratic principles out of fear , may be coming too late to have much of an effect . german justice minister brigitte zypries was called a " national security risk " by a state interior minister and numerous attacks were mounted against an initiative to allow online computer searches presented by interior minister wolfgang schäuble . zypries , as well as other members of the social democratic party , part of the chancellor 's ruling grand coalition , have come out against the computer search proposal .
in an op-ed published friday in the frankfurter rundschau she said clear limits needed to be placed on security measures in order to protect civil rights . some restrictions apply spd party head kurt beck agreed and added that his party was willing to consider permitting online searches of computer data if certain conditions were met . " we have to carefully weigh whether it is necessary and if it is even legally possible , " beck told the mass-market bild am sonntag newspaper .
" we are dealing with a sensitive area of privacy .
the people affected have to have a legal means to defend themselves from searches of their private information . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a verdict from the constitutional court is expected in early 2008 sebastian edathy an spd parliamentarian said the bundestag should wait until the country 's highest court rules on the constitutionality of a similar law enacted in one germany 's 16 states . germany 's federal constitutional court is scheduled to hear a case dealing with north rhine-westphalia 's online search law in october . " it would be foolish for us to make a decision that , in light of the judges ' verdict , would have to be corrected or revised , " he told the taz newspaper .
" the subject can be discussed , but it 's not ready for a decision . " bavarian interior minister günther beckstein , however , said such online searches should be implemented as soon as possible , calling them an important tool for authorities in fighting terrorism .
he also accused zypries of keeping police from using all the means at their disposal to prevent terror attacks . " i think mrs. zypries ' behavior is indefensible because it creates a hole in the security net and that can be very dangerous for germany , " he told the passauer neuen presse . as opinions on the issue continue to heat up , maiziere said he would do everything in his power to bring the political parties to a compromise by the end of august . article based on news reports -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i definitely think that germany is under-rated as a travel destination .
germany has so much to offer yet people seem to be unaware of it .
many people that i have talked to have only seen frankfurt and think that all of germany looks like frankfurt .
people do n't seem to know that germany has romantic cities , palaces , castles , and river valleys and that it is a very diverse country .
i was talking to someone who was surprised that germany is one of the countries that the alps run through !
what i find frustrating is that german tourism information seems to focus more on frankfurt 's skyscrapers than on cities like heidelberg , rothenburg , or the rhine and moselle valleys .
people from places like vancouver , new york , and hong kong go to europe to see old romantic cities , medieval festivals , and experience the culture .

for clear historical reasons , people in my part of europe -lrb- britain and europe -rrb- have blocked out germany as a place to go to for anything other than business .
germany is simply " hidden " by its past .
what a shame that is !
i have visited four times in the past two years and was very taken with the country .
i was n't surprised or changed in my opinions as i did not have any strong preconceptions .
it 's just that i had not realized that the country can be so interesting and in many areas very beautiful .
i reckon that many germans are pleased if a visitor can speak any german at all and they do not hold out for perfection .
this is because germany , while visited , is not a country that gets any kind of positive objective appreciation from people in english speaking countries .
there is not the same reaction to visiting germany as you would get if you visit france , italy or spain .
ben donald is right : it is a new frontier . - patrick hurley , ireland i plan to return to germany for the third time for vacation .
germany is one of the most beautiful countries i have ever visited , from the alps to the baltic .

" for me it 's just routine , " said philippe schaub , heading home after his latest stint in the army .
" we all do military service , we 're all given a gun to take home .
i keep it in my cupboard just like the coats and the snowboard and the vacuum cleaner . "
the idea is to have an army ready for call up anytime .
although neutral switzerland has n't fought a war for centuries , christoph keckeis , chief of the armed forces , said he sees no reason for change .
" the policy is that every single soldier has his weapon at home , a pistol or a gun , " keckeis said .
trust in the citizenry " this is a very robust tradition , " he added .
" we do have enormous confidence in our men , we know they are well-educated , and we are 100 percent sure that they know how to deal with this weapon and the ammunition . "
but not everyone shares that confidence .
tanja vollenweider had a happy family life until four years ago .
she and her husband had just bought a new house .
he was between jobs , so they had a few money worries , but not , she thought , big ones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland has high rates of suicide " it was a normal , happy day , we had taken the kids to the zoo , we had people to dinner in the evening ; " vollenweider said .
" in the middle of the night my daughter woke me - she said my husband had run out of the house with his army gun .
i tried to run after him , but i was too late . "
vollenweider 's husband killed himself .
high rates of suicide , domestic violence the only country with a higher rate of suicide with guns than switzerland is the united states .
and it 's not just suicide : every month or so , a swiss man turns his gun on his family .
the country has the highest rate of domestic violence using guns in europe .
" these deaths that are happening , these slaughters , these murders , are terrible , but there 's much more to the problem than that , " said sabin bieri , a professor of gender politics at the university of berne who is part of a growing campaign to get the guns out of swiss homes .
" the weapon is a constant threat in family life in switzerland , which i think is such a terrible thing for many women and many children . "
a threat to swiss masculinity ?
but it 's hard to challenge tradition .
learning to use a gun has been a rite of passage for young swiss men for centuries .
keckeis sees proposals to take the guns away as a threat to the masculinity of his troops .
" they will really be taken as unserious men , " he said .
" it would be a sign that we do n't have confidence in them any more , after being so confident for many years , and they would be really lost .
it would be a signal that the political power in switzerland is no longer confident in its armed forces and in its population . "
subject to referendum those political considerations are n't much comfort to tanja vollenweider .
she 's convinced she would still have her husband if the gun had n't been so readily available . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : introducing gun control would have to be decided by referendum " this only happened because the gun was right here at home , " she said .
" my husband would n't have gone out looking for one .
if the gun had n't been here i think he 'd still be alive . "
little by little , there are signs that the swiss may be ready for change : this summer , left-wing parties will launch plans for a nationwide referendum to force the army to take the weapons away .
the process will take a while but the current generation of new conscripts may be among the last to take their guns home with them . imogen foulkes -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

couriering packages around kabul gives them a rare chance to make a living . afghanistan is thought to have more land mines than any other country in the world .
the estimated 30 million mines are a dangerous legacy of decades of war that have maimed approximately half a million people .
those who have lost limbs because of the mines find it nearly impossible to earn a living .
the german development service -lrb- ded -rrb- , which is germany 's foreign development aid agency , has partnered with the afghan amputee bicyclist for rehabilitation and recreation -lrb- aabrar -rrb- organization to give amputees in kabul a chance to earn a living . going without bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life as an amputee is difficult in afghanistan gone to run errands for his mother in kabul , qahar was 11 years old when he stepped on a mine and lost both his legs .

" they went to school and to the university .
sometimes i cried and my mother comforted me .
she told me that i should stop crying , that everything was in god 's hands and that this was my destiny . "
qahar is now 23 and wears prosthetics .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i definitely think that germany is under-rated as a travel destination .
germany has so much to offer yet people seem to be unaware of it .
many people that i have talked to have only seen frankfurt and think that all of germany looks like frankfurt .
people do n't seem to know that germany has romantic cities , palaces , castles , and river valleys and that it is a very diverse country .
i was talking to someone who was surprised that germany is one of the countries that the alps run through !
what i find frustrating is that german tourism information seems to focus more on frankfurt 's skyscrapers than on cities like heidelberg , rothenburg , or the rhine and moselle valleys .
people from places like vancouver , new york , and hong kong go to europe to see old romantic cities , medieval festivals , and experience the culture .
we do not travel to see skyscrapers in frankfurt .
after all , we get enough of them at home . - yasser al-saadi , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ben donald wrote a book called " springtime for germany - or how i learned to love lederhosen " i agree with ben donald that germany is an overlooked destination .
for clear historical reasons , people in my part of europe -lrb- britain and europe -rrb- have blocked out germany as a place to go to for anything other than business .
germany is simply " hidden " by its past .
what a shame that is !
i have visited four times in the past two years and was very taken with the country .
i was n't surprised or changed in my opinions as i did not have any strong preconceptions .
it 's just that i had not realized that the country can be so interesting and in many areas very beautiful .
i reckon that many germans are pleased if a visitor can speak any german at all and they do not hold out for perfection .
this is because germany , while visited , is not a country that gets any kind of positive objective appreciation from people in english speaking countries .
there is not the same reaction to visiting germany as you would get if you visit france , italy or spain .
ben donald is right : it is a new frontier . - patrick hurley , ireland i plan to return to germany for the third time for vacation .
germany is one of the most beautiful countries i have ever visited , from the alps to the baltic .
the german people are some of the most friendly , funny and intelligent people i have ever met and are eager to continue a conversation , especially since i am from texas .
i am looking forward to my vacation in october to the rhine and the black forest . - mark burrows , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a reader from australia particularly like sababurg castle near kassel on our first trip to europe in 1984 , we fell in love with germany .

and , the autobahns are fantastic .
our early trips were spent visiting the traditional tourist destinations but in 1997 and 2000 we found the hidden gems of germany such as sababurg castle .
our children are now totally fluent in german and we will be returning to the fabulous country in 2008 for more exploring . - greg wulff , australia i 've traveled to germany on holiday twice now and think it 's a great travel destination .
germany needs to market itself much more than it does .
from the wine festivals in the rhine river valley to a hike in the black forest near the small town of staufen , the scenery is awesome .
baden-baden has quaint shops where you can stroll along the streets and munich is one of my new favorite cities in the world .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i definitely think that germany is under-rated as a travel destination .
germany has so much to offer yet people seem to be unaware of it .
many people that i have talked to have only seen frankfurt and think that all of germany looks like frankfurt .
people do n't seem to know that germany has romantic cities , palaces , castles , and river valleys and that it is a very diverse country .
i was talking to someone who was surprised that germany is one of the countries that the alps run through !
what i find frustrating is that german tourism information seems to focus more on frankfurt 's skyscrapers than on cities like heidelberg , rothenburg , or the rhine and moselle valleys .
people from places like vancouver , new york , and hong kong go to europe to see old romantic cities , medieval festivals , and experience the culture .
we do not travel to see skyscrapers in frankfurt .
after all , we get enough of them at home . - yasser al-saadi , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ben donald wrote a book called " springtime for germany - or how i learned to love lederhosen " i agree with ben donald that germany is an overlooked destination .
for clear historical reasons , people in my part of europe -lrb- britain and europe -rrb- have blocked out germany as a place to go to for anything other than business .
germany is simply " hidden " by its past .
what a shame that is !
i have visited four times in the past two years and was very taken with the country .
i was n't surprised or changed in my opinions as i did not have any strong preconceptions .
it 's just that i had not realized that the country can be so interesting and in many areas very beautiful .
i reckon that many germans are pleased if a visitor can speak any german at all and they do not hold out for perfection .
this is because germany , while visited , is not a country that gets any kind of positive objective appreciation from people in english speaking countries .
there is not the same reaction to visiting germany as you would get if you visit france , italy or spain .
ben donald is right : it is a new frontier . - patrick hurley , ireland i plan to return to germany for the third time for vacation .
germany is one of the most beautiful countries i have ever visited , from the alps to the baltic .
the german people are some of the most friendly , funny and intelligent people i have ever met and are eager to continue a conversation , especially since i am from texas .
i am looking forward to my vacation in october to the rhine and the black forest . - mark burrows , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a reader from australia particularly like sababurg castle near kassel on our first trip to europe in 1984 , we fell in love with germany .
the scenery is spectacular , the people helpful and everything " works . "
and , the autobahns are fantastic .
our early trips were spent visiting the traditional tourist destinations but in 1997 and 2000 we found the hidden gems of germany such as sababurg castle .
our children are now totally fluent in german and we will be returning to the fabulous country in 2008 for more exploring . - greg wulff , australia i 've traveled to germany on holiday twice now and think it 's a great travel destination .

couriering packages around kabul gives them a rare chance to make a living . afghanistan is thought to have more land mines than any other country in the world .
the estimated 30 million mines are a dangerous legacy of decades of war that have maimed approximately half a million people .
those who have lost limbs because of the mines find it nearly impossible to earn a living .
the german development service -lrb- ded -rrb- , which is germany 's foreign development aid agency , has partnered with the afghan amputee bicyclist for rehabilitation and recreation -lrb- aabrar -rrb- organization to give amputees in kabul a chance to earn a living . going without bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life as an amputee is difficult in afghanistan gone to run errands for his mother in kabul , qahar was 11 years old when he stepped on a mine and lost both his legs .
from then on , he was considered a burden on his large family , since he could n't earn money to help his siblings .
he sunk into a deep depression .
" i was mostly unhappy because i saw many people my age who could play volleyball and soccer , " qahar said .
" they went to school and to the university .
sometimes i cried and my mother comforted me .
she told me that i should stop crying , that everything was in god 's hands and that this was my destiny . "
qahar is now 23 and wears prosthetics .
he has found new hope with the aabrar , an afghan non-governmental organization that gets financial support from the ded .
the organization offers war invalids something that would normally be impossible in afghanistan - the chance to work and be independent . employment for amputees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated half million people have been injured by land mines in afghanistan the organization opened afghanistan 's first bicycle messenger service in kabul in november of 2002 , which exclusively employs people with physical disabilities the ded and aabrar came up with the idea while trying to think about what kind of employment opportunities could be given to amputees , said andreas schneider , the ded 's regional director for afghanistan and central asia .
the program employs 15 bicycle couriers .
formerly , these amputees would have spent years sitting at home without jobs .
now , in a normal day they deliver letters , packages and merchandise around the clock through the streets of kabul .
they wear protective masks because of pollution problems in the city , which has a million inhabitants .
they also wear helmets and have specially-designed bicycles .
" these are essentially specially-developed bicycles , " schneider said .
" you could say they 're a type of mountain bike that are designed so that they can be ridden with a prosthesis . " afghan businesses skeptical of service bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biking through kabul qahar has worked as a bicycle messenger for five years .
he brings home approximately 70 euros -lrb- $ 95 -rrb- a month .
qahar has also participated in international competitions for bicycle messengers , competing against those without disabilities .
he said he 's thankful he found this work , but he knows that other afghans are less fortunate .
" in afghanistan there are more than 300,000 disabled people and none of them have jobs , " qahar said .
" our neighbor boy who 's 12 or 13 years old has just lost his legs .
he ca n't work and also does n't have money to go to school and get an education . "
international organizations in kabul use the bicycle messenger service .
local businesses have been more reluctant , although the service is relatively cheap .
delivering a pizza , package or letter costs 25 afghani , approximately 50 euro cents .

couriering packages around kabul gives them a rare chance to make a living . afghanistan is thought to have more land mines than any other country in the world .
the estimated 30 million mines are a dangerous legacy of decades of war that have maimed approximately half a million people .
those who have lost limbs because of the mines find it nearly impossible to earn a living .
the german development service -lrb- ded -rrb- , which is germany 's foreign development aid agency , has partnered with the afghan amputee bicyclist for rehabilitation and recreation -lrb- aabrar -rrb- organization to give amputees in kabul a chance to earn a living . going without bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life as an amputee is difficult in afghanistan gone to run errands for his mother in kabul , qahar was 11 years old when he stepped on a mine and lost both his legs .
from then on , he was considered a burden on his large family , since he could n't earn money to help his siblings .
he sunk into a deep depression .
" i was mostly unhappy because i saw many people my age who could play volleyball and soccer , " qahar said .
" they went to school and to the university .
sometimes i cried and my mother comforted me .
she told me that i should stop crying , that everything was in god 's hands and that this was my destiny . "
qahar is now 23 and wears prosthetics .
he has found new hope with the aabrar , an afghan non-governmental organization that gets financial support from the ded .
the organization offers war invalids something that would normally be impossible in afghanistan - the chance to work and be independent . employment for amputees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated half million people have been injured by land mines in afghanistan the organization opened afghanistan 's first bicycle messenger service in kabul in november of 2002 , which exclusively employs people with physical disabilities the ded and aabrar came up with the idea while trying to think about what kind of employment opportunities could be given to amputees , said andreas schneider , the ded 's regional director for afghanistan and central asia .
the program employs 15 bicycle couriers .
formerly , these amputees would have spent years sitting at home without jobs .
now , in a normal day they deliver letters , packages and merchandise around the clock through the streets of kabul .
they wear protective masks because of pollution problems in the city , which has a million inhabitants .
they also wear helmets and have specially-designed bicycles .
" these are essentially specially-developed bicycles , " schneider said .
" you could say they 're a type of mountain bike that are designed so that they can be ridden with a prosthesis . " afghan businesses skeptical of service bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biking through kabul qahar has worked as a bicycle messenger for five years .
he brings home approximately 70 euros -lrb- $ 95 -rrb- a month .
qahar has also participated in international competitions for bicycle messengers , competing against those without disabilities .
he said he 's thankful he found this work , but he knows that other afghans are less fortunate .
" in afghanistan there are more than 300,000 disabled people and none of them have jobs , " qahar said .
" our neighbor boy who 's 12 or 13 years old has just lost his legs .
he ca n't work and also does n't have money to go to school and get an education . "
international organizations in kabul use the bicycle messenger service .
local businesses have been more reluctant , although the service is relatively cheap .
delivering a pizza , package or letter costs 25 afghani , approximately 50 euro cents .
until the project can become self-sufficient , the ded will continue to help out financially .
the program hopes to help more people like qahar get a chance at a new start on life . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" germany is not an oasis , we are also threatened by terrorism , " he said in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" that has to be responsibly explained to the public .
the tone of the debate is very important . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble , left , and zypries have gone eye-to-eye on several issues but statements from maiziere , who also said that the country should not abandon its democratic principles out of fear , may be coming too late to have much of an effect . german justice minister brigitte zypries was called a " national security risk " by a state interior minister and numerous attacks were mounted against an initiative to allow online computer searches presented by interior minister wolfgang schäuble . zypries , as well as other members of the social democratic party , part of the chancellor 's ruling grand coalition , have come out against the computer search proposal .
in an op-ed published friday in the frankfurter rundschau she said clear limits needed to be placed on security measures in order to protect civil rights . some restrictions apply spd party head kurt beck agreed and added that his party was willing to consider permitting online searches of computer data if certain conditions were met . " we have to carefully weigh whether it is necessary and if it is even legally possible , " beck told the mass-market bild am sonntag newspaper .
" we are dealing with a sensitive area of privacy .
the people affected have to have a legal means to defend themselves from searches of their private information . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a verdict from the constitutional court is expected in early 2008 sebastian edathy an spd parliamentarian said the bundestag should wait until the country 's highest court rules on the constitutionality of a similar law enacted in one germany 's 16 states . germany 's federal constitutional court is scheduled to hear a case dealing with north rhine-westphalia 's online search law in october . " it would be foolish for us to make a decision that , in light of the judges ' verdict , would have to be corrected or revised , " he told the taz newspaper .
" the subject can be discussed , but it 's not ready for a decision . " bavarian interior minister günther beckstein , however , said such online searches should be implemented as soon as possible , calling them an important tool for authorities in fighting terrorism .
he also accused zypries of keeping police from using all the means at their disposal to prevent terror attacks . " i think mrs. zypries ' behavior is indefensible because it creates a hole in the security net and that can be very dangerous for germany , " he told the passauer neuen presse . as opinions on the issue continue to heat up , maiziere said he would do everything in his power to bring the political parties to a compromise by the end of august . article based on news reports -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the meagre 1-0 win left opinions split over the victory 's potential impact on the bundesliga season . after a disappointing fourth-place league finish last season , germany striker miroslav klose netted the winner on saturday as bayern munich defeated schalke and claimed the german preseason title .
klose , one of munich 's major summer newcomers , was on target just before the half-hour mark , tapping into the empty net after confusion in the schalke defense .
munich dominated the match in leipzig and even without their other big-name newcomers , including injured france winger franck ribery and italy forward luca toni , the bavarians showed the creativity and style many observers said the side lacked last season .
" we laid down our marker that we 're back , " said bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld .
spending spree bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn said the victory would be good for the team 's self-confidence bayern laid down much more than a marker over the bundesliga 's summer break .
munich went on an unprecedented spending spree after coming only fourth last season , dishing out 70 million euros -lrb- $ 95 million -rrb- for new players .
" we 've now got a team that we hoped to have , " munich goalkeeper oliver kahn said .
" it 'll take a while until we find the best lineup . "
bayern won the six-team league cup , an unofficial pre-season event , by beating all three teams ranked ahead of them in the last bundesliga season : league champions vfb stuttgart , schalke and werder bremen .
" favorites for all the titles " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern fans want their team to start filling the trophy case " if you have the chance to get a title you should win it , " said coach ottmar hitzfeld . "
it 's good to beat all three teams that were ahead of us , one after another . "
bayern also claimed the bundesliga title the last four times they won the league cup , which has been fought over for 11 years .
" this team is an attraction for the bundesliga , " said matthias sammer , the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- sport director said of bayern .
" they 're the favorites for all the titles . "
the german season kicks off next week with the first round of the german cup and the bundesliga start set for aug .

a second hostage 's autopsy showed he died of gunshot wounds . negotiations for the german engineer 's release were making some progress , an anonymous source told the german dpa news agency . it remained unclear if the 62-year-old was being held by members of the taliban or a criminal group . a spokesman for the german foreign ministry said a berlin crisis team remained in close contact with the afghan government and is doing everything possible to secure the man 's safe release . the kidnappers have allegedly demanded the release of 10 prisoners being held in afghan jails in return for the german 's release . complete autopsy results in august bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government said it is doing everything possible for the german 's safe release an autopsy performed on the body of the hostage 's colleague , which was found last week and returned to germany , showed the man had died of gunshot wounds .
german officials were previously uncertain whether the 44-year old was executed or if his captors shot his body after his death . the mass-circulation bild am sonntag said the man had been shot in the knees and back .
it quoted german security sources after an autopsy carried out in cologne on thursday . the german foreign ministry declined to comment on the report and staff at the forensic institution where the autopsy was carried out said further tests were being made before a final report was released , probably in the first week in august .

" this will have a shameful effect on the dignity of the afghan people , " the president said . pope benedict xvi also called for the hostages , who were kidnapped july 19 , to be released .

couriering packages around kabul gives them a rare chance to make a living . afghanistan is thought to have more land mines than any other country in the world .
the estimated 30 million mines are a dangerous legacy of decades of war that have maimed approximately half a million people .
those who have lost limbs because of the mines find it nearly impossible to earn a living .
the german development service -lrb- ded -rrb- , which is germany 's foreign development aid agency , has partnered with the afghan amputee bicyclist for rehabilitation and recreation -lrb- aabrar -rrb- organization to give amputees in kabul a chance to earn a living . going without bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life as an amputee is difficult in afghanistan gone to run errands for his mother in kabul , qahar was 11 years old when he stepped on a mine and lost both his legs .
from then on , he was considered a burden on his large family , since he could n't earn money to help his siblings .
he sunk into a deep depression .
" i was mostly unhappy because i saw many people my age who could play volleyball and soccer , " qahar said .
" they went to school and to the university .
sometimes i cried and my mother comforted me .
she told me that i should stop crying , that everything was in god 's hands and that this was my destiny . "
qahar is now 23 and wears prosthetics .
he has found new hope with the aabrar , an afghan non-governmental organization that gets financial support from the ded .
the organization offers war invalids something that would normally be impossible in afghanistan - the chance to work and be independent . employment for amputees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated half million people have been injured by land mines in afghanistan the organization opened afghanistan 's first bicycle messenger service in kabul in november of 2002 , which exclusively employs people with physical disabilities the ded and aabrar came up with the idea while trying to think about what kind of employment opportunities could be given to amputees , said andreas schneider , the ded 's regional director for afghanistan and central asia .
the program employs 15 bicycle couriers .
formerly , these amputees would have spent years sitting at home without jobs .
now , in a normal day they deliver letters , packages and merchandise around the clock through the streets of kabul .
they wear protective masks because of pollution problems in the city , which has a million inhabitants .
they also wear helmets and have specially-designed bicycles .
" these are essentially specially-developed bicycles , " schneider said .
" you could say they 're a type of mountain bike that are designed so that they can be ridden with a prosthesis . " afghan businesses skeptical of service bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biking through kabul qahar has worked as a bicycle messenger for five years .
he brings home approximately 70 euros -lrb- $ 95 -rrb- a month .
qahar has also participated in international competitions for bicycle messengers , competing against those without disabilities .
he said he 's thankful he found this work , but he knows that other afghans are less fortunate .
" in afghanistan there are more than 300,000 disabled people and none of them have jobs , " qahar said .
" our neighbor boy who 's 12 or 13 years old has just lost his legs .
he ca n't work and also does n't have money to go to school and get an education . "
international organizations in kabul use the bicycle messenger service .
local businesses have been more reluctant , although the service is relatively cheap .
delivering a pizza , package or letter costs 25 afghani , approximately 50 euro cents .
until the project can become self-sufficient , the ded will continue to help out financially .

but concerns over high suicide rates and killings within families have caused some to ask whether having them there is simply too dangerous . all swiss men must do military service - they all learn to shoot - and when they go home , they take their assault rifles and 50 rounds of ammunition with them .
" for me it 's just routine , " said philippe schaub , heading home after his latest stint in the army .
" we all do military service , we 're all given a gun to take home .
i keep it in my cupboard just like the coats and the snowboard and the vacuum cleaner . "
the idea is to have an army ready for call up anytime .
although neutral switzerland has n't fought a war for centuries , christoph keckeis , chief of the armed forces , said he sees no reason for change .
" the policy is that every single soldier has his weapon at home , a pistol or a gun , " keckeis said .
trust in the citizenry " this is a very robust tradition , " he added .
" we do have enormous confidence in our men , we know they are well-educated , and we are 100 percent sure that they know how to deal with this weapon and the ammunition . "
but not everyone shares that confidence .
tanja vollenweider had a happy family life until four years ago .
she and her husband had just bought a new house .
he was between jobs , so they had a few money worries , but not , she thought , big ones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland has high rates of suicide " it was a normal , happy day , we had taken the kids to the zoo , we had people to dinner in the evening ; " vollenweider said .
" in the middle of the night my daughter woke me - she said my husband had run out of the house with his army gun .
i tried to run after him , but i was too late . "
vollenweider 's husband killed himself .
high rates of suicide , domestic violence the only country with a higher rate of suicide with guns than switzerland is the united states .
and it 's not just suicide : every month or so , a swiss man turns his gun on his family .
the country has the highest rate of domestic violence using guns in europe .
" these deaths that are happening , these slaughters , these murders , are terrible , but there 's much more to the problem than that , " said sabin bieri , a professor of gender politics at the university of berne who is part of a growing campaign to get the guns out of swiss homes .
" the weapon is a constant threat in family life in switzerland , which i think is such a terrible thing for many women and many children . "
a threat to swiss masculinity ?
but it 's hard to challenge tradition .
learning to use a gun has been a rite of passage for young swiss men for centuries .
keckeis sees proposals to take the guns away as a threat to the masculinity of his troops .
" they will really be taken as unserious men , " he said .
" it would be a sign that we do n't have confidence in them any more , after being so confident for many years , and they would be really lost .
it would be a signal that the political power in switzerland is no longer confident in its armed forces and in its population . "
subject to referendum those political considerations are n't much comfort to tanja vollenweider .
she 's convinced she would still have her husband if the gun had n't been so readily available . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : introducing gun control would have to be decided by referendum " this only happened because the gun was right here at home , " she said .
" my husband would n't have gone out looking for one .
if the gun had n't been here i think he 'd still be alive . "
little by little , there are signs that the swiss may be ready for change : this summer , left-wing parties will launch plans for a nationwide referendum to force the army to take the weapons away .
the process will take a while but the current generation of new conscripts may be among the last to take their guns home with them . imogen foulkes -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but concerns over high suicide rates and killings within families have caused some to ask whether having them there is simply too dangerous . all swiss men must do military service - they all learn to shoot - and when they go home , they take their assault rifles and 50 rounds of ammunition with them .
" for me it 's just routine , " said philippe schaub , heading home after his latest stint in the army .
" we all do military service , we 're all given a gun to take home .
i keep it in my cupboard just like the coats and the snowboard and the vacuum cleaner . "
the idea is to have an army ready for call up anytime .
although neutral switzerland has n't fought a war for centuries , christoph keckeis , chief of the armed forces , said he sees no reason for change .
" the policy is that every single soldier has his weapon at home , a pistol or a gun , " keckeis said .
trust in the citizenry " this is a very robust tradition , " he added .
" we do have enormous confidence in our men , we know they are well-educated , and we are 100 percent sure that they know how to deal with this weapon and the ammunition . "
but not everyone shares that confidence .
tanja vollenweider had a happy family life until four years ago .
she and her husband had just bought a new house .
he was between jobs , so they had a few money worries , but not , she thought , big ones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland has high rates of suicide " it was a normal , happy day , we had taken the kids to the zoo , we had people to dinner in the evening ; " vollenweider said .

i tried to run after him , but i was too late . "
vollenweider 's husband killed himself .
high rates of suicide , domestic violence the only country with a higher rate of suicide with guns than switzerland is the united states .
and it 's not just suicide : every month or so , a swiss man turns his gun on his family .
the country has the highest rate of domestic violence using guns in europe .
" these deaths that are happening , these slaughters , these murders , are terrible , but there 's much more to the problem than that , " said sabin bieri , a professor of gender politics at the university of berne who is part of a growing campaign to get the guns out of swiss homes .
" the weapon is a constant threat in family life in switzerland , which i think is such a terrible thing for many women and many children . "
a threat to swiss masculinity ?
but it 's hard to challenge tradition .
learning to use a gun has been a rite of passage for young swiss men for centuries .
keckeis sees proposals to take the guns away as a threat to the masculinity of his troops .
" they will really be taken as unserious men , " he said .
" it would be a sign that we do n't have confidence in them any more , after being so confident for many years , and they would be really lost .
it would be a signal that the political power in switzerland is no longer confident in its armed forces and in its population . "
subject to referendum those political considerations are n't much comfort to tanja vollenweider .
she 's convinced she would still have her husband if the gun had n't been so readily available . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : introducing gun control would have to be decided by referendum " this only happened because the gun was right here at home , " she said .
" my husband would n't have gone out looking for one .
if the gun had n't been here i think he 'd still be alive . "
little by little , there are signs that the swiss may be ready for change : this summer , left-wing parties will launch plans for a nationwide referendum to force the army to take the weapons away .

" germany is not an oasis , we are also threatened by terrorism , " he said in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" that has to be responsibly explained to the public .
the tone of the debate is very important . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble , left , and zypries have gone eye-to-eye on several issues but statements from maiziere , who also said that the country should not abandon its democratic principles out of fear , may be coming too late to have much of an effect . german justice minister brigitte zypries was called a " national security risk " by a state interior minister and numerous attacks were mounted against an initiative to allow online computer searches presented by interior minister wolfgang schäuble . zypries , as well as other members of the social democratic party , part of the chancellor 's ruling grand coalition , have come out against the computer search proposal .
in an op-ed published friday in the frankfurter rundschau she said clear limits needed to be placed on security measures in order to protect civil rights . some restrictions apply spd party head kurt beck agreed and added that his party was willing to consider permitting online searches of computer data if certain conditions were met . " we have to carefully weigh whether it is necessary and if it is even legally possible , " beck told the mass-market bild am sonntag newspaper .
" we are dealing with a sensitive area of privacy .
the people affected have to have a legal means to defend themselves from searches of their private information . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a verdict from the constitutional court is expected in early 2008 sebastian edathy an spd parliamentarian said the bundestag should wait until the country 's highest court rules on the constitutionality of a similar law enacted in one germany 's 16 states . germany 's federal constitutional court is scheduled to hear a case dealing with north rhine-westphalia 's online search law in october . " it would be foolish for us to make a decision that , in light of the judges ' verdict , would have to be corrected or revised , " he told the taz newspaper .
" the subject can be discussed , but it 's not ready for a decision . " bavarian interior minister günther beckstein , however , said such online searches should be implemented as soon as possible , calling them an important tool for authorities in fighting terrorism .
he also accused zypries of keeping police from using all the means at their disposal to prevent terror attacks . " i think mrs. zypries ' behavior is indefensible because it creates a hole in the security net and that can be very dangerous for germany , " he told the passauer neuen presse . as opinions on the issue continue to heat up , maiziere said he would do everything in his power to bring the political parties to a compromise by the end of august . article based on news reports -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

couriering packages around kabul gives them a rare chance to make a living . afghanistan is thought to have more land mines than any other country in the world .
the estimated 30 million mines are a dangerous legacy of decades of war that have maimed approximately half a million people .
those who have lost limbs because of the mines find it nearly impossible to earn a living .
the german development service -lrb- ded -rrb- , which is germany 's foreign development aid agency , has partnered with the afghan amputee bicyclist for rehabilitation and recreation -lrb- aabrar -rrb- organization to give amputees in kabul a chance to earn a living . going without bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life as an amputee is difficult in afghanistan gone to run errands for his mother in kabul , qahar was 11 years old when he stepped on a mine and lost both his legs .
from then on , he was considered a burden on his large family , since he could n't earn money to help his siblings .
he sunk into a deep depression .
" i was mostly unhappy because i saw many people my age who could play volleyball and soccer , " qahar said .
" they went to school and to the university .
sometimes i cried and my mother comforted me .
she told me that i should stop crying , that everything was in god 's hands and that this was my destiny . "
qahar is now 23 and wears prosthetics .
he has found new hope with the aabrar , an afghan non-governmental organization that gets financial support from the ded .
the organization offers war invalids something that would normally be impossible in afghanistan - the chance to work and be independent . employment for amputees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated half million people have been injured by land mines in afghanistan the organization opened afghanistan 's first bicycle messenger service in kabul in november of 2002 , which exclusively employs people with physical disabilities the ded and aabrar came up with the idea while trying to think about what kind of employment opportunities could be given to amputees , said andreas schneider , the ded 's regional director for afghanistan and central asia .
the program employs 15 bicycle couriers .
formerly , these amputees would have spent years sitting at home without jobs .
now , in a normal day they deliver letters , packages and merchandise around the clock through the streets of kabul .
they wear protective masks because of pollution problems in the city , which has a million inhabitants .
they also wear helmets and have specially-designed bicycles .
" these are essentially specially-developed bicycles , " schneider said .

couriering packages around kabul gives them a rare chance to make a living . afghanistan is thought to have more land mines than any other country in the world .
the estimated 30 million mines are a dangerous legacy of decades of war that have maimed approximately half a million people .
those who have lost limbs because of the mines find it nearly impossible to earn a living .
the german development service -lrb- ded -rrb- , which is germany 's foreign development aid agency , has partnered with the afghan amputee bicyclist for rehabilitation and recreation -lrb- aabrar -rrb- organization to give amputees in kabul a chance to earn a living . going without bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life as an amputee is difficult in afghanistan gone to run errands for his mother in kabul , qahar was 11 years old when he stepped on a mine and lost both his legs .
from then on , he was considered a burden on his large family , since he could n't earn money to help his siblings .
he sunk into a deep depression .
" i was mostly unhappy because i saw many people my age who could play volleyball and soccer , " qahar said .
" they went to school and to the university .
sometimes i cried and my mother comforted me .
she told me that i should stop crying , that everything was in god 's hands and that this was my destiny . "
qahar is now 23 and wears prosthetics .
he has found new hope with the aabrar , an afghan non-governmental organization that gets financial support from the ded .
the organization offers war invalids something that would normally be impossible in afghanistan - the chance to work and be independent . employment for amputees bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated half million people have been injured by land mines in afghanistan the organization opened afghanistan 's first bicycle messenger service in kabul in november of 2002 , which exclusively employs people with physical disabilities the ded and aabrar came up with the idea while trying to think about what kind of employment opportunities could be given to amputees , said andreas schneider , the ded 's regional director for afghanistan and central asia .
the program employs 15 bicycle couriers .
formerly , these amputees would have spent years sitting at home without jobs .
now , in a normal day they deliver letters , packages and merchandise around the clock through the streets of kabul .
they wear protective masks because of pollution problems in the city , which has a million inhabitants .
they also wear helmets and have specially-designed bicycles .
" these are essentially specially-developed bicycles , " schneider said .
" you could say they 're a type of mountain bike that are designed so that they can be ridden with a prosthesis .

the expectation generally is that the uk will continue to be close to the united states but perhaps not quite as close as it was .
the new british leader is an atlanticist , who knows and likes the us well .
he is expected to - and indeed he and foreign secretary david miliband have said he will - continue to advance a foreign policy that is sympathetic towards the us .
but nobody thinks that gordon brown is going to find a soulmate in george bush as tony blair did .
that relationship was forged in the heat of 9/11 and iraq .
iraq ...
on the most immediate foreign policy issue to hand , britain will not undertake a precipitous withdrawal from iraq .
however mr brown has spoken of a " new stage " and the signs are that he wants out as soon as possible , as long as that is -lrb- or can be presented as being -rrb- compatible with the policy of handing over only when the iraqis can do the job .
and britain will stay in afghanistan in a combat role .
indeed , it wants more nato members to join the fray , as does the united states . ... and iran a key issue that might well test the relationship is iran .
a new round of un sanctions is going to be debated , maybe decided , in september , but what if the bush administration decides to attack iran 's nuclear facilities in the final 18 months or so of its term of office ?
mr brown has not ruled out military action - doing so now could undermine the diplomatic and economic pressure currently being applied , it is felt - but most observers think he would not join in if the us went ahead .
forged in fire : bush and blair at camp david , february 2001 mr brown will go to camp david on sunday evening for dinner and will stay over into monday , the white house spokesman tony snow has announced .
he will no doubt try to clear up some mixed signals that his government has sent out about how it wants to deal with washington .
for example , the appointment of mark -lrb- now lord -rrb- malloch brown as foreign office minister - a man who was a leading critic of the bush administration when he was a senior un figure - was seen as a deliberate distancing from the us neo-conservatives .
on the other hand , britain does not really want to get much closer to the european union , holding firm to its " red lines " in the eu treaty negotiations , one of which is to preserve a national foreign policy .
this approach was reflected in the recent row with russia in the litvinenko affair , in which london did not reach out for an eu-wide response but trod its own path .
the possibility is that britain will end up semi-attached to the united states and semi-detached from europe .
links to us the former british ambassador to washington , sir christopher meyer , was present at camp david when tony blair met george bush there in february 2001 .
he dismisses any suggestion that gordon brown will want to use camp david to distance himself significantly from president bush .
" people have got quite excited about this , " he said .
" there are thousands of seminars about it but i do n't think that it warrants that level of activity .
they will not be as close personally , unless some magic strikes , but frankly that does not matter that much .
" there is such an awful lot of stuff in the relationship and while there are variables - personalities , events , and shifts of tone - and sometimes the relationship is not that special , historically since 1945 it goes on regardless .
rendition differences one recent example of how the relationship can at times be tense came when a house of commons committee revealed that britain had reservations about aspects of the us policy of flying terror suspects around the world but that these were ignored .
it was a reminder that , although the two countries are as close allies as they can realistically be , in the end they can diverge .
" mr brown 's mixed signals are a classic case of an administration bedding in , with some of the bits not dropping into place , " says sir christopher .
" as for iran , i am not sure i see the uk going for military action .
there are major military objections .
i would be surprised if britain got involved .
" and in afghanistan , we need help .
how long can we sustain that action ? "

on the other hand , britain does not really want to get much closer to the european union , holding firm to its " red lines " in the eu treaty negotiations , one of which is to preserve a national foreign policy .

" there are thousands of seminars about it but i do n't think that it warrants that level of activity .
they will not be as close personally , unless some magic strikes , but frankly that does not matter that much .
