program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 30.10.2007 can and should the eu cage the chinese dragon ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's global expansion has put the eu on the defensive the sino-european relationship is at a crossroads .
after decades of patient waiting for promised reforms and opening up , europe now sees the resurgence of a giant that is less eager to conform to its expectations . thirty years ago , deng xiaoping said that it would take 100 years for china to become a democracy .
while another 70 years of waiting would be frustrating in itself , things have been made worse by current president hu jintao 's assertion that the century of political transition has yet to begin . it is this sluggish liberalization which is frustrating the new generation of european leaders , especially german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy who both want china to speed up social and political reforms .
but this slow progress is only one item in a catalogue of differences which have been increasingly straining eu-china ties . over the past few months , the sino-european relationship has been rocked by allegations of internet espionage and cyber-warfare by china ; fractious trade relations over everything from steel to children 's toys , rising suspicion over the people 's republic 's economic ambitions and strong language on its human rights and environmental record . while many of these areas of conflict have recently highlighted the growing eu-china divide , experts on sino-european ties pinpoint three main challenges to the stability of the relationship . china expanding into areas of european interest jonathan holslag , the head of research at the brussels institute for contemporary china studies -lrb- biccs -rrb- , believes the biggest challenge to the relationship is china 's tenacious economic protectionism . " this protectionism is the eu 's key concern , particularly in the financial sector , " holslag told dw-world.de.
" china 's export promotion strategy is also a worry , given that the chinese government is developing a new generation of advanced national champions backed by excessive subsidies , tax breaks , and most importantly , a cheap currency .
there is also little reinforcing of basic product safety standards or international property rights -lrb- ipr -rrb- rules . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson has had run-ins with china holslag also believes that china 's economic boom is reaching niches in which europe once had a strong lead .
the eu 's advantage in many economic areas is being eroded by a state with more than $ 1.4 trillion -lrb- 0.97 trillion euros -rrb- of foreign exchange reserves in its pocket .
china 's enormous economic power could reduce the european bloc 's competitiveness . " the fact that china has developed into a competitor is mainly due to the fact that the eu itself is not able to step up its economic modernization and its political coherence , " holslag added .
" the worst reaction from the europeans would be to step up its own protectionism .
such a strategy would be harmful to europe 's own long-term interests .
the only way of dealing with china is for the eu to do things better . " european indecisiveness undermining diplomatic efforts according to carmel leclerq , an expert on eu-asia relations at the brussels-based sino-european forum , china is also slowly reducing the european union 's influence in many areas of global diplomacy .
china has abandoned its once timid diplomatic posture and is growing more assertive .
a zealous and well-coordinated foreign economic policy is beginning to undermine european interests in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has reached out to africa and has been accepted china 's tackling of problems which the eu has decided to stay out of , such as north korea and sudan , the people 's republic is sidelining the eu and weakening its influence , particularly in africa , were it is conducting an economic development policy based on large amounts of aid , loans and investments . " compared with china 's charm offensive where it seems genuinely knowledgeable , open and committed to solving international problems , the eu appears to be hopelessly undecided on where it stands on many issues and fails to translate its potential power into real clout , " said leclerq .
" the eu should n't try and undermine china 's growing influence or even contain it but try to build up a healthy balance of influence by making itself stronger and more focused . "
eu , china at odds over human rights human rights also remain a main point of dispute , especially as china still refuses to ratify the symbolically important convention on civil and political rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is some way behind the eu on human rights issues " the eu expects china to make real concessions .
the time of promises and minor cosmetic adaptations is over .
beijing has to start to improve civilian rights in line with international accords , " said jonas tiel from the european asian watch foundation .
" china needs to react in a more moderate manner to criticism .
the cancellation of human rights talks with germany after angela merkel met with the dalai lama was not constructive .
china can only expect even more pressure if it does n't take steps .
sanctions are not out of the question . " professor dai bingran , an expert on european affairs at the university of fudan in china , says that the eu needs to have more patience with china over human rights issues and that the chinese people are on the road to democracy and freedom but admitted progress is slow . " issues like human rights , freedom , democracy , etc. are not in the traditional chinese culture , say in confucianism , but that does not mean we are against them , " bingran said .
" on the contrary , in the last few decades the situation has greatly improved .
it is true that the situation is not as good as in europe , or as they should be , but for such things to take place , it does need some time . " possible demonization of china in europe most experts agree that while there are solutions to all these challenges , the biggest danger is china becoming " demonized " within the eu and that , much like what is happening at the moment in the united states , a " grand coalition " of china-sceptics forms in europe and brings pressure on national parliaments and the eu to act . " what 's possible is that interest groups , such as environmentalists , human rights campaigners , textile producers , and those who criticize china within the eu start to find each other , " holslag said .
" this would lead to increased pressure to resort to sanctions on trade and other issues and would inhibit the eu 's ability to pursue a cautious china policy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel get closer on their china stance leclerq believes that a harder stance towards china has already begun at a high level .
" merkel and sarkozy have already taken up more hard-line positions with china than any of their predecessors , mainly because they have been pressured to do so by domestic factors , " she said . " germany in particular is taking a more critical tone , moving away from its role as a prominent defender of close commercial relations with china as it starts to see the chinese challenging its own advanced economic strongholds in electronics and car manufacturing . "
cooperation and partnerships the way forward the experts believe that the dragon can not be caged and that the eu should not even try .
a concerted effort to restrict and alienate china , even with the backing of the united states , would be impossible without harming international economic stability .
the general belief is that the only way for the eu to keep china in check is to act as a unified player in world politics and to make itself indispensable as an economic and political partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future is not necessarily bleak for the eu and china the omens are good for the eu in this respect .
with the united states becoming more unpredictable due to the upcoming presidential elections and its increasing china-phobia , the chinese consider the eu an important partner .
the eu 's position as an intermediate between the us and china therefore makes it well placed to engage with the chinese and could provide the eu with more influence . negotiations for a new eu-china partnership agreement in either 2008 or 2009 will be vital to maintain mutual confidence , but china 's reluctance to address key topics like political freedom , economic imbalances and liberalization , and the eu 's current inability to agree on a coherent china policy makes the coming eighteen months very important regarding the future of sino-european relations . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

analyst michael grömling said it 's because they all bought last year to beat the sales tax increase - and because they 're getting older . on average , germans saved 170 euros -lrb- $ 245 -rrb- a month in the first half of 2007 , resulting in a national total of 84 billion euros for the six-month period . the seasonally adjusted savings ratio of 10.9 percent represents an increase of 0.4 percent over last year , as reported monday by germany 's federal statistical office , just in time for international savings day on oct .
30 . dw-world.de spoke with business analyst michael grömling from the cologne institute for economic research to find out why germans seem to be putting more money aside these days . dw-world.de : mr. grömling , why are germans saving more ? michael grömling : they 're saving more in relation to disposable income .
it mainly has to do with the value-added tax , which was raised from 16 to 19 percent on jan .
1 , 2007 .
this led to increased consumption during the previous year in order -lsb- buy early -rsb- to avoid paying the higher tax .
to make these purchases , many citizens dug into their savings .
the savings that were depleted last year are , in part , being built up again this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many took advantage of the 16 percent sales tax in 2006 how significant is a 0.4 percent increase in the savings ratio ? it means several billion euros that are pulled out of the consumption circuit .
however , we 'll have to wait and see how the savings pattern develops in 2007 as a whole . it definitely has to do with the fact that consumption was high in the second half of 2006 and that , because of this , many did n't need to make purchases in the first half of 2007 .
for example , those who bought cars last year do n't have to buy another one this year .
as a whole , it 's not an alarming development . germans are known for being bigger savers than other europeans and certainly than the americans .
why is this ? it has to do with a series of programs we 've started in the past few years that encourage people to save more due to demographic developments .
the population in germany will become drastically smaller in the next few years and decades .
the social security system wo n't be able to support people later in life to the same extent so they have to put aside more money now . in comparison with the us , it 's also worth mentioning that the low savings ratio there is more problematic than the high savings rate in germany . according to the report from the federal statistical office , germans tend to save conservatively - in banks and bonds , for example .
what can this be attributed to ? it goes back to the stock market crash in 2000 , which continued until 2003 .
the fact that germans invest their money so conservatively also has to do with the german mentality . according to recent reports , unemployment is down and inflation is up in germany .
do these factors play a role in germans ' savings habits ? not at this time .

30 , they had charged six french nationals , who were employees of an aid agency , with attempted kidnapping . an mob of several dozen people gathered outside the court house in abeche , calling the europeans " thieves , killers " , and accusing former colonial power france of being an " accomplice . " citizens of spain and belgium have also been charged as accomplices , the associated press reported .
they could face decades in prison , including hard labor , if found guilty . french foreign ministry spokeswoman pascale andreani said tuesday that france was sending a doctor and legal adviser to meet with the group 's detained members . the six were employees of a french aid group called l 'arche de zoe , or zoe 's arc , and were arrested thursday as they were preparing to leave with the children from abeche , an eastern city near chad 's border with sudan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the aid workers held in custody in abeche , chad the aid workers have insisted that they were told the children were orphans from sudan 's war-torn western region of darfur , which borders chad . the workers said they were taking the children out of the country to france to receive medical treatment . however , an investigation , partly involving united nations workers , revealed that none of the children was injured .
investigators also found that many of the children may not have been orphans . zoe 's arc said it had arranged for french host families to care for the children , but the organization denied charges that the children were to be given up for adoption .
according to the afp news agency , some of the families each paid between 2,800 euros and 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 4,000 and $ 8,600 -rrb- , supposedly for the evacuation costs of the children . french police have reportedly been investigating the activities of zoe 's arc since july . other nationals charged chadian authorities in the eastern city abeche have also charged three french journalists , who were accompanying the aid workers , with complicity in the case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chadian president idriss deby at the orphanage in abeche a further seven - of the spanish flight crew from the aircraft that was to fly the children to france - as well as the belgian pilot have been charged as accomplices , radio france internationale -lrb- rfi -rrb- reported . rfi said it was unclear whether two chadian nationals arrested with the 16 europeans had also been charged with complicity . chad 's interior minister ahmat bachir said the accused would be flown to the capital n 'djamena this week . eu forces in darfur-chad region not at risk meanwhile , the french government has said a multinational european union force in the darfur-chad border region would not be jeopardized . " this affair has absolutely nothing to do with the deployment of the multinational force , " french junior minister for human rights , rama yade , told europe 1 radio , according to the dpa news agency . over the weekend , french president nicolas sarkozy said zoe 's arc 's actions were " illegal and unacceptable . "
he also said he had spoken with chadian president idriss deby . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yade called the attempted transport " illegal and morally irresponsible " deby himself has described the actions of the aid workers as " simple kidnapping . "
he also accused the french organization of wanting to " sell -lrb- the children -rrb- to pedophile organizations in europe , and even perhaps to kill them and sell their organs , " according to dpa . however , deby also reportedly told sarkozy that the affair would not affect the deployment of 3,000 european troops , half of whom are french , scheduled to arrive in eastern chad and the northern region of the central african republic in november .
the soldiers are to help safeguard camps holding refugees fleeing darfur . more than four years of conflict there have left more than 200,000 people and 2.5 million people displaced . the 103 children who were on their way to france are currently in an orphanage in abeche , where they are being cared for by local aid workers and unicef staff . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" citizens of spain and belgium have also been charged as accomplices , the associated press reported .
they could face decades in prison , including hard labor , if found guilty . french foreign ministry spokeswoman pascale andreani said tuesday that france was sending a doctor and legal adviser to meet with the group 's detained members . the six were employees of a french aid group called l 'arche de zoe , or zoe 's arc , and were arrested thursday as they were preparing to leave with the children from abeche , an eastern city near chad 's border with sudan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the aid workers held in custody in abeche , chad the aid workers have insisted that they were told the children were orphans from sudan 's war-torn western region of darfur , which borders chad . the workers said they were taking the children out of the country to france to receive medical treatment . however , an investigation , partly involving united nations workers , revealed that none of the children was injured .

" this affair has absolutely nothing to do with the deployment of the multinational force , " french junior minister for human rights , rama yade , told europe 1 radio , according to the dpa news agency . over the weekend , french president nicolas sarkozy said zoe 's arc 's actions were " illegal and unacceptable . "
he also said he had spoken with chadian president idriss deby . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yade called the attempted transport " illegal and morally irresponsible " deby himself has described the actions of the aid workers as " simple kidnapping . "
he also accused the french organization of wanting to " sell -lrb- the children -rrb- to pedophile organizations in europe , and even perhaps to kill them and sell their organs , " according to dpa . however , deby also reportedly told sarkozy that the affair would not affect the deployment of 3,000 european troops , half of whom are french , scheduled to arrive in eastern chad and the northern region of the central african republic in november .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 30.10.2007 can and should the eu cage the chinese dragon ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's global expansion has put the eu on the defensive the sino-european relationship is at a crossroads .
after decades of patient waiting for promised reforms and opening up , europe now sees the resurgence of a giant that is less eager to conform to its expectations . thirty years ago , deng xiaoping said that it would take 100 years for china to become a democracy .
while another 70 years of waiting would be frustrating in itself , things have been made worse by current president hu jintao 's assertion that the century of political transition has yet to begin . it is this sluggish liberalization which is frustrating the new generation of european leaders , especially german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy who both want china to speed up social and political reforms .
but this slow progress is only one item in a catalogue of differences which have been increasingly straining eu-china ties . over the past few months , the sino-european relationship has been rocked by allegations of internet espionage and cyber-warfare by china ; fractious trade relations over everything from steel to children 's toys , rising suspicion over the people 's republic 's economic ambitions and strong language on its human rights and environmental record . while many of these areas of conflict have recently highlighted the growing eu-china divide , experts on sino-european ties pinpoint three main challenges to the stability of the relationship . china expanding into areas of european interest jonathan holslag , the head of research at the brussels institute for contemporary china studies -lrb- biccs -rrb- , believes the biggest challenge to the relationship is china 's tenacious economic protectionism . " this protectionism is the eu 's key concern , particularly in the financial sector , " holslag told dw-world.de.
" china 's export promotion strategy is also a worry , given that the chinese government is developing a new generation of advanced national champions backed by excessive subsidies , tax breaks , and most importantly , a cheap currency .
there is also little reinforcing of basic product safety standards or international property rights -lrb- ipr -rrb- rules . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson has had run-ins with china holslag also believes that china 's economic boom is reaching niches in which europe once had a strong lead .
the eu 's advantage in many economic areas is being eroded by a state with more than $ 1.4 trillion -lrb- 0.97 trillion euros -rrb- of foreign exchange reserves in its pocket .
china 's enormous economic power could reduce the european bloc 's competitiveness . " the fact that china has developed into a competitor is mainly due to the fact that the eu itself is not able to step up its economic modernization and its political coherence , " holslag added .
" the worst reaction from the europeans would be to step up its own protectionism .
such a strategy would be harmful to europe 's own long-term interests .
the only way of dealing with china is for the eu to do things better . " european indecisiveness undermining diplomatic efforts according to carmel leclerq , an expert on eu-asia relations at the brussels-based sino-european forum , china is also slowly reducing the european union 's influence in many areas of global diplomacy .
china has abandoned its once timid diplomatic posture and is growing more assertive .
a zealous and well-coordinated foreign economic policy is beginning to undermine european interests in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has reached out to africa and has been accepted china 's tackling of problems which the eu has decided to stay out of , such as north korea and sudan , the people 's republic is sidelining the eu and weakening its influence , particularly in africa , were it is conducting an economic development policy based on large amounts of aid , loans and investments . " compared with china 's charm offensive where it seems genuinely knowledgeable , open and committed to solving international problems , the eu appears to be hopelessly undecided on where it stands on many issues and fails to translate its potential power into real clout , " said leclerq .
" the eu should n't try and undermine china 's growing influence or even contain it but try to build up a healthy balance of influence by making itself stronger and more focused . "
eu , china at odds over human rights human rights also remain a main point of dispute , especially as china still refuses to ratify the symbolically important convention on civil and political rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is some way behind the eu on human rights issues " the eu expects china to make real concessions .
the time of promises and minor cosmetic adaptations is over .
beijing has to start to improve civilian rights in line with international accords , " said jonas tiel from the european asian watch foundation .
" china needs to react in a more moderate manner to criticism .
the cancellation of human rights talks with germany after angela merkel met with the dalai lama was not constructive .
china can only expect even more pressure if it does n't take steps .
sanctions are not out of the question . " professor dai bingran , an expert on european affairs at the university of fudan in china , says that the eu needs to have more patience with china over human rights issues and that the chinese people are on the road to democracy and freedom but admitted progress is slow . " issues like human rights , freedom , democracy , etc. are not in the traditional chinese culture , say in confucianism , but that does not mean we are against them , " bingran said .
" on the contrary , in the last few decades the situation has greatly improved .
it is true that the situation is not as good as in europe , or as they should be , but for such things to take place , it does need some time . " possible demonization of china in europe most experts agree that while there are solutions to all these challenges , the biggest danger is china becoming " demonized " within the eu and that , much like what is happening at the moment in the united states , a " grand coalition " of china-sceptics forms in europe and brings pressure on national parliaments and the eu to act . " what 's possible is that interest groups , such as environmentalists , human rights campaigners , textile producers , and those who criticize china within the eu start to find each other , " holslag said .
" this would lead to increased pressure to resort to sanctions on trade and other issues and would inhibit the eu 's ability to pursue a cautious china policy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel get closer on their china stance leclerq believes that a harder stance towards china has already begun at a high level .
" merkel and sarkozy have already taken up more hard-line positions with china than any of their predecessors , mainly because they have been pressured to do so by domestic factors , " she said . " germany in particular is taking a more critical tone , moving away from its role as a prominent defender of close commercial relations with china as it starts to see the chinese challenging its own advanced economic strongholds in electronics and car manufacturing .

after decades of patient waiting for promised reforms and opening up , europe now sees the resurgence of a giant that is less eager to conform to its expectations . thirty years ago , deng xiaoping said that it would take 100 years for china to become a democracy .
while another 70 years of waiting would be frustrating in itself , things have been made worse by current president hu jintao 's assertion that the century of political transition has yet to begin . it is this sluggish liberalization which is frustrating the new generation of european leaders , especially german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy who both want china to speed up social and political reforms .
but this slow progress is only one item in a catalogue of differences which have been increasingly straining eu-china ties . over the past few months , the sino-european relationship has been rocked by allegations of internet espionage and cyber-warfare by china ; fractious trade relations over everything from steel to children 's toys , rising suspicion over the people 's republic 's economic ambitions and strong language on its human rights and environmental record . while many of these areas of conflict have recently highlighted the growing eu-china divide , experts on sino-european ties pinpoint three main challenges to the stability of the relationship . china expanding into areas of european interest jonathan holslag , the head of research at the brussels institute for contemporary china studies -lrb- biccs -rrb- , believes the biggest challenge to the relationship is china 's tenacious economic protectionism . " this protectionism is the eu 's key concern , particularly in the financial sector , " holslag told dw-world.de.
" china 's export promotion strategy is also a worry , given that the chinese government is developing a new generation of advanced national champions backed by excessive subsidies , tax breaks , and most importantly , a cheap currency .
there is also little reinforcing of basic product safety standards or international property rights -lrb- ipr -rrb- rules . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson has had run-ins with china holslag also believes that china 's economic boom is reaching niches in which europe once had a strong lead .
the eu 's advantage in many economic areas is being eroded by a state with more than $ 1.4 trillion -lrb- 0.97 trillion euros -rrb- of foreign exchange reserves in its pocket .
china 's enormous economic power could reduce the european bloc 's competitiveness . " the fact that china has developed into a competitor is mainly due to the fact that the eu itself is not able to step up its economic modernization and its political coherence , " holslag added .
" the worst reaction from the europeans would be to step up its own protectionism .
such a strategy would be harmful to europe 's own long-term interests .
the only way of dealing with china is for the eu to do things better . " european indecisiveness undermining diplomatic efforts according to carmel leclerq , an expert on eu-asia relations at the brussels-based sino-european forum , china is also slowly reducing the european union 's influence in many areas of global diplomacy .
china has abandoned its once timid diplomatic posture and is growing more assertive .
a zealous and well-coordinated foreign economic policy is beginning to undermine european interests in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has reached out to africa and has been accepted china 's tackling of problems which the eu has decided to stay out of , such as north korea and sudan , the people 's republic is sidelining the eu and weakening its influence , particularly in africa , were it is conducting an economic development policy based on large amounts of aid , loans and investments . " compared with china 's charm offensive where it seems genuinely knowledgeable , open and committed to solving international problems , the eu appears to be hopelessly undecided on where it stands on many issues and fails to translate its potential power into real clout , " said leclerq .
" the eu should n't try and undermine china 's growing influence or even contain it but try to build up a healthy balance of influence by making itself stronger and more focused . "
eu , china at odds over human rights human rights also remain a main point of dispute , especially as china still refuses to ratify the symbolically important convention on civil and political rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is some way behind the eu on human rights issues " the eu expects china to make real concessions .
the time of promises and minor cosmetic adaptations is over .
beijing has to start to improve civilian rights in line with international accords , " said jonas tiel from the european asian watch foundation .
" china needs to react in a more moderate manner to criticism .
the cancellation of human rights talks with germany after angela merkel met with the dalai lama was not constructive .
china can only expect even more pressure if it does n't take steps .
sanctions are not out of the question . " professor dai bingran , an expert on european affairs at the university of fudan in china , says that the eu needs to have more patience with china over human rights issues and that the chinese people are on the road to democracy and freedom but admitted progress is slow . " issues like human rights , freedom , democracy , etc. are not in the traditional chinese culture , say in confucianism , but that does not mean we are against them , " bingran said .
" on the contrary , in the last few decades the situation has greatly improved .
it is true that the situation is not as good as in europe , or as they should be , but for such things to take place , it does need some time . " possible demonization of china in europe most experts agree that while there are solutions to all these challenges , the biggest danger is china becoming " demonized " within the eu and that , much like what is happening at the moment in the united states , a " grand coalition " of china-sceptics forms in europe and brings pressure on national parliaments and the eu to act . " what 's possible is that interest groups , such as environmentalists , human rights campaigners , textile producers , and those who criticize china within the eu start to find each other , " holslag said .
" this would lead to increased pressure to resort to sanctions on trade and other issues and would inhibit the eu 's ability to pursue a cautious china policy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel get closer on their china stance leclerq believes that a harder stance towards china has already begun at a high level .
" merkel and sarkozy have already taken up more hard-line positions with china than any of their predecessors , mainly because they have been pressured to do so by domestic factors , " she said . " germany in particular is taking a more critical tone , moving away from its role as a prominent defender of close commercial relations with china as it starts to see the chinese challenging its own advanced economic strongholds in electronics and car manufacturing . "
cooperation and partnerships the way forward the experts believe that the dragon can not be caged and that the eu should not even try .
a concerted effort to restrict and alienate china , even with the backing of the united states , would be impossible without harming international economic stability .
the general belief is that the only way for the eu to keep china in check is to act as a unified player in world politics and to make itself indispensable as an economic and political partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future is not necessarily bleak for the eu and china the omens are good for the eu in this respect .

whenever there is a controversial event which could be blamed on the idiot-box , the same question arises : how much influence does television have on our lives ?
violent shows are almost always cited in cases when kids run amok and teenage promiscuity is often blamed on too much sex on tv .
it was only a matter of time before the ingenuity shown by a certain set of television criminals became the inspiration for a daring , real-life prison break .
while those involved in the incident at the juvenile detention center in neustadt , northwest germany , were not being framed for the murder of the vice president 's brother as some part of an elaborate political conspiracy , it did take an ingenious effort of tv-land proportions to break one 19-year old inmate out of her cell .
resourceful girls escape under guards ' noses taking a lot less time than 22 episodes to get to the actual escape , the escapee 's 18-year-old accomplice , another inmate who was released last friday , managed to get the fleeing jailbird out of the detention center and away under the very noses of the prison guards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " just stay calm , we 're nearly home and free " the guards , none of whom may have been too bright , failed to follow up suspicions after the released girl left the correctional facility with a suitcase which the officials found to be " particularly heavy . "

the german chancellor also called on indian president pratibha patil and vice president hamid ansari . merkel to sign defense , sci-tech agreements bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is welcomed by india 's prime minister singh merkel , who is on her first visit to india as chancellor , was set to meet with singh for discussions on bilateral , regional and global issues later on tuesday before signing a number of bilateral agreements in the areas of defense cooperation , science and technology and intellectual property rights . the chancellor is accompanied on her visit by german education and research minister annette schavan and a 30-member delegation of top business leaders representing companies like european aircraft manufacturer airbus , conglomerate siemens , rail operator deutsche bahn and reinsurer munich re . trade and investment is a special focus area of merkel 's visit and the chancellor has already made it clear during her visit that indian investors would be sincerely welcomed in germany and has requested that india ease trade barriers for german business and investment . german companies vying for slice of large pie bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with education minister annette schavan -lrb- left -rrb- german firms are keen on a share of the 360 billion euros -lrb- $ 511 billion -rrb- that india plans to invest in infrastructure and other projects in the next five years .

" indian airlines are one of our most important customers in asia and worldwide , " said enders .
" we are in several negotiations with indian airlines . " airbus , however , is not just interested in selling airplanes in india , but is looking to develop pilot training centers , enders added .
estimates put the number of pilots needed by india at around 1000 a year . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" switzerland wants to deepen and expand relations with the eu , " micheline calmy-rey , the country 's acting president , said monday , oct .

analyst michael grömling said it 's because they all bought last year to beat the sales tax increase - and because they 're getting older . on average , germans saved 170 euros -lrb- $ 245 -rrb- a month in the first half of 2007 , resulting in a national total of 84 billion euros for the six-month period . the seasonally adjusted savings ratio of 10.9 percent represents an increase of 0.4 percent over last year , as reported monday by germany 's federal statistical office , just in time for international savings day on oct .
30 . dw-world.de spoke with business analyst michael grömling from the cologne institute for economic research to find out why germans seem to be putting more money aside these days . dw-world.de : mr. grömling , why are germans saving more ? michael grömling : they 're saving more in relation to disposable income .
it mainly has to do with the value-added tax , which was raised from 16 to 19 percent on jan .
1 , 2007 .
this led to increased consumption during the previous year in order -lsb- buy early -rsb- to avoid paying the higher tax .
to make these purchases , many citizens dug into their savings .
the savings that were depleted last year are , in part , being built up again this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many took advantage of the 16 percent sales tax in 2006 how significant is a 0.4 percent increase in the savings ratio ? it means several billion euros that are pulled out of the consumption circuit .
however , we 'll have to wait and see how the savings pattern develops in 2007 as a whole . it definitely has to do with the fact that consumption was high in the second half of 2006 and that , because of this , many did n't need to make purchases in the first half of 2007 .
for example , those who bought cars last year do n't have to buy another one this year .
as a whole , it 's not an alarming development . germans are known for being bigger savers than other europeans and certainly than the americans .
why is this ? it has to do with a series of programs we 've started in the past few years that encourage people to save more due to demographic developments .
the population in germany will become drastically smaller in the next few years and decades .
the social security system wo n't be able to support people later in life to the same extent so they have to put aside more money now . in comparison with the us , it 's also worth mentioning that the low savings ratio there is more problematic than the high savings rate in germany . according to the report from the federal statistical office , germans tend to save conservatively - in banks and bonds , for example .
what can this be attributed to ? it goes back to the stock market crash in 2000 , which continued until 2003 .
the fact that germans invest their money so conservatively also has to do with the german mentality . according to recent reports , unemployment is down and inflation is up in germany .
do these factors play a role in germans ' savings habits ? not at this time .
the relatively stable job market in comparison to previous years should be a reason for lower savings .
discussion about savings over the past few days do n't apply here , in my opinion .
the higher inflation rate may have an impact but we have to wait and see how long this phenomenon lasts . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after decades of patient waiting for promised reforms and opening up , europe now sees the resurgence of a giant that is less eager to conform to its expectations . thirty years ago , deng xiaoping said that it would take 100 years for china to become a democracy .
while another 70 years of waiting would be frustrating in itself , things have been made worse by current president hu jintao 's assertion that the century of political transition has yet to begin . it is this sluggish liberalization which is frustrating the new generation of european leaders , especially german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy who both want china to speed up social and political reforms .
but this slow progress is only one item in a catalogue of differences which have been increasingly straining eu-china ties . over the past few months , the sino-european relationship has been rocked by allegations of internet espionage and cyber-warfare by china ; fractious trade relations over everything from steel to children 's toys , rising suspicion over the people 's republic 's economic ambitions and strong language on its human rights and environmental record . while many of these areas of conflict have recently highlighted the growing eu-china divide , experts on sino-european ties pinpoint three main challenges to the stability of the relationship . china expanding into areas of european interest jonathan holslag , the head of research at the brussels institute for contemporary china studies -lrb- biccs -rrb- , believes the biggest challenge to the relationship is china 's tenacious economic protectionism . " this protectionism is the eu 's key concern , particularly in the financial sector , " holslag told dw-world.de.
" china 's export promotion strategy is also a worry , given that the chinese government is developing a new generation of advanced national champions backed by excessive subsidies , tax breaks , and most importantly , a cheap currency .
there is also little reinforcing of basic product safety standards or international property rights -lrb- ipr -rrb- rules . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson has had run-ins with china holslag also believes that china 's economic boom is reaching niches in which europe once had a strong lead .
the eu 's advantage in many economic areas is being eroded by a state with more than $ 1.4 trillion -lrb- 0.97 trillion euros -rrb- of foreign exchange reserves in its pocket .
china 's enormous economic power could reduce the european bloc 's competitiveness . " the fact that china has developed into a competitor is mainly due to the fact that the eu itself is not able to step up its economic modernization and its political coherence , " holslag added .
" the worst reaction from the europeans would be to step up its own protectionism .
such a strategy would be harmful to europe 's own long-term interests .
the only way of dealing with china is for the eu to do things better . " european indecisiveness undermining diplomatic efforts according to carmel leclerq , an expert on eu-asia relations at the brussels-based sino-european forum , china is also slowly reducing the european union 's influence in many areas of global diplomacy .
china has abandoned its once timid diplomatic posture and is growing more assertive .
a zealous and well-coordinated foreign economic policy is beginning to undermine european interests in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has reached out to africa and has been accepted china 's tackling of problems which the eu has decided to stay out of , such as north korea and sudan , the people 's republic is sidelining the eu and weakening its influence , particularly in africa , were it is conducting an economic development policy based on large amounts of aid , loans and investments . " compared with china 's charm offensive where it seems genuinely knowledgeable , open and committed to solving international problems , the eu appears to be hopelessly undecided on where it stands on many issues and fails to translate its potential power into real clout , " said leclerq .
" the eu should n't try and undermine china 's growing influence or even contain it but try to build up a healthy balance of influence by making itself stronger and more focused . "
eu , china at odds over human rights human rights also remain a main point of dispute , especially as china still refuses to ratify the symbolically important convention on civil and political rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is some way behind the eu on human rights issues " the eu expects china to make real concessions .
the time of promises and minor cosmetic adaptations is over .
beijing has to start to improve civilian rights in line with international accords , " said jonas tiel from the european asian watch foundation .
" china needs to react in a more moderate manner to criticism .
the cancellation of human rights talks with germany after angela merkel met with the dalai lama was not constructive .
china can only expect even more pressure if it does n't take steps .
sanctions are not out of the question . " professor dai bingran , an expert on european affairs at the university of fudan in china , says that the eu needs to have more patience with china over human rights issues and that the chinese people are on the road to democracy and freedom but admitted progress is slow . " issues like human rights , freedom , democracy , etc. are not in the traditional chinese culture , say in confucianism , but that does not mean we are against them , " bingran said .
" on the contrary , in the last few decades the situation has greatly improved .
it is true that the situation is not as good as in europe , or as they should be , but for such things to take place , it does need some time . " possible demonization of china in europe most experts agree that while there are solutions to all these challenges , the biggest danger is china becoming " demonized " within the eu and that , much like what is happening at the moment in the united states , a " grand coalition " of china-sceptics forms in europe and brings pressure on national parliaments and the eu to act . " what 's possible is that interest groups , such as environmentalists , human rights campaigners , textile producers , and those who criticize china within the eu start to find each other , " holslag said .
" this would lead to increased pressure to resort to sanctions on trade and other issues and would inhibit the eu 's ability to pursue a cautious china policy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel get closer on their china stance leclerq believes that a harder stance towards china has already begun at a high level .
" merkel and sarkozy have already taken up more hard-line positions with china than any of their predecessors , mainly because they have been pressured to do so by domestic factors , " she said . " germany in particular is taking a more critical tone , moving away from its role as a prominent defender of close commercial relations with china as it starts to see the chinese challenging its own advanced economic strongholds in electronics and car manufacturing . "
cooperation and partnerships the way forward the experts believe that the dragon can not be caged and that the eu should not even try .
a concerted effort to restrict and alienate china , even with the backing of the united states , would be impossible without harming international economic stability .
the general belief is that the only way for the eu to keep china in check is to act as a unified player in world politics and to make itself indispensable as an economic and political partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future is not necessarily bleak for the eu and china the omens are good for the eu in this respect .
with the united states becoming more unpredictable due to the upcoming presidential elections and its increasing china-phobia , the chinese consider the eu an important partner .
the eu 's position as an intermediate between the us and china therefore makes it well placed to engage with the chinese and could provide the eu with more influence . negotiations for a new eu-china partnership agreement in either 2008 or 2009 will be vital to maintain mutual confidence , but china 's reluctance to address key topics like political freedom , economic imbalances and liberalization , and the eu 's current inability to agree on a coherent china policy makes the coming eighteen months very important regarding the future of sino-european relations . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

analyst michael grömling said it 's because they all bought last year to beat the sales tax increase - and because they 're getting older . on average , germans saved 170 euros -lrb- $ 245 -rrb- a month in the first half of 2007 , resulting in a national total of 84 billion euros for the six-month period . the seasonally adjusted savings ratio of 10.9 percent represents an increase of 0.4 percent over last year , as reported monday by germany 's federal statistical office , just in time for international savings day on oct .
30 . dw-world.de spoke with business analyst michael grömling from the cologne institute for economic research to find out why germans seem to be putting more money aside these days . dw-world.de : mr. grömling , why are germans saving more ? michael grömling : they 're saving more in relation to disposable income .
it mainly has to do with the value-added tax , which was raised from 16 to 19 percent on jan .
1 , 2007 .
this led to increased consumption during the previous year in order -lsb- buy early -rsb- to avoid paying the higher tax .
to make these purchases , many citizens dug into their savings .
the savings that were depleted last year are , in part , being built up again this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many took advantage of the 16 percent sales tax in 2006 how significant is a 0.4 percent increase in the savings ratio ? it means several billion euros that are pulled out of the consumption circuit .
however , we 'll have to wait and see how the savings pattern develops in 2007 as a whole . it definitely has to do with the fact that consumption was high in the second half of 2006 and that , because of this , many did n't need to make purchases in the first half of 2007 .
for example , those who bought cars last year do n't have to buy another one this year .
as a whole , it 's not an alarming development . germans are known for being bigger savers than other europeans and certainly than the americans .
why is this ? it has to do with a series of programs we 've started in the past few years that encourage people to save more due to demographic developments .
the population in germany will become drastically smaller in the next few years and decades .
the social security system wo n't be able to support people later in life to the same extent so they have to put aside more money now . in comparison with the us , it 's also worth mentioning that the low savings ratio there is more problematic than the high savings rate in germany . according to the report from the federal statistical office , germans tend to save conservatively - in banks and bonds , for example .
what can this be attributed to ? it goes back to the stock market crash in 2000 , which continued until 2003 .
the fact that germans invest their money so conservatively also has to do with the german mentality . according to recent reports , unemployment is down and inflation is up in germany .
do these factors play a role in germans ' savings habits ? not at this time .
the relatively stable job market in comparison to previous years should be a reason for lower savings .
discussion about savings over the past few days do n't apply here , in my opinion .
the higher inflation rate may have an impact but we have to wait and see how long this phenomenon lasts . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the group was captured by militants 10 minutes after their arrival despite having a police escort . afghan police accused of complicity allegations that the police had been in contact with the kidnappers prior to the engineers ' arrival have been made by a number of the group taken that day . three days into their ordeal , rüdiger d. , who apparently struggled to keep up with the rest of the group , was shot dead by one of the kidnappers , who one of the freed afghan hostages later described as a pakistani . during their three months in captivity , the hostages were often moved around , never spending more than a few nights in one place .
despite being clothed in summer attire , the hostages were forced to walk across mountain ranges as temperatures plunged . according to the wardak province authorities , blechschmidt and the afghans with him were released in return for the release from prison of six taliban members in a deal struck by the german government . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" switzerland wants to deepen and expand relations with the eu , " micheline calmy-rey , the country 's acting president , said monday , oct .
30 , at a meeting of heads-of-state of europe 's four german-speaking countries . calmy-rey , german president horst köhler and austrian president heinz fischer were invited by lichtenstein 's prince alois to his castle in vaduz on monday for the fourth annual meeting of its kind . the swiss president 's statement came just over a week after the country 's right-wing people 's party won parliamentary elections on an anti-eu , anti-immigration platform . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maurer said voters approved of the people 's party 's political platform " those who are against the eu , who want lower taxes , who want security and fewer criminal foreigners voted for the svp , " people 's party head ueli maurer said after the election , referring to his party by the acronym of its german name . the un special rapporteur on racism denounced the party for inciting racial hatred in its xenophobic campaigning and for pledging to deport non-national criminals . calmy-rey 's socialist party , now the second largest in parliament , has 43 of 200 seats , while the people 's party has 62 . elections show effects of globalization the president said the elections on oct .

" but there is still economic uncertainty and people are worried about their material security . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the people 's party took 29 percent of the vote calmy-rey , who was switzerland 's foreign minister but has taken on the duties of president for a year , said that her country has 120 bilateral treaties with the eu that switzerland wants to fully implement . " we just have one problem at the moment , and that 's the tax conflict , " she added . the european commission has maintained that some of the tax laws in switzerland 's cantons are inconsistent with the eu-swiss free trade agreement . switzerland on track to join visa-free area lichtenstein 's prince alois said he was confident that both his princedom and switzerland would be able to join the schengen agreement by 2008 , as planned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the heads-of-state had time for a museum visit in lichenstein 's capital the treaty allows for visa-free travel between the participating countries , most of which are members of the european union , and is seen as a major step toward integration with europe . the eu 's reform treaty topped the agenda at monday 's meeting in vaduz .
both köhler and his austrian counterpart fischer expressed their confidence that the document would be ratified next year .
the reform treaty is meant to replace the failed constitution draft , which was rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 . " i 'm very happy about the european union 's reform treaty , " said köhler .

analyst michael grömling said it 's because they all bought last year to beat the sales tax increase - and because they 're getting older . on average , germans saved 170 euros -lrb- $ 245 -rrb- a month in the first half of 2007 , resulting in a national total of 84 billion euros for the six-month period . the seasonally adjusted savings ratio of 10.9 percent represents an increase of 0.4 percent over last year , as reported monday by germany 's federal statistical office , just in time for international savings day on oct .
30 . dw-world.de spoke with business analyst michael grömling from the cologne institute for economic research to find out why germans seem to be putting more money aside these days . dw-world.de : mr. grömling , why are germans saving more ? michael grömling : they 're saving more in relation to disposable income .
it mainly has to do with the value-added tax , which was raised from 16 to 19 percent on jan .
1 , 2007 .
this led to increased consumption during the previous year in order -lsb- buy early -rsb- to avoid paying the higher tax .
to make these purchases , many citizens dug into their savings .
the savings that were depleted last year are , in part , being built up again this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many took advantage of the 16 percent sales tax in 2006 how significant is a 0.4 percent increase in the savings ratio ? it means several billion euros that are pulled out of the consumption circuit .
however , we 'll have to wait and see how the savings pattern develops in 2007 as a whole . it definitely has to do with the fact that consumption was high in the second half of 2006 and that , because of this , many did n't need to make purchases in the first half of 2007 .
for example , those who bought cars last year do n't have to buy another one this year .
as a whole , it 's not an alarming development . germans are known for being bigger savers than other europeans and certainly than the americans .
why is this ? it has to do with a series of programs we 've started in the past few years that encourage people to save more due to demographic developments .
the population in germany will become drastically smaller in the next few years and decades .
the social security system wo n't be able to support people later in life to the same extent so they have to put aside more money now . in comparison with the us , it 's also worth mentioning that the low savings ratio there is more problematic than the high savings rate in germany . according to the report from the federal statistical office , germans tend to save conservatively - in banks and bonds , for example .
what can this be attributed to ? it goes back to the stock market crash in 2000 , which continued until 2003 .
the fact that germans invest their money so conservatively also has to do with the german mentality . according to recent reports , unemployment is down and inflation is up in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 30.10.2007 can and should the eu cage the chinese dragon ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's global expansion has put the eu on the defensive the sino-european relationship is at a crossroads .
after decades of patient waiting for promised reforms and opening up , europe now sees the resurgence of a giant that is less eager to conform to its expectations . thirty years ago , deng xiaoping said that it would take 100 years for china to become a democracy .
while another 70 years of waiting would be frustrating in itself , things have been made worse by current president hu jintao 's assertion that the century of political transition has yet to begin . it is this sluggish liberalization which is frustrating the new generation of european leaders , especially german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy who both want china to speed up social and political reforms .
but this slow progress is only one item in a catalogue of differences which have been increasingly straining eu-china ties . over the past few months , the sino-european relationship has been rocked by allegations of internet espionage and cyber-warfare by china ; fractious trade relations over everything from steel to children 's toys , rising suspicion over the people 's republic 's economic ambitions and strong language on its human rights and environmental record . while many of these areas of conflict have recently highlighted the growing eu-china divide , experts on sino-european ties pinpoint three main challenges to the stability of the relationship . china expanding into areas of european interest jonathan holslag , the head of research at the brussels institute for contemporary china studies -lrb- biccs -rrb- , believes the biggest challenge to the relationship is china 's tenacious economic protectionism . " this protectionism is the eu 's key concern , particularly in the financial sector , " holslag told dw-world.de.
" china 's export promotion strategy is also a worry , given that the chinese government is developing a new generation of advanced national champions backed by excessive subsidies , tax breaks , and most importantly , a cheap currency .
there is also little reinforcing of basic product safety standards or international property rights -lrb- ipr -rrb- rules . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson has had run-ins with china holslag also believes that china 's economic boom is reaching niches in which europe once had a strong lead .
the eu 's advantage in many economic areas is being eroded by a state with more than $ 1.4 trillion -lrb- 0.97 trillion euros -rrb- of foreign exchange reserves in its pocket .
china 's enormous economic power could reduce the european bloc 's competitiveness . " the fact that china has developed into a competitor is mainly due to the fact that the eu itself is not able to step up its economic modernization and its political coherence , " holslag added .
" the worst reaction from the europeans would be to step up its own protectionism .
such a strategy would be harmful to europe 's own long-term interests .
the only way of dealing with china is for the eu to do things better . " european indecisiveness undermining diplomatic efforts according to carmel leclerq , an expert on eu-asia relations at the brussels-based sino-european forum , china is also slowly reducing the european union 's influence in many areas of global diplomacy .
china has abandoned its once timid diplomatic posture and is growing more assertive .
a zealous and well-coordinated foreign economic policy is beginning to undermine european interests in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has reached out to africa and has been accepted china 's tackling of problems which the eu has decided to stay out of , such as north korea and sudan , the people 's republic is sidelining the eu and weakening its influence , particularly in africa , were it is conducting an economic development policy based on large amounts of aid , loans and investments . " compared with china 's charm offensive where it seems genuinely knowledgeable , open and committed to solving international problems , the eu appears to be hopelessly undecided on where it stands on many issues and fails to translate its potential power into real clout , " said leclerq .
" the eu should n't try and undermine china 's growing influence or even contain it but try to build up a healthy balance of influence by making itself stronger and more focused . "
eu , china at odds over human rights human rights also remain a main point of dispute , especially as china still refuses to ratify the symbolically important convention on civil and political rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is some way behind the eu on human rights issues " the eu expects china to make real concessions .
the time of promises and minor cosmetic adaptations is over .
beijing has to start to improve civilian rights in line with international accords , " said jonas tiel from the european asian watch foundation .
" china needs to react in a more moderate manner to criticism .
the cancellation of human rights talks with germany after angela merkel met with the dalai lama was not constructive .
china can only expect even more pressure if it does n't take steps .
sanctions are not out of the question . " professor dai bingran , an expert on european affairs at the university of fudan in china , says that the eu needs to have more patience with china over human rights issues and that the chinese people are on the road to democracy and freedom but admitted progress is slow . " issues like human rights , freedom , democracy , etc. are not in the traditional chinese culture , say in confucianism , but that does not mean we are against them , " bingran said .
" on the contrary , in the last few decades the situation has greatly improved .
it is true that the situation is not as good as in europe , or as they should be , but for such things to take place , it does need some time . " possible demonization of china in europe most experts agree that while there are solutions to all these challenges , the biggest danger is china becoming " demonized " within the eu and that , much like what is happening at the moment in the united states , a " grand coalition " of china-sceptics forms in europe and brings pressure on national parliaments and the eu to act . " what 's possible is that interest groups , such as environmentalists , human rights campaigners , textile producers , and those who criticize china within the eu start to find each other , " holslag said .
" this would lead to increased pressure to resort to sanctions on trade and other issues and would inhibit the eu 's ability to pursue a cautious china policy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel get closer on their china stance leclerq believes that a harder stance towards china has already begun at a high level .
" merkel and sarkozy have already taken up more hard-line positions with china than any of their predecessors , mainly because they have been pressured to do so by domestic factors , " she said . " germany in particular is taking a more critical tone , moving away from its role as a prominent defender of close commercial relations with china as it starts to see the chinese challenging its own advanced economic strongholds in electronics and car manufacturing . "
cooperation and partnerships the way forward the experts believe that the dragon can not be caged and that the eu should not even try .
a concerted effort to restrict and alienate china , even with the backing of the united states , would be impossible without harming international economic stability .
the general belief is that the only way for the eu to keep china in check is to act as a unified player in world politics and to make itself indispensable as an economic and political partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future is not necessarily bleak for the eu and china the omens are good for the eu in this respect .
with the united states becoming more unpredictable due to the upcoming presidential elections and its increasing china-phobia , the chinese consider the eu an important partner .
the eu 's position as an intermediate between the us and china therefore makes it well placed to engage with the chinese and could provide the eu with more influence . negotiations for a new eu-china partnership agreement in either 2008 or 2009 will be vital to maintain mutual confidence , but china 's reluctance to address key topics like political freedom , economic imbalances and liberalization , and the eu 's current inability to agree on a coherent china policy makes the coming eighteen months very important regarding the future of sino-european relations . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while another 70 years of waiting would be frustrating in itself , things have been made worse by current president hu jintao 's assertion that the century of political transition has yet to begin . it is this sluggish liberalization which is frustrating the new generation of european leaders , especially german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy who both want china to speed up social and political reforms .
but this slow progress is only one item in a catalogue of differences which have been increasingly straining eu-china ties . over the past few months , the sino-european relationship has been rocked by allegations of internet espionage and cyber-warfare by china ; fractious trade relations over everything from steel to children 's toys , rising suspicion over the people 's republic 's economic ambitions and strong language on its human rights and environmental record . while many of these areas of conflict have recently highlighted the growing eu-china divide , experts on sino-european ties pinpoint three main challenges to the stability of the relationship . china expanding into areas of european interest jonathan holslag , the head of research at the brussels institute for contemporary china studies -lrb- biccs -rrb- , believes the biggest challenge to the relationship is china 's tenacious economic protectionism .

the german chancellor also called on indian president pratibha patil and vice president hamid ansari . merkel to sign defense , sci-tech agreements bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is welcomed by india 's prime minister singh merkel , who is on her first visit to india as chancellor , was set to meet with singh for discussions on bilateral , regional and global issues later on tuesday before signing a number of bilateral agreements in the areas of defense cooperation , science and technology and intellectual property rights . the chancellor is accompanied on her visit by german education and research minister annette schavan and a 30-member delegation of top business leaders representing companies like european aircraft manufacturer airbus , conglomerate siemens , rail operator deutsche bahn and reinsurer munich re . trade and investment is a special focus area of merkel 's visit and the chancellor has already made it clear during her visit that indian investors would be sincerely welcomed in germany and has requested that india ease trade barriers for german business and investment . german companies vying for slice of large pie bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with education minister annette schavan -lrb- left -rrb- german firms are keen on a share of the 360 billion euros -lrb- $ 511 billion -rrb- that india plans to invest in infrastructure and other projects in the next five years .
besides infrastructure , sectors like science and technology , energy , research and development and information technology are the areas in which german firms are most interested . bilateral trade passed the 10 billion euro mark in 2006 , and germany is the seventh largest investor in india with a total inflow of $ 1.9 billion between 1991 and june 2007 . merkel will take her business roadshow to the economic center of mumbai on wednesday where she will attend a meeting of german and indian company leaders . airbus chief optimistic of eurofighter contract bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders was confident of selling eurofighters to india one member of the business delegation accompanying the chancellor is airbus chief thomas enders who announced on tuesday that he was optimistic about the chance to supply the indian air force with 120 eurofighters . " the eurofighter ranks among the most modern combat aircraft worldwide , " said the former ceo of the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- . india has budgeted $ 10.4 billion to buy 126 new medium multi-role combat aircraft for the air force starting in 2012 and the eurofighter consortium which builds the multi-role typhoon fighter jet is hoping to land the lucrative contract ahead of its us , russian , swedish and french rivals . enders also saw possibilities for contracts on civilian aircraft , especially medium-haul planes , with the surge in air traffic in india . " indian airlines are one of our most important customers in asia and worldwide , " said enders .
" we are in several negotiations with indian airlines . " airbus , however , is not just interested in selling airplanes in india , but is looking to develop pilot training centers , enders added .

they could face decades in prison , including hard labor , if found guilty . french foreign ministry spokeswoman pascale andreani said tuesday that france was sending a doctor and legal adviser to meet with the group 's detained members . the six were employees of a french aid group called l 'arche de zoe , or zoe 's arc , and were arrested thursday as they were preparing to leave with the children from abeche , an eastern city near chad 's border with sudan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the aid workers held in custody in abeche , chad the aid workers have insisted that they were told the children were orphans from sudan 's war-torn western region of darfur , which borders chad . the workers said they were taking the children out of the country to france to receive medical treatment . however , an investigation , partly involving united nations workers , revealed that none of the children was injured .

analyst michael grömling said it 's because they all bought last year to beat the sales tax increase - and because they 're getting older . on average , germans saved 170 euros -lrb- $ 245 -rrb- a month in the first half of 2007 , resulting in a national total of 84 billion euros for the six-month period . the seasonally adjusted savings ratio of 10.9 percent represents an increase of 0.4 percent over last year , as reported monday by germany 's federal statistical office , just in time for international savings day on oct .
30 . dw-world.de spoke with business analyst michael grömling from the cologne institute for economic research to find out why germans seem to be putting more money aside these days . dw-world.de : mr. grömling , why are germans saving more ? michael grömling : they 're saving more in relation to disposable income .
it mainly has to do with the value-added tax , which was raised from 16 to 19 percent on jan .
1 , 2007 .
this led to increased consumption during the previous year in order -lsb- buy early -rsb- to avoid paying the higher tax .
to make these purchases , many citizens dug into their savings .
the savings that were depleted last year are , in part , being built up again this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many took advantage of the 16 percent sales tax in 2006 how significant is a 0.4 percent increase in the savings ratio ? it means several billion euros that are pulled out of the consumption circuit .
however , we 'll have to wait and see how the savings pattern develops in 2007 as a whole . it definitely has to do with the fact that consumption was high in the second half of 2006 and that , because of this , many did n't need to make purchases in the first half of 2007 .
for example , those who bought cars last year do n't have to buy another one this year .
as a whole , it 's not an alarming development . germans are known for being bigger savers than other europeans and certainly than the americans .
why is this ? it has to do with a series of programs we 've started in the past few years that encourage people to save more due to demographic developments .
the population in germany will become drastically smaller in the next few years and decades .
the social security system wo n't be able to support people later in life to the same extent so they have to put aside more money now . in comparison with the us , it 's also worth mentioning that the low savings ratio there is more problematic than the high savings rate in germany . according to the report from the federal statistical office , germans tend to save conservatively - in banks and bonds , for example .
what can this be attributed to ? it goes back to the stock market crash in 2000 , which continued until 2003 .
the fact that germans invest their money so conservatively also has to do with the german mentality . according to recent reports , unemployment is down and inflation is up in germany .
do these factors play a role in germans ' savings habits ? not at this time .
the relatively stable job market in comparison to previous years should be a reason for lower savings .
discussion about savings over the past few days do n't apply here , in my opinion .
the higher inflation rate may have an impact but we have to wait and see how long this phenomenon lasts . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 30.10.2007 can and should the eu cage the chinese dragon ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's global expansion has put the eu on the defensive the sino-european relationship is at a crossroads .
after decades of patient waiting for promised reforms and opening up , europe now sees the resurgence of a giant that is less eager to conform to its expectations . thirty years ago , deng xiaoping said that it would take 100 years for china to become a democracy .
while another 70 years of waiting would be frustrating in itself , things have been made worse by current president hu jintao 's assertion that the century of political transition has yet to begin . it is this sluggish liberalization which is frustrating the new generation of european leaders , especially german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy who both want china to speed up social and political reforms .
but this slow progress is only one item in a catalogue of differences which have been increasingly straining eu-china ties . over the past few months , the sino-european relationship has been rocked by allegations of internet espionage and cyber-warfare by china ; fractious trade relations over everything from steel to children 's toys , rising suspicion over the people 's republic 's economic ambitions and strong language on its human rights and environmental record . while many of these areas of conflict have recently highlighted the growing eu-china divide , experts on sino-european ties pinpoint three main challenges to the stability of the relationship . china expanding into areas of european interest jonathan holslag , the head of research at the brussels institute for contemporary china studies -lrb- biccs -rrb- , believes the biggest challenge to the relationship is china 's tenacious economic protectionism . " this protectionism is the eu 's key concern , particularly in the financial sector , " holslag told dw-world.de.
" china 's export promotion strategy is also a worry , given that the chinese government is developing a new generation of advanced national champions backed by excessive subsidies , tax breaks , and most importantly , a cheap currency .
there is also little reinforcing of basic product safety standards or international property rights -lrb- ipr -rrb- rules . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson has had run-ins with china holslag also believes that china 's economic boom is reaching niches in which europe once had a strong lead .
the eu 's advantage in many economic areas is being eroded by a state with more than $ 1.4 trillion -lrb- 0.97 trillion euros -rrb- of foreign exchange reserves in its pocket .
china 's enormous economic power could reduce the european bloc 's competitiveness . " the fact that china has developed into a competitor is mainly due to the fact that the eu itself is not able to step up its economic modernization and its political coherence , " holslag added .
" the worst reaction from the europeans would be to step up its own protectionism .
such a strategy would be harmful to europe 's own long-term interests .
the only way of dealing with china is for the eu to do things better . " european indecisiveness undermining diplomatic efforts according to carmel leclerq , an expert on eu-asia relations at the brussels-based sino-european forum , china is also slowly reducing the european union 's influence in many areas of global diplomacy .
china has abandoned its once timid diplomatic posture and is growing more assertive .
a zealous and well-coordinated foreign economic policy is beginning to undermine european interests in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has reached out to africa and has been accepted china 's tackling of problems which the eu has decided to stay out of , such as north korea and sudan , the people 's republic is sidelining the eu and weakening its influence , particularly in africa , were it is conducting an economic development policy based on large amounts of aid , loans and investments . " compared with china 's charm offensive where it seems genuinely knowledgeable , open and committed to solving international problems , the eu appears to be hopelessly undecided on where it stands on many issues and fails to translate its potential power into real clout , " said leclerq .
" the eu should n't try and undermine china 's growing influence or even contain it but try to build up a healthy balance of influence by making itself stronger and more focused . "
eu , china at odds over human rights human rights also remain a main point of dispute , especially as china still refuses to ratify the symbolically important convention on civil and political rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is some way behind the eu on human rights issues " the eu expects china to make real concessions .
the time of promises and minor cosmetic adaptations is over .
beijing has to start to improve civilian rights in line with international accords , " said jonas tiel from the european asian watch foundation .
" china needs to react in a more moderate manner to criticism .
the cancellation of human rights talks with germany after angela merkel met with the dalai lama was not constructive .
china can only expect even more pressure if it does n't take steps .
sanctions are not out of the question .

after decades of patient waiting for promised reforms and opening up , europe now sees the resurgence of a giant that is less eager to conform to its expectations . thirty years ago , deng xiaoping said that it would take 100 years for china to become a democracy .
while another 70 years of waiting would be frustrating in itself , things have been made worse by current president hu jintao 's assertion that the century of political transition has yet to begin . it is this sluggish liberalization which is frustrating the new generation of european leaders , especially german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy who both want china to speed up social and political reforms .
but this slow progress is only one item in a catalogue of differences which have been increasingly straining eu-china ties . over the past few months , the sino-european relationship has been rocked by allegations of internet espionage and cyber-warfare by china ; fractious trade relations over everything from steel to children 's toys , rising suspicion over the people 's republic 's economic ambitions and strong language on its human rights and environmental record . while many of these areas of conflict have recently highlighted the growing eu-china divide , experts on sino-european ties pinpoint three main challenges to the stability of the relationship . china expanding into areas of european interest jonathan holslag , the head of research at the brussels institute for contemporary china studies -lrb- biccs -rrb- , believes the biggest challenge to the relationship is china 's tenacious economic protectionism . " this protectionism is the eu 's key concern , particularly in the financial sector , " holslag told dw-world.de.
" china 's export promotion strategy is also a worry , given that the chinese government is developing a new generation of advanced national champions backed by excessive subsidies , tax breaks , and most importantly , a cheap currency .

china 's enormous economic power could reduce the european bloc 's competitiveness . " the fact that china has developed into a competitor is mainly due to the fact that the eu itself is not able to step up its economic modernization and its political coherence , " holslag added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 30.10.2007 germans are saving more , despite the economic upswing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german piggy banks are being well fed germans are putting aside more money this year , according to a recent report .
analyst michael grömling said it 's because they all bought last year to beat the sales tax increase - and because they 're getting older . on average , germans saved 170 euros -lrb- $ 245 -rrb- a month in the first half of 2007 , resulting in a national total of 84 billion euros for the six-month period . the seasonally adjusted savings ratio of 10.9 percent represents an increase of 0.4 percent over last year , as reported monday by germany 's federal statistical office , just in time for international savings day on oct .
30 . dw-world.de spoke with business analyst michael grömling from the cologne institute for economic research to find out why germans seem to be putting more money aside these days . dw-world.de : mr. grömling , why are germans saving more ? michael grömling : they 're saving more in relation to disposable income .
it mainly has to do with the value-added tax , which was raised from 16 to 19 percent on jan .
1 , 2007 .
this led to increased consumption during the previous year in order -lsb- buy early -rsb- to avoid paying the higher tax .
to make these purchases , many citizens dug into their savings .
the savings that were depleted last year are , in part , being built up again this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many took advantage of the 16 percent sales tax in 2006 how significant is a 0.4 percent increase in the savings ratio ? it means several billion euros that are pulled out of the consumption circuit .
however , we 'll have to wait and see how the savings pattern develops in 2007 as a whole . it definitely has to do with the fact that consumption was high in the second half of 2006 and that , because of this , many did n't need to make purchases in the first half of 2007 .
for example , those who bought cars last year do n't have to buy another one this year .
as a whole , it 's not an alarming development . germans are known for being bigger savers than other europeans and certainly than the americans .
why is this ? it has to do with a series of programs we 've started in the past few years that encourage people to save more due to demographic developments .
the population in germany will become drastically smaller in the next few years and decades .
the social security system wo n't be able to support people later in life to the same extent so they have to put aside more money now . in comparison with the us , it 's also worth mentioning that the low savings ratio there is more problematic than the high savings rate in germany . according to the report from the federal statistical office , germans tend to save conservatively - in banks and bonds , for example .
what can this be attributed to ? it goes back to the stock market crash in 2000 , which continued until 2003 .

analyst michael grömling said it 's because they all bought last year to beat the sales tax increase - and because they 're getting older . on average , germans saved 170 euros -lrb- $ 245 -rrb- a month in the first half of 2007 , resulting in a national total of 84 billion euros for the six-month period . the seasonally adjusted savings ratio of 10.9 percent represents an increase of 0.4 percent over last year , as reported monday by germany 's federal statistical office , just in time for international savings day on oct .
30 . dw-world.de spoke with business analyst michael grömling from the cologne institute for economic research to find out why germans seem to be putting more money aside these days . dw-world.de : mr. grömling , why are germans saving more ? michael grömling : they 're saving more in relation to disposable income .
it mainly has to do with the value-added tax , which was raised from 16 to 19 percent on jan .
1 , 2007 .
this led to increased consumption during the previous year in order -lsb- buy early -rsb- to avoid paying the higher tax .
to make these purchases , many citizens dug into their savings .
the savings that were depleted last year are , in part , being built up again this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many took advantage of the 16 percent sales tax in 2006 how significant is a 0.4 percent increase in the savings ratio ? it means several billion euros that are pulled out of the consumption circuit .
however , we 'll have to wait and see how the savings pattern develops in 2007 as a whole . it definitely has to do with the fact that consumption was high in the second half of 2006 and that , because of this , many did n't need to make purchases in the first half of 2007 .
for example , those who bought cars last year do n't have to buy another one this year .
as a whole , it 's not an alarming development . germans are known for being bigger savers than other europeans and certainly than the americans .
why is this ? it has to do with a series of programs we 've started in the past few years that encourage people to save more due to demographic developments .
the population in germany will become drastically smaller in the next few years and decades .
the social security system wo n't be able to support people later in life to the same extent so they have to put aside more money now . in comparison with the us , it 's also worth mentioning that the low savings ratio there is more problematic than the high savings rate in germany . according to the report from the federal statistical office , germans tend to save conservatively - in banks and bonds , for example .

however , we 'll have to wait and see how the savings pattern develops in 2007 as a whole . it definitely has to do with the fact that consumption was high in the second half of 2006 and that , because of this , many did n't need to make purchases in the first half of 2007 .
for example , those who bought cars last year do n't have to buy another one this year .
as a whole , it 's not an alarming development . germans are known for being bigger savers than other europeans and certainly than the americans .
why is this ? it has to do with a series of programs we 've started in the past few years that encourage people to save more due to demographic developments .
the population in germany will become drastically smaller in the next few years and decades .
the social security system wo n't be able to support people later in life to the same extent so they have to put aside more money now . in comparison with the us , it 's also worth mentioning that the low savings ratio there is more problematic than the high savings rate in germany . according to the report from the federal statistical office , germans tend to save conservatively - in banks and bonds , for example .
what can this be attributed to ? it goes back to the stock market crash in 2000 , which continued until 2003 .
the fact that germans invest their money so conservatively also has to do with the german mentality . according to recent reports , unemployment is down and inflation is up in germany .
do these factors play a role in germans ' savings habits ? not at this time .
the relatively stable job market in comparison to previous years should be a reason for lower savings .
discussion about savings over the past few days do n't apply here , in my opinion .
the higher inflation rate may have an impact but we have to wait and see how long this phenomenon lasts . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

blechschmidt 's colleague was later found dead from gunshot wounds . ex-hostage sure captors were not criminal gang germany 's foreign ministry had previously announced that the captors were more likely to be a criminal group with sympathies to the taliban rather than hardcore islamists with an ideological motivation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blechschmidt pleaded for help on video during his ordeal the ministry refused to make detailed comments on blechschmidt 's reported statement but said through a spokesperson that the kidnapping case would continue to be assessed by the federal crisis squad responsible for the investigation . blechschmidt and his companions had gone to the central afghan province of maidan wardak to repair a wall at the band-i-sultan dam .
the group was captured by militants 10 minutes after their arrival despite having a police escort . afghan police accused of complicity allegations that the police had been in contact with the kidnappers prior to the engineers ' arrival have been made by a number of the group taken that day . three days into their ordeal , rüdiger d. , who apparently struggled to keep up with the rest of the group , was shot dead by one of the kidnappers , who one of the freed afghan hostages later described as a pakistani . during their three months in captivity , the hostages were often moved around , never spending more than a few nights in one place .
despite being clothed in summer attire , the hostages were forced to walk across mountain ranges as temperatures plunged . according to the wardak province authorities , blechschmidt and the afghans with him were released in return for the release from prison of six taliban members in a deal struck by the german government . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they could face decades in prison , including hard labor , if found guilty . french foreign ministry spokeswoman pascale andreani said tuesday that france was sending a doctor and legal adviser to meet with the group 's detained members . the six were employees of a french aid group called l 'arche de zoe , or zoe 's arc , and were arrested thursday as they were preparing to leave with the children from abeche , an eastern city near chad 's border with sudan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the aid workers held in custody in abeche , chad the aid workers have insisted that they were told the children were orphans from sudan 's war-torn western region of darfur , which borders chad . the workers said they were taking the children out of the country to france to receive medical treatment . however , an investigation , partly involving united nations workers , revealed that none of the children was injured .

30 , they had charged six french nationals , who were employees of an aid agency , with attempted kidnapping . an mob of several dozen people gathered outside the court house in abeche , calling the europeans " thieves , killers " , and accusing former colonial power france of being an " accomplice . " citizens of spain and belgium have also been charged as accomplices , the associated press reported .
they could face decades in prison , including hard labor , if found guilty . french foreign ministry spokeswoman pascale andreani said tuesday that france was sending a doctor and legal adviser to meet with the group 's detained members . the six were employees of a french aid group called l 'arche de zoe , or zoe 's arc , and were arrested thursday as they were preparing to leave with the children from abeche , an eastern city near chad 's border with sudan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the aid workers held in custody in abeche , chad the aid workers have insisted that they were told the children were orphans from sudan 's war-torn western region of darfur , which borders chad . the workers said they were taking the children out of the country to france to receive medical treatment . however , an investigation , partly involving united nations workers , revealed that none of the children was injured .
investigators also found that many of the children may not have been orphans . zoe 's arc said it had arranged for french host families to care for the children , but the organization denied charges that the children were to be given up for adoption .
according to the afp news agency , some of the families each paid between 2,800 euros and 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 4,000 and $ 8,600 -rrb- , supposedly for the evacuation costs of the children . french police have reportedly been investigating the activities of zoe 's arc since july . other nationals charged chadian authorities in the eastern city abeche have also charged three french journalists , who were accompanying the aid workers , with complicity in the case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chadian president idriss deby at the orphanage in abeche a further seven - of the spanish flight crew from the aircraft that was to fly the children to france - as well as the belgian pilot have been charged as accomplices , radio france internationale -lrb- rfi -rrb- reported . rfi said it was unclear whether two chadian nationals arrested with the 16 europeans had also been charged with complicity . chad 's interior minister ahmat bachir said the accused would be flown to the capital n 'djamena this week . eu forces in darfur-chad region not at risk meanwhile , the french government has said a multinational european union force in the darfur-chad border region would not be jeopardized . " this affair has absolutely nothing to do with the deployment of the multinational force , " french junior minister for human rights , rama yade , told europe 1 radio , according to the dpa news agency . over the weekend , french president nicolas sarkozy said zoe 's arc 's actions were " illegal and unacceptable . "
he also said he had spoken with chadian president idriss deby . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yade called the attempted transport " illegal and morally irresponsible " deby himself has described the actions of the aid workers as " simple kidnapping . "
he also accused the french organization of wanting to " sell -lrb- the children -rrb- to pedophile organizations in europe , and even perhaps to kill them and sell their organs , " according to dpa . however , deby also reportedly told sarkozy that the affair would not affect the deployment of 3,000 european troops , half of whom are french , scheduled to arrive in eastern chad and the northern region of the central african republic in november .

30 , they had charged six french nationals , who were employees of an aid agency , with attempted kidnapping . an mob of several dozen people gathered outside the court house in abeche , calling the europeans " thieves , killers " , and accusing former colonial power france of being an " accomplice . " citizens of spain and belgium have also been charged as accomplices , the associated press reported .
they could face decades in prison , including hard labor , if found guilty . french foreign ministry spokeswoman pascale andreani said tuesday that france was sending a doctor and legal adviser to meet with the group 's detained members . the six were employees of a french aid group called l 'arche de zoe , or zoe 's arc , and were arrested thursday as they were preparing to leave with the children from abeche , an eastern city near chad 's border with sudan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the aid workers held in custody in abeche , chad the aid workers have insisted that they were told the children were orphans from sudan 's war-torn western region of darfur , which borders chad . the workers said they were taking the children out of the country to france to receive medical treatment . however , an investigation , partly involving united nations workers , revealed that none of the children was injured .
investigators also found that many of the children may not have been orphans . zoe 's arc said it had arranged for french host families to care for the children , but the organization denied charges that the children were to be given up for adoption .
according to the afp news agency , some of the families each paid between 2,800 euros and 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 4,000 and $ 8,600 -rrb- , supposedly for the evacuation costs of the children . french police have reportedly been investigating the activities of zoe 's arc since july . other nationals charged chadian authorities in the eastern city abeche have also charged three french journalists , who were accompanying the aid workers , with complicity in the case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chadian president idriss deby at the orphanage in abeche a further seven - of the spanish flight crew from the aircraft that was to fly the children to france - as well as the belgian pilot have been charged as accomplices , radio france internationale -lrb- rfi -rrb- reported . rfi said it was unclear whether two chadian nationals arrested with the 16 europeans had also been charged with complicity . chad 's interior minister ahmat bachir said the accused would be flown to the capital n 'djamena this week . eu forces in darfur-chad region not at risk meanwhile , the french government has said a multinational european union force in the darfur-chad border region would not be jeopardized . " this affair has absolutely nothing to do with the deployment of the multinational force , " french junior minister for human rights , rama yade , told europe 1 radio , according to the dpa news agency . over the weekend , french president nicolas sarkozy said zoe 's arc 's actions were " illegal and unacceptable . "
he also said he had spoken with chadian president idriss deby . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yade called the attempted transport " illegal and morally irresponsible " deby himself has described the actions of the aid workers as " simple kidnapping . "
he also accused the french organization of wanting to " sell -lrb- the children -rrb- to pedophile organizations in europe , and even perhaps to kill them and sell their organs , " according to dpa . however , deby also reportedly told sarkozy that the affair would not affect the deployment of 3,000 european troops , half of whom are french , scheduled to arrive in eastern chad and the northern region of the central african republic in november .
the soldiers are to help safeguard camps holding refugees fleeing darfur . more than four years of conflict there have left more than 200,000 people and 2.5 million people displaced . the 103 children who were on their way to france are currently in an orphanage in abeche , where they are being cared for by local aid workers and unicef staff . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after decades of patient waiting for promised reforms and opening up , europe now sees the resurgence of a giant that is less eager to conform to its expectations . thirty years ago , deng xiaoping said that it would take 100 years for china to become a democracy .
while another 70 years of waiting would be frustrating in itself , things have been made worse by current president hu jintao 's assertion that the century of political transition has yet to begin . it is this sluggish liberalization which is frustrating the new generation of european leaders , especially german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy who both want china to speed up social and political reforms .
but this slow progress is only one item in a catalogue of differences which have been increasingly straining eu-china ties . over the past few months , the sino-european relationship has been rocked by allegations of internet espionage and cyber-warfare by china ; fractious trade relations over everything from steel to children 's toys , rising suspicion over the people 's republic 's economic ambitions and strong language on its human rights and environmental record . while many of these areas of conflict have recently highlighted the growing eu-china divide , experts on sino-european ties pinpoint three main challenges to the stability of the relationship . china expanding into areas of european interest jonathan holslag , the head of research at the brussels institute for contemporary china studies -lrb- biccs -rrb- , believes the biggest challenge to the relationship is china 's tenacious economic protectionism . " this protectionism is the eu 's key concern , particularly in the financial sector , " holslag told dw-world.de.
" china 's export promotion strategy is also a worry , given that the chinese government is developing a new generation of advanced national champions backed by excessive subsidies , tax breaks , and most importantly , a cheap currency .
there is also little reinforcing of basic product safety standards or international property rights -lrb- ipr -rrb- rules . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson has had run-ins with china holslag also believes that china 's economic boom is reaching niches in which europe once had a strong lead .
the eu 's advantage in many economic areas is being eroded by a state with more than $ 1.4 trillion -lrb- 0.97 trillion euros -rrb- of foreign exchange reserves in its pocket .
china 's enormous economic power could reduce the european bloc 's competitiveness . " the fact that china has developed into a competitor is mainly due to the fact that the eu itself is not able to step up its economic modernization and its political coherence , " holslag added .
" the worst reaction from the europeans would be to step up its own protectionism .
such a strategy would be harmful to europe 's own long-term interests .
the only way of dealing with china is for the eu to do things better . " european indecisiveness undermining diplomatic efforts according to carmel leclerq , an expert on eu-asia relations at the brussels-based sino-european forum , china is also slowly reducing the european union 's influence in many areas of global diplomacy .
china has abandoned its once timid diplomatic posture and is growing more assertive .
a zealous and well-coordinated foreign economic policy is beginning to undermine european interests in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has reached out to africa and has been accepted china 's tackling of problems which the eu has decided to stay out of , such as north korea and sudan , the people 's republic is sidelining the eu and weakening its influence , particularly in africa , were it is conducting an economic development policy based on large amounts of aid , loans and investments . " compared with china 's charm offensive where it seems genuinely knowledgeable , open and committed to solving international problems , the eu appears to be hopelessly undecided on where it stands on many issues and fails to translate its potential power into real clout , " said leclerq .
" the eu should n't try and undermine china 's growing influence or even contain it but try to build up a healthy balance of influence by making itself stronger and more focused . "
eu , china at odds over human rights human rights also remain a main point of dispute , especially as china still refuses to ratify the symbolically important convention on civil and political rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is some way behind the eu on human rights issues " the eu expects china to make real concessions .
the time of promises and minor cosmetic adaptations is over .
beijing has to start to improve civilian rights in line with international accords , " said jonas tiel from the european asian watch foundation .
" china needs to react in a more moderate manner to criticism .
the cancellation of human rights talks with germany after angela merkel met with the dalai lama was not constructive .
china can only expect even more pressure if it does n't take steps .
sanctions are not out of the question . " professor dai bingran , an expert on european affairs at the university of fudan in china , says that the eu needs to have more patience with china over human rights issues and that the chinese people are on the road to democracy and freedom but admitted progress is slow . " issues like human rights , freedom , democracy , etc. are not in the traditional chinese culture , say in confucianism , but that does not mean we are against them , " bingran said .
" on the contrary , in the last few decades the situation has greatly improved .
it is true that the situation is not as good as in europe , or as they should be , but for such things to take place , it does need some time . " possible demonization of china in europe most experts agree that while there are solutions to all these challenges , the biggest danger is china becoming " demonized " within the eu and that , much like what is happening at the moment in the united states , a " grand coalition " of china-sceptics forms in europe and brings pressure on national parliaments and the eu to act . " what 's possible is that interest groups , such as environmentalists , human rights campaigners , textile producers , and those who criticize china within the eu start to find each other , " holslag said .
" this would lead to increased pressure to resort to sanctions on trade and other issues and would inhibit the eu 's ability to pursue a cautious china policy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel get closer on their china stance leclerq believes that a harder stance towards china has already begun at a high level .
" merkel and sarkozy have already taken up more hard-line positions with china than any of their predecessors , mainly because they have been pressured to do so by domestic factors , " she said . " germany in particular is taking a more critical tone , moving away from its role as a prominent defender of close commercial relations with china as it starts to see the chinese challenging its own advanced economic strongholds in electronics and car manufacturing . "
cooperation and partnerships the way forward the experts believe that the dragon can not be caged and that the eu should not even try .
a concerted effort to restrict and alienate china , even with the backing of the united states , would be impossible without harming international economic stability .
the general belief is that the only way for the eu to keep china in check is to act as a unified player in world politics and to make itself indispensable as an economic and political partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future is not necessarily bleak for the eu and china the omens are good for the eu in this respect .
with the united states becoming more unpredictable due to the upcoming presidential elections and its increasing china-phobia , the chinese consider the eu an important partner .
the eu 's position as an intermediate between the us and china therefore makes it well placed to engage with the chinese and could provide the eu with more influence . negotiations for a new eu-china partnership agreement in either 2008 or 2009 will be vital to maintain mutual confidence , but china 's reluctance to address key topics like political freedom , economic imbalances and liberalization , and the eu 's current inability to agree on a coherent china policy makes the coming eighteen months very important regarding the future of sino-european relations . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after decades of patient waiting for promised reforms and opening up , europe now sees the resurgence of a giant that is less eager to conform to its expectations . thirty years ago , deng xiaoping said that it would take 100 years for china to become a democracy .
while another 70 years of waiting would be frustrating in itself , things have been made worse by current president hu jintao 's assertion that the century of political transition has yet to begin . it is this sluggish liberalization which is frustrating the new generation of european leaders , especially german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy who both want china to speed up social and political reforms .
but this slow progress is only one item in a catalogue of differences which have been increasingly straining eu-china ties . over the past few months , the sino-european relationship has been rocked by allegations of internet espionage and cyber-warfare by china ; fractious trade relations over everything from steel to children 's toys , rising suspicion over the people 's republic 's economic ambitions and strong language on its human rights and environmental record . while many of these areas of conflict have recently highlighted the growing eu-china divide , experts on sino-european ties pinpoint three main challenges to the stability of the relationship . china expanding into areas of european interest jonathan holslag , the head of research at the brussels institute for contemporary china studies -lrb- biccs -rrb- , believes the biggest challenge to the relationship is china 's tenacious economic protectionism . " this protectionism is the eu 's key concern , particularly in the financial sector , " holslag told dw-world.de.
" china 's export promotion strategy is also a worry , given that the chinese government is developing a new generation of advanced national champions backed by excessive subsidies , tax breaks , and most importantly , a cheap currency .
there is also little reinforcing of basic product safety standards or international property rights -lrb- ipr -rrb- rules . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson has had run-ins with china holslag also believes that china 's economic boom is reaching niches in which europe once had a strong lead .
the eu 's advantage in many economic areas is being eroded by a state with more than $ 1.4 trillion -lrb- 0.97 trillion euros -rrb- of foreign exchange reserves in its pocket .
china 's enormous economic power could reduce the european bloc 's competitiveness . " the fact that china has developed into a competitor is mainly due to the fact that the eu itself is not able to step up its economic modernization and its political coherence , " holslag added .
" the worst reaction from the europeans would be to step up its own protectionism .
such a strategy would be harmful to europe 's own long-term interests .
the only way of dealing with china is for the eu to do things better . " european indecisiveness undermining diplomatic efforts according to carmel leclerq , an expert on eu-asia relations at the brussels-based sino-european forum , china is also slowly reducing the european union 's influence in many areas of global diplomacy .
china has abandoned its once timid diplomatic posture and is growing more assertive .
a zealous and well-coordinated foreign economic policy is beginning to undermine european interests in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has reached out to africa and has been accepted china 's tackling of problems which the eu has decided to stay out of , such as north korea and sudan , the people 's republic is sidelining the eu and weakening its influence , particularly in africa , were it is conducting an economic development policy based on large amounts of aid , loans and investments . " compared with china 's charm offensive where it seems genuinely knowledgeable , open and committed to solving international problems , the eu appears to be hopelessly undecided on where it stands on many issues and fails to translate its potential power into real clout , " said leclerq .
" the eu should n't try and undermine china 's growing influence or even contain it but try to build up a healthy balance of influence by making itself stronger and more focused . "
eu , china at odds over human rights human rights also remain a main point of dispute , especially as china still refuses to ratify the symbolically important convention on civil and political rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is some way behind the eu on human rights issues " the eu expects china to make real concessions .
the time of promises and minor cosmetic adaptations is over .

" china needs to react in a more moderate manner to criticism .
the cancellation of human rights talks with germany after angela merkel met with the dalai lama was not constructive .
china can only expect even more pressure if it does n't take steps .
sanctions are not out of the question . " professor dai bingran , an expert on european affairs at the university of fudan in china , says that the eu needs to have more patience with china over human rights issues and that the chinese people are on the road to democracy and freedom but admitted progress is slow . " issues like human rights , freedom , democracy , etc. are not in the traditional chinese culture , say in confucianism , but that does not mean we are against them , " bingran said .
" on the contrary , in the last few decades the situation has greatly improved .
it is true that the situation is not as good as in europe , or as they should be , but for such things to take place , it does need some time . " possible demonization of china in europe most experts agree that while there are solutions to all these challenges , the biggest danger is china becoming " demonized " within the eu and that , much like what is happening at the moment in the united states , a " grand coalition " of china-sceptics forms in europe and brings pressure on national parliaments and the eu to act . " what 's possible is that interest groups , such as environmentalists , human rights campaigners , textile producers , and those who criticize china within the eu start to find each other , " holslag said .
" this would lead to increased pressure to resort to sanctions on trade and other issues and would inhibit the eu 's ability to pursue a cautious china policy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel get closer on their china stance leclerq believes that a harder stance towards china has already begun at a high level .
" merkel and sarkozy have already taken up more hard-line positions with china than any of their predecessors , mainly because they have been pressured to do so by domestic factors , " she said . " germany in particular is taking a more critical tone , moving away from its role as a prominent defender of close commercial relations with china as it starts to see the chinese challenging its own advanced economic strongholds in electronics and car manufacturing . "
cooperation and partnerships the way forward the experts believe that the dragon can not be caged and that the eu should not even try .
a concerted effort to restrict and alienate china , even with the backing of the united states , would be impossible without harming international economic stability .
the general belief is that the only way for the eu to keep china in check is to act as a unified player in world politics and to make itself indispensable as an economic and political partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future is not necessarily bleak for the eu and china the omens are good for the eu in this respect .
with the united states becoming more unpredictable due to the upcoming presidential elections and its increasing china-phobia , the chinese consider the eu an important partner .
the eu 's position as an intermediate between the us and china therefore makes it well placed to engage with the chinese and could provide the eu with more influence . negotiations for a new eu-china partnership agreement in either 2008 or 2009 will be vital to maintain mutual confidence , but china 's reluctance to address key topics like political freedom , economic imbalances and liberalization , and the eu 's current inability to agree on a coherent china policy makes the coming eighteen months very important regarding the future of sino-european relations . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

analyst michael grömling said it 's because they all bought last year to beat the sales tax increase - and because they 're getting older . on average , germans saved 170 euros -lrb- $ 245 -rrb- a month in the first half of 2007 , resulting in a national total of 84 billion euros for the six-month period . the seasonally adjusted savings ratio of 10.9 percent represents an increase of 0.4 percent over last year , as reported monday by germany 's federal statistical office , just in time for international savings day on oct .
30 . dw-world.de spoke with business analyst michael grömling from the cologne institute for economic research to find out why germans seem to be putting more money aside these days . dw-world.de : mr. grömling , why are germans saving more ? michael grömling : they 're saving more in relation to disposable income .
it mainly has to do with the value-added tax , which was raised from 16 to 19 percent on jan .
1 , 2007 .
this led to increased consumption during the previous year in order -lsb- buy early -rsb- to avoid paying the higher tax .
to make these purchases , many citizens dug into their savings .
the savings that were depleted last year are , in part , being built up again this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many took advantage of the 16 percent sales tax in 2006 how significant is a 0.4 percent increase in the savings ratio ? it means several billion euros that are pulled out of the consumption circuit .
however , we 'll have to wait and see how the savings pattern develops in 2007 as a whole . it definitely has to do with the fact that consumption was high in the second half of 2006 and that , because of this , many did n't need to make purchases in the first half of 2007 .
for example , those who bought cars last year do n't have to buy another one this year .
as a whole , it 's not an alarming development . germans are known for being bigger savers than other europeans and certainly than the americans .
why is this ? it has to do with a series of programs we 've started in the past few years that encourage people to save more due to demographic developments .
the population in germany will become drastically smaller in the next few years and decades .
the social security system wo n't be able to support people later in life to the same extent so they have to put aside more money now . in comparison with the us , it 's also worth mentioning that the low savings ratio there is more problematic than the high savings rate in germany . according to the report from the federal statistical office , germans tend to save conservatively - in banks and bonds , for example .
what can this be attributed to ? it goes back to the stock market crash in 2000 , which continued until 2003 .
the fact that germans invest their money so conservatively also has to do with the german mentality . according to recent reports , unemployment is down and inflation is up in germany .
do these factors play a role in germans ' savings habits ? not at this time .
the relatively stable job market in comparison to previous years should be a reason for lower savings .

the social security system wo n't be able to support people later in life to the same extent so they have to put aside more money now . in comparison with the us , it 's also worth mentioning that the low savings ratio there is more problematic than the high savings rate in germany . according to the report from the federal statistical office , germans tend to save conservatively - in banks and bonds , for example .
what can this be attributed to ? it goes back to the stock market crash in 2000 , which continued until 2003 .
the fact that germans invest their money so conservatively also has to do with the german mentality . according to recent reports , unemployment is down and inflation is up in germany .
do these factors play a role in germans ' savings habits ? not at this time .
the relatively stable job market in comparison to previous years should be a reason for lower savings .
discussion about savings over the past few days do n't apply here , in my opinion .
the higher inflation rate may have an impact but we have to wait and see how long this phenomenon lasts . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 30.10.2007 germans are saving more , despite the economic upswing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german piggy banks are being well fed germans are putting aside more money this year , according to a recent report .
analyst michael grömling said it 's because they all bought last year to beat the sales tax increase - and because they 're getting older . on average , germans saved 170 euros -lrb- $ 245 -rrb- a month in the first half of 2007 , resulting in a national total of 84 billion euros for the six-month period . the seasonally adjusted savings ratio of 10.9 percent represents an increase of 0.4 percent over last year , as reported monday by germany 's federal statistical office , just in time for international savings day on oct .
30 . dw-world.de spoke with business analyst michael grömling from the cologne institute for economic research to find out why germans seem to be putting more money aside these days . dw-world.de : mr. grömling , why are germans saving more ? michael grömling : they 're saving more in relation to disposable income .
it mainly has to do with the value-added tax , which was raised from 16 to 19 percent on jan .
1 , 2007 .
this led to increased consumption during the previous year in order -lsb- buy early -rsb- to avoid paying the higher tax .
to make these purchases , many citizens dug into their savings .
the savings that were depleted last year are , in part , being built up again this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many took advantage of the 16 percent sales tax in 2006 how significant is a 0.4 percent increase in the savings ratio ? it means several billion euros that are pulled out of the consumption circuit .
however , we 'll have to wait and see how the savings pattern develops in 2007 as a whole . it definitely has to do with the fact that consumption was high in the second half of 2006 and that , because of this , many did n't need to make purchases in the first half of 2007 .
for example , those who bought cars last year do n't have to buy another one this year .
as a whole , it 's not an alarming development . germans are known for being bigger savers than other europeans and certainly than the americans .
why is this ? it has to do with a series of programs we 've started in the past few years that encourage people to save more due to demographic developments .
the population in germany will become drastically smaller in the next few years and decades .
the social security system wo n't be able to support people later in life to the same extent so they have to put aside more money now . in comparison with the us , it 's also worth mentioning that the low savings ratio there is more problematic than the high savings rate in germany . according to the report from the federal statistical office , germans tend to save conservatively - in banks and bonds , for example .
what can this be attributed to ? it goes back to the stock market crash in 2000 , which continued until 2003 .
the fact that germans invest their money so conservatively also has to do with the german mentality . according to recent reports , unemployment is down and inflation is up in germany .
do these factors play a role in germans ' savings habits ? not at this time .
the relatively stable job market in comparison to previous years should be a reason for lower savings .
discussion about savings over the past few days do n't apply here , in my opinion .
the higher inflation rate may have an impact but we have to wait and see how long this phenomenon lasts . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

analyst michael grömling said it 's because they all bought last year to beat the sales tax increase - and because they 're getting older . on average , germans saved 170 euros -lrb- $ 245 -rrb- a month in the first half of 2007 , resulting in a national total of 84 billion euros for the six-month period . the seasonally adjusted savings ratio of 10.9 percent represents an increase of 0.4 percent over last year , as reported monday by germany 's federal statistical office , just in time for international savings day on oct .
30 . dw-world.de spoke with business analyst michael grömling from the cologne institute for economic research to find out why germans seem to be putting more money aside these days . dw-world.de : mr. grömling , why are germans saving more ? michael grömling : they 're saving more in relation to disposable income .
it mainly has to do with the value-added tax , which was raised from 16 to 19 percent on jan .
1 , 2007 .
this led to increased consumption during the previous year in order -lsb- buy early -rsb- to avoid paying the higher tax .
to make these purchases , many citizens dug into their savings .
the savings that were depleted last year are , in part , being built up again this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many took advantage of the 16 percent sales tax in 2006 how significant is a 0.4 percent increase in the savings ratio ? it means several billion euros that are pulled out of the consumption circuit .
however , we 'll have to wait and see how the savings pattern develops in 2007 as a whole . it definitely has to do with the fact that consumption was high in the second half of 2006 and that , because of this , many did n't need to make purchases in the first half of 2007 .
for example , those who bought cars last year do n't have to buy another one this year .
as a whole , it 's not an alarming development . germans are known for being bigger savers than other europeans and certainly than the americans .
why is this ? it has to do with a series of programs we 've started in the past few years that encourage people to save more due to demographic developments .
the population in germany will become drastically smaller in the next few years and decades .
the social security system wo n't be able to support people later in life to the same extent so they have to put aside more money now . in comparison with the us , it 's also worth mentioning that the low savings ratio there is more problematic than the high savings rate in germany . according to the report from the federal statistical office , germans tend to save conservatively - in banks and bonds , for example .
what can this be attributed to ? it goes back to the stock market crash in 2000 , which continued until 2003 .
the fact that germans invest their money so conservatively also has to do with the german mentality . according to recent reports , unemployment is down and inflation is up in germany .
do these factors play a role in germans ' savings habits ? not at this time .
the relatively stable job market in comparison to previous years should be a reason for lower savings .
discussion about savings over the past few days do n't apply here , in my opinion .

the german chancellor also called on indian president pratibha patil and vice president hamid ansari . merkel to sign defense , sci-tech agreements bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is welcomed by india 's prime minister singh merkel , who is on her first visit to india as chancellor , was set to meet with singh for discussions on bilateral , regional and global issues later on tuesday before signing a number of bilateral agreements in the areas of defense cooperation , science and technology and intellectual property rights . the chancellor is accompanied on her visit by german education and research minister annette schavan and a 30-member delegation of top business leaders representing companies like european aircraft manufacturer airbus , conglomerate siemens , rail operator deutsche bahn and reinsurer munich re . trade and investment is a special focus area of merkel 's visit and the chancellor has already made it clear during her visit that indian investors would be sincerely welcomed in germany and has requested that india ease trade barriers for german business and investment . german companies vying for slice of large pie bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with education minister annette schavan -lrb- left -rrb- german firms are keen on a share of the 360 billion euros -lrb- $ 511 billion -rrb- that india plans to invest in infrastructure and other projects in the next five years .
besides infrastructure , sectors like science and technology , energy , research and development and information technology are the areas in which german firms are most interested . bilateral trade passed the 10 billion euro mark in 2006 , and germany is the seventh largest investor in india with a total inflow of $ 1.9 billion between 1991 and june 2007 . merkel will take her business roadshow to the economic center of mumbai on wednesday where she will attend a meeting of german and indian company leaders . airbus chief optimistic of eurofighter contract bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders was confident of selling eurofighters to india one member of the business delegation accompanying the chancellor is airbus chief thomas enders who announced on tuesday that he was optimistic about the chance to supply the indian air force with 120 eurofighters . " the eurofighter ranks among the most modern combat aircraft worldwide , " said the former ceo of the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- . india has budgeted $ 10.4 billion to buy 126 new medium multi-role combat aircraft for the air force starting in 2012 and the eurofighter consortium which builds the multi-role typhoon fighter jet is hoping to land the lucrative contract ahead of its us , russian , swedish and french rivals . enders also saw possibilities for contracts on civilian aircraft , especially medium-haul planes , with the surge in air traffic in india . " indian airlines are one of our most important customers in asia and worldwide , " said enders .
" we are in several negotiations with indian airlines . " airbus , however , is not just interested in selling airplanes in india , but is looking to develop pilot training centers , enders added .
estimates put the number of pilots needed by india at around 1000 a year . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

analyst michael grömling said it 's because they all bought last year to beat the sales tax increase - and because they 're getting older . on average , germans saved 170 euros -lrb- $ 245 -rrb- a month in the first half of 2007 , resulting in a national total of 84 billion euros for the six-month period . the seasonally adjusted savings ratio of 10.9 percent represents an increase of 0.4 percent over last year , as reported monday by germany 's federal statistical office , just in time for international savings day on oct .
30 . dw-world.de spoke with business analyst michael grömling from the cologne institute for economic research to find out why germans seem to be putting more money aside these days . dw-world.de : mr. grömling , why are germans saving more ? michael grömling : they 're saving more in relation to disposable income .
it mainly has to do with the value-added tax , which was raised from 16 to 19 percent on jan .
1 , 2007 .
this led to increased consumption during the previous year in order -lsb- buy early -rsb- to avoid paying the higher tax .
to make these purchases , many citizens dug into their savings .
the savings that were depleted last year are , in part , being built up again this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many took advantage of the 16 percent sales tax in 2006 how significant is a 0.4 percent increase in the savings ratio ? it means several billion euros that are pulled out of the consumption circuit .
however , we 'll have to wait and see how the savings pattern develops in 2007 as a whole . it definitely has to do with the fact that consumption was high in the second half of 2006 and that , because of this , many did n't need to make purchases in the first half of 2007 .
for example , those who bought cars last year do n't have to buy another one this year .
as a whole , it 's not an alarming development . germans are known for being bigger savers than other europeans and certainly than the americans .
why is this ? it has to do with a series of programs we 've started in the past few years that encourage people to save more due to demographic developments .
the population in germany will become drastically smaller in the next few years and decades .
the social security system wo n't be able to support people later in life to the same extent so they have to put aside more money now . in comparison with the us , it 's also worth mentioning that the low savings ratio there is more problematic than the high savings rate in germany . according to the report from the federal statistical office , germans tend to save conservatively - in banks and bonds , for example .
what can this be attributed to ? it goes back to the stock market crash in 2000 , which continued until 2003 .
the fact that germans invest their money so conservatively also has to do with the german mentality . according to recent reports , unemployment is down and inflation is up in germany .
do these factors play a role in germans ' savings habits ? not at this time .
the relatively stable job market in comparison to previous years should be a reason for lower savings .
discussion about savings over the past few days do n't apply here , in my opinion .
the higher inflation rate may have an impact but we have to wait and see how long this phenomenon lasts . interview : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the group was captured by militants 10 minutes after their arrival despite having a police escort . afghan police accused of complicity allegations that the police had been in contact with the kidnappers prior to the engineers ' arrival have been made by a number of the group taken that day . three days into their ordeal , rüdiger d. , who apparently struggled to keep up with the rest of the group , was shot dead by one of the kidnappers , who one of the freed afghan hostages later described as a pakistani . during their three months in captivity , the hostages were often moved around , never spending more than a few nights in one place .
despite being clothed in summer attire , the hostages were forced to walk across mountain ranges as temperatures plunged . according to the wardak province authorities , blechschmidt and the afghans with him were released in return for the release from prison of six taliban members in a deal struck by the german government . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

blechschmidt 's colleague was later found dead from gunshot wounds . ex-hostage sure captors were not criminal gang germany 's foreign ministry had previously announced that the captors were more likely to be a criminal group with sympathies to the taliban rather than hardcore islamists with an ideological motivation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blechschmidt pleaded for help on video during his ordeal the ministry refused to make detailed comments on blechschmidt 's reported statement but said through a spokesperson that the kidnapping case would continue to be assessed by the federal crisis squad responsible for the investigation . blechschmidt and his companions had gone to the central afghan province of maidan wardak to repair a wall at the band-i-sultan dam .
the group was captured by militants 10 minutes after their arrival despite having a police escort . afghan police accused of complicity allegations that the police had been in contact with the kidnappers prior to the engineers ' arrival have been made by a number of the group taken that day . three days into their ordeal , rüdiger d. , who apparently struggled to keep up with the rest of the group , was shot dead by one of the kidnappers , who one of the freed afghan hostages later described as a pakistani . during their three months in captivity , the hostages were often moved around , never spending more than a few nights in one place .
despite being clothed in summer attire , the hostages were forced to walk across mountain ranges as temperatures plunged . according to the wardak province authorities , blechschmidt and the afghans with him were released in return for the release from prison of six taliban members in a deal struck by the german government . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

whenever there is a controversial event which could be blamed on the idiot-box , the same question arises : how much influence does television have on our lives ?
violent shows are almost always cited in cases when kids run amok and teenage promiscuity is often blamed on too much sex on tv .
it was only a matter of time before the ingenuity shown by a certain set of television criminals became the inspiration for a daring , real-life prison break .
while those involved in the incident at the juvenile detention center in neustadt , northwest germany , were not being framed for the murder of the vice president 's brother as some part of an elaborate political conspiracy , it did take an ingenious effort of tv-land proportions to break one 19-year old inmate out of her cell .
resourceful girls escape under guards ' noses taking a lot less time than 22 episodes to get to the actual escape , the escapee 's 18-year-old accomplice , another inmate who was released last friday , managed to get the fleeing jailbird out of the detention center and away under the very noses of the prison guards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " just stay calm , we 're nearly home and free " the guards , none of whom may have been too bright , failed to follow up suspicions after the released girl left the correctional facility with a suitcase which the officials found to be " particularly heavy . "
the girl was allowed to leave the center with the suitcase , which contained her prison break co-star , without the luggage being searched .
in addition to that embarrassing oversight , the fact that the other young woman was missing was only noticed several hours later during the routine evening check of cells at the center .
the two young women are still at large while the prison officers have presumably gone back to watching the weakest link . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

analyst michael grömling said it 's because they all bought last year to beat the sales tax increase - and because they 're getting older . on average , germans saved 170 euros -lrb- $ 245 -rrb- a month in the first half of 2007 , resulting in a national total of 84 billion euros for the six-month period . the seasonally adjusted savings ratio of 10.9 percent represents an increase of 0.4 percent over last year , as reported monday by germany 's federal statistical office , just in time for international savings day on oct .
30 . dw-world.de spoke with business analyst michael grömling from the cologne institute for economic research to find out why germans seem to be putting more money aside these days . dw-world.de : mr. grömling , why are germans saving more ? michael grömling : they 're saving more in relation to disposable income .
it mainly has to do with the value-added tax , which was raised from 16 to 19 percent on jan .
1 , 2007 .
this led to increased consumption during the previous year in order -lsb- buy early -rsb- to avoid paying the higher tax .
to make these purchases , many citizens dug into their savings .
the savings that were depleted last year are , in part , being built up again this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many took advantage of the 16 percent sales tax in 2006 how significant is a 0.4 percent increase in the savings ratio ? it means several billion euros that are pulled out of the consumption circuit .
however , we 'll have to wait and see how the savings pattern develops in 2007 as a whole . it definitely has to do with the fact that consumption was high in the second half of 2006 and that , because of this , many did n't need to make purchases in the first half of 2007 .
for example , those who bought cars last year do n't have to buy another one this year .
as a whole , it 's not an alarming development . germans are known for being bigger savers than other europeans and certainly than the americans .
why is this ? it has to do with a series of programs we 've started in the past few years that encourage people to save more due to demographic developments .
the population in germany will become drastically smaller in the next few years and decades .
the social security system wo n't be able to support people later in life to the same extent so they have to put aside more money now . in comparison with the us , it 's also worth mentioning that the low savings ratio there is more problematic than the high savings rate in germany . according to the report from the federal statistical office , germans tend to save conservatively - in banks and bonds , for example .
what can this be attributed to ? it goes back to the stock market crash in 2000 , which continued until 2003 .
the fact that germans invest their money so conservatively also has to do with the german mentality . according to recent reports , unemployment is down and inflation is up in germany .
do these factors play a role in germans ' savings habits ? not at this time .
the relatively stable job market in comparison to previous years should be a reason for lower savings .

after decades of patient waiting for promised reforms and opening up , europe now sees the resurgence of a giant that is less eager to conform to its expectations . thirty years ago , deng xiaoping said that it would take 100 years for china to become a democracy .
while another 70 years of waiting would be frustrating in itself , things have been made worse by current president hu jintao 's assertion that the century of political transition has yet to begin . it is this sluggish liberalization which is frustrating the new generation of european leaders , especially german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy who both want china to speed up social and political reforms .
but this slow progress is only one item in a catalogue of differences which have been increasingly straining eu-china ties . over the past few months , the sino-european relationship has been rocked by allegations of internet espionage and cyber-warfare by china ; fractious trade relations over everything from steel to children 's toys , rising suspicion over the people 's republic 's economic ambitions and strong language on its human rights and environmental record . while many of these areas of conflict have recently highlighted the growing eu-china divide , experts on sino-european ties pinpoint three main challenges to the stability of the relationship . china expanding into areas of european interest jonathan holslag , the head of research at the brussels institute for contemporary china studies -lrb- biccs -rrb- , believes the biggest challenge to the relationship is china 's tenacious economic protectionism . " this protectionism is the eu 's key concern , particularly in the financial sector , " holslag told dw-world.de.
" china 's export promotion strategy is also a worry , given that the chinese government is developing a new generation of advanced national champions backed by excessive subsidies , tax breaks , and most importantly , a cheap currency .
there is also little reinforcing of basic product safety standards or international property rights -lrb- ipr -rrb- rules . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson has had run-ins with china holslag also believes that china 's economic boom is reaching niches in which europe once had a strong lead .
the eu 's advantage in many economic areas is being eroded by a state with more than $ 1.4 trillion -lrb- 0.97 trillion euros -rrb- of foreign exchange reserves in its pocket .
china 's enormous economic power could reduce the european bloc 's competitiveness . " the fact that china has developed into a competitor is mainly due to the fact that the eu itself is not able to step up its economic modernization and its political coherence , " holslag added .
" the worst reaction from the europeans would be to step up its own protectionism .
such a strategy would be harmful to europe 's own long-term interests .
the only way of dealing with china is for the eu to do things better . " european indecisiveness undermining diplomatic efforts according to carmel leclerq , an expert on eu-asia relations at the brussels-based sino-european forum , china is also slowly reducing the european union 's influence in many areas of global diplomacy .
china has abandoned its once timid diplomatic posture and is growing more assertive .

" compared with china 's charm offensive where it seems genuinely knowledgeable , open and committed to solving international problems , the eu appears to be hopelessly undecided on where it stands on many issues and fails to translate its potential power into real clout , " said leclerq .
" the eu should n't try and undermine china 's growing influence or even contain it but try to build up a healthy balance of influence by making itself stronger and more focused . "

" professor dai bingran , an expert on european affairs at the university of fudan in china , says that the eu needs to have more patience with china over human rights issues and that the chinese people are on the road to democracy and freedom but admitted progress is slow . " issues like human rights , freedom , democracy , etc. are not in the traditional chinese culture , say in confucianism , but that does not mean we are against them , " bingran said .

it is true that the situation is not as good as in europe , or as they should be , but for such things to take place , it does need some time . " possible demonization of china in europe most experts agree that while there are solutions to all these challenges , the biggest danger is china becoming " demonized " within the eu and that , much like what is happening at the moment in the united states , a " grand coalition " of china-sceptics forms in europe and brings pressure on national parliaments and the eu to act . " what 's possible is that interest groups , such as environmentalists , human rights campaigners , textile producers , and those who criticize china within the eu start to find each other , " holslag said .

"
cooperation and partnerships the way forward the experts believe that the dragon can not be caged and that the eu should not even try .
a concerted effort to restrict and alienate china , even with the backing of the united states , would be impossible without harming international economic stability .

after decades of patient waiting for promised reforms and opening up , europe now sees the resurgence of a giant that is less eager to conform to its expectations . thirty years ago , deng xiaoping said that it would take 100 years for china to become a democracy .
while another 70 years of waiting would be frustrating in itself , things have been made worse by current president hu jintao 's assertion that the century of political transition has yet to begin . it is this sluggish liberalization which is frustrating the new generation of european leaders , especially german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy who both want china to speed up social and political reforms .
but this slow progress is only one item in a catalogue of differences which have been increasingly straining eu-china ties . over the past few months , the sino-european relationship has been rocked by allegations of internet espionage and cyber-warfare by china ; fractious trade relations over everything from steel to children 's toys , rising suspicion over the people 's republic 's economic ambitions and strong language on its human rights and environmental record . while many of these areas of conflict have recently highlighted the growing eu-china divide , experts on sino-european ties pinpoint three main challenges to the stability of the relationship . china expanding into areas of european interest jonathan holslag , the head of research at the brussels institute for contemporary china studies -lrb- biccs -rrb- , believes the biggest challenge to the relationship is china 's tenacious economic protectionism . " this protectionism is the eu 's key concern , particularly in the financial sector , " holslag told dw-world.de.
" china 's export promotion strategy is also a worry , given that the chinese government is developing a new generation of advanced national champions backed by excessive subsidies , tax breaks , and most importantly , a cheap currency .
there is also little reinforcing of basic product safety standards or international property rights -lrb- ipr -rrb- rules . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson has had run-ins with china holslag also believes that china 's economic boom is reaching niches in which europe once had a strong lead .
the eu 's advantage in many economic areas is being eroded by a state with more than $ 1.4 trillion -lrb- 0.97 trillion euros -rrb- of foreign exchange reserves in its pocket .
china 's enormous economic power could reduce the european bloc 's competitiveness . " the fact that china has developed into a competitor is mainly due to the fact that the eu itself is not able to step up its economic modernization and its political coherence , " holslag added .
" the worst reaction from the europeans would be to step up its own protectionism .
such a strategy would be harmful to europe 's own long-term interests .
the only way of dealing with china is for the eu to do things better . " european indecisiveness undermining diplomatic efforts according to carmel leclerq , an expert on eu-asia relations at the brussels-based sino-european forum , china is also slowly reducing the european union 's influence in many areas of global diplomacy .
china has abandoned its once timid diplomatic posture and is growing more assertive .
a zealous and well-coordinated foreign economic policy is beginning to undermine european interests in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has reached out to africa and has been accepted china 's tackling of problems which the eu has decided to stay out of , such as north korea and sudan , the people 's republic is sidelining the eu and weakening its influence , particularly in africa , were it is conducting an economic development policy based on large amounts of aid , loans and investments . " compared with china 's charm offensive where it seems genuinely knowledgeable , open and committed to solving international problems , the eu appears to be hopelessly undecided on where it stands on many issues and fails to translate its potential power into real clout , " said leclerq .
" the eu should n't try and undermine china 's growing influence or even contain it but try to build up a healthy balance of influence by making itself stronger and more focused . "
eu , china at odds over human rights human rights also remain a main point of dispute , especially as china still refuses to ratify the symbolically important convention on civil and political rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is some way behind the eu on human rights issues " the eu expects china to make real concessions .
the time of promises and minor cosmetic adaptations is over .
beijing has to start to improve civilian rights in line with international accords , " said jonas tiel from the european asian watch foundation .
" china needs to react in a more moderate manner to criticism .
the cancellation of human rights talks with germany after angela merkel met with the dalai lama was not constructive .
china can only expect even more pressure if it does n't take steps .
sanctions are not out of the question . " professor dai bingran , an expert on european affairs at the university of fudan in china , says that the eu needs to have more patience with china over human rights issues and that the chinese people are on the road to democracy and freedom but admitted progress is slow . " issues like human rights , freedom , democracy , etc. are not in the traditional chinese culture , say in confucianism , but that does not mean we are against them , " bingran said .
" on the contrary , in the last few decades the situation has greatly improved .
it is true that the situation is not as good as in europe , or as they should be , but for such things to take place , it does need some time . " possible demonization of china in europe most experts agree that while there are solutions to all these challenges , the biggest danger is china becoming " demonized " within the eu and that , much like what is happening at the moment in the united states , a " grand coalition " of china-sceptics forms in europe and brings pressure on national parliaments and the eu to act . " what 's possible is that interest groups , such as environmentalists , human rights campaigners , textile producers , and those who criticize china within the eu start to find each other , " holslag said .
" this would lead to increased pressure to resort to sanctions on trade and other issues and would inhibit the eu 's ability to pursue a cautious china policy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel get closer on their china stance leclerq believes that a harder stance towards china has already begun at a high level .
" merkel and sarkozy have already taken up more hard-line positions with china than any of their predecessors , mainly because they have been pressured to do so by domestic factors , " she said . " germany in particular is taking a more critical tone , moving away from its role as a prominent defender of close commercial relations with china as it starts to see the chinese challenging its own advanced economic strongholds in electronics and car manufacturing . "
cooperation and partnerships the way forward the experts believe that the dragon can not be caged and that the eu should not even try .
a concerted effort to restrict and alienate china , even with the backing of the united states , would be impossible without harming international economic stability .
the general belief is that the only way for the eu to keep china in check is to act as a unified player in world politics and to make itself indispensable as an economic and political partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future is not necessarily bleak for the eu and china the omens are good for the eu in this respect .
with the united states becoming more unpredictable due to the upcoming presidential elections and its increasing china-phobia , the chinese consider the eu an important partner .
the eu 's position as an intermediate between the us and china therefore makes it well placed to engage with the chinese and could provide the eu with more influence . negotiations for a new eu-china partnership agreement in either 2008 or 2009 will be vital to maintain mutual confidence , but china 's reluctance to address key topics like political freedom , economic imbalances and liberalization , and the eu 's current inability to agree on a coherent china policy makes the coming eighteen months very important regarding the future of sino-european relations . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

whenever there is a controversial event which could be blamed on the idiot-box , the same question arises : how much influence does television have on our lives ?
violent shows are almost always cited in cases when kids run amok and teenage promiscuity is often blamed on too much sex on tv .
it was only a matter of time before the ingenuity shown by a certain set of television criminals became the inspiration for a daring , real-life prison break .
while those involved in the incident at the juvenile detention center in neustadt , northwest germany , were not being framed for the murder of the vice president 's brother as some part of an elaborate political conspiracy , it did take an ingenious effort of tv-land proportions to break one 19-year old inmate out of her cell .
resourceful girls escape under guards ' noses taking a lot less time than 22 episodes to get to the actual escape , the escapee 's 18-year-old accomplice , another inmate who was released last friday , managed to get the fleeing jailbird out of the detention center and away under the very noses of the prison guards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " just stay calm , we 're nearly home and free " the guards , none of whom may have been too bright , failed to follow up suspicions after the released girl left the correctional facility with a suitcase which the officials found to be " particularly heavy . "
the girl was allowed to leave the center with the suitcase , which contained her prison break co-star , without the luggage being searched .
in addition to that embarrassing oversight , the fact that the other young woman was missing was only noticed several hours later during the routine evening check of cells at the center .
the two young women are still at large while the prison officers have presumably gone back to watching the weakest link . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

analyst michael grömling said it 's because they all bought last year to beat the sales tax increase - and because they 're getting older . on average , germans saved 170 euros -lrb- $ 245 -rrb- a month in the first half of 2007 , resulting in a national total of 84 billion euros for the six-month period . the seasonally adjusted savings ratio of 10.9 percent represents an increase of 0.4 percent over last year , as reported monday by germany 's federal statistical office , just in time for international savings day on oct .
30 . dw-world.de spoke with business analyst michael grömling from the cologne institute for economic research to find out why germans seem to be putting more money aside these days . dw-world.de : mr. grömling , why are germans saving more ? michael grömling : they 're saving more in relation to disposable income .
it mainly has to do with the value-added tax , which was raised from 16 to 19 percent on jan .
1 , 2007 .
this led to increased consumption during the previous year in order -lsb- buy early -rsb- to avoid paying the higher tax .

however , we 'll have to wait and see how the savings pattern develops in 2007 as a whole . it definitely has to do with the fact that consumption was high in the second half of 2006 and that , because of this , many did n't need to make purchases in the first half of 2007 .
for example , those who bought cars last year do n't have to buy another one this year .
as a whole , it 's not an alarming development . germans are known for being bigger savers than other europeans and certainly than the americans .
why is this ? it has to do with a series of programs we 've started in the past few years that encourage people to save more due to demographic developments .
the population in germany will become drastically smaller in the next few years and decades .
the social security system wo n't be able to support people later in life to the same extent so they have to put aside more money now . in comparison with the us , it 's also worth mentioning that the low savings ratio there is more problematic than the high savings rate in germany . according to the report from the federal statistical office , germans tend to save conservatively - in banks and bonds , for example .
what can this be attributed to ? it goes back to the stock market crash in 2000 , which continued until 2003 .
the fact that germans invest their money so conservatively also has to do with the german mentality . according to recent reports , unemployment is down and inflation is up in germany .
do these factors play a role in germans ' savings habits ? not at this time .
the relatively stable job market in comparison to previous years should be a reason for lower savings .

the group was captured by militants 10 minutes after their arrival despite having a police escort . afghan police accused of complicity allegations that the police had been in contact with the kidnappers prior to the engineers ' arrival have been made by a number of the group taken that day . three days into their ordeal , rüdiger d. , who apparently struggled to keep up with the rest of the group , was shot dead by one of the kidnappers , who one of the freed afghan hostages later described as a pakistani . during their three months in captivity , the hostages were often moved around , never spending more than a few nights in one place .
despite being clothed in summer attire , the hostages were forced to walk across mountain ranges as temperatures plunged . according to the wardak province authorities , blechschmidt and the afghans with him were released in return for the release from prison of six taliban members in a deal struck by the german government . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

30 , they had charged six french nationals , who were employees of an aid agency , with attempted kidnapping . an mob of several dozen people gathered outside the court house in abeche , calling the europeans " thieves , killers " , and accusing former colonial power france of being an " accomplice . " citizens of spain and belgium have also been charged as accomplices , the associated press reported .
they could face decades in prison , including hard labor , if found guilty . french foreign ministry spokeswoman pascale andreani said tuesday that france was sending a doctor and legal adviser to meet with the group 's detained members . the six were employees of a french aid group called l 'arche de zoe , or zoe 's arc , and were arrested thursday as they were preparing to leave with the children from abeche , an eastern city near chad 's border with sudan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the aid workers held in custody in abeche , chad the aid workers have insisted that they were told the children were orphans from sudan 's war-torn western region of darfur , which borders chad . the workers said they were taking the children out of the country to france to receive medical treatment . however , an investigation , partly involving united nations workers , revealed that none of the children was injured .
investigators also found that many of the children may not have been orphans . zoe 's arc said it had arranged for french host families to care for the children , but the organization denied charges that the children were to be given up for adoption .
according to the afp news agency , some of the families each paid between 2,800 euros and 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 4,000 and $ 8,600 -rrb- , supposedly for the evacuation costs of the children . french police have reportedly been investigating the activities of zoe 's arc since july . other nationals charged chadian authorities in the eastern city abeche have also charged three french journalists , who were accompanying the aid workers , with complicity in the case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chadian president idriss deby at the orphanage in abeche a further seven - of the spanish flight crew from the aircraft that was to fly the children to france - as well as the belgian pilot have been charged as accomplices , radio france internationale -lrb- rfi -rrb- reported . rfi said it was unclear whether two chadian nationals arrested with the 16 europeans had also been charged with complicity . chad 's interior minister ahmat bachir said the accused would be flown to the capital n 'djamena this week . eu forces in darfur-chad region not at risk meanwhile , the french government has said a multinational european union force in the darfur-chad border region would not be jeopardized . " this affair has absolutely nothing to do with the deployment of the multinational force , " french junior minister for human rights , rama yade , told europe 1 radio , according to the dpa news agency . over the weekend , french president nicolas sarkozy said zoe 's arc 's actions were " illegal and unacceptable . "
he also said he had spoken with chadian president idriss deby . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yade called the attempted transport " illegal and morally irresponsible " deby himself has described the actions of the aid workers as " simple kidnapping . "
he also accused the french organization of wanting to " sell -lrb- the children -rrb- to pedophile organizations in europe , and even perhaps to kill them and sell their organs , " according to dpa . however , deby also reportedly told sarkozy that the affair would not affect the deployment of 3,000 european troops , half of whom are french , scheduled to arrive in eastern chad and the northern region of the central african republic in november .
the soldiers are to help safeguard camps holding refugees fleeing darfur . more than four years of conflict there have left more than 200,000 people and 2.5 million people displaced . the 103 children who were on their way to france are currently in an orphanage in abeche , where they are being cared for by local aid workers and unicef staff . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

30 , they had charged six french nationals , who were employees of an aid agency , with attempted kidnapping . an mob of several dozen people gathered outside the court house in abeche , calling the europeans " thieves , killers " , and accusing former colonial power france of being an " accomplice . " citizens of spain and belgium have also been charged as accomplices , the associated press reported .
they could face decades in prison , including hard labor , if found guilty . french foreign ministry spokeswoman pascale andreani said tuesday that france was sending a doctor and legal adviser to meet with the group 's detained members . the six were employees of a french aid group called l 'arche de zoe , or zoe 's arc , and were arrested thursday as they were preparing to leave with the children from abeche , an eastern city near chad 's border with sudan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the aid workers held in custody in abeche , chad the aid workers have insisted that they were told the children were orphans from sudan 's war-torn western region of darfur , which borders chad . the workers said they were taking the children out of the country to france to receive medical treatment . however , an investigation , partly involving united nations workers , revealed that none of the children was injured .
investigators also found that many of the children may not have been orphans . zoe 's arc said it had arranged for french host families to care for the children , but the organization denied charges that the children were to be given up for adoption .
according to the afp news agency , some of the families each paid between 2,800 euros and 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 4,000 and $ 8,600 -rrb- , supposedly for the evacuation costs of the children . french police have reportedly been investigating the activities of zoe 's arc since july . other nationals charged chadian authorities in the eastern city abeche have also charged three french journalists , who were accompanying the aid workers , with complicity in the case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chadian president idriss deby at the orphanage in abeche a further seven - of the spanish flight crew from the aircraft that was to fly the children to france - as well as the belgian pilot have been charged as accomplices , radio france internationale -lrb- rfi -rrb- reported . rfi said it was unclear whether two chadian nationals arrested with the 16 europeans had also been charged with complicity . chad 's interior minister ahmat bachir said the accused would be flown to the capital n 'djamena this week . eu forces in darfur-chad region not at risk meanwhile , the french government has said a multinational european union force in the darfur-chad border region would not be jeopardized . " this affair has absolutely nothing to do with the deployment of the multinational force , " french junior minister for human rights , rama yade , told europe 1 radio , according to the dpa news agency . over the weekend , french president nicolas sarkozy said zoe 's arc 's actions were " illegal and unacceptable . "
he also said he had spoken with chadian president idriss deby . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yade called the attempted transport " illegal and morally irresponsible " deby himself has described the actions of the aid workers as " simple kidnapping . "
he also accused the french organization of wanting to " sell -lrb- the children -rrb- to pedophile organizations in europe , and even perhaps to kill them and sell their organs , " according to dpa . however , deby also reportedly told sarkozy that the affair would not affect the deployment of 3,000 european troops , half of whom are french , scheduled to arrive in eastern chad and the northern region of the central african republic in november .
the soldiers are to help safeguard camps holding refugees fleeing darfur . more than four years of conflict there have left more than 200,000 people and 2.5 million people displaced . the 103 children who were on their way to france are currently in an orphanage in abeche , where they are being cared for by local aid workers and unicef staff . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" indian airlines are one of our most important customers in asia and worldwide , " said enders .
" we are in several negotiations with indian airlines . " airbus , however , is not just interested in selling airplanes in india , but is looking to develop pilot training centers , enders added .

analyst michael grömling said it 's because they all bought last year to beat the sales tax increase - and because they 're getting older . on average , germans saved 170 euros -lrb- $ 245 -rrb- a month in the first half of 2007 , resulting in a national total of 84 billion euros for the six-month period . the seasonally adjusted savings ratio of 10.9 percent represents an increase of 0.4 percent over last year , as reported monday by germany 's federal statistical office , just in time for international savings day on oct .
30 . dw-world.de spoke with business analyst michael grömling from the cologne institute for economic research to find out why germans seem to be putting more money aside these days . dw-world.de : mr. grömling , why are germans saving more ? michael grömling : they 're saving more in relation to disposable income .
it mainly has to do with the value-added tax , which was raised from 16 to 19 percent on jan .
1 , 2007 .
this led to increased consumption during the previous year in order -lsb- buy early -rsb- to avoid paying the higher tax .
to make these purchases , many citizens dug into their savings .
the savings that were depleted last year are , in part , being built up again this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many took advantage of the 16 percent sales tax in 2006 how significant is a 0.4 percent increase in the savings ratio ? it means several billion euros that are pulled out of the consumption circuit .
however , we 'll have to wait and see how the savings pattern develops in 2007 as a whole . it definitely has to do with the fact that consumption was high in the second half of 2006 and that , because of this , many did n't need to make purchases in the first half of 2007 .
for example , those who bought cars last year do n't have to buy another one this year .
as a whole , it 's not an alarming development . germans are known for being bigger savers than other europeans and certainly than the americans .
why is this ? it has to do with a series of programs we 've started in the past few years that encourage people to save more due to demographic developments .
the population in germany will become drastically smaller in the next few years and decades .
the social security system wo n't be able to support people later in life to the same extent so they have to put aside more money now . in comparison with the us , it 's also worth mentioning that the low savings ratio there is more problematic than the high savings rate in germany . according to the report from the federal statistical office , germans tend to save conservatively - in banks and bonds , for example .
what can this be attributed to ? it goes back to the stock market crash in 2000 , which continued until 2003 .
the fact that germans invest their money so conservatively also has to do with the german mentality . according to recent reports , unemployment is down and inflation is up in germany .
do these factors play a role in germans ' savings habits ? not at this time .
the relatively stable job market in comparison to previous years should be a reason for lower savings .

blechschmidt 's colleague was later found dead from gunshot wounds . ex-hostage sure captors were not criminal gang germany 's foreign ministry had previously announced that the captors were more likely to be a criminal group with sympathies to the taliban rather than hardcore islamists with an ideological motivation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blechschmidt pleaded for help on video during his ordeal the ministry refused to make detailed comments on blechschmidt 's reported statement but said through a spokesperson that the kidnapping case would continue to be assessed by the federal crisis squad responsible for the investigation . blechschmidt and his companions had gone to the central afghan province of maidan wardak to repair a wall at the band-i-sultan dam .
the group was captured by militants 10 minutes after their arrival despite having a police escort . afghan police accused of complicity allegations that the police had been in contact with the kidnappers prior to the engineers ' arrival have been made by a number of the group taken that day . three days into their ordeal , rüdiger d. , who apparently struggled to keep up with the rest of the group , was shot dead by one of the kidnappers , who one of the freed afghan hostages later described as a pakistani . during their three months in captivity , the hostages were often moved around , never spending more than a few nights in one place .
despite being clothed in summer attire , the hostages were forced to walk across mountain ranges as temperatures plunged . according to the wardak province authorities , blechschmidt and the afghans with him were released in return for the release from prison of six taliban members in a deal struck by the german government . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after decades of patient waiting for promised reforms and opening up , europe now sees the resurgence of a giant that is less eager to conform to its expectations . thirty years ago , deng xiaoping said that it would take 100 years for china to become a democracy .
while another 70 years of waiting would be frustrating in itself , things have been made worse by current president hu jintao 's assertion that the century of political transition has yet to begin . it is this sluggish liberalization which is frustrating the new generation of european leaders , especially german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy who both want china to speed up social and political reforms .
but this slow progress is only one item in a catalogue of differences which have been increasingly straining eu-china ties . over the past few months , the sino-european relationship has been rocked by allegations of internet espionage and cyber-warfare by china ; fractious trade relations over everything from steel to children 's toys , rising suspicion over the people 's republic 's economic ambitions and strong language on its human rights and environmental record . while many of these areas of conflict have recently highlighted the growing eu-china divide , experts on sino-european ties pinpoint three main challenges to the stability of the relationship . china expanding into areas of european interest jonathan holslag , the head of research at the brussels institute for contemporary china studies -lrb- biccs -rrb- , believes the biggest challenge to the relationship is china 's tenacious economic protectionism . " this protectionism is the eu 's key concern , particularly in the financial sector , " holslag told dw-world.de.
" china 's export promotion strategy is also a worry , given that the chinese government is developing a new generation of advanced national champions backed by excessive subsidies , tax breaks , and most importantly , a cheap currency .
there is also little reinforcing of basic product safety standards or international property rights -lrb- ipr -rrb- rules . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson has had run-ins with china holslag also believes that china 's economic boom is reaching niches in which europe once had a strong lead .
the eu 's advantage in many economic areas is being eroded by a state with more than $ 1.4 trillion -lrb- 0.97 trillion euros -rrb- of foreign exchange reserves in its pocket .
china 's enormous economic power could reduce the european bloc 's competitiveness . " the fact that china has developed into a competitor is mainly due to the fact that the eu itself is not able to step up its economic modernization and its political coherence , " holslag added .
" the worst reaction from the europeans would be to step up its own protectionism .
such a strategy would be harmful to europe 's own long-term interests .
the only way of dealing with china is for the eu to do things better . " european indecisiveness undermining diplomatic efforts according to carmel leclerq , an expert on eu-asia relations at the brussels-based sino-european forum , china is also slowly reducing the european union 's influence in many areas of global diplomacy .
china has abandoned its once timid diplomatic posture and is growing more assertive .
a zealous and well-coordinated foreign economic policy is beginning to undermine european interests in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has reached out to africa and has been accepted china 's tackling of problems which the eu has decided to stay out of , such as north korea and sudan , the people 's republic is sidelining the eu and weakening its influence , particularly in africa , were it is conducting an economic development policy based on large amounts of aid , loans and investments . " compared with china 's charm offensive where it seems genuinely knowledgeable , open and committed to solving international problems , the eu appears to be hopelessly undecided on where it stands on many issues and fails to translate its potential power into real clout , " said leclerq .
" the eu should n't try and undermine china 's growing influence or even contain it but try to build up a healthy balance of influence by making itself stronger and more focused . "
eu , china at odds over human rights human rights also remain a main point of dispute , especially as china still refuses to ratify the symbolically important convention on civil and political rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is some way behind the eu on human rights issues " the eu expects china to make real concessions .
the time of promises and minor cosmetic adaptations is over .
beijing has to start to improve civilian rights in line with international accords , " said jonas tiel from the european asian watch foundation .
" china needs to react in a more moderate manner to criticism .
the cancellation of human rights talks with germany after angela merkel met with the dalai lama was not constructive .
china can only expect even more pressure if it does n't take steps .
sanctions are not out of the question . " professor dai bingran , an expert on european affairs at the university of fudan in china , says that the eu needs to have more patience with china over human rights issues and that the chinese people are on the road to democracy and freedom but admitted progress is slow . " issues like human rights , freedom , democracy , etc. are not in the traditional chinese culture , say in confucianism , but that does not mean we are against them , " bingran said .
" on the contrary , in the last few decades the situation has greatly improved .
it is true that the situation is not as good as in europe , or as they should be , but for such things to take place , it does need some time . " possible demonization of china in europe most experts agree that while there are solutions to all these challenges , the biggest danger is china becoming " demonized " within the eu and that , much like what is happening at the moment in the united states , a " grand coalition " of china-sceptics forms in europe and brings pressure on national parliaments and the eu to act . " what 's possible is that interest groups , such as environmentalists , human rights campaigners , textile producers , and those who criticize china within the eu start to find each other , " holslag said .
" this would lead to increased pressure to resort to sanctions on trade and other issues and would inhibit the eu 's ability to pursue a cautious china policy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel get closer on their china stance leclerq believes that a harder stance towards china has already begun at a high level .
" merkel and sarkozy have already taken up more hard-line positions with china than any of their predecessors , mainly because they have been pressured to do so by domestic factors , " she said . " germany in particular is taking a more critical tone , moving away from its role as a prominent defender of close commercial relations with china as it starts to see the chinese challenging its own advanced economic strongholds in electronics and car manufacturing . "
cooperation and partnerships the way forward the experts believe that the dragon can not be caged and that the eu should not even try .
a concerted effort to restrict and alienate china , even with the backing of the united states , would be impossible without harming international economic stability .
the general belief is that the only way for the eu to keep china in check is to act as a unified player in world politics and to make itself indispensable as an economic and political partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future is not necessarily bleak for the eu and china the omens are good for the eu in this respect .
with the united states becoming more unpredictable due to the upcoming presidential elections and its increasing china-phobia , the chinese consider the eu an important partner .
the eu 's position as an intermediate between the us and china therefore makes it well placed to engage with the chinese and could provide the eu with more influence . negotiations for a new eu-china partnership agreement in either 2008 or 2009 will be vital to maintain mutual confidence , but china 's reluctance to address key topics like political freedom , economic imbalances and liberalization , and the eu 's current inability to agree on a coherent china policy makes the coming eighteen months very important regarding the future of sino-european relations . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a zealous and well-coordinated foreign economic policy is beginning to undermine european interests in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has reached out to africa and has been accepted china 's tackling of problems which the eu has decided to stay out of , such as north korea and sudan , the people 's republic is sidelining the eu and weakening its influence , particularly in africa , were it is conducting an economic development policy based on large amounts of aid , loans and investments . " compared with china 's charm offensive where it seems genuinely knowledgeable , open and committed to solving international problems , the eu appears to be hopelessly undecided on where it stands on many issues and fails to translate its potential power into real clout , " said leclerq .
" the eu should n't try and undermine china 's growing influence or even contain it but try to build up a healthy balance of influence by making itself stronger and more focused . "
eu , china at odds over human rights human rights also remain a main point of dispute , especially as china still refuses to ratify the symbolically important convention on civil and political rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is some way behind the eu on human rights issues " the eu expects china to make real concessions .
the time of promises and minor cosmetic adaptations is over .
beijing has to start to improve civilian rights in line with international accords , " said jonas tiel from the european asian watch foundation .
" china needs to react in a more moderate manner to criticism .
the cancellation of human rights talks with germany after angela merkel met with the dalai lama was not constructive .
china can only expect even more pressure if it does n't take steps .
sanctions are not out of the question . " professor dai bingran , an expert on european affairs at the university of fudan in china , says that the eu needs to have more patience with china over human rights issues and that the chinese people are on the road to democracy and freedom but admitted progress is slow . " issues like human rights , freedom , democracy , etc. are not in the traditional chinese culture , say in confucianism , but that does not mean we are against them , " bingran said .
" on the contrary , in the last few decades the situation has greatly improved .
it is true that the situation is not as good as in europe , or as they should be , but for such things to take place , it does need some time . " possible demonization of china in europe most experts agree that while there are solutions to all these challenges , the biggest danger is china becoming " demonized " within the eu and that , much like what is happening at the moment in the united states , a " grand coalition " of china-sceptics forms in europe and brings pressure on national parliaments and the eu to act . " what 's possible is that interest groups , such as environmentalists , human rights campaigners , textile producers , and those who criticize china within the eu start to find each other , " holslag said .
" this would lead to increased pressure to resort to sanctions on trade and other issues and would inhibit the eu 's ability to pursue a cautious china policy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel get closer on their china stance leclerq believes that a harder stance towards china has already begun at a high level .
" merkel and sarkozy have already taken up more hard-line positions with china than any of their predecessors , mainly because they have been pressured to do so by domestic factors , " she said . " germany in particular is taking a more critical tone , moving away from its role as a prominent defender of close commercial relations with china as it starts to see the chinese challenging its own advanced economic strongholds in electronics and car manufacturing . "
cooperation and partnerships the way forward the experts believe that the dragon can not be caged and that the eu should not even try .
a concerted effort to restrict and alienate china , even with the backing of the united states , would be impossible without harming international economic stability .
the general belief is that the only way for the eu to keep china in check is to act as a unified player in world politics and to make itself indispensable as an economic and political partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future is not necessarily bleak for the eu and china the omens are good for the eu in this respect .
with the united states becoming more unpredictable due to the upcoming presidential elections and its increasing china-phobia , the chinese consider the eu an important partner .
the eu 's position as an intermediate between the us and china therefore makes it well placed to engage with the chinese and could provide the eu with more influence . negotiations for a new eu-china partnership agreement in either 2008 or 2009 will be vital to maintain mutual confidence , but china 's reluctance to address key topics like political freedom , economic imbalances and liberalization , and the eu 's current inability to agree on a coherent china policy makes the coming eighteen months very important regarding the future of sino-european relations . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

whenever there is a controversial event which could be blamed on the idiot-box , the same question arises : how much influence does television have on our lives ?
violent shows are almost always cited in cases when kids run amok and teenage promiscuity is often blamed on too much sex on tv .
it was only a matter of time before the ingenuity shown by a certain set of television criminals became the inspiration for a daring , real-life prison break .
while those involved in the incident at the juvenile detention center in neustadt , northwest germany , were not being framed for the murder of the vice president 's brother as some part of an elaborate political conspiracy , it did take an ingenious effort of tv-land proportions to break one 19-year old inmate out of her cell .
resourceful girls escape under guards ' noses taking a lot less time than 22 episodes to get to the actual escape , the escapee 's 18-year-old accomplice , another inmate who was released last friday , managed to get the fleeing jailbird out of the detention center and away under the very noses of the prison guards .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " just stay calm , we 're nearly home and free " the guards , none of whom may have been too bright , failed to follow up suspicions after the released girl left the correctional facility with a suitcase which the officials found to be " particularly heavy . "
the girl was allowed to leave the center with the suitcase , which contained her prison break co-star , without the luggage being searched .
in addition to that embarrassing oversight , the fact that the other young woman was missing was only noticed several hours later during the routine evening check of cells at the center .
the two young women are still at large while the prison officers have presumably gone back to watching the weakest link . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

30 , they had charged six french nationals , who were employees of an aid agency , with attempted kidnapping . an mob of several dozen people gathered outside the court house in abeche , calling the europeans " thieves , killers " , and accusing former colonial power france of being an " accomplice . " citizens of spain and belgium have also been charged as accomplices , the associated press reported .
they could face decades in prison , including hard labor , if found guilty . french foreign ministry spokeswoman pascale andreani said tuesday that france was sending a doctor and legal adviser to meet with the group 's detained members . the six were employees of a french aid group called l 'arche de zoe , or zoe 's arc , and were arrested thursday as they were preparing to leave with the children from abeche , an eastern city near chad 's border with sudan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the aid workers held in custody in abeche , chad the aid workers have insisted that they were told the children were orphans from sudan 's war-torn western region of darfur , which borders chad . the workers said they were taking the children out of the country to france to receive medical treatment . however , an investigation , partly involving united nations workers , revealed that none of the children was injured .
investigators also found that many of the children may not have been orphans . zoe 's arc said it had arranged for french host families to care for the children , but the organization denied charges that the children were to be given up for adoption .
according to the afp news agency , some of the families each paid between 2,800 euros and 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 4,000 and $ 8,600 -rrb- , supposedly for the evacuation costs of the children . french police have reportedly been investigating the activities of zoe 's arc since july . other nationals charged chadian authorities in the eastern city abeche have also charged three french journalists , who were accompanying the aid workers , with complicity in the case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chadian president idriss deby at the orphanage in abeche a further seven - of the spanish flight crew from the aircraft that was to fly the children to france - as well as the belgian pilot have been charged as accomplices , radio france internationale -lrb- rfi -rrb- reported . rfi said it was unclear whether two chadian nationals arrested with the 16 europeans had also been charged with complicity . chad 's interior minister ahmat bachir said the accused would be flown to the capital n 'djamena this week . eu forces in darfur-chad region not at risk meanwhile , the french government has said a multinational european union force in the darfur-chad border region would not be jeopardized . " this affair has absolutely nothing to do with the deployment of the multinational force , " french junior minister for human rights , rama yade , told europe 1 radio , according to the dpa news agency . over the weekend , french president nicolas sarkozy said zoe 's arc 's actions were " illegal and unacceptable . "
he also said he had spoken with chadian president idriss deby . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yade called the attempted transport " illegal and morally irresponsible " deby himself has described the actions of the aid workers as " simple kidnapping . "
he also accused the french organization of wanting to " sell -lrb- the children -rrb- to pedophile organizations in europe , and even perhaps to kill them and sell their organs , " according to dpa . however , deby also reportedly told sarkozy that the affair would not affect the deployment of 3,000 european troops , half of whom are french , scheduled to arrive in eastern chad and the northern region of the central african republic in november .
the soldiers are to help safeguard camps holding refugees fleeing darfur . more than four years of conflict there have left more than 200,000 people and 2.5 million people displaced . the 103 children who were on their way to france are currently in an orphanage in abeche , where they are being cared for by local aid workers and unicef staff . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german chancellor also called on indian president pratibha patil and vice president hamid ansari . merkel to sign defense , sci-tech agreements bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is welcomed by india 's prime minister singh merkel , who is on her first visit to india as chancellor , was set to meet with singh for discussions on bilateral , regional and global issues later on tuesday before signing a number of bilateral agreements in the areas of defense cooperation , science and technology and intellectual property rights . the chancellor is accompanied on her visit by german education and research minister annette schavan and a 30-member delegation of top business leaders representing companies like european aircraft manufacturer airbus , conglomerate siemens , rail operator deutsche bahn and reinsurer munich re . trade and investment is a special focus area of merkel 's visit and the chancellor has already made it clear during her visit that indian investors would be sincerely welcomed in germany and has requested that india ease trade barriers for german business and investment . german companies vying for slice of large pie bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with education minister annette schavan -lrb- left -rrb- german firms are keen on a share of the 360 billion euros -lrb- $ 511 billion -rrb- that india plans to invest in infrastructure and other projects in the next five years .
besides infrastructure , sectors like science and technology , energy , research and development and information technology are the areas in which german firms are most interested . bilateral trade passed the 10 billion euro mark in 2006 , and germany is the seventh largest investor in india with a total inflow of $ 1.9 billion between 1991 and june 2007 . merkel will take her business roadshow to the economic center of mumbai on wednesday where she will attend a meeting of german and indian company leaders . airbus chief optimistic of eurofighter contract bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enders was confident of selling eurofighters to india one member of the business delegation accompanying the chancellor is airbus chief thomas enders who announced on tuesday that he was optimistic about the chance to supply the indian air force with 120 eurofighters . " the eurofighter ranks among the most modern combat aircraft worldwide , " said the former ceo of the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- . india has budgeted $ 10.4 billion to buy 126 new medium multi-role combat aircraft for the air force starting in 2012 and the eurofighter consortium which builds the multi-role typhoon fighter jet is hoping to land the lucrative contract ahead of its us , russian , swedish and french rivals . enders also saw possibilities for contracts on civilian aircraft , especially medium-haul planes , with the surge in air traffic in india . " indian airlines are one of our most important customers in asia and worldwide , " said enders .
" we are in several negotiations with indian airlines . " airbus , however , is not just interested in selling airplanes in india , but is looking to develop pilot training centers , enders added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 30.10.2007 can and should the eu cage the chinese dragon ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's global expansion has put the eu on the defensive the sino-european relationship is at a crossroads .
after decades of patient waiting for promised reforms and opening up , europe now sees the resurgence of a giant that is less eager to conform to its expectations . thirty years ago , deng xiaoping said that it would take 100 years for china to become a democracy .
while another 70 years of waiting would be frustrating in itself , things have been made worse by current president hu jintao 's assertion that the century of political transition has yet to begin . it is this sluggish liberalization which is frustrating the new generation of european leaders , especially german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy who both want china to speed up social and political reforms .
but this slow progress is only one item in a catalogue of differences which have been increasingly straining eu-china ties . over the past few months , the sino-european relationship has been rocked by allegations of internet espionage and cyber-warfare by china ; fractious trade relations over everything from steel to children 's toys , rising suspicion over the people 's republic 's economic ambitions and strong language on its human rights and environmental record . while many of these areas of conflict have recently highlighted the growing eu-china divide , experts on sino-european ties pinpoint three main challenges to the stability of the relationship . china expanding into areas of european interest jonathan holslag , the head of research at the brussels institute for contemporary china studies -lrb- biccs -rrb- , believes the biggest challenge to the relationship is china 's tenacious economic protectionism . " this protectionism is the eu 's key concern , particularly in the financial sector , " holslag told dw-world.de.
" china 's export promotion strategy is also a worry , given that the chinese government is developing a new generation of advanced national champions backed by excessive subsidies , tax breaks , and most importantly , a cheap currency .
there is also little reinforcing of basic product safety standards or international property rights -lrb- ipr -rrb- rules . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson has had run-ins with china holslag also believes that china 's economic boom is reaching niches in which europe once had a strong lead .
the eu 's advantage in many economic areas is being eroded by a state with more than $ 1.4 trillion -lrb- 0.97 trillion euros -rrb- of foreign exchange reserves in its pocket .
china 's enormous economic power could reduce the european bloc 's competitiveness . " the fact that china has developed into a competitor is mainly due to the fact that the eu itself is not able to step up its economic modernization and its political coherence , " holslag added .
" the worst reaction from the europeans would be to step up its own protectionism .
such a strategy would be harmful to europe 's own long-term interests .
the only way of dealing with china is for the eu to do things better . " european indecisiveness undermining diplomatic efforts according to carmel leclerq , an expert on eu-asia relations at the brussels-based sino-european forum , china is also slowly reducing the european union 's influence in many areas of global diplomacy .
china has abandoned its once timid diplomatic posture and is growing more assertive .
a zealous and well-coordinated foreign economic policy is beginning to undermine european interests in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has reached out to africa and has been accepted china 's tackling of problems which the eu has decided to stay out of , such as north korea and sudan , the people 's republic is sidelining the eu and weakening its influence , particularly in africa , were it is conducting an economic development policy based on large amounts of aid , loans and investments . " compared with china 's charm offensive where it seems genuinely knowledgeable , open and committed to solving international problems , the eu appears to be hopelessly undecided on where it stands on many issues and fails to translate its potential power into real clout , " said leclerq .
" the eu should n't try and undermine china 's growing influence or even contain it but try to build up a healthy balance of influence by making itself stronger and more focused . "
eu , china at odds over human rights human rights also remain a main point of dispute , especially as china still refuses to ratify the symbolically important convention on civil and political rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is some way behind the eu on human rights issues " the eu expects china to make real concessions .
the time of promises and minor cosmetic adaptations is over .
beijing has to start to improve civilian rights in line with international accords , " said jonas tiel from the european asian watch foundation .
" china needs to react in a more moderate manner to criticism .
the cancellation of human rights talks with germany after angela merkel met with the dalai lama was not constructive .
china can only expect even more pressure if it does n't take steps .
sanctions are not out of the question . " professor dai bingran , an expert on european affairs at the university of fudan in china , says that the eu needs to have more patience with china over human rights issues and that the chinese people are on the road to democracy and freedom but admitted progress is slow . " issues like human rights , freedom , democracy , etc. are not in the traditional chinese culture , say in confucianism , but that does not mean we are against them , " bingran said .
" on the contrary , in the last few decades the situation has greatly improved .
it is true that the situation is not as good as in europe , or as they should be , but for such things to take place , it does need some time . " possible demonization of china in europe most experts agree that while there are solutions to all these challenges , the biggest danger is china becoming " demonized " within the eu and that , much like what is happening at the moment in the united states , a " grand coalition " of china-sceptics forms in europe and brings pressure on national parliaments and the eu to act . " what 's possible is that interest groups , such as environmentalists , human rights campaigners , textile producers , and those who criticize china within the eu start to find each other , " holslag said .
" this would lead to increased pressure to resort to sanctions on trade and other issues and would inhibit the eu 's ability to pursue a cautious china policy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel get closer on their china stance leclerq believes that a harder stance towards china has already begun at a high level .
" merkel and sarkozy have already taken up more hard-line positions with china than any of their predecessors , mainly because they have been pressured to do so by domestic factors , " she said . " germany in particular is taking a more critical tone , moving away from its role as a prominent defender of close commercial relations with china as it starts to see the chinese challenging its own advanced economic strongholds in electronics and car manufacturing . "
cooperation and partnerships the way forward the experts believe that the dragon can not be caged and that the eu should not even try .
a concerted effort to restrict and alienate china , even with the backing of the united states , would be impossible without harming international economic stability .
the general belief is that the only way for the eu to keep china in check is to act as a unified player in world politics and to make itself indispensable as an economic and political partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future is not necessarily bleak for the eu and china the omens are good for the eu in this respect .
with the united states becoming more unpredictable due to the upcoming presidential elections and its increasing china-phobia , the chinese consider the eu an important partner .
the eu 's position as an intermediate between the us and china therefore makes it well placed to engage with the chinese and could provide the eu with more influence . negotiations for a new eu-china partnership agreement in either 2008 or 2009 will be vital to maintain mutual confidence , but china 's reluctance to address key topics like political freedom , economic imbalances and liberalization , and the eu 's current inability to agree on a coherent china policy makes the coming eighteen months very important regarding the future of sino-european relations . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after decades of patient waiting for promised reforms and opening up , europe now sees the resurgence of a giant that is less eager to conform to its expectations . thirty years ago , deng xiaoping said that it would take 100 years for china to become a democracy .
while another 70 years of waiting would be frustrating in itself , things have been made worse by current president hu jintao 's assertion that the century of political transition has yet to begin . it is this sluggish liberalization which is frustrating the new generation of european leaders , especially german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy who both want china to speed up social and political reforms .
but this slow progress is only one item in a catalogue of differences which have been increasingly straining eu-china ties . over the past few months , the sino-european relationship has been rocked by allegations of internet espionage and cyber-warfare by china ; fractious trade relations over everything from steel to children 's toys , rising suspicion over the people 's republic 's economic ambitions and strong language on its human rights and environmental record . while many of these areas of conflict have recently highlighted the growing eu-china divide , experts on sino-european ties pinpoint three main challenges to the stability of the relationship . china expanding into areas of european interest jonathan holslag , the head of research at the brussels institute for contemporary china studies -lrb- biccs -rrb- , believes the biggest challenge to the relationship is china 's tenacious economic protectionism . " this protectionism is the eu 's key concern , particularly in the financial sector , " holslag told dw-world.de.
" china 's export promotion strategy is also a worry , given that the chinese government is developing a new generation of advanced national champions backed by excessive subsidies , tax breaks , and most importantly , a cheap currency .
there is also little reinforcing of basic product safety standards or international property rights -lrb- ipr -rrb- rules . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson has had run-ins with china holslag also believes that china 's economic boom is reaching niches in which europe once had a strong lead .
the eu 's advantage in many economic areas is being eroded by a state with more than $ 1.4 trillion -lrb- 0.97 trillion euros -rrb- of foreign exchange reserves in its pocket .
china 's enormous economic power could reduce the european bloc 's competitiveness . " the fact that china has developed into a competitor is mainly due to the fact that the eu itself is not able to step up its economic modernization and its political coherence , " holslag added .
" the worst reaction from the europeans would be to step up its own protectionism .
such a strategy would be harmful to europe 's own long-term interests .
the only way of dealing with china is for the eu to do things better . " european indecisiveness undermining diplomatic efforts according to carmel leclerq , an expert on eu-asia relations at the brussels-based sino-european forum , china is also slowly reducing the european union 's influence in many areas of global diplomacy .
china has abandoned its once timid diplomatic posture and is growing more assertive .
a zealous and well-coordinated foreign economic policy is beginning to undermine european interests in the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has reached out to africa and has been accepted china 's tackling of problems which the eu has decided to stay out of , such as north korea and sudan , the people 's republic is sidelining the eu and weakening its influence , particularly in africa , were it is conducting an economic development policy based on large amounts of aid , loans and investments . " compared with china 's charm offensive where it seems genuinely knowledgeable , open and committed to solving international problems , the eu appears to be hopelessly undecided on where it stands on many issues and fails to translate its potential power into real clout , " said leclerq .
" the eu should n't try and undermine china 's growing influence or even contain it but try to build up a healthy balance of influence by making itself stronger and more focused . "
eu , china at odds over human rights human rights also remain a main point of dispute , especially as china still refuses to ratify the symbolically important convention on civil and political rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is some way behind the eu on human rights issues " the eu expects china to make real concessions .
the time of promises and minor cosmetic adaptations is over .
beijing has to start to improve civilian rights in line with international accords , " said jonas tiel from the european asian watch foundation .
" china needs to react in a more moderate manner to criticism .
the cancellation of human rights talks with germany after angela merkel met with the dalai lama was not constructive .
china can only expect even more pressure if it does n't take steps .
sanctions are not out of the question . " professor dai bingran , an expert on european affairs at the university of fudan in china , says that the eu needs to have more patience with china over human rights issues and that the chinese people are on the road to democracy and freedom but admitted progress is slow . " issues like human rights , freedom , democracy , etc. are not in the traditional chinese culture , say in confucianism , but that does not mean we are against them , " bingran said .
" on the contrary , in the last few decades the situation has greatly improved .
it is true that the situation is not as good as in europe , or as they should be , but for such things to take place , it does need some time . " possible demonization of china in europe most experts agree that while there are solutions to all these challenges , the biggest danger is china becoming " demonized " within the eu and that , much like what is happening at the moment in the united states , a " grand coalition " of china-sceptics forms in europe and brings pressure on national parliaments and the eu to act . " what 's possible is that interest groups , such as environmentalists , human rights campaigners , textile producers , and those who criticize china within the eu start to find each other , " holslag said .
" this would lead to increased pressure to resort to sanctions on trade and other issues and would inhibit the eu 's ability to pursue a cautious china policy . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel get closer on their china stance leclerq believes that a harder stance towards china has already begun at a high level .
" merkel and sarkozy have already taken up more hard-line positions with china than any of their predecessors , mainly because they have been pressured to do so by domestic factors , " she said . " germany in particular is taking a more critical tone , moving away from its role as a prominent defender of close commercial relations with china as it starts to see the chinese challenging its own advanced economic strongholds in electronics and car manufacturing . "
cooperation and partnerships the way forward the experts believe that the dragon can not be caged and that the eu should not even try .
a concerted effort to restrict and alienate china , even with the backing of the united states , would be impossible without harming international economic stability .
the general belief is that the only way for the eu to keep china in check is to act as a unified player in world politics and to make itself indispensable as an economic and political partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future is not necessarily bleak for the eu and china the omens are good for the eu in this respect .
with the united states becoming more unpredictable due to the upcoming presidential elections and its increasing china-phobia , the chinese consider the eu an important partner .
the eu 's position as an intermediate between the us and china therefore makes it well placed to engage with the chinese and could provide the eu with more influence . negotiations for a new eu-china partnership agreement in either 2008 or 2009 will be vital to maintain mutual confidence , but china 's reluctance to address key topics like political freedom , economic imbalances and liberalization , and the eu 's current inability to agree on a coherent china policy makes the coming eighteen months very important regarding the future of sino-european relations . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

japan has been providing fuel for coalition forces in afghanistan , but its mandate runs out on 1 november .
mr fukuda held talks with democratic party leader ichiro ozawa , who said he could only back such a mission if it was part of a united nations operation .
there are fears the dispute could spark early elections in japan .
the government has already lost control of the upper house of parliament at elections in july , and would not welcome a fresh poll for the lower house , correspondents say .
mr fukuda meanwhile is due to visit the united states next month , his first overseas trip since taking office .
principles " i told him that i can not approve of it " ichiro ozawa opposition leader japan has refuelled coalition warships in the indian ocean since 2001 and the us and japan both want an extension .
the prime minister sought the democratic party 's backing for new legislation .
" i asked for his party 's cooperation regarding the new anti-terrorism bill and explained the situation , but as of today we did not reach any agreement , " mr fukuda said after he met the opposition leader .
mr ozawa said : " i told him that i can not approve of it .
we need to have principles , which means that unless it 's part of un operations , it would not be possible . "
the two men are due to meet again at the end of the week .
the mission has been dogged by allegations that japan supplied far more fuel to us forces than officially recorded - encouraging speculation that tokyo might have helped supply the us war in iraq , not just its operations in afghanistan .
japan 's constitution forbids it from fighting other nations but the government has recently tried to revise it to allow for a more robust defence policy .
in the past few years it has sent troops to iraq on a humanitarian mission as well as supplying the coalition in afghanistan .
the iraq deployment ended in 2006 , while the afghan one appeared to come to an effective end on monday , when a pakistani destroyer took on a fresh load of fuel , japanese media said .
the associated press quoted a japanese defence official saying no further ships would be refuelled .

japan has been providing fuel for coalition forces in afghanistan , but its mandate runs out on 1 november .
mr fukuda held talks with democratic party leader ichiro ozawa , who said he could only back such a mission if it was part of a united nations operation .
there are fears the dispute could spark early elections in japan .
the government has already lost control of the upper house of parliament at elections in july , and would not welcome a fresh poll for the lower house , correspondents say .
mr fukuda meanwhile is due to visit the united states next month , his first overseas trip since taking office .
principles i told him that i can not approve of it ichiro ozawa opposition leader japan has refuelled coalition warships in the indian ocean since 2001 and the us and japan both want an extension .
the prime minister sought the democratic party 's backing for new legislation .
" i asked for his party 's cooperation regarding the new anti-terrorism bill and explained the situation , but as of today we did not reach any agreement , " mr fukuda said after he met the opposition leader .
mr ozawa said : " i told him that i can not approve of it .
we need to have principles , which means that unless it 's part of un operations , it would not be possible . "
the two men are due to meet again at the end of the week .
the mission has been dogged by allegations that japan supplied far more fuel to us forces than officially recorded - encouraging speculation that tokyo might have helped supply the us war in iraq , not just its operations in afghanistan .
japan 's refuelling mission has proved controversial at home japan 's constitution forbids it from fighting other nations but the government has recently tried to revise it to allow for a more robust defence policy .
in the past few years it has sent troops to iraq on a humanitarian mission as well as supplying the coalition in afghanistan .
the iraq deployment ended in 2006 , while the afghan one appeared to come to an effective end on monday , when a pakistani destroyer took on a fresh load of fuel , japanese media said .
the associated press quoted a japanese defence official saying no further ships would be refuelled .

new figures show the lifeboats were launched almost 150 times less than in the same period last year .
however , at least eight of the 31 rnli stations in wales were busier than last year .
the figures are released the same day welsh blue peter chef jake sawyers , 12 , launches a rnli fundraising appeal .
the annual statistics showed that welsh lifeboats launched 554 times this summer , down from the record of almost 700 call outs last year .
but an rnli spokeswoman added that it had still been a busy summer for stations such as beaumaris , abersoch , cardigan , aberystwyth , burry port , st david 's , new quay and flint , which all saw the number of call outs increase .
" the weather has been absolutely dreadful this summer so we had less people using the coastline , " she said .
" but certain stations , like beaumaris , saw a rise in call-outs which suggests more people are visiting these areas . "
i 've lived close to the sea all my life , so i know how dangerous it can be , but it 's good to know that the rnli is there if you ever did get into trouble jake sawyers she added that , despite the drop in call-outs this year , it was still important to raise as much money as possible from the charity 's latest appeal , which will be known as sos .
" the rnli has no government funding and is run entirely on donations and legacies , " she said .
jake sawyers , who beat more than 12,000 budding chefs to become the first blue peter cook in april , will host the launch of the new appeal at port talbot lifeboat station , near his home .
the 12-year-old is calling on people to come up with fundraising around the sos acronym on 25 january , and will be preparing his local crew a soup lunch to promote one sos fundraising idea - slurp our soup .
other suggestions for the day , which is supported by schools , businesses , pubs and community groups , are ' sponsor our sports ' , ' sizzle our sausages ' or ' scoff our snacks ' .
jake , who is visually-impaired , said : " i 've lived close to the sea all my life , so i know how dangerous it can be , but it 's good to know that the rnli is there if you ever did get into trouble .
" the lifeboat crew make sure people are safe so i want to pay them back by making them a nice lunch and asking people to support sos day and raise as much money as possible for the rnli . "

bbc news -pipe- technology -pipe- pc stripper helps spam to spread bbc news / technology graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- tuesday , 30 october 2007 , 08:49 gmt pc stripper helps spam to spread a virtual stripper is helping to defeat anti-spam security checks .
spammers have created a windows game which shows a woman in a state of undress when people correctly type in text shown in an accompanying image .
the scrambled text images come from sites which use them to stop computers automatically signing up for accounts that can be put to illegal use .
by getting people to type in the text the spammers can take over the accounts and use them to send junk mail .
text chat the scrambled text systems used to defeat automatic sign-ups are known as captchas or " completely automated public turing test to tell computers and humans apart " .
typically they feature a disfigured word or one overlaid with artefacts that make it difficult for anyone but a human to decipher .
many computer criminals have been trying to crack these systems to get at the net-based resources , such as e-mail accounts or blogging tools , they are designed to protect .
" the free e-mail services , so far , have been extremely successful at using captchas to recognise a human being or an automatic program , " said raimund genes , chief technology officer at trend micro .
the novel system for getting round captchas uses images of a woman called " melissa " who invites victims to decipher the scrambled text .
entering the correct text produces another image and another chunk of scrambled text .
mr genes said the captchas seen with the first versions of the malicious program are all taken from the sign-up system for yahoo webmail .
in the past many viruses have tricked people into opening booby-trapped attachments with the false promise of seeing explicit images , said mr genes , but this was one of the first to actually show people more images if people respond . "
because of the effectiveness of this technology , we have begun to see scammers adapt their tactics " yahoo mr genes said the program could prove because " the average male e-mail user would want to see more " .
so far the two security firms who have spotted the program , trend micro and panda security , have not seen many copies of it in the wild suggesting few people have been caught out .
mr genes said it was very likely a proof of concept program that might find wide use in the future .
" maybe they are trying it out to slip under the radar , " he said .
" more and more malware does not want to get any publicity , it wants to be silent and hidden . "
the virtual stripper program arrives on machines that are already infected with malicious software , said mr genes .
the program comes to life when the internet explorer browser is used on infected machines .
the captcha-busting program can run on windows 98 , me , nt , 2000 , xp , and server 2003 .
mr genes recommended that people run anti-virus , anti-spyware and web watching programs to avoid infection and to install updates as soon as they become available .
a yahoo spokesperson said : " yahoo began deploying captcha more than six years ago to help combat the ability for malicious programs to send spam .
" because of the effectiveness of this technology , we have begun to see scammers adapt their tactics , where human beings solve the puzzles the viruses can not . "
the company added : " yahoo is continuing to innovate in our defenses against this type of abuse .
we have a number of mechanisms to help us detect and respond to abuse . "

spammers have created a windows game which shows a woman in a state of undress when people correctly type in text shown in an accompanying image .
the scrambled text images come from sites which use them to stop computers automatically signing up for accounts that can be put to illegal use .
by getting people to type in the text the spammers can take over the accounts and use them to send junk mail .
text chat the scrambled text systems used to defeat automatic sign-ups are known as captchas or " completely automated public turing test to tell computers and humans apart " .
typically they feature a disfigured word or one overlaid with artefacts that make it difficult for anyone but a human to decipher .
many computer criminals have been trying to crack these systems to get at the net-based resources , such as e-mail accounts or blogging tools , they are designed to protect .
" the free e-mail services , so far , have been extremely successful at using captchas to recognise a human being or an automatic program , " said raimund genes , chief technology officer at trend micro .
the windows game uses humans to crack anti-spam security the novel system for getting round captchas uses images of a woman called " melissa " who invites victims to decipher the scrambled text .
entering the correct text produces another image and another chunk of scrambled text .
mr genes said the captchas seen with the first versions of the malicious program are all taken from the sign-up system for yahoo webmail .
in the past many viruses have tricked people into opening booby-trapped attachments with the false promise of seeing explicit images , said mr genes , but this was one of the first to actually show people more images if people respond .
because of the effectiveness of this technology , we have begun to see scammers adapt their tactics yahoo mr genes said the program could prove because " the average male e-mail user would want to see more " .
so far the two security firms who have spotted the program , trend micro and panda security , have not seen many copies of it in the wild suggesting few people have been caught out .
mr genes said it was very likely a proof of concept program that might find wide use in the future .
" maybe they are trying it out to slip under the radar , " he said .
" more and more malware does not want to get any publicity , it wants to be silent and hidden . "
the virtual stripper program arrives on machines that are already infected with malicious software , said mr genes .
the program comes to life when the internet explorer browser is used on infected machines .
the captcha-busting program can run on windows 98 , me , nt , 2000 , xp , and server 2003 .

but youtube was not the first to set the online video craze rolling .
among those video sites that are not youtube , metacafe has a good claim to be the pioneer in the field .
founder eyal hertzog says he was thinking about such a site back before the days of the dotcom boom .
" the idea was originally crafted in 1998 , " he told the bbc news website , " that 's when i wrote the first document of what it should be . "
back in the days of dial-up most of the video clips people watched arrived via e-mails that were passed around among friends , acquaintances and colleagues .
at the time broadband was only used by big business , so e-mail was the only way that big files could travel .
" everyone who used e-mail heavily got them , " he said , " i just thought that one day it was going to be really big .
it really engaged me . "
launch pad the initial conception was not for a video-sharing site that has become so common today .
instead , mr hertzog aimed to set up an entertainment channel that could showcase home made clips .

" we went on to the web when broadband became more popular and prices became more reasonable , said mr hertzog .
metacafe now serves up around 450 million videos per month to the 19 million unique users who visit every month .
along with yahoo , myspace and aol it is among the top ten video sites online .
it specialises in short-form videos and no clip on the site is longer than eight minutes .
the average clip is 90 seconds long .
as a pioneer metacafe has gone through many of the troubles that sites such as youtube , yahoo and dailymotion are now grappling with .
erick hachenburg , metacafe 's chief executive , said it avoided many of the troubles of rivals by ensuring that there was only one version of each video showcased on the site .
behind the scenes , he said , metacafe has developed a video identification system that analyses what is being uploaded to see if it is a duplicate .
" we can determine whether something has ever been uploaded before , " said mr hachenburg .
this helps to ward off the problems other sites suffer , he said , because it ensure that , once a clip is labelled as pirated , it will be blocked from appearing on the site again .
" we 've never built the business on the basis of piracy , " he said .
" we 've never had long form pirated content on there .
ever . "
stopping copies also helps reinforce one of the ways that metacafe is trying to distinguish itself in the crowded online video market , said mr hachenburg .
" it 's the single copy that 's the entertainment proposition for our user base , " he said .
rank and reward many members of that user base , about 80,000 of them , help metacafe filter the deluge of clips being uploaded .
that group acts as members act as an editorial board to rate and review everything uploaded to the site .
they annotate the material and flag a clip if it should have a restricted audience .
to help this ranking process , metacafe has developed software which oversees how those on the editorial board react to the videos they see .
this software notes how much of the clip people watched , whether they watched it more than once and whether it was forwarded on to friends .
the software helps to decide who in metacafe 's regular user community would be interested in the clip .
" because we are programming focused we can tell with a great deal of accuracy the type of video you want to see tomorrow morning , " said mr hertzog .
limiting duplicates helps metacafe , like other sites such as revver , reward those that post original short films to the site .
metacafe has created a " producer rewards " programme that gives $ 5 to video creators for every 1,000 views they get .
since it was set up in october 2006 , the programme has handed out more than $ 800,000 .
many of the most popular creators on the site top up their income via the movies they post .
one creator , going by the alias kipkay , has made more than $ 64,000 out the films he has posted .
" they should make money , " said mr herzog , " it just makes sense if you do something that good . "

" we went on to the web when broadband became more popular and prices became more reasonable , said mr hertzog .
metacafe now serves up around 450 million videos per month to the 19 million unique users who visit every month .
along with yahoo , myspace and aol it is among the top ten video sites online .
it specialises in short-form videos and no clip on the site is longer than eight minutes .
the average clip is 90 seconds long .
as a pioneer metacafe has gone through many of the troubles that sites such as youtube , yahoo and dailymotion are now grappling with .
erick hachenburg , metacafe 's chief executive , said it avoided many of the troubles of rivals by ensuring that there was only one version of each video showcased on the site .
when metacafe launched most people used dial-up behind the scenes , he said , metacafe has developed a video identification system that analyses what is being uploaded to see if it is a duplicate .
" we can determine whether something has ever been uploaded before , " said mr hachenburg .
this helps to ward off the problems other sites suffer , he said , because it ensure that , once a clip is labelled as pirated , it will be blocked from appearing on the site again .
" we 've never built the business on the basis of piracy , " he said .
" we 've never had long form pirated content on there .
ever . "
stopping copies also helps reinforce one of the ways that metacafe is trying to distinguish itself in the crowded online video market , said mr hachenburg .
" it 's the single copy that 's the entertainment proposition for our user base , " he said .
rank and reward many members of that user base , about 80,000 of them , help metacafe filter the deluge of clips being uploaded .
that group acts as members act as an editorial board to rate and review everything uploaded to the site .
they annotate the material and flag a clip if it should have a restricted audience .
to help this ranking process , metacafe has developed software which oversees how those on the editorial board react to the videos they see .
this software notes how much of the clip people watched , whether they watched it more than once and whether it was forwarded on to friends .
the software helps to decide who in metacafe 's regular user community would be interested in the clip .
eyal hertzog first thought about online video in 1998 " because we are programming focused we can tell with a great deal of accuracy the type of video you want to see tomorrow morning , " said mr hertzog .
limiting duplicates helps metacafe , like other sites such as revver , reward those that post original short films to the site .
metacafe has created a " producer rewards " programme that gives $ 5 to video creators for every 1,000 views they get .
since it was set up in october 2006 , the programme has handed out more than $ 800,000 .
many of the most popular creators on the site top up their income via the movies they post .
one creator , going by the alias kipkay , has made more than $ 64,000 out the films he has posted .
" they should make money , " said mr herzog , " it just makes sense if you do something that good . "

but youtube was not the first to set the online video craze rolling .
among those video sites that are not youtube , metacafe has a good claim to be the pioneer in the field .
founder eyal hertzog says he was thinking about such a site back before the days of the dotcom boom .
" the idea was originally crafted in 1998 , " he told the bbc news website , " that 's when i wrote the first document of what it should be . "
back in the days of dial-up most of the video clips people watched arrived via e-mails that were passed around among friends , acquaintances and colleagues .
at the time broadband was only used by big business , so e-mail was the only way that big files could travel .
" everyone who used e-mail heavily got them , " he said , " i just thought that one day it was going to be really big .
it really engaged me . "
launch pad the initial conception was not for a video-sharing site that has become so common today .
instead , mr hertzog aimed to set up an entertainment channel that could showcase home made clips .

" we went on to the web when broadband became more popular and prices became more reasonable , said mr hertzog .
metacafe now serves up around 450 million videos per month to the 19 million unique users who visit every month .
along with yahoo , myspace and aol it is among the top ten video sites online .
it specialises in short-form videos and no clip on the site is longer than eight minutes .
the average clip is 90 seconds long .
as a pioneer metacafe has gone through many of the troubles that sites such as youtube , yahoo and dailymotion are now grappling with .
erick hachenburg , metacafe 's chief executive , said it avoided many of the troubles of rivals by ensuring that there was only one version of each video showcased on the site .
when metacafe launched most people used dial-up behind the scenes , he said , metacafe has developed a video identification system that analyses what is being uploaded to see if it is a duplicate .
" we can determine whether something has ever been uploaded before , " said mr hachenburg .
this helps to ward off the problems other sites suffer , he said , because it ensure that , once a clip is labelled as pirated , it will be blocked from appearing on the site again .
" we 've never built the business on the basis of piracy , " he said .
" we 've never had long form pirated content on there .
ever . "
stopping copies also helps reinforce one of the ways that metacafe is trying to distinguish itself in the crowded online video market , said mr hachenburg .
" it 's the single copy that 's the entertainment proposition for our user base , " he said .
rank and reward many members of that user base , about 80,000 of them , help metacafe filter the deluge of clips being uploaded .
that group acts as members act as an editorial board to rate and review everything uploaded to the site .
they annotate the material and flag a clip if it should have a restricted audience .
to help this ranking process , metacafe has developed software which oversees how those on the editorial board react to the videos they see .
this software notes how much of the clip people watched , whether they watched it more than once and whether it was forwarded on to friends .
the software helps to decide who in metacafe 's regular user community would be interested in the clip .
eyal hertzog first thought about online video in 1998 " because we are programming focused we can tell with a great deal of accuracy the type of video you want to see tomorrow morning , " said mr hertzog .
limiting duplicates helps metacafe , like other sites such as revver , reward those that post original short films to the site .
metacafe has created a " producer rewards " programme that gives $ 5 to video creators for every 1,000 views they get .
since it was set up in october 2006 , the programme has handed out more than $ 800,000 .
many of the most popular creators on the site top up their income via the movies they post .
one creator , going by the alias kipkay , has made more than $ 64,000 out the films he has posted .
" they should make money , " said mr herzog , " it just makes sense if you do something that good . "

four-year-old madeleine , from rothley , leicestershire , vanished from her holiday apartment in portugal on 3 may .
on saturday , her family will hold a church service to mark six months since she was last seen in the algarve resort of praia da luz .
mr mccann wrote in his latest internet diary entry : " we will be marking this milestone very quietly with an ecumenical prayer service for madeleine and other missing children in the local anglican church . "
' changed status ' according to the find madeleine website , the fund has so far received more than £ 1million in donations .
at its launch , madeleine 's uncle john mccann said : " this fund will be a vehicle to help our family get our darling , wee niece back . "

" when they were made arguido -lsb- suspects -rsb- , it stopped , which was a mutual decision on the part of the fund and the mccanns , " he said .
" they were happy to accept that their changed status meant they were no longer entitled to that assistance . "
