that is why anti-terror legislations differ from country to country . terrorism is not a new phenomenon in europe .
in the united kingdom , spain and ireland alone , it has claimed 5,000 deaths over the last 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the effects of sept .
11 are felt strongly in europe the sept .
11 attacks on the united states , however , have had a rippling effect across the atlantic as well .
faced with the challenges posed by the war against international terrorism , which were only heightened by the attacks in london and madrid , european countries were forced to adapt and expand their anti-terror legislations .
" legislative and institutional requirements have definitely become stricter in all 27 member states of the european union , " said annegret bendiek of the german institute for international and security affairs and author of a study on fighting terrorism in the eu .
yet striking the right balance between efficient engagement in the war on terror and protection of civil liberties has n't been easy to achieve .
one policy , many implementations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the end of privacy ?
in june 2002 , the eu council passed two resolutions - one establishing a common european arrest warrant and one defining a common concept of terrorist offences which all the member states of the european union had to include in their legal system .
in december 2005 , the eu adopted its eu counter-terrorism strategy , but it left the responsibility for its implementation in the hands of individual member states .
" states like the united kingdom , france and also germany are of course very engaged , " bendiek said .
but european states continue to differ greatly in their institutional and legislative approaches .
tough measures of all the eu member states , the united kingdom has gone the farthest in expanding the legislation meant to counter acts of terrorism .
several months after the 2001 attacks on new york and washington , d.c , britain 's terrorism act of 2000 was replaced by the anti-terrorism , crime and security act which stipulated that foreign terrorist suspects could be detained indefinitely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2005 attacks in london lead to even stricter anti-terror laws after a public outcry and an intervention from the law lords - a judicial body of the upper house of the british parliament which serves as a court of last instance in the uk - this measure was abolished for being incompatible with the european convention of human rights .
its powers were later replaced by the so-called control order in the 2005 prevention of terrorism act .
the control order , however , still allows for comprehensive restriction of an individual 's liberties for the purpose of " protecting members of the public from a risk of terrorism . "
after the london bomb attacks in the summer of 2005 , the british legislation was made even stricter .
according to the terrorism act of 2006 , for example , " glorification of terrorist acts " can lead to a seven-year prison sentence .
it 's legal to eavesdrop ever since july 2005 , italy 's secret service has been allowed to monitor telephone conversations for the sake of preventing terrorist attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police surveillance is a cause of concern for privacy activists france adopted a new law this year that follows the british model allowing for surveillance cameras to be placed in public spaces such as train stations , churches and mosques , shops , factories or nuclear plants .
after a failed terrorist attack , in which crude propane gas bombs were primed to explode on two german trains on july 31 , the german government introduced a new law on fighting terrorism .
germany now has a computer databank which allows police and intelligence agencies easier access to a range of information on terrorism suspects , including membership of terrorist groups , firearms registration information as well as internet and telecommunications data .
not everybody can do it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you never know who 's listening in but smaller and less affluent eu countries are often lagging behind in terms of their legislative apparatus and implementation of counter-terrorist measures .
according to bendiek , malta , portugal or greece , for example , lack the administrative infrastructure , personnel and funds for implementing anti-terrorism laws .
in other countries , it is above all different legal traditions that cancel each other in various legislations .
" the british have fewer problems with video surveillance than the germans , " bendiek said .

wisniewski was not charged in the slaying of harm 's predecessor , siegfried buback .
his murder was one of a series of raf assassinations that rocked former west germany in what later became known as " the german autumn . "
but in an interview with the newsmagazine der spiegel this week , another former terrorist , peter-jürgen boock , said wisniewski was probably the motorcycle gunman who fired the fatal shots that killed buback and two companions in april 1977 .
three other members of the raf , also known as the baader-meinhof gang , were convicted of the buback killing , but it never became clear who pulled the trigger .

brigitte mohnhaupt , found guilty as an accomplice , was released last month after serving 24 years .
knut folkerts , who was released from prison in 1995 , was the third man convicted , but two other former terrorists told der spiegel they did not believe he was involved in the murder .
all three convicted of the buback killing have remained silent .
buback 's son , michael , said last week that he might support klar 's clemency appeal after receiving new information which suggested that he had n't carried out the killing .
the 1977 assassination of buback was intended to free imprisoned raf members , including its co-founder , andreas baader .
the raf , which disbanded in 1998 , is suspected of killing 34 people between 1972 and 1991 .

knut folkerts , who was released from prison in 1995 , was the third man convicted , but two other former terrorists told der spiegel they did not believe he was involved in the murder .
all three convicted of the buback killing have remained silent .
buback 's son , michael , said last week that he might support klar 's clemency appeal after receiving new information which suggested that he had n't carried out the killing .
the 1977 assassination of buback was intended to free imprisoned raf members , including its co-founder , andreas baader .
the raf , which disbanded in 1998 , is suspected of killing 34 people between 1972 and 1991 .

that is why anti-terror legislations differ from country to country . terrorism is not a new phenomenon in europe .
in the united kingdom , spain and ireland alone , it has claimed 5,000 deaths over the last 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the effects of sept .
11 are felt strongly in europe the sept .
11 attacks on the united states , however , have had a rippling effect across the atlantic as well .
faced with the challenges posed by the war against international terrorism , which were only heightened by the attacks in london and madrid , european countries were forced to adapt and expand their anti-terror legislations .
" legislative and institutional requirements have definitely become stricter in all 27 member states of the european union , " said annegret bendiek of the german institute for international and security affairs and author of a study on fighting terrorism in the eu .
yet striking the right balance between efficient engagement in the war on terror and protection of civil liberties has n't been easy to achieve .
one policy , many implementations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the end of privacy ?
in june 2002 , the eu council passed two resolutions - one establishing a common european arrest warrant and one defining a common concept of terrorist offences which all the member states of the european union had to include in their legal system .
in december 2005 , the eu adopted its eu counter-terrorism strategy , but it left the responsibility for its implementation in the hands of individual member states .
" states like the united kingdom , france and also germany are of course very engaged , " bendiek said .
but european states continue to differ greatly in their institutional and legislative approaches .
tough measures of all the eu member states , the united kingdom has gone the farthest in expanding the legislation meant to counter acts of terrorism .
several months after the 2001 attacks on new york and washington , d.c , britain 's terrorism act of 2000 was replaced by the anti-terrorism , crime and security act which stipulated that foreign terrorist suspects could be detained indefinitely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2005 attacks in london lead to even stricter anti-terror laws after a public outcry and an intervention from the law lords - a judicial body of the upper house of the british parliament which serves as a court of last instance in the uk - this measure was abolished for being incompatible with the european convention of human rights .
its powers were later replaced by the so-called control order in the 2005 prevention of terrorism act .
the control order , however , still allows for comprehensive restriction of an individual 's liberties for the purpose of " protecting members of the public from a risk of terrorism . "
after the london bomb attacks in the summer of 2005 , the british legislation was made even stricter .
according to the terrorism act of 2006 , for example , " glorification of terrorist acts " can lead to a seven-year prison sentence .
it 's legal to eavesdrop ever since july 2005 , italy 's secret service has been allowed to monitor telephone conversations for the sake of preventing terrorist attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police surveillance is a cause of concern for privacy activists france adopted a new law this year that follows the british model allowing for surveillance cameras to be placed in public spaces such as train stations , churches and mosques , shops , factories or nuclear plants .
after a failed terrorist attack , in which crude propane gas bombs were primed to explode on two german trains on july 31 , the german government introduced a new law on fighting terrorism .
germany now has a computer databank which allows police and intelligence agencies easier access to a range of information on terrorism suspects , including membership of terrorist groups , firearms registration information as well as internet and telecommunications data .
not everybody can do it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you never know who 's listening in but smaller and less affluent eu countries are often lagging behind in terms of their legislative apparatus and implementation of counter-terrorist measures .
according to bendiek , malta , portugal or greece , for example , lack the administrative infrastructure , personnel and funds for implementing anti-terrorism laws .
in other countries , it is above all different legal traditions that cancel each other in various legislations .
" the british have fewer problems with video surveillance than the germans , " bendiek said .
" but as war as telephone surveillance is concerned , it could be the other way around . " dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de harsh words from german commissioner on data protection the federal commissioner for data protection has accused the german government of " culpable neglect " in protecting data privacy .
he said the government should halt plans for greater access to phone and internet records .
-lrb- 24.04.2007 -rrb- europol seeks broader mandate amid growing terror threat eu police arrested over 700 terror suspects last year , according to a report released tuesday .
half of the arrests involved islamist extremism - the most dangerous variety of terrorism , the report says .

iran denies us and eu charges that it is trying to build nuclear weapons .
larijani told reporters that the talks with solana aimed to evaluate " new ideas " that might be put on the table , the anatolia news agency said .
but solana 's spokesperson cristina gallach said there were " no changes in the position of the international community " and added that the priority was simply to " create conditions for the beginning of negotiations . "
diplomats said there was little hope of a breakthrough given iran 's steadfast refusal to freeze its enrichment work .
an ongoing crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is unlikely that larijani and solana will reach a breakthrough solana will travel on thursday to oslo , where he will brief eu foreign ministers on his meeting with larijani .
iran is defying two un security council resolutions to halt enrichment , saying its program is a legitimate effort to generate civilian nuclear power .
the council has imposed limited sanctions as punishment .
diplomats told afp that while everyone was trying to find a formula to start talks , the two sides remain far apart on a crisis that began in 2002 when it was revealed that iran was secretly building nuclear facilities .
the united states , europe , russia and china are ready in a compromise gesture to give iran a chance to edge its way slowly into stopping uranium enrichment , diplomats said .
the six world powers - britain , china , france , germany , russia and the united states - had last june offered economic , technical and security benefits if iran would agree to the suspension .
but iran pressed ahead and negotiations never started .
several rounds of talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has imposed sanctions on iran because of its nuclear activities larijani and solana held several rounds of talks that failed to find a way to start meetings with the six powers .
the two envoys last met face-to-face on the sidelines of a munich security conference on feb 11 .
larijani said on wednesday that progress had been blocked when " some unacceptable , irrational conditions were put forward " - a clear reference to the demands that iran suspend enrichment .
" if a solution can be found , it will cost the price of suspension , " a european diplomat said .
a second diplomat said one idea would be for iran to declare a moratorium on moving beyond activities it has already started , such as installing and running some 1,300 centrifuge machines as it seeks to upgrade from current research levels of enrichment to industrial production .
the moratorium could open the way for further talks with solana , with the un security council holding off on further sanctions against the islamic republic .
iran 's proposals involve it keeping at least a reduced level of enrichment work , diplomats said .
suspension or dismantling ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad vowed to push forward with efforts to enrich uranium non-proliferation expert gary samore told afp by telephone from washington that tehran wants the eu to agree to setting up an international consortium in iran for uranium enrichment .
but the major powers want such a consortium , which would process fuel for iran , to be set up outside the islamic republic .
a western diplomat said talks with the five permanent security council members plus germany would not in any case start before iran suspends enrichment .
" suspension does not mean dismantling what they have built , " the diplomat said , adding that the major powers were primarily interested in stopping the centrifuges from spinning in the refining of the u-235 isotope that makes for enriched uranium as well as keeping the iranians from learning how to run centrifuges .
iran faces a new security council deadline in one month , after which more sanctions could be imposed .

iran denies us and eu charges that it is trying to build nuclear weapons .
larijani told reporters that the talks with solana aimed to evaluate " new ideas " that might be put on the table , the anatolia news agency said .
but solana 's spokesperson cristina gallach said there were " no changes in the position of the international community " and added that the priority was simply to " create conditions for the beginning of negotiations . "
diplomats said there was little hope of a breakthrough given iran 's steadfast refusal to freeze its enrichment work .
an ongoing crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is unlikely that larijani and solana will reach a breakthrough solana will travel on thursday to oslo , where he will brief eu foreign ministers on his meeting with larijani .
iran is defying two un security council resolutions to halt enrichment , saying its program is a legitimate effort to generate civilian nuclear power .
the council has imposed limited sanctions as punishment .
diplomats told afp that while everyone was trying to find a formula to start talks , the two sides remain far apart on a crisis that began in 2002 when it was revealed that iran was secretly building nuclear facilities .
the united states , europe , russia and china are ready in a compromise gesture to give iran a chance to edge its way slowly into stopping uranium enrichment , diplomats said .
the six world powers - britain , china , france , germany , russia and the united states - had last june offered economic , technical and security benefits if iran would agree to the suspension .
but iran pressed ahead and negotiations never started .
several rounds of talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has imposed sanctions on iran because of its nuclear activities larijani and solana held several rounds of talks that failed to find a way to start meetings with the six powers .
the two envoys last met face-to-face on the sidelines of a munich security conference on feb 11 .
larijani said on wednesday that progress had been blocked when " some unacceptable , irrational conditions were put forward " - a clear reference to the demands that iran suspend enrichment .
" if a solution can be found , it will cost the price of suspension , " a european diplomat said .
a second diplomat said one idea would be for iran to declare a moratorium on moving beyond activities it has already started , such as installing and running some 1,300 centrifuge machines as it seeks to upgrade from current research levels of enrichment to industrial production .
the moratorium could open the way for further talks with solana , with the un security council holding off on further sanctions against the islamic republic .
iran 's proposals involve it keeping at least a reduced level of enrichment work , diplomats said .
suspension or dismantling ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad vowed to push forward with efforts to enrich uranium non-proliferation expert gary samore told afp by telephone from washington that tehran wants the eu to agree to setting up an international consortium in iran for uranium enrichment .
but the major powers want such a consortium , which would process fuel for iran , to be set up outside the islamic republic .
a western diplomat said talks with the five permanent security council members plus germany would not in any case start before iran suspends enrichment .
" suspension does not mean dismantling what they have built , " the diplomat said , adding that the major powers were primarily interested in stopping the centrifuges from spinning in the refining of the u-235 isotope that makes for enriched uranium as well as keeping the iranians from learning how to run centrifuges .
iran faces a new security council deadline in one month , after which more sanctions could be imposed .

germany has already heated up by 0.9 degrees celsius in the past century . germany can expect heavy storms and intense heat waves that cause numerous deaths , said wolfgang kusch , head of germany 's state-run meteorology service dwd , announcing the results of the meteorologists ' observations .
" climate change has become a fact of life , " he told a news conference .
germany 's annual median temperature increased by 0.9 degrees celsius to 8.2 c -lrb- 46 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- since 1901 and could rise another 2 to 5 degrees by 2100 , according to the dwd .
germany experienced the warmest decade of the 20th century from 1990 to 1999 as well as seeing a 9-percent rise in precipitation .
germany should be better prepared for global warming , kusch said , stressing that farmers in particular would be forced to deal with the effects .
the changing climate would also unleash greater risks for people 's health , such as infectious diseases and skin cancer .

as a result of the higher temperatures , germany would be subject to more rain and less snow in winter , causing ski resorts in the country 's south to close down , as tourism flourishes on the north and baltic seas .
cities would also see their temperatures rise beyond the 2 degree difference the dwd has already observed between urban areas and the surrounding countryside .

drogba 's well-established capacity for ruffling the composure of the liverpool defense was underlined as early as the eighth minute , the ivory coast striker 's knockdown from ashley cole 's cross teeing up frank lampard on the penalty spot .
the england midfielder managed to get his foot over the bouncing ball but his shot was too straight and jose reina was able to make a good block . a minute later , andriy shevchenko curled a shot narrowly over the angle of post and bar and liverpool were reprieved again when drogba failed to pick out an unmarked joe cole in the middle after john arne riise 's slack back pass had sent him sprinting clear through the inside right channel .
liverpool unbowed twenty minutes had elapsed before liverpool managed to muster a shot on the chelsea goal , bolo zenden 's wayward effort only adding to the frustration of the increasingly agitated rafael benitez on the touchline . dirk kuyt finally gave petr cech something to do shortly afterwards , although a kindly deflection off ricardo carvalho ensured his header flew straight to the midriff of the czech goalkeeper . chelsea were soon threatening again and , after drogba had failed to connect with joe cole 's inviting cross , lampard sent a 25-yard free-kick fizzing inches outside the base of reina 's right-hand post . the pressure finally told in the 29th minute as chelsea took the lead with a move launched by carvalho on the edge of his own area . the portuguese carried the ball out to the edge of the center circle before spreading the ball wide to drogba , who muscled past daniel agger and advanced into the area before pulling the ball back behind jamie carragher .
cutting in from the opposite flank at pace , joe cole was able to get in front of alvaro arbeloa and finish the move with the most straightforward of finishes from eight yards out . but two fine saves from reina kept out efforts from drogba and lampard and ensured chelsea 's win was restricted to the narrowest of margins .
rooney trumps kaka fans at old trafford were cheering early on tuesday , as the hosts scored after a corner kick in the fifth minute .
striker cristiano ronaldo fired a short-range header at milan keeper , who could only deflect the ball into his own net . but any hopes that united would replicate their 7-1 thrashing of rome in the quarterfinals were soon dashed .
kaka caught manchester 's defense napping and left-footed the ball past edwin van der sar from a nearly impossible angle . manchester was playing with a makeshift back four due to injury , and it showed .
shortly before half-time , kaka power his way through three defenders to send the visitors into the locker room with a 2-1 lead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaka twisted manchester 's defense into knots the hosts were clearly shocked and looked tentative when play resumed .
but paul scholes got them back on track in the sixtieth minute with a nifty lob pass in the box to rooney , who slipped the ball under dida . from there on in it was all united .
darren fletcher had two excellent scoring opportunities late in the match , only to be narrowly denied .
and rooney sealed the win for manchester in injury time with a curling blast into the lower left hand corner of the goal . it was a decent outcome for both sides .

that is why anti-terror legislations differ from country to country . terrorism is not a new phenomenon in europe .
in the united kingdom , spain and ireland alone , it has claimed 5,000 deaths over the last 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the effects of sept .
11 are felt strongly in europe the sept .
11 attacks on the united states , however , have had a rippling effect across the atlantic as well .
faced with the challenges posed by the war against international terrorism , which were only heightened by the attacks in london and madrid , european countries were forced to adapt and expand their anti-terror legislations .
" legislative and institutional requirements have definitely become stricter in all 27 member states of the european union , " said annegret bendiek of the german institute for international and security affairs and author of a study on fighting terrorism in the eu .
yet striking the right balance between efficient engagement in the war on terror and protection of civil liberties has n't been easy to achieve .
one policy , many implementations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the end of privacy ?
in june 2002 , the eu council passed two resolutions - one establishing a common european arrest warrant and one defining a common concept of terrorist offences which all the member states of the european union had to include in their legal system .
in december 2005 , the eu adopted its eu counter-terrorism strategy , but it left the responsibility for its implementation in the hands of individual member states .
" states like the united kingdom , france and also germany are of course very engaged , " bendiek said .
but european states continue to differ greatly in their institutional and legislative approaches .
tough measures of all the eu member states , the united kingdom has gone the farthest in expanding the legislation meant to counter acts of terrorism .
several months after the 2001 attacks on new york and washington , d.c , britain 's terrorism act of 2000 was replaced by the anti-terrorism , crime and security act which stipulated that foreign terrorist suspects could be detained indefinitely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2005 attacks in london lead to even stricter anti-terror laws after a public outcry and an intervention from the law lords - a judicial body of the upper house of the british parliament which serves as a court of last instance in the uk - this measure was abolished for being incompatible with the european convention of human rights .
its powers were later replaced by the so-called control order in the 2005 prevention of terrorism act .
the control order , however , still allows for comprehensive restriction of an individual 's liberties for the purpose of " protecting members of the public from a risk of terrorism . "
after the london bomb attacks in the summer of 2005 , the british legislation was made even stricter .
according to the terrorism act of 2006 , for example , " glorification of terrorist acts " can lead to a seven-year prison sentence .
it 's legal to eavesdrop ever since july 2005 , italy 's secret service has been allowed to monitor telephone conversations for the sake of preventing terrorist attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police surveillance is a cause of concern for privacy activists france adopted a new law this year that follows the british model allowing for surveillance cameras to be placed in public spaces such as train stations , churches and mosques , shops , factories or nuclear plants .
after a failed terrorist attack , in which crude propane gas bombs were primed to explode on two german trains on july 31 , the german government introduced a new law on fighting terrorism .
germany now has a computer databank which allows police and intelligence agencies easier access to a range of information on terrorism suspects , including membership of terrorist groups , firearms registration information as well as internet and telecommunications data .
not everybody can do it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you never know who 's listening in but smaller and less affluent eu countries are often lagging behind in terms of their legislative apparatus and implementation of counter-terrorist measures .
according to bendiek , malta , portugal or greece , for example , lack the administrative infrastructure , personnel and funds for implementing anti-terrorism laws .
in other countries , it is above all different legal traditions that cancel each other in various legislations .
" the british have fewer problems with video surveillance than the germans , " bendiek said .
" but as war as telephone surveillance is concerned , it could be the other way around .

" we have estimated that the mean temperature of this super-earth lies between 0 and 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 32 and 104 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , and water would thus be liquid , " said stephane udry of the geneva observatory .
" models predict that the planet should be either rocky like our earth or covered with oceans . "
the planet is located around a star known as the gliese 581 , about 20.5 light years from the earth 's solar system and one of the 100 closest stars to the sun .
ideal habitat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : light on the plant could be similar to a sunset on earth , scientists say though the planet is much closer to its star than the earth is to the sun , conditions are similar because the gliese 581 , known as a red dwarf , is smaller and colder .
one year lasts only 13 days on the planet .
" red dwarfs are ideal targets for the search for such planets because they emit less light , and the habitable zone is thus much closer to them than it is around the sun , " said xavier bonfils of lisbon university .
more than 200 so-called exoplanets - planets outside of the sun 's solar system - have been discovered in the passed 12 years since the first one was found .
most are massive bowls of gas similar to jupiter .

the same team of astronauts discovered a another planet around the same red dwarf two years ago - a neptune-sized planet about 15 times as massive as earth .
an extensive analysis of the latest find is to be revealed in the journal astronomy & astrophysics .
xavier delfosse of grenoble university in france said the newfound planet could inhabit life and will definitely be a target of future space missions to find extra-terrestrial beings .
" liquid water is critical to life as we know it , " he said .

gates , who was speaking after a meeting in berlin with german defense minister franz josef jung and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , said he would return to russia soon to continue discussions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gates -lrb- l -rrb- with german foreign minister steinmeier he said the us had offered to work closely with moscow and negotiate limits that would ensure the shield would not pose a threat to russia 's nuclear deterence .
" we will continue to consult with russia on missile defence as well as with our allies , " gates said .
" we 've made some very far-reaching proposals . "
" there is some debate in moscow about this dialogue , " he added .
attempts to alleviate russia 's concerns however , addressing a press conference in berlin with gates , jung said the aim was a " total concept " on missile defense and that the russian objections were " unjustified . "
the missile shield was intended as a " defensive function for the population , " jung said , adding that it was aimed at countering a threat that could be 10 years away .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gates with defense minister franz josef jung jung also said earlier in an interview with the daily sächsische zeitung published wednesday that he was confident the united states could alleviate russia 's concerns .
russia can be convinced of the necessity of the missile defense system " by explaining to them that there is a shared interest in security against missiles - for example from rogue states , " jung said .
german chancellor angela merkel has urged washington to engage russia on its concerns about us plans to deploy 10 interceptor missiles in poland and a radar in the czech republic by 2012 .
the four-billion-dollar project is aimed at countering a potential missile threat from iran , not russia .
scepticism about plan but the plan has antagonized moscow , which sees it as a further military encroachment in its former sphere of influence , and has aroused misgivings among some european allies .
on tuesday in warsaw , gates said he did not believe that russia was a military threat to poland " either now or -lrb- in the event that -rrb- we should install a missile defense . "
" the world changes in dramatic ways , and what we are talking about here is indivisible security for the united states and for our nato allies , " he said .
" we would like to extend that umbrella to russia , and partner with russia and have russia be with us in this program , " he said .
poland 's willingness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are many critics but also supporters of the plan poland 's conservative government , led by the president 's twin brother , prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , has signaled its willingness to host the base , but formal negotiations between washington and warsaw have not yet begun .
gates , who started the trip monday in moscow , has invited the russians to inspect a us missile defense interceptor site in fort greely , alaska and a radar in california to clear up what he said was russian misunderstanding about the capability of the system being proposed for europe .
" in terms of assurances that the system would not be changed years from now in a way that might be more threatening to the russian deterrent , it seems to me that it is a matter that can be negotiated , " he said .
gates provided no details and it was unclear whether the scope of such negotiations would involve the broader us missile defense system , or only the proposed european component . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu-russia mistrust nears cold war level , eu commissioner says mistrust and a lack of respect in the relations between the european union and russia are at their lowest level since the fall of communism , according to eu trade commissioner peter mandelson .

german chancellor angela merkel aimed to make climate change a central theme at the summit , being held under the german g8 presidency , pfaffenbach reiterated in berlin on tuesday .
in his remarks , pfaffenbach was careful not to mention the united states by name , however , it the recipient of his comments on climate change was clear . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : planes contribute to co2 emissions blamed for global warming he indicated the germany 's disappointment that the us was not yet prepared to submit to an internationally agreed climate protection regime along the lines of the 1997 kyoto protocol , which runs out in 2012 . pfaffenbach expressed optimism that criticism and protests by non-governmental organizations , which have voiced strident protest at past g8 summits , would be muted this time . anti-globalization organizations are predicting that up to 100,000 demonstrators will march in the eastern german city of rostock , while police estimate the number at half that .
larger organizations , like attac and greenpeace , have committed themselves to peaceful marches , while smaller , more radical , groups have refused to rule out violent protests like that in genoa in 2001 .
africa also high on the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel pledged to push g8 members to meet their development aid commitments merkel intended to meet ngo representatives in mid-may , and the ngos had welcomed the fact that the chancellor also intended to place africa high on the agenda , he said .
g8 members aimed to offer african countries a " broad political partnership " with the aim of promoting democracy and reducing corruption , pfaffenbach said .
he stressed that money was not the solution to everything , although the industrialized countries stood by their longstanding commitments , including allocating 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product to development aid by 2012 .
african countries needed to improve their governmental structures and attract more private capital , he said .

germany has already heated up by 0.9 degrees celsius in the past century . germany can expect heavy storms and intense heat waves that cause numerous deaths , said wolfgang kusch , head of germany 's state-run meteorology service dwd , announcing the results of the meteorologists ' observations .
" climate change has become a fact of life , " he told a news conference .
germany 's annual median temperature increased by 0.9 degrees celsius to 8.2 c -lrb- 46 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- since 1901 and could rise another 2 to 5 degrees by 2100 , according to the dwd .
germany experienced the warmest decade of the 20th century from 1990 to 1999 as well as seeing a 9-percent rise in precipitation .
germany should be better prepared for global warming , kusch said , stressing that farmers in particular would be forced to deal with the effects .
the changing climate would also unleash greater risks for people 's health , such as infectious diseases and skin cancer .
heat islands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 2006 deviation of temperature from the 1960-1990 average " we have to do all we can to ensure that the earth does not become uninhabitable , " kusch said .
as a result of the higher temperatures , germany would be subject to more rain and less snow in winter , causing ski resorts in the country 's south to close down , as tourism flourishes on the north and baltic seas .
cities would also see their temperatures rise beyond the 2 degree difference the dwd has already observed between urban areas and the surrounding countryside .
" german cities will increasingly become ' heat islands ' and there will be a growing need for fresh air corridors into cities , " he said .

that is why anti-terror legislations differ from country to country . terrorism is not a new phenomenon in europe .
in the united kingdom , spain and ireland alone , it has claimed 5,000 deaths over the last 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the effects of sept .
11 are felt strongly in europe the sept .
11 attacks on the united states , however , have had a rippling effect across the atlantic as well .
faced with the challenges posed by the war against international terrorism , which were only heightened by the attacks in london and madrid , european countries were forced to adapt and expand their anti-terror legislations .
" legislative and institutional requirements have definitely become stricter in all 27 member states of the european union , " said annegret bendiek of the german institute for international and security affairs and author of a study on fighting terrorism in the eu .
yet striking the right balance between efficient engagement in the war on terror and protection of civil liberties has n't been easy to achieve .
one policy , many implementations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the end of privacy ?
in june 2002 , the eu council passed two resolutions - one establishing a common european arrest warrant and one defining a common concept of terrorist offences which all the member states of the european union had to include in their legal system .
in december 2005 , the eu adopted its eu counter-terrorism strategy , but it left the responsibility for its implementation in the hands of individual member states .
" states like the united kingdom , france and also germany are of course very engaged , " bendiek said .
but european states continue to differ greatly in their institutional and legislative approaches .
tough measures of all the eu member states , the united kingdom has gone the farthest in expanding the legislation meant to counter acts of terrorism .
several months after the 2001 attacks on new york and washington , d.c , britain 's terrorism act of 2000 was replaced by the anti-terrorism , crime and security act which stipulated that foreign terrorist suspects could be detained indefinitely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2005 attacks in london lead to even stricter anti-terror laws after a public outcry and an intervention from the law lords - a judicial body of the upper house of the british parliament which serves as a court of last instance in the uk - this measure was abolished for being incompatible with the european convention of human rights .
its powers were later replaced by the so-called control order in the 2005 prevention of terrorism act .
the control order , however , still allows for comprehensive restriction of an individual 's liberties for the purpose of " protecting members of the public from a risk of terrorism . "
after the london bomb attacks in the summer of 2005 , the british legislation was made even stricter .
according to the terrorism act of 2006 , for example , " glorification of terrorist acts " can lead to a seven-year prison sentence .
it 's legal to eavesdrop ever since july 2005 , italy 's secret service has been allowed to monitor telephone conversations for the sake of preventing terrorist attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police surveillance is a cause of concern for privacy activists france adopted a new law this year that follows the british model allowing for surveillance cameras to be placed in public spaces such as train stations , churches and mosques , shops , factories or nuclear plants .
after a failed terrorist attack , in which crude propane gas bombs were primed to explode on two german trains on july 31 , the german government introduced a new law on fighting terrorism .
germany now has a computer databank which allows police and intelligence agencies easier access to a range of information on terrorism suspects , including membership of terrorist groups , firearms registration information as well as internet and telecommunications data .
not everybody can do it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you never know who 's listening in but smaller and less affluent eu countries are often lagging behind in terms of their legislative apparatus and implementation of counter-terrorist measures .
according to bendiek , malta , portugal or greece , for example , lack the administrative infrastructure , personnel and funds for implementing anti-terrorism laws .
in other countries , it is above all different legal traditions that cancel each other in various legislations .
" the british have fewer problems with video surveillance than the germans , " bendiek said .
" but as war as telephone surveillance is concerned , it could be the other way around .

german chancellor angela merkel aimed to make climate change a central theme at the summit , being held under the german g8 presidency , pfaffenbach reiterated in berlin on tuesday .
in his remarks , pfaffenbach was careful not to mention the united states by name , however , it the recipient of his comments on climate change was clear . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : planes contribute to co2 emissions blamed for global warming he indicated the germany 's disappointment that the us was not yet prepared to submit to an internationally agreed climate protection regime along the lines of the 1997 kyoto protocol , which runs out in 2012 . pfaffenbach expressed optimism that criticism and protests by non-governmental organizations , which have voiced strident protest at past g8 summits , would be muted this time . anti-globalization organizations are predicting that up to 100,000 demonstrators will march in the eastern german city of rostock , while police estimate the number at half that .
larger organizations , like attac and greenpeace , have committed themselves to peaceful marches , while smaller , more radical , groups have refused to rule out violent protests like that in genoa in 2001 .
africa also high on the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel pledged to push g8 members to meet their development aid commitments merkel intended to meet ngo representatives in mid-may , and the ngos had welcomed the fact that the chancellor also intended to place africa high on the agenda , he said .
g8 members aimed to offer african countries a " broad political partnership " with the aim of promoting democracy and reducing corruption , pfaffenbach said .
he stressed that money was not the solution to everything , although the industrialized countries stood by their longstanding commitments , including allocating 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product to development aid by 2012 .
african countries needed to improve their governmental structures and attract more private capital , he said .

german chancellor angela merkel aimed to make climate change a central theme at the summit , being held under the german g8 presidency , pfaffenbach reiterated in berlin on tuesday .
in his remarks , pfaffenbach was careful not to mention the united states by name , however , it the recipient of his comments on climate change was clear . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : planes contribute to co2 emissions blamed for global warming he indicated the germany 's disappointment that the us was not yet prepared to submit to an internationally agreed climate protection regime along the lines of the 1997 kyoto protocol , which runs out in 2012 . pfaffenbach expressed optimism that criticism and protests by non-governmental organizations , which have voiced strident protest at past g8 summits , would be muted this time . anti-globalization organizations are predicting that up to 100,000 demonstrators will march in the eastern german city of rostock , while police estimate the number at half that .
larger organizations , like attac and greenpeace , have committed themselves to peaceful marches , while smaller , more radical , groups have refused to rule out violent protests like that in genoa in 2001 .
africa also high on the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel pledged to push g8 members to meet their development aid commitments merkel intended to meet ngo representatives in mid-may , and the ngos had welcomed the fact that the chancellor also intended to place africa high on the agenda , he said .
g8 members aimed to offer african countries a " broad political partnership " with the aim of promoting democracy and reducing corruption , pfaffenbach said .
he stressed that money was not the solution to everything , although the industrialized countries stood by their longstanding commitments , including allocating 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product to development aid by 2012 .
african countries needed to improve their governmental structures and attract more private capital , he said .

gates , who was speaking after a meeting in berlin with german defense minister franz josef jung and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , said he would return to russia soon to continue discussions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gates -lrb- l -rrb- with german foreign minister steinmeier he said the us had offered to work closely with moscow and negotiate limits that would ensure the shield would not pose a threat to russia 's nuclear deterence .
" we will continue to consult with russia on missile defence as well as with our allies , " gates said .
" we 've made some very far-reaching proposals . "
" there is some debate in moscow about this dialogue , " he added .
attempts to alleviate russia 's concerns however , addressing a press conference in berlin with gates , jung said the aim was a " total concept " on missile defense and that the russian objections were " unjustified . "
the missile shield was intended as a " defensive function for the population , " jung said , adding that it was aimed at countering a threat that could be 10 years away .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gates with defense minister franz josef jung jung also said earlier in an interview with the daily sächsische zeitung published wednesday that he was confident the united states could alleviate russia 's concerns .
russia can be convinced of the necessity of the missile defense system " by explaining to them that there is a shared interest in security against missiles - for example from rogue states , " jung said .
german chancellor angela merkel has urged washington to engage russia on its concerns about us plans to deploy 10 interceptor missiles in poland and a radar in the czech republic by 2012 .
the four-billion-dollar project is aimed at countering a potential missile threat from iran , not russia .
scepticism about plan but the plan has antagonized moscow , which sees it as a further military encroachment in its former sphere of influence , and has aroused misgivings among some european allies .
on tuesday in warsaw , gates said he did not believe that russia was a military threat to poland " either now or -lrb- in the event that -rrb- we should install a missile defense . "
" the world changes in dramatic ways , and what we are talking about here is indivisible security for the united states and for our nato allies , " he said .
" we would like to extend that umbrella to russia , and partner with russia and have russia be with us in this program , " he said .
poland 's willingness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are many critics but also supporters of the plan poland 's conservative government , led by the president 's twin brother , prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , has signaled its willingness to host the base , but formal negotiations between washington and warsaw have not yet begun .
gates , who started the trip monday in moscow , has invited the russians to inspect a us missile defense interceptor site in fort greely , alaska and a radar in california to clear up what he said was russian misunderstanding about the capability of the system being proposed for europe .
" in terms of assurances that the system would not be changed years from now in a way that might be more threatening to the russian deterrent , it seems to me that it is a matter that can be negotiated , " he said .

" we have estimated that the mean temperature of this super-earth lies between 0 and 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 32 and 104 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , and water would thus be liquid , " said stephane udry of the geneva observatory .
" models predict that the planet should be either rocky like our earth or covered with oceans . "
the planet is located around a star known as the gliese 581 , about 20.5 light years from the earth 's solar system and one of the 100 closest stars to the sun .
ideal habitat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : light on the plant could be similar to a sunset on earth , scientists say though the planet is much closer to its star than the earth is to the sun , conditions are similar because the gliese 581 , known as a red dwarf , is smaller and colder .
one year lasts only 13 days on the planet .
" red dwarfs are ideal targets for the search for such planets because they emit less light , and the habitable zone is thus much closer to them than it is around the sun , " said xavier bonfils of lisbon university .
more than 200 so-called exoplanets - planets outside of the sun 's solar system - have been discovered in the passed 12 years since the first one was found .
most are massive bowls of gas similar to jupiter .
universal treasure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the planet resemble earth one day ?
the same team of astronauts discovered a another planet around the same red dwarf two years ago - a neptune-sized planet about 15 times as massive as earth .
an extensive analysis of the latest find is to be revealed in the journal astronomy & astrophysics .
xavier delfosse of grenoble university in france said the newfound planet could inhabit life and will definitely be a target of future space missions to find extra-terrestrial beings .
" liquid water is critical to life as we know it , " he said .
" on the treasure map of the universe , one would be tempted to mark this planet with an x.

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economy minister michael glos " the upturn is continuing , growth remains strong and the situation in the labor market keeps getting better , " glos said .
citing germany 's robust export performance , glos said the present level of the euro was " sustainable , " but warned that a strong currency can threaten a country 's exports , making them more expensive and less competitive on world markets .
" if it -lrb- the euro -rrb- were to rise still more strongly , there would be risks , " glos said .
he was speaking as the euro moved closer to an all-time high point against the dollar , soaring to 1.3656 on wednesday , well within striking distance of 1.3666 , its record level reached on dec 30 , 2004 .

analysts polled by news agency thomson financial had predicted a far more modest surge , to 107.8 points .
" germany is profiting from the extraordinary international investment boom , which due to germany 's specialization is having a stronger cyclical impact than in the other major european countries , " ifo president hans-werner sinn said in a statement .
for its monthly survey , ifo polls some 7,000 companies about their assessment of current business and their expectations for the next six months .

the unemployment rate in march fell to 9.8 percent .
ifo said in retailing and wholesaling , the business climate had also brightened noticeably in march with companies giving more positive appraisals of both their current situation and their six-month outlook .

" of course , a considerable share of those exports would go to other euro area countries .
but , thus far , the mood amongst german manufacturers seems to be defiant regarding the euro , " she said , adding that the strong single currency and a us slowdown could leave " skid marks " in the future .

german chancellor angela merkel aimed to make climate change a central theme at the summit , being held under the german g8 presidency , pfaffenbach reiterated in berlin on tuesday .
in his remarks , pfaffenbach was careful not to mention the united states by name , however , it the recipient of his comments on climate change was clear . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : planes contribute to co2 emissions blamed for global warming he indicated the germany 's disappointment that the us was not yet prepared to submit to an internationally agreed climate protection regime along the lines of the 1997 kyoto protocol , which runs out in 2012 . pfaffenbach expressed optimism that criticism and protests by non-governmental organizations , which have voiced strident protest at past g8 summits , would be muted this time . anti-globalization organizations are predicting that up to 100,000 demonstrators will march in the eastern german city of rostock , while police estimate the number at half that .
larger organizations , like attac and greenpeace , have committed themselves to peaceful marches , while smaller , more radical , groups have refused to rule out violent protests like that in genoa in 2001 .
africa also high on the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel pledged to push g8 members to meet their development aid commitments merkel intended to meet ngo representatives in mid-may , and the ngos had welcomed the fact that the chancellor also intended to place africa high on the agenda , he said .
g8 members aimed to offer african countries a " broad political partnership " with the aim of promoting democracy and reducing corruption , pfaffenbach said .
he stressed that money was not the solution to everything , although the industrialized countries stood by their longstanding commitments , including allocating 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product to development aid by 2012 .
african countries needed to improve their governmental structures and attract more private capital , he said .
algeria , egypt , ghana , nigeria , senegal and south africa have been invited to the conference , as have brazil , china , india and mexico . dw staff / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel pledges to keep africa on international agenda german chancellor angela merkel said tuesday that the world 's industrialized countries do not need to set new goals to help the developing world but keep the promises they have already made .

drogba 's well-established capacity for ruffling the composure of the liverpool defense was underlined as early as the eighth minute , the ivory coast striker 's knockdown from ashley cole 's cross teeing up frank lampard on the penalty spot .
the england midfielder managed to get his foot over the bouncing ball but his shot was too straight and jose reina was able to make a good block . a minute later , andriy shevchenko curled a shot narrowly over the angle of post and bar and liverpool were reprieved again when drogba failed to pick out an unmarked joe cole in the middle after john arne riise 's slack back pass had sent him sprinting clear through the inside right channel .
liverpool unbowed twenty minutes had elapsed before liverpool managed to muster a shot on the chelsea goal , bolo zenden 's wayward effort only adding to the frustration of the increasingly agitated rafael benitez on the touchline . dirk kuyt finally gave petr cech something to do shortly afterwards , although a kindly deflection off ricardo carvalho ensured his header flew straight to the midriff of the czech goalkeeper . chelsea were soon threatening again and , after drogba had failed to connect with joe cole 's inviting cross , lampard sent a 25-yard free-kick fizzing inches outside the base of reina 's right-hand post . the pressure finally told in the 29th minute as chelsea took the lead with a move launched by carvalho on the edge of his own area . the portuguese carried the ball out to the edge of the center circle before spreading the ball wide to drogba , who muscled past daniel agger and advanced into the area before pulling the ball back behind jamie carragher .
cutting in from the opposite flank at pace , joe cole was able to get in front of alvaro arbeloa and finish the move with the most straightforward of finishes from eight yards out . but two fine saves from reina kept out efforts from drogba and lampard and ensured chelsea 's win was restricted to the narrowest of margins .
rooney trumps kaka fans at old trafford were cheering early on tuesday , as the hosts scored after a corner kick in the fifth minute .
striker cristiano ronaldo fired a short-range header at milan keeper , who could only deflect the ball into his own net . but any hopes that united would replicate their 7-1 thrashing of rome in the quarterfinals were soon dashed .
kaka caught manchester 's defense napping and left-footed the ball past edwin van der sar from a nearly impossible angle . manchester was playing with a makeshift back four due to injury , and it showed .
shortly before half-time , kaka power his way through three defenders to send the visitors into the locker room with a 2-1 lead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaka twisted manchester 's defense into knots the hosts were clearly shocked and looked tentative when play resumed .
but paul scholes got them back on track in the sixtieth minute with a nifty lob pass in the box to rooney , who slipped the ball under dida . from there on in it was all united .
darren fletcher had two excellent scoring opportunities late in the match , only to be narrowly denied .
and rooney sealed the win for manchester in injury time with a curling blast into the lower left hand corner of the goal . it was a decent outcome for both sides .

" if it -lrb- the euro -rrb- were to rise still more strongly , there would be risks , " glos said .

" the company needs clarity with regard to its leadership during these times , " kleinfeld said .
" i have therefore decided not to make myself available for an extension of my contract . " his successor has not been named . kleinfeld refused to accept the board delaying a vote on the contract , company officials said , as a result paving the way for a major shakeout in the group 's top management . his decision to leave the company after a two-decade career followed last week 's dramatic announcement by siemens chairman heinrich von pierer that he was resigning . slush-fund probe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner von siemens started the company in 1847 although cleared of any wrongdoing , kleinfeld 's future had hung in the balance as the siemens ' board considered whether far-reaching changes of the group 's management were necessary to help give the group a new start as it contended with an ongoing slush-fund probe . ahead of wednesday 's meeting , german media had reported that supervisory board members had started a search for a possible successor for kleinfeld as part of a push for a major shakeout of the company 's top management . despite launching an internal company investigation into recent scandals and stepping up corporate control procedures , kleinfeld has come under fire for failing to act sooner in dealing with allegations of corruption . this included claims that funds totaling as much as 420 million euros -lrb- $ 573 million dollars -rrb- had been siphoned off into illicit accounts over the last seven years . won praise during his two years at the helm of siemens , kleinfeld has also won plaudits from investors for his efforts to boost the company 's finances through big cuts in the company 's workforce and a major acquisitions drive . siemens ' shares edged down 0.94 percent to 88.36 euros as trading drew to a close wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinrich von pierer said last week he would step down the almost herculean task of steering siemens out of the crisis that has engulfed the company in recent months now falls on german steel giant thyssenkrupp ag 's chairman gerhard cromme , who is to takeover as board chairman from von pierer . ending his long career with the company , von pierer insisted he was not taking personal responsibility for the scandals that have badly shaken the company .
these included allegations that members of management channeled funds into an employer-friendly labor group . at the helm 66-year-old von pierer had presided over the company 's management both as chief executive and then as chairman during the time the corruption was alleged to have taken place . von pierer stepped aside as chief executive in 2005 to make way for kleinfeld , who was his protégé . the scandals have , however , also largely overshadowed siemens ' recent solid financial performance . data released tuesday evening by the company showed second-quarter net profit surged 36 percent to 1.259 billion euros .
this beat analysts ' forecasts of a rise to 1.193 billion euros . the group said revenues jumped 10 percent in the quarter to 20.626 billion euros . at the same time , siemens said orders increased nine percent to 23.469 billion euros , while group profit climbed 49 percent to 1.964 billion euros . dw staff / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de uncertainty continues at the top of siemens the supervisory board of siemens will determine on wednesday whether ceo klaus kleinfeld will stay on at the german electronics giant .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.04.2007 business confidence surges as germany boosts growth outlook großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economic forecasters are promissing sunny and clear skies business confidence in germany continued to climb in april as the booming german economy , the biggest in the 13-country eurozone , was bolstered by international investment , a survey showed wednesday . the widely watched business climate index , calculated each month by the munich-based economic research institute ifo , came as economy minister michael glos raised the german economic growth forecast for 2007 to 2.3 percent - a sharp rise on the previous prediction of 1.7 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economy minister michael glos " the upturn is continuing , growth remains strong and the situation in the labor market keeps getting better , " glos said .
citing germany 's robust export performance , glos said the present level of the euro was " sustainable , " but warned that a strong currency can threaten a country 's exports , making them more expensive and less competitive on world markets .
" if it -lrb- the euro -rrb- were to rise still more strongly , there would be risks , " glos said .
he was speaking as the euro moved closer to an all-time high point against the dollar , soaring to 1.3656 on wednesday , well within striking distance of 1.3666 , its record level reached on dec 30 , 2004 .
surpassing expectations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro moved closer to an all-time high point against the dollar the influential ifo index rose to 108.6 points in april from 107.7 points in march , putting it just one-tenth of a point away from the record score of 108.7 points recorded in december .
analysts polled by news agency thomson financial had predicted a far more modest surge , to 107.8 points .
" germany is profiting from the extraordinary international investment boom , which due to germany 's specialization is having a stronger cyclical impact than in the other major european countries , " ifo president hans-werner sinn said in a statement .
for its monthly survey , ifo polls some 7,000 companies about their assessment of current business and their expectations for the next six months .
a breakdown of the data showed that the current sentiment sub-index rose to 113.2 points in april from 112.4 points in march .
and the expectations sub-index also increased , rising to 104.3 points from 103.2 points , ifo said .
analysts said the data were further proof that the german economy has weathered a steep hike in value-added tax this year .
jumping over hurdles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany increased its vat to 19 procent this year on jan 1 , the german government increased vat by three full percentage points to 19 percent , the biggest-ever single rise in a move experts said would put the brakes on consumer spending and therefore drag on overall growth .
the robust health of the economy is now expected to reduce public debt and buoy the job market .
the unemployment rate in march fell to 9.8 percent .
ifo said in retailing and wholesaling , the business climate had also brightened noticeably in march with companies giving more positive appraisals of both their current situation and their six-month outlook .
sentiment in the construction industry , however , remained unchanged .
positive outlook bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german manufacturers are confident about their exports elga bartsch of morgan stanley said the fact the euro had hit a two-year peak against the dollar had not hurt germany 's export-driven economy .
" notwithstanding the stronger euro , the ifo institute also reported an improvement in the export expectations of german manufacturers , " bartsch said .
" of course , a considerable share of those exports would go to other euro area countries .
but , thus far , the mood amongst german manufacturers seems to be defiant regarding the euro , " she said , adding that the strong single currency and a us slowdown could leave " skid marks " in the future .
laying the groundwork bank of america 's holger schmieding said german companies had helped lay the groundwork for the sharp economic upturn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank may end up raising its interest rates " with export expectations up according to an ifo spokesman , it shows that the severe slashing of costs that german corporations had to do in the years since 2000 is paying off nicely , " he said .
" german exports are competitive .
so far , strong demand from asia , central and eastern europe as well as the oil countries seems to offset the rise in the euro and weaker us demand . "
the sunny outlook in germany would provide additional arguments for the european central bank to continue raising its key interest rates , analysts said .
" along with rises in business confidence in belgium and netherlands , the surveys released so far this month support our view that the ecb will raise rates to 4.00 percent in june and once again in to 4.25 percent by year-end , " said sunil kapadia of ubs investment research . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de soccer world cup hardly touched german economy the patriotism and high spirits unleashed by this past summer 's world cup were expected to boost the german economy , but experts say the soccer event had virtually no impact on growth and employment .
-lrb- 21.04.2007 -rrb- outlook for german economy remains sunny the country 's top economic institutes are raising their forecast for economic growth this year by two thirds , which could mean a higher tax take , stronger domestic demand and lower unemployment .
-lrb- 19.04.2007 -rrb- optimism grows on outlook for german economy the run of good news for the german economy , europe 's biggest , looks set to continue for some time , with bundesbank president axel weber arguing on monday that current growth marks only the beginning of a longer upturn .

some media experts have called the appointment of a minority anchorwoman " revolutionary . "
do you see it that way too ? gualtiero zambonini : i would n't call it revolutionary , but it 's definitely an important signal in the right direction .
at wdr , we 've had asli sevindim , a turkish-german journalist , as the main anchorwoman of our evening prime-time news show for over a year now .
another of our turkish-german editors , birand bingül , belongs to the team of commentators on the prime-time news show on the ard network . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-iraqi journalist dunja hayali is the new face of german tv network zdf so , in a way zdf is following us .
but that 's also important because it 's a sign that the public broadcasters in germany have realized the necessity of reflecting this development in society both in their programs as well as in the profiles of their presenters . there are still very few minority presenters on the german networks .
why is that the case ? at wdr , we 've been developing measures for the past four years at least to try and get immigrant journalists on mainstream programs .
but in reality , we are only at the beginning of the road .
nobody should be under the illusion that just because we have a presenter of iraqi origin on zdf or an anchorwoman with a turkish background on wdr , we 've taken care of the problem .
these examples are important for two reasons .
firstly , because they show how seriously we want to promote the issue .
and secondly , because these role models are a sign to potential journalists who perhaps have n't trusted themselves up to now or did n't think that presenting a prime-time news show on major networks could be something for a person with an iraqi or an italian name .
it provides encouragement for more immigrants to pursue journalism careers . in the past , these signs were missing as was a hiring policy among media companies that consciously looked for minority journalists and signaled " we want more of them . "
that 's part of the problem why there are such few minority journalists in newsrooms and in front of cameras and microphones .
we simply realized the problem too late in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's immigrants do n't usually have the chance to study journalism the other part of the problem is that it 's only now in the second and third generation of immigrants that talent and potential is coming to the fore in the german media market .
these are children from immigrant families who grew up here and went to school and university .
this is a development that took place much earlier in countries such as britain or the netherlands partly because some of these nations have a history of immigration different from germany 's . how does germany compare with other countries in europe when it comes to integrating its immigrants into television ? we can definitely learn from good examples in europe , for instance from countries such as sweden or the netherlands where there are integration policies at the broadcasters and corresponding laws .
in the netherlands for example , minorities are entitled to have a certain share of programming in the media and there are laws governing it .
that obviously creates a whole new basis for the question about which journalists the networks hire . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british tv comes closer to reflecting social reality at the same time , that does n't mean there are no problems in these countries .
in the netherlands , there are still too many programs that are white - that means there are too many white dutch faces and not enough immigrants .
in britain , the situation is slightly different .
for instance , bbc international is a wonderful example of journalistic diversity , but that 's not the case in all bbc programs .
my colleagues at bbc say , ' it 's good that we 've achieved some goals , but we 're still far removed from truly representing society in the media . ' we can learn from the french too , who are redoubling efforts to tackle the problem of a lack of minority journalists .
but we 're generally lagging behind in europe .
the important thing is that we 've all recognized the problem . what else needs to be done at the networks for there to be a real change ? a rethink is already taking place among the top managers at the broadcasters as a result of pressure from politicians , societal developments as well as pressure from european policies which have placed integration of minorities high on the agenda .
one has to say that is not just a question of values and good sense but also a question of the market .
we have to take demographic developments into account .
today every fifth person in germany has an immigrant background .
among the younger generations in big cities , it 's every second person .
that means that viewers too have changed and this viewer ship lives in a culture of diversity .
if we do n't take these viewers into account , then we lose the right to exist .
it really is a question of our existence . but to really make progress on the issue , there has to be a change in the media company culture as well as in the way funds are managed .
in addition , the issue has to be anchored in the guiding principles of the broadcasters and supported with further training programs for employees as well as managers .
if nothing changes in the minds of the decision-makers , then we ca n't solve the problem . i believe that the public broadcasters bear a special responsibility towards promoting integration of immigrants .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de champions league -pipe- 25.04.2007 chelsea wins narrowly in champions league semifinal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liverpool 's ready to take chelsea at home joe cole scored the only goal of the game as chelsea emerged from the first leg of their champions league semi-final with a 1-0 advantage over liverpool to take to anfield . after generating enough chances to put the tie beyond doubt , particularly in a first-half they comfortably dominated , jose mourinho 's side were put under sufficient pressure after the break for liverpool to head home believing they can turn things around in front of their own supporters . cole 's 29th-minute winner , a close-range effort created by didier drogba 's power-packed run and astute pass , was a fine goal .
drogba 's well-established capacity for ruffling the composure of the liverpool defense was underlined as early as the eighth minute , the ivory coast striker 's knockdown from ashley cole 's cross teeing up frank lampard on the penalty spot .
the england midfielder managed to get his foot over the bouncing ball but his shot was too straight and jose reina was able to make a good block . a minute later , andriy shevchenko curled a shot narrowly over the angle of post and bar and liverpool were reprieved again when drogba failed to pick out an unmarked joe cole in the middle after john arne riise 's slack back pass had sent him sprinting clear through the inside right channel .
liverpool unbowed twenty minutes had elapsed before liverpool managed to muster a shot on the chelsea goal , bolo zenden 's wayward effort only adding to the frustration of the increasingly agitated rafael benitez on the touchline . dirk kuyt finally gave petr cech something to do shortly afterwards , although a kindly deflection off ricardo carvalho ensured his header flew straight to the midriff of the czech goalkeeper . chelsea were soon threatening again and , after drogba had failed to connect with joe cole 's inviting cross , lampard sent a 25-yard free-kick fizzing inches outside the base of reina 's right-hand post . the pressure finally told in the 29th minute as chelsea took the lead with a move launched by carvalho on the edge of his own area . the portuguese carried the ball out to the edge of the center circle before spreading the ball wide to drogba , who muscled past daniel agger and advanced into the area before pulling the ball back behind jamie carragher .
cutting in from the opposite flank at pace , joe cole was able to get in front of alvaro arbeloa and finish the move with the most straightforward of finishes from eight yards out . but two fine saves from reina kept out efforts from drogba and lampard and ensured chelsea 's win was restricted to the narrowest of margins .
rooney trumps kaka fans at old trafford were cheering early on tuesday , as the hosts scored after a corner kick in the fifth minute .
striker cristiano ronaldo fired a short-range header at milan keeper , who could only deflect the ball into his own net . but any hopes that united would replicate their 7-1 thrashing of rome in the quarterfinals were soon dashed .
kaka caught manchester 's defense napping and left-footed the ball past edwin van der sar from a nearly impossible angle . manchester was playing with a makeshift back four due to injury , and it showed .
shortly before half-time , kaka power his way through three defenders to send the visitors into the locker room with a 2-1 lead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaka twisted manchester 's defense into knots the hosts were clearly shocked and looked tentative when play resumed .
but paul scholes got them back on track in the sixtieth minute with a nifty lob pass in the box to rooney , who slipped the ball under dida . from there on in it was all united .
darren fletcher had two excellent scoring opportunities late in the match , only to be narrowly denied .
and rooney sealed the win for manchester in injury time with a curling blast into the lower left hand corner of the goal . it was a decent outcome for both sides .

iran denies us and eu charges that it is trying to build nuclear weapons .
larijani told reporters that the talks with solana aimed to evaluate " new ideas " that might be put on the table , the anatolia news agency said .
but solana 's spokesperson cristina gallach said there were " no changes in the position of the international community " and added that the priority was simply to " create conditions for the beginning of negotiations . "
diplomats said there was little hope of a breakthrough given iran 's steadfast refusal to freeze its enrichment work .
an ongoing crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is unlikely that larijani and solana will reach a breakthrough solana will travel on thursday to oslo , where he will brief eu foreign ministers on his meeting with larijani .
iran is defying two un security council resolutions to halt enrichment , saying its program is a legitimate effort to generate civilian nuclear power .
the council has imposed limited sanctions as punishment .
diplomats told afp that while everyone was trying to find a formula to start talks , the two sides remain far apart on a crisis that began in 2002 when it was revealed that iran was secretly building nuclear facilities .
the united states , europe , russia and china are ready in a compromise gesture to give iran a chance to edge its way slowly into stopping uranium enrichment , diplomats said .
the six world powers - britain , china , france , germany , russia and the united states - had last june offered economic , technical and security benefits if iran would agree to the suspension .
but iran pressed ahead and negotiations never started .
several rounds of talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has imposed sanctions on iran because of its nuclear activities larijani and solana held several rounds of talks that failed to find a way to start meetings with the six powers .
the two envoys last met face-to-face on the sidelines of a munich security conference on feb 11 .
larijani said on wednesday that progress had been blocked when " some unacceptable , irrational conditions were put forward " - a clear reference to the demands that iran suspend enrichment .
" if a solution can be found , it will cost the price of suspension , " a european diplomat said .
a second diplomat said one idea would be for iran to declare a moratorium on moving beyond activities it has already started , such as installing and running some 1,300 centrifuge machines as it seeks to upgrade from current research levels of enrichment to industrial production .
the moratorium could open the way for further talks with solana , with the un security council holding off on further sanctions against the islamic republic .
iran 's proposals involve it keeping at least a reduced level of enrichment work , diplomats said .
suspension or dismantling ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad vowed to push forward with efforts to enrich uranium non-proliferation expert gary samore told afp by telephone from washington that tehran wants the eu to agree to setting up an international consortium in iran for uranium enrichment .
but the major powers want such a consortium , which would process fuel for iran , to be set up outside the islamic republic .
a western diplomat said talks with the five permanent security council members plus germany would not in any case start before iran suspends enrichment .
" suspension does not mean dismantling what they have built , " the diplomat said , adding that the major powers were primarily interested in stopping the centrifuges from spinning in the refining of the u-235 isotope that makes for enriched uranium as well as keeping the iranians from learning how to run centrifuges .
iran faces a new security council deadline in one month , after which more sanctions could be imposed .
the united states has not ruled out a military attack to bring iran to heel . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran 's release of sailors gives hope in nuclear negotiations iran 's release of the captured british sailors hints at a more pragmatic , less radical approach towards the west , say analysts .
the move stirs hope of a possible return to negotiations in the iran nuclear stand-off .
-lrb- 06.04.2007 -rrb- opinion : a pointless resolution the un security council 's latest resolution that imposes sanctions on iran for refusing to halt its nuclear program can only make it more difficult to solve the problem , writes dw 's peter philipp .

but experts say it spotlights the long way the country needs to go to visibly integrate its immigrants . at the end of april , dunja hayali , a german journalist of iraqi origin , will break the mold when she begins co-anchoring the main news show on zdf , one of germany 's biggest public television networks . in a country where a fifth of the population has an immigrant background , experts said minority presenters of all backgrounds remain conspicuously absent on mainstream television information and news programs . " it does n't matter whether you have turkish roots and look obviously different or have blond hair and blue eyes and blend in with germans , " said minou amir-sehhi , a freelance german-iranian tv journalist for the publicly funded ard network who coordinates the " intercultural network " at the german association of journalists -lrb- djv -rrb- . " there 's been a general wariness about contact with other accents and cultures in the country , and that 's reflected on television . " in the entire media industry , about 3 percent of journalists are estimated to have an immigrant background . striving for normality a sprinkling of immigrant presenters is currently to be found on some private channels and stations such as mtv .
on the influential public broadcasters , a few tend to be on niche programs devoted to issues of multiculturalism and integration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cherno jobatey is one of the few minority presenters on german television in that context , hayali 's appointment is " quite revolutionary , " said amir-sehhi . " it 's a sign of normality when you have a person with an immigrant background casually reading the news or the sports results on a major network instead of being shown as a problem or an exotic stereotype , " she said . experts added that in recent years a vocal debate about integration of immigrants has raised awareness about the role media , especially television with its high-profile visibility and reach , can play . the german government has also weighed in , urging the networks to recruit more journalists and tv presenters from immigrant minorities . " we have to make immigrants more visible in german television , " state secretary for integration maria böhmer told the daily süddeutsche zeitung .
" i keep hearing from immigrants that they do n't see themselves represented by the public sector broadcasters .
there is n't enough awareness of their experience of life , and there are n't enough immigrants in front of or behind the camera . " for example , having a turkish anchorwoman needs to become a normal thing , " she added .
" we need more reporters who themselves know the immigrants ’ world and can convey it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presenter arabella kiesbauer is a popular face on the private prosieben channel some observers said further examples such as hayali 's could also provide much-needed role models for immigrants . " it 's a sign to potential journalists who perhaps have n't trusted themselves to think that presenting a prime-time news show on a major network could be a job for a person with an italian or an iraqi name , " said gualtiero zambonini , commissioner for integration at cologne-based public network wdr , one of the few broadcasters to have such a post . learning from the netherlands ? at a european level , germany lags behind countries such as britain , where black and asian presenters are established on the bbc , and france , where a black anchorman , harry roselmack , has been hosting the country 's most popular news program . immigrants in those countries come largely from former colonies and share the language of the adopted nation , making it easier for them to break into the media . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harry roselmack is the first black anchorman on france 's most popular tv news show zambonini pointed out that germany could take a page from the netherlands ' book . " for example , minorities in the netherlands are entitled to have a certain share of programming in the media and there are laws governing it , " said zambonini .
" that obviously creates a whole new basis for the question about which journalists the networks hire . " networks doing a rethink german broadcasters , prodded by the government , are also reexamining their policies . dunja hayali said broadcaster zdf made no secret of the fact they were consciously seeking a minority presenter when they hired her . " of course my qualifications were the most important criterion , but there 's no denying my immigrant background was an added plus in bagging the job , " said hayali , who previously moderated a news show at dw-tv . demographic pressures are also forcing public broadcasters , which are partly financed by tv licensing fees , to adapt to a changed viewership . " today every fifth person in germany has an immigrant background , among the young generation in the big cities it 's every second , " said zambonini .
" we just have to take these viewers into account , otherwise we lose our right to exist . " not enough immigrant journalists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children with immigrant backgrounds often perform poorly at schools in germany but the biggest problem for the networks , experts said , is finding minority journalists . " the pool of potential immigrant journalists is tiny , which shows that promoting diversity has just not been a priority for media networks , " said lutz michel , head of the mmb institute for media research in essen . he added that a combination of poor language skills , lack of an academic environment at home and insufficient educational qualifications prevent many from opting for a career in journalism . an oecd study last year found that children from immigrant families in germany have fewer chances to succeed at school than in almost any other industrialized country . a long way to go most media observers agree that only a shared drive by politicians , media companies and journalism schools to fix problems in the education system as well as consciously seek and train budding immigrant journalists is the only way to boost the presence of minority reporters in the long term . minou amir-sehhi said german media needed to do more than appoint a few minority journalists to be a true mirror of society . " only when we have a dark-haired , dark-eyed presenter reporting from the german parliament then we can say we 've truly accepted reality and our status as an immigration country , " she said . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " an important signal to immigrants " dw-world.de spoke with the commissioner for integration at german broadcaster wdr about the need for tv networks to recruit more journalists and presenters from immigrant minorities .

but experts say it spotlights the long way the country needs to go to visibly integrate its immigrants . at the end of april , dunja hayali , a german journalist of iraqi origin , will break the mold when she begins co-anchoring the main news show on zdf , one of germany 's biggest public television networks . in a country where a fifth of the population has an immigrant background , experts said minority presenters of all backgrounds remain conspicuously absent on mainstream television information and news programs . " it does n't matter whether you have turkish roots and look obviously different or have blond hair and blue eyes and blend in with germans , " said minou amir-sehhi , a freelance german-iranian tv journalist for the publicly funded ard network who coordinates the " intercultural network " at the german association of journalists -lrb- djv -rrb- . " there 's been a general wariness about contact with other accents and cultures in the country , and that 's reflected on television . " in the entire media industry , about 3 percent of journalists are estimated to have an immigrant background . striving for normality a sprinkling of immigrant presenters is currently to be found on some private channels and stations such as mtv .
on the influential public broadcasters , a few tend to be on niche programs devoted to issues of multiculturalism and integration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cherno jobatey is one of the few minority presenters on german television in that context , hayali 's appointment is " quite revolutionary , " said amir-sehhi . " it 's a sign of normality when you have a person with an immigrant background casually reading the news or the sports results on a major network instead of being shown as a problem or an exotic stereotype , " she said . experts added that in recent years a vocal debate about integration of immigrants has raised awareness about the role media , especially television with its high-profile visibility and reach , can play . the german government has also weighed in , urging the networks to recruit more journalists and tv presenters from immigrant minorities . " we have to make immigrants more visible in german television , " state secretary for integration maria böhmer told the daily süddeutsche zeitung .
" i keep hearing from immigrants that they do n't see themselves represented by the public sector broadcasters .
there is n't enough awareness of their experience of life , and there are n't enough immigrants in front of or behind the camera . " for example , having a turkish anchorwoman needs to become a normal thing , " she added .
" we need more reporters who themselves know the immigrants ’ world and can convey it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presenter arabella kiesbauer is a popular face on the private prosieben channel some observers said further examples such as hayali 's could also provide much-needed role models for immigrants . " it 's a sign to potential journalists who perhaps have n't trusted themselves to think that presenting a prime-time news show on a major network could be a job for a person with an italian or an iraqi name , " said gualtiero zambonini , commissioner for integration at cologne-based public network wdr , one of the few broadcasters to have such a post . learning from the netherlands ? at a european level , germany lags behind countries such as britain , where black and asian presenters are established on the bbc , and france , where a black anchorman , harry roselmack , has been hosting the country 's most popular news program . immigrants in those countries come largely from former colonies and share the language of the adopted nation , making it easier for them to break into the media . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harry roselmack is the first black anchorman on france 's most popular tv news show zambonini pointed out that germany could take a page from the netherlands ' book . " for example , minorities in the netherlands are entitled to have a certain share of programming in the media and there are laws governing it , " said zambonini .
" that obviously creates a whole new basis for the question about which journalists the networks hire . " networks doing a rethink german broadcasters , prodded by the government , are also reexamining their policies . dunja hayali said broadcaster zdf made no secret of the fact they were consciously seeking a minority presenter when they hired her .

drogba 's well-established capacity for ruffling the composure of the liverpool defense was underlined as early as the eighth minute , the ivory coast striker 's knockdown from ashley cole 's cross teeing up frank lampard on the penalty spot .
the england midfielder managed to get his foot over the bouncing ball but his shot was too straight and jose reina was able to make a good block . a minute later , andriy shevchenko curled a shot narrowly over the angle of post and bar and liverpool were reprieved again when drogba failed to pick out an unmarked joe cole in the middle after john arne riise 's slack back pass had sent him sprinting clear through the inside right channel .
liverpool unbowed twenty minutes had elapsed before liverpool managed to muster a shot on the chelsea goal , bolo zenden 's wayward effort only adding to the frustration of the increasingly agitated rafael benitez on the touchline . dirk kuyt finally gave petr cech something to do shortly afterwards , although a kindly deflection off ricardo carvalho ensured his header flew straight to the midriff of the czech goalkeeper . chelsea were soon threatening again and , after drogba had failed to connect with joe cole 's inviting cross , lampard sent a 25-yard free-kick fizzing inches outside the base of reina 's right-hand post . the pressure finally told in the 29th minute as chelsea took the lead with a move launched by carvalho on the edge of his own area . the portuguese carried the ball out to the edge of the center circle before spreading the ball wide to drogba , who muscled past daniel agger and advanced into the area before pulling the ball back behind jamie carragher .
cutting in from the opposite flank at pace , joe cole was able to get in front of alvaro arbeloa and finish the move with the most straightforward of finishes from eight yards out . but two fine saves from reina kept out efforts from drogba and lampard and ensured chelsea 's win was restricted to the narrowest of margins .
rooney trumps kaka fans at old trafford were cheering early on tuesday , as the hosts scored after a corner kick in the fifth minute .
striker cristiano ronaldo fired a short-range header at milan keeper , who could only deflect the ball into his own net . but any hopes that united would replicate their 7-1 thrashing of rome in the quarterfinals were soon dashed .
kaka caught manchester 's defense napping and left-footed the ball past edwin van der sar from a nearly impossible angle . manchester was playing with a makeshift back four due to injury , and it showed .
shortly before half-time , kaka power his way through three defenders to send the visitors into the locker room with a 2-1 lead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaka twisted manchester 's defense into knots the hosts were clearly shocked and looked tentative when play resumed .
but paul scholes got them back on track in the sixtieth minute with a nifty lob pass in the box to rooney , who slipped the ball under dida . from there on in it was all united .
darren fletcher had two excellent scoring opportunities late in the match , only to be narrowly denied .
and rooney sealed the win for manchester in injury time with a curling blast into the lower left hand corner of the goal . it was a decent outcome for both sides .

another of our turkish-german editors , birand bingül , belongs to the team of commentators on the prime-time news show on the ard network . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-iraqi journalist dunja hayali is the new face of german tv network zdf so , in a way zdf is following us .
but that 's also important because it 's a sign that the public broadcasters in germany have realized the necessity of reflecting this development in society both in their programs as well as in the profiles of their presenters . there are still very few minority presenters on the german networks .
why is that the case ? at wdr , we 've been developing measures for the past four years at least to try and get immigrant journalists on mainstream programs .
but in reality , we are only at the beginning of the road .
nobody should be under the illusion that just because we have a presenter of iraqi origin on zdf or an anchorwoman with a turkish background on wdr , we 've taken care of the problem .
these examples are important for two reasons .
firstly , because they show how seriously we want to promote the issue .
and secondly , because these role models are a sign to potential journalists who perhaps have n't trusted themselves up to now or did n't think that presenting a prime-time news show on major networks could be something for a person with an iraqi or an italian name .
it provides encouragement for more immigrants to pursue journalism careers . in the past , these signs were missing as was a hiring policy among media companies that consciously looked for minority journalists and signaled " we want more of them . "
that 's part of the problem why there are such few minority journalists in newsrooms and in front of cameras and microphones .
we simply realized the problem too late in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's immigrants do n't usually have the chance to study journalism the other part of the problem is that it 's only now in the second and third generation of immigrants that talent and potential is coming to the fore in the german media market .
these are children from immigrant families who grew up here and went to school and university .
this is a development that took place much earlier in countries such as britain or the netherlands partly because some of these nations have a history of immigration different from germany 's . how does germany compare with other countries in europe when it comes to integrating its immigrants into television ? we can definitely learn from good examples in europe , for instance from countries such as sweden or the netherlands where there are integration policies at the broadcasters and corresponding laws .
in the netherlands for example , minorities are entitled to have a certain share of programming in the media and there are laws governing it .
that obviously creates a whole new basis for the question about which journalists the networks hire . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british tv comes closer to reflecting social reality at the same time , that does n't mean there are no problems in these countries .
in the netherlands , there are still too many programs that are white - that means there are too many white dutch faces and not enough immigrants .
in britain , the situation is slightly different .
for instance , bbc international is a wonderful example of journalistic diversity , but that 's not the case in all bbc programs .
my colleagues at bbc say , ' it 's good that we 've achieved some goals , but we 're still far removed from truly representing society in the media . ' we can learn from the french too , who are redoubling efforts to tackle the problem of a lack of minority journalists .
but we 're generally lagging behind in europe .
the important thing is that we 've all recognized the problem . what else needs to be done at the networks for there to be a real change ? a rethink is already taking place among the top managers at the broadcasters as a result of pressure from politicians , societal developments as well as pressure from european policies which have placed integration of minorities high on the agenda .
one has to say that is not just a question of values and good sense but also a question of the market .
we have to take demographic developments into account .
today every fifth person in germany has an immigrant background .
among the younger generations in big cities , it 's every second person .
that means that viewers too have changed and this viewer ship lives in a culture of diversity .
if we do n't take these viewers into account , then we lose the right to exist .
it really is a question of our existence . but to really make progress on the issue , there has to be a change in the media company culture as well as in the way funds are managed .
in addition , the issue has to be anchored in the guiding principles of the broadcasters and supported with further training programs for employees as well as managers .
if nothing changes in the minds of the decision-makers , then we ca n't solve the problem . i believe that the public broadcasters bear a special responsibility towards promoting integration of immigrants .

wisniewski was not charged in the slaying of harm 's predecessor , siegfried buback .
his murder was one of a series of raf assassinations that rocked former west germany in what later became known as " the german autumn . "
but in an interview with the newsmagazine der spiegel this week , another former terrorist , peter-jürgen boock , said wisniewski was probably the motorcycle gunman who fired the fatal shots that killed buback and two companions in april 1977 .
three other members of the raf , also known as the baader-meinhof gang , were convicted of the buback killing , but it never became clear who pulled the trigger .
maintained silence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chief federal prosecutor monika harms is reopening the case one of those convicted in the murder , christian klar , remains in prison and has applied for a presidential pardon .
brigitte mohnhaupt , found guilty as an accomplice , was released last month after serving 24 years .
knut folkerts , who was released from prison in 1995 , was the third man convicted , but two other former terrorists told der spiegel they did not believe he was involved in the murder .
all three convicted of the buback killing have remained silent .
buback 's son , michael , said last week that he might support klar 's clemency appeal after receiving new information which suggested that he had n't carried out the killing .
the 1977 assassination of buback was intended to free imprisoned raf members , including its co-founder , andreas baader .
the raf , which disbanded in 1998 , is suspected of killing 34 people between 1972 and 1991 .

drogba 's well-established capacity for ruffling the composure of the liverpool defense was underlined as early as the eighth minute , the ivory coast striker 's knockdown from ashley cole 's cross teeing up frank lampard on the penalty spot .
the england midfielder managed to get his foot over the bouncing ball but his shot was too straight and jose reina was able to make a good block . a minute later , andriy shevchenko curled a shot narrowly over the angle of post and bar and liverpool were reprieved again when drogba failed to pick out an unmarked joe cole in the middle after john arne riise 's slack back pass had sent him sprinting clear through the inside right channel .
liverpool unbowed twenty minutes had elapsed before liverpool managed to muster a shot on the chelsea goal , bolo zenden 's wayward effort only adding to the frustration of the increasingly agitated rafael benitez on the touchline . dirk kuyt finally gave petr cech something to do shortly afterwards , although a kindly deflection off ricardo carvalho ensured his header flew straight to the midriff of the czech goalkeeper . chelsea were soon threatening again and , after drogba had failed to connect with joe cole 's inviting cross , lampard sent a 25-yard free-kick fizzing inches outside the base of reina 's right-hand post . the pressure finally told in the 29th minute as chelsea took the lead with a move launched by carvalho on the edge of his own area . the portuguese carried the ball out to the edge of the center circle before spreading the ball wide to drogba , who muscled past daniel agger and advanced into the area before pulling the ball back behind jamie carragher .
cutting in from the opposite flank at pace , joe cole was able to get in front of alvaro arbeloa and finish the move with the most straightforward of finishes from eight yards out . but two fine saves from reina kept out efforts from drogba and lampard and ensured chelsea 's win was restricted to the narrowest of margins .
rooney trumps kaka fans at old trafford were cheering early on tuesday , as the hosts scored after a corner kick in the fifth minute .
striker cristiano ronaldo fired a short-range header at milan keeper , who could only deflect the ball into his own net . but any hopes that united would replicate their 7-1 thrashing of rome in the quarterfinals were soon dashed .
kaka caught manchester 's defense napping and left-footed the ball past edwin van der sar from a nearly impossible angle . manchester was playing with a makeshift back four due to injury , and it showed .
shortly before half-time , kaka power his way through three defenders to send the visitors into the locker room with a 2-1 lead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaka twisted manchester 's defense into knots the hosts were clearly shocked and looked tentative when play resumed .
but paul scholes got them back on track in the sixtieth minute with a nifty lob pass in the box to rooney , who slipped the ball under dida . from there on in it was all united .
darren fletcher had two excellent scoring opportunities late in the match , only to be narrowly denied .
and rooney sealed the win for manchester in injury time with a curling blast into the lower left hand corner of the goal . it was a decent outcome for both sides .

for the first time , european scientists have discovered another habitable planet .
dw-world.de talked with one of the discoverers , stephane udry of the geneva observatory . dw-world.de : how did you discover the planet ?
was it a coincidence ? stephane udry : no , of course not .
we 're working on a complete research project to discover such planets .
we 're tracking several thousand stars to get hints about planets from them .
our planet circles around a home star .
we 're mainly interested in the traveling speed of such stars , because it helps us to calculate the existence of a planet . what 's the name of the planet ? we do n't name them , because there are too many of them .
we 're using the name of the home star and add a letter that references the date of discovery .
the first planet that 's discovered around a star gets a " b , " the second a " c. "
the new planet is called gliese 581 c , because it 's the second that we 've discovered near the star gliese 581 . what kind of conditions exist on gliese 581 c ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : udry -lrb- right -rrb- with the director of the geneva observatory , michel mayor that 's a difficult questions .
it probably has a hard surface structure , because that 's the case with most planets of this size .
the mass of our planet is five times as big as that of the earth .
the average temperature should be between 0 and 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 32 and 104 degrees fahrenheit . -rrb-
a year only lasts 13 days on the planet , because it circles near its star . does organic life maybe exist there ? i can only say that the size and the temperature of the planet would be good for that .
the planet is in the so-called habitable zone , because it 's highly probable that water exists there .
there are probably several sources of water .
there are probably comets that bring water to the planet , as happened on earth during the early phase of the solar system .
there could be ice .
but the basic requirements for life are chemical components such as carbon and oxygen .
if they exists , conditions are good .
but i can not say much at the moment .
it 's possible that we 'll be able to do so in 20 years .
we need light from the planet 's atmosphere to determine that . can you use research probes to examine the planet further ? no , it 's too far away for that - 20 light years .
if we could travel at one tenth of the speed of light , which would be wonderful , we 'd still need two centuries to get there .
that 's why we have to continue to analyze the information from here . how important is this discovery for science ? it 's certainly an important discovery .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 25.04.2007 eu member states differ on anti-terror measures großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suveillance is increasingly used as a counterterrorist measure even though the european union has a common counter-terrorism strategy , its implementation is left to individual member states .
that is why anti-terror legislations differ from country to country . terrorism is not a new phenomenon in europe .
in the united kingdom , spain and ireland alone , it has claimed 5,000 deaths over the last 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the effects of sept .
11 are felt strongly in europe the sept .
11 attacks on the united states , however , have had a rippling effect across the atlantic as well .
faced with the challenges posed by the war against international terrorism , which were only heightened by the attacks in london and madrid , european countries were forced to adapt and expand their anti-terror legislations .
" legislative and institutional requirements have definitely become stricter in all 27 member states of the european union , " said annegret bendiek of the german institute for international and security affairs and author of a study on fighting terrorism in the eu .
yet striking the right balance between efficient engagement in the war on terror and protection of civil liberties has n't been easy to achieve .
one policy , many implementations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the end of privacy ?
in june 2002 , the eu council passed two resolutions - one establishing a common european arrest warrant and one defining a common concept of terrorist offences which all the member states of the european union had to include in their legal system .
in december 2005 , the eu adopted its eu counter-terrorism strategy , but it left the responsibility for its implementation in the hands of individual member states .
" states like the united kingdom , france and also germany are of course very engaged , " bendiek said .
but european states continue to differ greatly in their institutional and legislative approaches .
tough measures of all the eu member states , the united kingdom has gone the farthest in expanding the legislation meant to counter acts of terrorism .
several months after the 2001 attacks on new york and washington , d.c , britain 's terrorism act of 2000 was replaced by the anti-terrorism , crime and security act which stipulated that foreign terrorist suspects could be detained indefinitely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2005 attacks in london lead to even stricter anti-terror laws after a public outcry and an intervention from the law lords - a judicial body of the upper house of the british parliament which serves as a court of last instance in the uk - this measure was abolished for being incompatible with the european convention of human rights .
its powers were later replaced by the so-called control order in the 2005 prevention of terrorism act .
the control order , however , still allows for comprehensive restriction of an individual 's liberties for the purpose of " protecting members of the public from a risk of terrorism . "
after the london bomb attacks in the summer of 2005 , the british legislation was made even stricter .
according to the terrorism act of 2006 , for example , " glorification of terrorist acts " can lead to a seven-year prison sentence .

we 're working on a complete research project to discover such planets .
we 're tracking several thousand stars to get hints about planets from them .
our planet circles around a home star .
we 're mainly interested in the traveling speed of such stars , because it helps us to calculate the existence of a planet . what 's the name of the planet ? we do n't name them , because there are too many of them .
we 're using the name of the home star and add a letter that references the date of discovery .
the first planet that 's discovered around a star gets a " b , " the second a " c. "
the new planet is called gliese 581 c , because it 's the second that we 've discovered near the star gliese 581 . what kind of conditions exist on gliese 581 c ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : udry -lrb- right -rrb- with the director of the geneva observatory , michel mayor that 's a difficult questions .

the planet is in the so-called habitable zone , because it 's highly probable that water exists there .
there are probably several sources of water .
there are probably comets that bring water to the planet , as happened on earth during the early phase of the solar system .
there could be ice .
but the basic requirements for life are chemical components such as carbon and oxygen .
if they exists , conditions are good .

it 's possible that we 'll be able to do so in 20 years .
we need light from the planet 's atmosphere to determine that . can you use research probes to examine the planet further ? no , it 's too far away for that - 20 light years .
if we could travel at one tenth of the speed of light , which would be wonderful , we 'd still need two centuries to get there .
that 's why we have to continue to analyze the information from here . how important is this discovery for science ? it 's certainly an important discovery .

germany has already heated up by 0.9 degrees celsius in the past century . germany can expect heavy storms and intense heat waves that cause numerous deaths , said wolfgang kusch , head of germany 's state-run meteorology service dwd , announcing the results of the meteorologists ' observations .
" climate change has become a fact of life , " he told a news conference .
germany 's annual median temperature increased by 0.9 degrees celsius to 8.2 c -lrb- 46 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- since 1901 and could rise another 2 to 5 degrees by 2100 , according to the dwd .
germany experienced the warmest decade of the 20th century from 1990 to 1999 as well as seeing a 9-percent rise in precipitation .
germany should be better prepared for global warming , kusch said , stressing that farmers in particular would be forced to deal with the effects .
the changing climate would also unleash greater risks for people 's health , such as infectious diseases and skin cancer .
heat islands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 2006 deviation of temperature from the 1960-1990 average " we have to do all we can to ensure that the earth does not become uninhabitable , " kusch said .
as a result of the higher temperatures , germany would be subject to more rain and less snow in winter , causing ski resorts in the country 's south to close down , as tourism flourishes on the north and baltic seas .
cities would also see their temperatures rise beyond the 2 degree difference the dwd has already observed between urban areas and the surrounding countryside .
" german cities will increasingly become ' heat islands ' and there will be a growing need for fresh air corridors into cities , " he said .

german chancellor angela merkel aimed to make climate change a central theme at the summit , being held under the german g8 presidency , pfaffenbach reiterated in berlin on tuesday .
in his remarks , pfaffenbach was careful not to mention the united states by name , however , it the recipient of his comments on climate change was clear . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : planes contribute to co2 emissions blamed for global warming he indicated the germany 's disappointment that the us was not yet prepared to submit to an internationally agreed climate protection regime along the lines of the 1997 kyoto protocol , which runs out in 2012 . pfaffenbach expressed optimism that criticism and protests by non-governmental organizations , which have voiced strident protest at past g8 summits , would be muted this time . anti-globalization organizations are predicting that up to 100,000 demonstrators will march in the eastern german city of rostock , while police estimate the number at half that .
larger organizations , like attac and greenpeace , have committed themselves to peaceful marches , while smaller , more radical , groups have refused to rule out violent protests like that in genoa in 2001 .
africa also high on the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel pledged to push g8 members to meet their development aid commitments merkel intended to meet ngo representatives in mid-may , and the ngos had welcomed the fact that the chancellor also intended to place africa high on the agenda , he said .
g8 members aimed to offer african countries a " broad political partnership " with the aim of promoting democracy and reducing corruption , pfaffenbach said .
he stressed that money was not the solution to everything , although the industrialized countries stood by their longstanding commitments , including allocating 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product to development aid by 2012 .
african countries needed to improve their governmental structures and attract more private capital , he said .
algeria , egypt , ghana , nigeria , senegal and south africa have been invited to the conference , as have brazil , china , india and mexico . dw staff / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel pledges to keep africa on international agenda german chancellor angela merkel said tuesday that the world 's industrialized countries do not need to set new goals to help the developing world but keep the promises they have already made .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gates with defense minister franz josef jung jung also said earlier in an interview with the daily sächsische zeitung published wednesday that he was confident the united states could alleviate russia 's concerns .
russia can be convinced of the necessity of the missile defense system " by explaining to them that there is a shared interest in security against missiles - for example from rogue states , " jung said .
german chancellor angela merkel has urged washington to engage russia on its concerns about us plans to deploy 10 interceptor missiles in poland and a radar in the czech republic by 2012 .
the four-billion-dollar project is aimed at countering a potential missile threat from iran , not russia .
scepticism about plan but the plan has antagonized moscow , which sees it as a further military encroachment in its former sphere of influence , and has aroused misgivings among some european allies .
on tuesday in warsaw , gates said he did not believe that russia was a military threat to poland " either now or -lrb- in the event that -rrb- we should install a missile defense . "
" the world changes in dramatic ways , and what we are talking about here is indivisible security for the united states and for our nato allies , " he said .
" we would like to extend that umbrella to russia , and partner with russia and have russia be with us in this program , " he said .
poland 's willingness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are many critics but also supporters of the plan poland 's conservative government , led by the president 's twin brother , prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , has signaled its willingness to host the base , but formal negotiations between washington and warsaw have not yet begun .
gates , who started the trip monday in moscow , has invited the russians to inspect a us missile defense interceptor site in fort greely , alaska and a radar in california to clear up what he said was russian misunderstanding about the capability of the system being proposed for europe .
" in terms of assurances that the system would not be changed years from now in a way that might be more threatening to the russian deterrent , it seems to me that it is a matter that can be negotiated , " he said .
gates provided no details and it was unclear whether the scope of such negotiations would involve the broader us missile defense system , or only the proposed european component . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu-russia mistrust nears cold war level , eu commissioner says mistrust and a lack of respect in the relations between the european union and russia are at their lowest level since the fall of communism , according to eu trade commissioner peter mandelson .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economy minister michael glos " the upturn is continuing , growth remains strong and the situation in the labor market keeps getting better , " glos said .
citing germany 's robust export performance , glos said the present level of the euro was " sustainable , " but warned that a strong currency can threaten a country 's exports , making them more expensive and less competitive on world markets .
" if it -lrb- the euro -rrb- were to rise still more strongly , there would be risks , " glos said .
he was speaking as the euro moved closer to an all-time high point against the dollar , soaring to 1.3656 on wednesday , well within striking distance of 1.3666 , its record level reached on dec 30 , 2004 .
surpassing expectations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro moved closer to an all-time high point against the dollar the influential ifo index rose to 108.6 points in april from 107.7 points in march , putting it just one-tenth of a point away from the record score of 108.7 points recorded in december .
analysts polled by news agency thomson financial had predicted a far more modest surge , to 107.8 points .
" germany is profiting from the extraordinary international investment boom , which due to germany 's specialization is having a stronger cyclical impact than in the other major european countries , " ifo president hans-werner sinn said in a statement .
for its monthly survey , ifo polls some 7,000 companies about their assessment of current business and their expectations for the next six months .
a breakdown of the data showed that the current sentiment sub-index rose to 113.2 points in april from 112.4 points in march .
and the expectations sub-index also increased , rising to 104.3 points from 103.2 points , ifo said .
analysts said the data were further proof that the german economy has weathered a steep hike in value-added tax this year .
jumping over hurdles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany increased its vat to 19 procent this year on jan 1 , the german government increased vat by three full percentage points to 19 percent , the biggest-ever single rise in a move experts said would put the brakes on consumer spending and therefore drag on overall growth .
the robust health of the economy is now expected to reduce public debt and buoy the job market .
the unemployment rate in march fell to 9.8 percent .
ifo said in retailing and wholesaling , the business climate had also brightened noticeably in march with companies giving more positive appraisals of both their current situation and their six-month outlook .
sentiment in the construction industry , however , remained unchanged .
positive outlook bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german manufacturers are confident about their exports elga bartsch of morgan stanley said the fact the euro had hit a two-year peak against the dollar had not hurt germany 's export-driven economy .
" notwithstanding the stronger euro , the ifo institute also reported an improvement in the export expectations of german manufacturers , " bartsch said .
" of course , a considerable share of those exports would go to other euro area countries .
but , thus far , the mood amongst german manufacturers seems to be defiant regarding the euro , " she said , adding that the strong single currency and a us slowdown could leave " skid marks " in the future .
laying the groundwork bank of america 's holger schmieding said german companies had helped lay the groundwork for the sharp economic upturn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank may end up raising its interest rates " with export expectations up according to an ifo spokesman , it shows that the severe slashing of costs that german corporations had to do in the years since 2000 is paying off nicely , " he said .
" german exports are competitive .
so far , strong demand from asia , central and eastern europe as well as the oil countries seems to offset the rise in the euro and weaker us demand . "
the sunny outlook in germany would provide additional arguments for the european central bank to continue raising its key interest rates , analysts said .
" along with rises in business confidence in belgium and netherlands , the surveys released so far this month support our view that the ecb will raise rates to 4.00 percent in june and once again in to 4.25 percent by year-end , " said sunil kapadia of ubs investment research . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de soccer world cup hardly touched german economy the patriotism and high spirits unleashed by this past summer 's world cup were expected to boost the german economy , but experts say the soccer event had virtually no impact on growth and employment .
-lrb- 21.04.2007 -rrb- outlook for german economy remains sunny the country 's top economic institutes are raising their forecast for economic growth this year by two thirds , which could mean a higher tax take , stronger domestic demand and lower unemployment .
-lrb- 19.04.2007 -rrb- optimism grows on outlook for german economy the run of good news for the german economy , europe 's biggest , looks set to continue for some time , with bundesbank president axel weber arguing on monday that current growth marks only the beginning of a longer upturn .

that is why anti-terror legislations differ from country to country . terrorism is not a new phenomenon in europe .
in the united kingdom , spain and ireland alone , it has claimed 5,000 deaths over the last 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the effects of sept .
11 are felt strongly in europe the sept .
11 attacks on the united states , however , have had a rippling effect across the atlantic as well .
faced with the challenges posed by the war against international terrorism , which were only heightened by the attacks in london and madrid , european countries were forced to adapt and expand their anti-terror legislations .
" legislative and institutional requirements have definitely become stricter in all 27 member states of the european union , " said annegret bendiek of the german institute for international and security affairs and author of a study on fighting terrorism in the eu .
yet striking the right balance between efficient engagement in the war on terror and protection of civil liberties has n't been easy to achieve .
one policy , many implementations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the end of privacy ?
in june 2002 , the eu council passed two resolutions - one establishing a common european arrest warrant and one defining a common concept of terrorist offences which all the member states of the european union had to include in their legal system .
in december 2005 , the eu adopted its eu counter-terrorism strategy , but it left the responsibility for its implementation in the hands of individual member states .
" states like the united kingdom , france and also germany are of course very engaged , " bendiek said .
but european states continue to differ greatly in their institutional and legislative approaches .
tough measures of all the eu member states , the united kingdom has gone the farthest in expanding the legislation meant to counter acts of terrorism .
several months after the 2001 attacks on new york and washington , d.c , britain 's terrorism act of 2000 was replaced by the anti-terrorism , crime and security act which stipulated that foreign terrorist suspects could be detained indefinitely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2005 attacks in london lead to even stricter anti-terror laws after a public outcry and an intervention from the law lords - a judicial body of the upper house of the british parliament which serves as a court of last instance in the uk - this measure was abolished for being incompatible with the european convention of human rights .
its powers were later replaced by the so-called control order in the 2005 prevention of terrorism act .
the control order , however , still allows for comprehensive restriction of an individual 's liberties for the purpose of " protecting members of the public from a risk of terrorism . "
after the london bomb attacks in the summer of 2005 , the british legislation was made even stricter .
according to the terrorism act of 2006 , for example , " glorification of terrorist acts " can lead to a seven-year prison sentence .
it 's legal to eavesdrop ever since july 2005 , italy 's secret service has been allowed to monitor telephone conversations for the sake of preventing terrorist attacks .

for the first time , european scientists have discovered another habitable planet .
dw-world.de talked with one of the discoverers , stephane udry of the geneva observatory . dw-world.de : how did you discover the planet ?
was it a coincidence ? stephane udry : no , of course not .
we 're working on a complete research project to discover such planets .
we 're tracking several thousand stars to get hints about planets from them .
our planet circles around a home star .
we 're mainly interested in the traveling speed of such stars , because it helps us to calculate the existence of a planet . what 's the name of the planet ? we do n't name them , because there are too many of them .
we 're using the name of the home star and add a letter that references the date of discovery .
the first planet that 's discovered around a star gets a " b , " the second a " c. "
the new planet is called gliese 581 c , because it 's the second that we 've discovered near the star gliese 581 . what kind of conditions exist on gliese 581 c ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : udry -lrb- right -rrb- with the director of the geneva observatory , michel mayor that 's a difficult questions .

the mass of our planet is five times as big as that of the earth .
the average temperature should be between 0 and 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 32 and 104 degrees fahrenheit . -rrb-
a year only lasts 13 days on the planet , because it circles near its star . does organic life maybe exist there ? i can only say that the size and the temperature of the planet would be good for that .
the planet is in the so-called habitable zone , because it 's highly probable that water exists there .
there are probably several sources of water .
there are probably comets that bring water to the planet , as happened on earth during the early phase of the solar system .
there could be ice .
but the basic requirements for life are chemical components such as carbon and oxygen .
if they exists , conditions are good .
but i can not say much at the moment .
it 's possible that we 'll be able to do so in 20 years .
we need light from the planet 's atmosphere to determine that . can you use research probes to examine the planet further ? no , it 's too far away for that - 20 light years .
if we could travel at one tenth of the speed of light , which would be wonderful , we 'd still need two centuries to get there .
that 's why we have to continue to analyze the information from here . how important is this discovery for science ? it 's certainly an important discovery .

for the first time , european scientists have discovered another habitable planet .
dw-world.de talked with one of the discoverers , stephane udry of the geneva observatory . dw-world.de : how did you discover the planet ?
was it a coincidence ? stephane udry : no , of course not .
we 're working on a complete research project to discover such planets .
we 're tracking several thousand stars to get hints about planets from them .
our planet circles around a home star .
we 're mainly interested in the traveling speed of such stars , because it helps us to calculate the existence of a planet . what 's the name of the planet ? we do n't name them , because there are too many of them .
we 're using the name of the home star and add a letter that references the date of discovery .
the first planet that 's discovered around a star gets a " b , " the second a " c. "
the new planet is called gliese 581 c , because it 's the second that we 've discovered near the star gliese 581 . what kind of conditions exist on gliese 581 c ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : udry -lrb- right -rrb- with the director of the geneva observatory , michel mayor that 's a difficult questions .
it probably has a hard surface structure , because that 's the case with most planets of this size .
the mass of our planet is five times as big as that of the earth .
the average temperature should be between 0 and 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 32 and 104 degrees fahrenheit . -rrb-
a year only lasts 13 days on the planet , because it circles near its star . does organic life maybe exist there ? i can only say that the size and the temperature of the planet would be good for that .
the planet is in the so-called habitable zone , because it 's highly probable that water exists there .
there are probably several sources of water .
there are probably comets that bring water to the planet , as happened on earth during the early phase of the solar system .
there could be ice .
but the basic requirements for life are chemical components such as carbon and oxygen .
if they exists , conditions are good .
but i can not say much at the moment .
it 's possible that we 'll be able to do so in 20 years .
we need light from the planet 's atmosphere to determine that . can you use research probes to examine the planet further ? no , it 's too far away for that - 20 light years .
if we could travel at one tenth of the speed of light , which would be wonderful , we 'd still need two centuries to get there .
that 's why we have to continue to analyze the information from here . how important is this discovery for science ? it 's certainly an important discovery .
our long-term goal is to find a second planet , where life is possible .

germany has already heated up by 0.9 degrees celsius in the past century . germany can expect heavy storms and intense heat waves that cause numerous deaths , said wolfgang kusch , head of germany 's state-run meteorology service dwd , announcing the results of the meteorologists ' observations .
" climate change has become a fact of life , " he told a news conference .
germany 's annual median temperature increased by 0.9 degrees celsius to 8.2 c -lrb- 46 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- since 1901 and could rise another 2 to 5 degrees by 2100 , according to the dwd .
germany experienced the warmest decade of the 20th century from 1990 to 1999 as well as seeing a 9-percent rise in precipitation .
germany should be better prepared for global warming , kusch said , stressing that farmers in particular would be forced to deal with the effects .
the changing climate would also unleash greater risks for people 's health , such as infectious diseases and skin cancer .
heat islands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 2006 deviation of temperature from the 1960-1990 average " we have to do all we can to ensure that the earth does not become uninhabitable , " kusch said .
as a result of the higher temperatures , germany would be subject to more rain and less snow in winter , causing ski resorts in the country 's south to close down , as tourism flourishes on the north and baltic seas .
cities would also see their temperatures rise beyond the 2 degree difference the dwd has already observed between urban areas and the surrounding countryside .
" german cities will increasingly become ' heat islands ' and there will be a growing need for fresh air corridors into cities , " he said .

germany has already heated up by 0.9 degrees celsius in the past century . germany can expect heavy storms and intense heat waves that cause numerous deaths , said wolfgang kusch , head of germany 's state-run meteorology service dwd , announcing the results of the meteorologists ' observations .
" climate change has become a fact of life , " he told a news conference .
germany 's annual median temperature increased by 0.9 degrees celsius to 8.2 c -lrb- 46 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- since 1901 and could rise another 2 to 5 degrees by 2100 , according to the dwd .
germany experienced the warmest decade of the 20th century from 1990 to 1999 as well as seeing a 9-percent rise in precipitation .
germany should be better prepared for global warming , kusch said , stressing that farmers in particular would be forced to deal with the effects .
the changing climate would also unleash greater risks for people 's health , such as infectious diseases and skin cancer .
heat islands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 2006 deviation of temperature from the 1960-1990 average " we have to do all we can to ensure that the earth does not become uninhabitable , " kusch said .
as a result of the higher temperatures , germany would be subject to more rain and less snow in winter , causing ski resorts in the country 's south to close down , as tourism flourishes on the north and baltic seas .
cities would also see their temperatures rise beyond the 2 degree difference the dwd has already observed between urban areas and the surrounding countryside .
" german cities will increasingly become ' heat islands ' and there will be a growing need for fresh air corridors into cities , " he said .

that is why anti-terror legislations differ from country to country . terrorism is not a new phenomenon in europe .
in the united kingdom , spain and ireland alone , it has claimed 5,000 deaths over the last 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the effects of sept .
11 are felt strongly in europe the sept .
11 attacks on the united states , however , have had a rippling effect across the atlantic as well .
faced with the challenges posed by the war against international terrorism , which were only heightened by the attacks in london and madrid , european countries were forced to adapt and expand their anti-terror legislations .
" legislative and institutional requirements have definitely become stricter in all 27 member states of the european union , " said annegret bendiek of the german institute for international and security affairs and author of a study on fighting terrorism in the eu .
yet striking the right balance between efficient engagement in the war on terror and protection of civil liberties has n't been easy to achieve .
one policy , many implementations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the end of privacy ?
in june 2002 , the eu council passed two resolutions - one establishing a common european arrest warrant and one defining a common concept of terrorist offences which all the member states of the european union had to include in their legal system .
in december 2005 , the eu adopted its eu counter-terrorism strategy , but it left the responsibility for its implementation in the hands of individual member states .
" states like the united kingdom , france and also germany are of course very engaged , " bendiek said .
but european states continue to differ greatly in their institutional and legislative approaches .
tough measures of all the eu member states , the united kingdom has gone the farthest in expanding the legislation meant to counter acts of terrorism .
several months after the 2001 attacks on new york and washington , d.c , britain 's terrorism act of 2000 was replaced by the anti-terrorism , crime and security act which stipulated that foreign terrorist suspects could be detained indefinitely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2005 attacks in london lead to even stricter anti-terror laws after a public outcry and an intervention from the law lords - a judicial body of the upper house of the british parliament which serves as a court of last instance in the uk - this measure was abolished for being incompatible with the european convention of human rights .
its powers were later replaced by the so-called control order in the 2005 prevention of terrorism act .
the control order , however , still allows for comprehensive restriction of an individual 's liberties for the purpose of " protecting members of the public from a risk of terrorism . "
after the london bomb attacks in the summer of 2005 , the british legislation was made even stricter .
according to the terrorism act of 2006 , for example , " glorification of terrorist acts " can lead to a seven-year prison sentence .
it 's legal to eavesdrop ever since july 2005 , italy 's secret service has been allowed to monitor telephone conversations for the sake of preventing terrorist attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police surveillance is a cause of concern for privacy activists france adopted a new law this year that follows the british model allowing for surveillance cameras to be placed in public spaces such as train stations , churches and mosques , shops , factories or nuclear plants .
after a failed terrorist attack , in which crude propane gas bombs were primed to explode on two german trains on july 31 , the german government introduced a new law on fighting terrorism .
germany now has a computer databank which allows police and intelligence agencies easier access to a range of information on terrorism suspects , including membership of terrorist groups , firearms registration information as well as internet and telecommunications data .
not everybody can do it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you never know who 's listening in but smaller and less affluent eu countries are often lagging behind in terms of their legislative apparatus and implementation of counter-terrorist measures .
according to bendiek , malta , portugal or greece , for example , lack the administrative infrastructure , personnel and funds for implementing anti-terrorism laws .
in other countries , it is above all different legal traditions that cancel each other in various legislations .
" the british have fewer problems with video surveillance than the germans , " bendiek said .

drogba 's well-established capacity for ruffling the composure of the liverpool defense was underlined as early as the eighth minute , the ivory coast striker 's knockdown from ashley cole 's cross teeing up frank lampard on the penalty spot .
the england midfielder managed to get his foot over the bouncing ball but his shot was too straight and jose reina was able to make a good block . a minute later , andriy shevchenko curled a shot narrowly over the angle of post and bar and liverpool were reprieved again when drogba failed to pick out an unmarked joe cole in the middle after john arne riise 's slack back pass had sent him sprinting clear through the inside right channel .
liverpool unbowed twenty minutes had elapsed before liverpool managed to muster a shot on the chelsea goal , bolo zenden 's wayward effort only adding to the frustration of the increasingly agitated rafael benitez on the touchline . dirk kuyt finally gave petr cech something to do shortly afterwards , although a kindly deflection off ricardo carvalho ensured his header flew straight to the midriff of the czech goalkeeper . chelsea were soon threatening again and , after drogba had failed to connect with joe cole 's inviting cross , lampard sent a 25-yard free-kick fizzing inches outside the base of reina 's right-hand post . the pressure finally told in the 29th minute as chelsea took the lead with a move launched by carvalho on the edge of his own area . the portuguese carried the ball out to the edge of the center circle before spreading the ball wide to drogba , who muscled past daniel agger and advanced into the area before pulling the ball back behind jamie carragher .

drogba 's well-established capacity for ruffling the composure of the liverpool defense was underlined as early as the eighth minute , the ivory coast striker 's knockdown from ashley cole 's cross teeing up frank lampard on the penalty spot .
the england midfielder managed to get his foot over the bouncing ball but his shot was too straight and jose reina was able to make a good block . a minute later , andriy shevchenko curled a shot narrowly over the angle of post and bar and liverpool were reprieved again when drogba failed to pick out an unmarked joe cole in the middle after john arne riise 's slack back pass had sent him sprinting clear through the inside right channel .
liverpool unbowed twenty minutes had elapsed before liverpool managed to muster a shot on the chelsea goal , bolo zenden 's wayward effort only adding to the frustration of the increasingly agitated rafael benitez on the touchline . dirk kuyt finally gave petr cech something to do shortly afterwards , although a kindly deflection off ricardo carvalho ensured his header flew straight to the midriff of the czech goalkeeper . chelsea were soon threatening again and , after drogba had failed to connect with joe cole 's inviting cross , lampard sent a 25-yard free-kick fizzing inches outside the base of reina 's right-hand post . the pressure finally told in the 29th minute as chelsea took the lead with a move launched by carvalho on the edge of his own area . the portuguese carried the ball out to the edge of the center circle before spreading the ball wide to drogba , who muscled past daniel agger and advanced into the area before pulling the ball back behind jamie carragher .

drogba 's well-established capacity for ruffling the composure of the liverpool defense was underlined as early as the eighth minute , the ivory coast striker 's knockdown from ashley cole 's cross teeing up frank lampard on the penalty spot .
the england midfielder managed to get his foot over the bouncing ball but his shot was too straight and jose reina was able to make a good block . a minute later , andriy shevchenko curled a shot narrowly over the angle of post and bar and liverpool were reprieved again when drogba failed to pick out an unmarked joe cole in the middle after john arne riise 's slack back pass had sent him sprinting clear through the inside right channel .
liverpool unbowed twenty minutes had elapsed before liverpool managed to muster a shot on the chelsea goal , bolo zenden 's wayward effort only adding to the frustration of the increasingly agitated rafael benitez on the touchline . dirk kuyt finally gave petr cech something to do shortly afterwards , although a kindly deflection off ricardo carvalho ensured his header flew straight to the midriff of the czech goalkeeper . chelsea were soon threatening again and , after drogba had failed to connect with joe cole 's inviting cross , lampard sent a 25-yard free-kick fizzing inches outside the base of reina 's right-hand post . the pressure finally told in the 29th minute as chelsea took the lead with a move launched by carvalho on the edge of his own area . the portuguese carried the ball out to the edge of the center circle before spreading the ball wide to drogba , who muscled past daniel agger and advanced into the area before pulling the ball back behind jamie carragher .
cutting in from the opposite flank at pace , joe cole was able to get in front of alvaro arbeloa and finish the move with the most straightforward of finishes from eight yards out . but two fine saves from reina kept out efforts from drogba and lampard and ensured chelsea 's win was restricted to the narrowest of margins .
rooney trumps kaka fans at old trafford were cheering early on tuesday , as the hosts scored after a corner kick in the fifth minute .
striker cristiano ronaldo fired a short-range header at milan keeper , who could only deflect the ball into his own net . but any hopes that united would replicate their 7-1 thrashing of rome in the quarterfinals were soon dashed .
kaka caught manchester 's defense napping and left-footed the ball past edwin van der sar from a nearly impossible angle . manchester was playing with a makeshift back four due to injury , and it showed .
shortly before half-time , kaka power his way through three defenders to send the visitors into the locker room with a 2-1 lead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaka twisted manchester 's defense into knots the hosts were clearly shocked and looked tentative when play resumed .
but paul scholes got them back on track in the sixtieth minute with a nifty lob pass in the box to rooney , who slipped the ball under dida . from there on in it was all united .
darren fletcher had two excellent scoring opportunities late in the match , only to be narrowly denied .
and rooney sealed the win for manchester in injury time with a curling blast into the lower left hand corner of the goal . it was a decent outcome for both sides .

that is why anti-terror legislations differ from country to country . terrorism is not a new phenomenon in europe .
in the united kingdom , spain and ireland alone , it has claimed 5,000 deaths over the last 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the effects of sept .
11 are felt strongly in europe the sept .
11 attacks on the united states , however , have had a rippling effect across the atlantic as well .
faced with the challenges posed by the war against international terrorism , which were only heightened by the attacks in london and madrid , european countries were forced to adapt and expand their anti-terror legislations .
" legislative and institutional requirements have definitely become stricter in all 27 member states of the european union , " said annegret bendiek of the german institute for international and security affairs and author of a study on fighting terrorism in the eu .
yet striking the right balance between efficient engagement in the war on terror and protection of civil liberties has n't been easy to achieve .
one policy , many implementations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the end of privacy ?
in june 2002 , the eu council passed two resolutions - one establishing a common european arrest warrant and one defining a common concept of terrorist offences which all the member states of the european union had to include in their legal system .
in december 2005 , the eu adopted its eu counter-terrorism strategy , but it left the responsibility for its implementation in the hands of individual member states .
" states like the united kingdom , france and also germany are of course very engaged , " bendiek said .
but european states continue to differ greatly in their institutional and legislative approaches .
tough measures of all the eu member states , the united kingdom has gone the farthest in expanding the legislation meant to counter acts of terrorism .
several months after the 2001 attacks on new york and washington , d.c , britain 's terrorism act of 2000 was replaced by the anti-terrorism , crime and security act which stipulated that foreign terrorist suspects could be detained indefinitely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2005 attacks in london lead to even stricter anti-terror laws after a public outcry and an intervention from the law lords - a judicial body of the upper house of the british parliament which serves as a court of last instance in the uk - this measure was abolished for being incompatible with the european convention of human rights .
its powers were later replaced by the so-called control order in the 2005 prevention of terrorism act .
the control order , however , still allows for comprehensive restriction of an individual 's liberties for the purpose of " protecting members of the public from a risk of terrorism . "
after the london bomb attacks in the summer of 2005 , the british legislation was made even stricter .
according to the terrorism act of 2006 , for example , " glorification of terrorist acts " can lead to a seven-year prison sentence .
it 's legal to eavesdrop ever since july 2005 , italy 's secret service has been allowed to monitor telephone conversations for the sake of preventing terrorist attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police surveillance is a cause of concern for privacy activists france adopted a new law this year that follows the british model allowing for surveillance cameras to be placed in public spaces such as train stations , churches and mosques , shops , factories or nuclear plants .
after a failed terrorist attack , in which crude propane gas bombs were primed to explode on two german trains on july 31 , the german government introduced a new law on fighting terrorism .
germany now has a computer databank which allows police and intelligence agencies easier access to a range of information on terrorism suspects , including membership of terrorist groups , firearms registration information as well as internet and telecommunications data .
not everybody can do it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you never know who 's listening in but smaller and less affluent eu countries are often lagging behind in terms of their legislative apparatus and implementation of counter-terrorist measures .
according to bendiek , malta , portugal or greece , for example , lack the administrative infrastructure , personnel and funds for implementing anti-terrorism laws .
in other countries , it is above all different legal traditions that cancel each other in various legislations .
" the british have fewer problems with video surveillance than the germans , " bendiek said .
" but as war as telephone surveillance is concerned , it could be the other way around .

but experts say it spotlights the long way the country needs to go to visibly integrate its immigrants . at the end of april , dunja hayali , a german journalist of iraqi origin , will break the mold when she begins co-anchoring the main news show on zdf , one of germany 's biggest public television networks . in a country where a fifth of the population has an immigrant background , experts said minority presenters of all backgrounds remain conspicuously absent on mainstream television information and news programs . " it does n't matter whether you have turkish roots and look obviously different or have blond hair and blue eyes and blend in with germans , " said minou amir-sehhi , a freelance german-iranian tv journalist for the publicly funded ard network who coordinates the " intercultural network " at the german association of journalists -lrb- djv -rrb- . " there 's been a general wariness about contact with other accents and cultures in the country , and that 's reflected on television . " in the entire media industry , about 3 percent of journalists are estimated to have an immigrant background . striving for normality a sprinkling of immigrant presenters is currently to be found on some private channels and stations such as mtv .
on the influential public broadcasters , a few tend to be on niche programs devoted to issues of multiculturalism and integration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cherno jobatey is one of the few minority presenters on german television in that context , hayali 's appointment is " quite revolutionary , " said amir-sehhi . " it 's a sign of normality when you have a person with an immigrant background casually reading the news or the sports results on a major network instead of being shown as a problem or an exotic stereotype , " she said . experts added that in recent years a vocal debate about integration of immigrants has raised awareness about the role media , especially television with its high-profile visibility and reach , can play . the german government has also weighed in , urging the networks to recruit more journalists and tv presenters from immigrant minorities . " we have to make immigrants more visible in german television , " state secretary for integration maria böhmer told the daily süddeutsche zeitung .
" i keep hearing from immigrants that they do n't see themselves represented by the public sector broadcasters .
there is n't enough awareness of their experience of life , and there are n't enough immigrants in front of or behind the camera . " for example , having a turkish anchorwoman needs to become a normal thing , " she added .
" we need more reporters who themselves know the immigrants ’ world and can convey it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presenter arabella kiesbauer is a popular face on the private prosieben channel some observers said further examples such as hayali 's could also provide much-needed role models for immigrants . " it 's a sign to potential journalists who perhaps have n't trusted themselves to think that presenting a prime-time news show on a major network could be a job for a person with an italian or an iraqi name , " said gualtiero zambonini , commissioner for integration at cologne-based public network wdr , one of the few broadcasters to have such a post . learning from the netherlands ? at a european level , germany lags behind countries such as britain , where black and asian presenters are established on the bbc , and france , where a black anchorman , harry roselmack , has been hosting the country 's most popular news program . immigrants in those countries come largely from former colonies and share the language of the adopted nation , making it easier for them to break into the media . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harry roselmack is the first black anchorman on france 's most popular tv news show zambonini pointed out that germany could take a page from the netherlands ' book . " for example , minorities in the netherlands are entitled to have a certain share of programming in the media and there are laws governing it , " said zambonini .
" that obviously creates a whole new basis for the question about which journalists the networks hire . " networks doing a rethink german broadcasters , prodded by the government , are also reexamining their policies . dunja hayali said broadcaster zdf made no secret of the fact they were consciously seeking a minority presenter when they hired her . " of course my qualifications were the most important criterion , but there 's no denying my immigrant background was an added plus in bagging the job , " said hayali , who previously moderated a news show at dw-tv . demographic pressures are also forcing public broadcasters , which are partly financed by tv licensing fees , to adapt to a changed viewership . " today every fifth person in germany has an immigrant background , among the young generation in the big cities it 's every second , " said zambonini .
" we just have to take these viewers into account , otherwise we lose our right to exist . " not enough immigrant journalists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children with immigrant backgrounds often perform poorly at schools in germany but the biggest problem for the networks , experts said , is finding minority journalists . " the pool of potential immigrant journalists is tiny , which shows that promoting diversity has just not been a priority for media networks , " said lutz michel , head of the mmb institute for media research in essen . he added that a combination of poor language skills , lack of an academic environment at home and insufficient educational qualifications prevent many from opting for a career in journalism . an oecd study last year found that children from immigrant families in germany have fewer chances to succeed at school than in almost any other industrialized country . a long way to go most media observers agree that only a shared drive by politicians , media companies and journalism schools to fix problems in the education system as well as consciously seek and train budding immigrant journalists is the only way to boost the presence of minority reporters in the long term . minou amir-sehhi said german media needed to do more than appoint a few minority journalists to be a true mirror of society . " only when we have a dark-haired , dark-eyed presenter reporting from the german parliament then we can say we 've truly accepted reality and our status as an immigration country , " she said . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " an important signal to immigrants " dw-world.de spoke with the commissioner for integration at german broadcaster wdr about the need for tv networks to recruit more journalists and presenters from immigrant minorities .

" it does n't matter whether you have turkish roots and look obviously different or have blond hair and blue eyes and blend in with germans , " said minou amir-sehhi , a freelance german-iranian tv journalist for the publicly funded ard network who coordinates the " intercultural network " at the german association of journalists -lrb- djv -rrb- .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presenter arabella kiesbauer is a popular face on the private prosieben channel some observers said further examples such as hayali 's could also provide much-needed role models for immigrants . " it 's a sign to potential journalists who perhaps have n't trusted themselves to think that presenting a prime-time news show on a major network could be a job for a person with an italian or an iraqi name , " said gualtiero zambonini , commissioner for integration at cologne-based public network wdr , one of the few broadcasters to have such a post . learning from the netherlands ? at a european level , germany lags behind countries such as britain , where black and asian presenters are established on the bbc , and france , where a black anchorman , harry roselmack , has been hosting the country 's most popular news program . immigrants in those countries come largely from former colonies and share the language of the adopted nation , making it easier for them to break into the media . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harry roselmack is the first black anchorman on france 's most popular tv news show zambonini pointed out that germany could take a page from the netherlands ' book . " for example , minorities in the netherlands are entitled to have a certain share of programming in the media and there are laws governing it , " said zambonini .
" that obviously creates a whole new basis for the question about which journalists the networks hire . " networks doing a rethink german broadcasters , prodded by the government , are also reexamining their policies . dunja hayali said broadcaster zdf made no secret of the fact they were consciously seeking a minority presenter when they hired her . " of course my qualifications were the most important criterion , but there 's no denying my immigrant background was an added plus in bagging the job , " said hayali , who previously moderated a news show at dw-tv . demographic pressures are also forcing public broadcasters , which are partly financed by tv licensing fees , to adapt to a changed viewership . " today every fifth person in germany has an immigrant background , among the young generation in the big cities it 's every second , " said zambonini .
" we just have to take these viewers into account , otherwise we lose our right to exist . " not enough immigrant journalists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children with immigrant backgrounds often perform poorly at schools in germany but the biggest problem for the networks , experts said , is finding minority journalists . " the pool of potential immigrant journalists is tiny , which shows that promoting diversity has just not been a priority for media networks , " said lutz michel , head of the mmb institute for media research in essen . he added that a combination of poor language skills , lack of an academic environment at home and insufficient educational qualifications prevent many from opting for a career in journalism . an oecd study last year found that children from immigrant families in germany have fewer chances to succeed at school than in almost any other industrialized country . a long way to go most media observers agree that only a shared drive by politicians , media companies and journalism schools to fix problems in the education system as well as consciously seek and train budding immigrant journalists is the only way to boost the presence of minority reporters in the long term . minou amir-sehhi said german media needed to do more than appoint a few minority journalists to be a true mirror of society . " only when we have a dark-haired , dark-eyed presenter reporting from the german parliament then we can say we 've truly accepted reality and our status as an immigration country , " she said . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " an important signal to immigrants " dw-world.de spoke with the commissioner for integration at german broadcaster wdr about the need for tv networks to recruit more journalists and presenters from immigrant minorities .

" the world changes in dramatic ways , and what we are talking about here is indivisible security for the united states and for our nato allies , " he said .

gates , who started the trip monday in moscow , has invited the russians to inspect a us missile defense interceptor site in fort greely , alaska and a radar in california to clear up what he said was russian misunderstanding about the capability of the system being proposed for europe .
" in terms of assurances that the system would not be changed years from now in a way that might be more threatening to the russian deterrent , it seems to me that it is a matter that can be negotiated , " he said .

but they 're not willing to put up with the ill treatment any longer . then again , maybe it 's less the animals and more the people outside the german capital who are vying for the limelight in the cute animal arena .
it 's not really a stretch anyway for the citizens of cologne , who have a penchant for thinking themselves the center of the universe .
so , true to form , they 've started a major campaign to name their city 's latest animal addition : a baby elephant that glimpsed the world last week .
its release from the womb has unleashed a provincial media frenzy in the rhine river city .
bildunterschrift : is that a taunt we detect peeking out of knut 's mouth ?
since the animal 's birth , the city 's tabloid kölner express has been urging readers to send in their name suggestions for the baby boy born to mother tong koon on april 16 .
submissions have ranged from " somo , " to " marlon , " " pano " and " benjathong . "
" an asian ring to it " topping the list , however , -lrb- and my personal favorite -rrb- was " bendetto " - the nickname given to pope benedict xvi when he took up his post two years ago .
express readers thought it appropriate that pope and elephant partake in a mutual term of endearment since they share the same birthday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coverboy knut but cologne 's ego-centrism has won out .
the " mini-phant " -lrb- as the city 's express readers had dubbed their little darling for the short term -rrb- is due to be christened " ming jung " on wednesday , april 25 .
after a series of intense jury deliberations about the trunkster 's alias , cologne zoo director theo pagel said the " ming jung " suggestion was perfect .
" it sounds like the cologne dialect and has an asian ring to it at the same time , " he said .
he added that its melodious sound rolled off the tongue quite well .
" ming jung , " one might add , is the cologne dialect expression for mein junge , or " my boy . "
only the people of cologne could detect the symmetries between their city and the orient .
breeding zoo for asian elephants bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marlar , just one year ago then again , ming jung 's mother tong koon immigrated with four other elephants to the cologne zoo just last september , so we 'll cut ' em a little slack .
meanwhile , the other stellar-phant marlar has just celebrated her first birthday at the zoo .
" marlar is a bit dazed and confused about her new little playmate , ming jung , " said zookeeper werner naß .
if the births of the baby-phants keep going -lrb- another one is expected at the end of may -rrb- , knut may just get a run for his money after all .

germany 's star director spoke with dw-world.de about the draw of the jungle . christoph schlingensief 's production of wagner 's famous o per a premiered this week in the north-western brazilian city of manaus , the capital of the amazon .
bikini-clad samba dancers and o per a singers alike per formed in the amazon theater , which is known from werner herzog 's 1982 film " fitzcarraldo , " starring actor klaus kinski as an irish rubber baron .
the production is set to travel to germany and austria , before returning to brazil for an encore . dw-world.de : a soprano who had per formed in manaus said recently that it was an " extreme ex per ience " to sing in the amazon city .
was it also " extreme " for you to work in manaus ? christoph schlingensief : it was extreme , and therefore also productive .
just sitting under german cafeteria lights makes you blind .
we were here for nearly three months and i would n't have missed a day . in spite of the amazon 's " festival of o per a , " the audiences in manaus are n't as familiar with o per a as the european audiences are .
was that an advantage for you ? no . was it important to you that the brazilian participants got to know wagner , or was there little time for that ? when you rehearse for two months and the participants , technicians and slum residents hear wagner the whole time , then it 's nothing special .
here , wagner is just normal music .
it 's not as important as it is in german living rooms .
only in so-called wagnerian circles do people try to keep him antiseptic .
no one here is interested in that kind of thing . bildunterschrift : some 25,000 people attended the open-air premiere on april 20 samba , afro-brazilian rituals , poverty and women in bikinis - why did you choose to use so many brazilian cliches ? poverty as a cliche ?
have you seen how many people sleep on the streets here ? are you planning to bring the manaus team to germany to share this wagner-samba-production with german audiences ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : proverty in brazil is more than a cliche , said schlingensief the production is going to sao paulo first , then probably to germany and vienna .
since the show has been such a big success , the secretary of culture for the amazon has already invited us back to manaus next year . why did you choose to make a reference in the o per a to the film " salo " by italian director piero paolo pasolini , instead of werner herzog 's 1982 film " fitzcarraldo , " which also would have been appropriate ?
why did the brazilian setting inspire you to use pasolini 's screen version of the book " 120 days of sodom " ? i ca n't say much about brazil as a whole , but the colonial period , the " rubber period " in manaus , was a time in which everything looked the same .
there were filthy rich industrialists , an opera house , brothels , child sex , perversion - even today the region is still suffering from sex tourism .
the airline varig recently staged a campaign that brought up the issue of child sex . -lrb- actor klaus -rrb- kinski filled the jungle with wagner music -lrb- in werner herzog 's film " fitzcarraldo . " -rrb-
with a gramophone .
but we were on tour with a whole orchestra .
i 'm more interested in the idea of a forced opera than a private one . the german media focused on manaus as the setting for " the flying dutchman " and wagner seemed to take a backseat .
was it your intention to emphasize brazil over wagner ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlingensief , 46 , is known for productions that are way outside the box of tradition wagner 's spiritual world and the spiritual world of the amazon fit wonderfully together .
i wanted to demonstrate that , and it worked . brazilian writer milton hatoum , who comes from manaus , said the city and the primeval forest are " two different scenarios , two lies separated by the river . "
having spent over two months in manaus , do you agree with this description ? the difference is not the river .
that 's nonsense .
there 's also a big city jungle .
and manaus has over 1.8 million residents .
i think the primeval forest is melancholy and true to the bone .
the city is still trying to belie this .
the other side is waiting for its attack .
that 's why we were on the other side very often .
in the primeval forest . soraia vilela interviewed christoph schlingensief -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stage blood flows in berlin production of " iphigenia " naked senior citizens , countless liters of stage blood , a homosexual couple and us soldiers at abu ghraib : it sounds more like the script for an art house film than an 18th century opera .

iran denies us and eu charges that it is trying to build nuclear weapons .
larijani told reporters that the talks with solana aimed to evaluate " new ideas " that might be put on the table , the anatolia news agency said .
but solana 's spokesperson cristina gallach said there were " no changes in the position of the international community " and added that the priority was simply to " create conditions for the beginning of negotiations . "
diplomats said there was little hope of a breakthrough given iran 's steadfast refusal to freeze its enrichment work .
an ongoing crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is unlikely that larijani and solana will reach a breakthrough solana will travel on thursday to oslo , where he will brief eu foreign ministers on his meeting with larijani .
iran is defying two un security council resolutions to halt enrichment , saying its program is a legitimate effort to generate civilian nuclear power .
the council has imposed limited sanctions as punishment .
diplomats told afp that while everyone was trying to find a formula to start talks , the two sides remain far apart on a crisis that began in 2002 when it was revealed that iran was secretly building nuclear facilities .
the united states , europe , russia and china are ready in a compromise gesture to give iran a chance to edge its way slowly into stopping uranium enrichment , diplomats said .
the six world powers - britain , china , france , germany , russia and the united states - had last june offered economic , technical and security benefits if iran would agree to the suspension .
but iran pressed ahead and negotiations never started .
several rounds of talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has imposed sanctions on iran because of its nuclear activities larijani and solana held several rounds of talks that failed to find a way to start meetings with the six powers .
the two envoys last met face-to-face on the sidelines of a munich security conference on feb 11 .
larijani said on wednesday that progress had been blocked when " some unacceptable , irrational conditions were put forward " - a clear reference to the demands that iran suspend enrichment .
" if a solution can be found , it will cost the price of suspension , " a european diplomat said .
a second diplomat said one idea would be for iran to declare a moratorium on moving beyond activities it has already started , such as installing and running some 1,300 centrifuge machines as it seeks to upgrade from current research levels of enrichment to industrial production .
the moratorium could open the way for further talks with solana , with the un security council holding off on further sanctions against the islamic republic .
iran 's proposals involve it keeping at least a reduced level of enrichment work , diplomats said .
suspension or dismantling ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad vowed to push forward with efforts to enrich uranium non-proliferation expert gary samore told afp by telephone from washington that tehran wants the eu to agree to setting up an international consortium in iran for uranium enrichment .
but the major powers want such a consortium , which would process fuel for iran , to be set up outside the islamic republic .
a western diplomat said talks with the five permanent security council members plus germany would not in any case start before iran suspends enrichment .
" suspension does not mean dismantling what they have built , " the diplomat said , adding that the major powers were primarily interested in stopping the centrifuges from spinning in the refining of the u-235 isotope that makes for enriched uranium as well as keeping the iranians from learning how to run centrifuges .
iran faces a new security council deadline in one month , after which more sanctions could be imposed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 25.04.2007 new face on german tv highlights dearth of minority presenters großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dunja hayali will soon co-anchor the prime time news show on germany 's zdf network the choice of a minority presenter for the main news show on a major network is almost revolutionary in germany .
but experts say it spotlights the long way the country needs to go to visibly integrate its immigrants . at the end of april , dunja hayali , a german journalist of iraqi origin , will break the mold when she begins co-anchoring the main news show on zdf , one of germany 's biggest public television networks . in a country where a fifth of the population has an immigrant background , experts said minority presenters of all backgrounds remain conspicuously absent on mainstream television information and news programs . " it does n't matter whether you have turkish roots and look obviously different or have blond hair and blue eyes and blend in with germans , " said minou amir-sehhi , a freelance german-iranian tv journalist for the publicly funded ard network who coordinates the " intercultural network " at the german association of journalists -lrb- djv -rrb- . " there 's been a general wariness about contact with other accents and cultures in the country , and that 's reflected on television . " in the entire media industry , about 3 percent of journalists are estimated to have an immigrant background . striving for normality a sprinkling of immigrant presenters is currently to be found on some private channels and stations such as mtv .
on the influential public broadcasters , a few tend to be on niche programs devoted to issues of multiculturalism and integration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cherno jobatey is one of the few minority presenters on german television in that context , hayali 's appointment is " quite revolutionary , " said amir-sehhi . " it 's a sign of normality when you have a person with an immigrant background casually reading the news or the sports results on a major network instead of being shown as a problem or an exotic stereotype , " she said . experts added that in recent years a vocal debate about integration of immigrants has raised awareness about the role media , especially television with its high-profile visibility and reach , can play . the german government has also weighed in , urging the networks to recruit more journalists and tv presenters from immigrant minorities . " we have to make immigrants more visible in german television , " state secretary for integration maria böhmer told the daily süddeutsche zeitung .
" i keep hearing from immigrants that they do n't see themselves represented by the public sector broadcasters .
there is n't enough awareness of their experience of life , and there are n't enough immigrants in front of or behind the camera . " for example , having a turkish anchorwoman needs to become a normal thing , " she added .
" we need more reporters who themselves know the immigrants ’ world and can convey it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presenter arabella kiesbauer is a popular face on the private prosieben channel some observers said further examples such as hayali 's could also provide much-needed role models for immigrants . " it 's a sign to potential journalists who perhaps have n't trusted themselves to think that presenting a prime-time news show on a major network could be a job for a person with an italian or an iraqi name , " said gualtiero zambonini , commissioner for integration at cologne-based public network wdr , one of the few broadcasters to have such a post . learning from the netherlands ? at a european level , germany lags behind countries such as britain , where black and asian presenters are established on the bbc , and france , where a black anchorman , harry roselmack , has been hosting the country 's most popular news program . immigrants in those countries come largely from former colonies and share the language of the adopted nation , making it easier for them to break into the media . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harry roselmack is the first black anchorman on france 's most popular tv news show zambonini pointed out that germany could take a page from the netherlands ' book . " for example , minorities in the netherlands are entitled to have a certain share of programming in the media and there are laws governing it , " said zambonini .
" that obviously creates a whole new basis for the question about which journalists the networks hire . " networks doing a rethink german broadcasters , prodded by the government , are also reexamining their policies . dunja hayali said broadcaster zdf made no secret of the fact they were consciously seeking a minority presenter when they hired her . " of course my qualifications were the most important criterion , but there 's no denying my immigrant background was an added plus in bagging the job , " said hayali , who previously moderated a news show at dw-tv . demographic pressures are also forcing public broadcasters , which are partly financed by tv licensing fees , to adapt to a changed viewership . " today every fifth person in germany has an immigrant background , among the young generation in the big cities it 's every second , " said zambonini .
" we just have to take these viewers into account , otherwise we lose our right to exist . " not enough immigrant journalists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children with immigrant backgrounds often perform poorly at schools in germany but the biggest problem for the networks , experts said , is finding minority journalists . " the pool of potential immigrant journalists is tiny , which shows that promoting diversity has just not been a priority for media networks , " said lutz michel , head of the mmb institute for media research in essen . he added that a combination of poor language skills , lack of an academic environment at home and insufficient educational qualifications prevent many from opting for a career in journalism . an oecd study last year found that children from immigrant families in germany have fewer chances to succeed at school than in almost any other industrialized country . a long way to go most media observers agree that only a shared drive by politicians , media companies and journalism schools to fix problems in the education system as well as consciously seek and train budding immigrant journalists is the only way to boost the presence of minority reporters in the long term . minou amir-sehhi said german media needed to do more than appoint a few minority journalists to be a true mirror of society . " only when we have a dark-haired , dark-eyed presenter reporting from the german parliament then we can say we 've truly accepted reality and our status as an immigration country , " she said . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " an important signal to immigrants " dw-world.de spoke with the commissioner for integration at german broadcaster wdr about the need for tv networks to recruit more journalists and presenters from immigrant minorities .

german chancellor angela merkel aimed to make climate change a central theme at the summit , being held under the german g8 presidency , pfaffenbach reiterated in berlin on tuesday .
in his remarks , pfaffenbach was careful not to mention the united states by name , however , it the recipient of his comments on climate change was clear . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : planes contribute to co2 emissions blamed for global warming he indicated the germany 's disappointment that the us was not yet prepared to submit to an internationally agreed climate protection regime along the lines of the 1997 kyoto protocol , which runs out in 2012 . pfaffenbach expressed optimism that criticism and protests by non-governmental organizations , which have voiced strident protest at past g8 summits , would be muted this time . anti-globalization organizations are predicting that up to 100,000 demonstrators will march in the eastern german city of rostock , while police estimate the number at half that .
larger organizations , like attac and greenpeace , have committed themselves to peaceful marches , while smaller , more radical , groups have refused to rule out violent protests like that in genoa in 2001 .
africa also high on the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel pledged to push g8 members to meet their development aid commitments merkel intended to meet ngo representatives in mid-may , and the ngos had welcomed the fact that the chancellor also intended to place africa high on the agenda , he said .
g8 members aimed to offer african countries a " broad political partnership " with the aim of promoting democracy and reducing corruption , pfaffenbach said .
he stressed that money was not the solution to everything , although the industrialized countries stood by their longstanding commitments , including allocating 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product to development aid by 2012 .
african countries needed to improve their governmental structures and attract more private capital , he said .

" if a solution can be found , it will cost the price of suspension , " a european diplomat said .
a second diplomat said one idea would be for iran to declare a moratorium on moving beyond activities it has already started , such as installing and running some 1,300 centrifuge machines as it seeks to upgrade from current research levels of enrichment to industrial production .
the moratorium could open the way for further talks with solana , with the un security council holding off on further sanctions against the islamic republic .
iran 's proposals involve it keeping at least a reduced level of enrichment work , diplomats said .

a western diplomat said talks with the five permanent security council members plus germany would not in any case start before iran suspends enrichment .

iran denies us and eu charges that it is trying to build nuclear weapons .
larijani told reporters that the talks with solana aimed to evaluate " new ideas " that might be put on the table , the anatolia news agency said .
but solana 's spokesperson cristina gallach said there were " no changes in the position of the international community " and added that the priority was simply to " create conditions for the beginning of negotiations . "
diplomats said there was little hope of a breakthrough given iran 's steadfast refusal to freeze its enrichment work .
an ongoing crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is unlikely that larijani and solana will reach a breakthrough solana will travel on thursday to oslo , where he will brief eu foreign ministers on his meeting with larijani .
iran is defying two un security council resolutions to halt enrichment , saying its program is a legitimate effort to generate civilian nuclear power .
the council has imposed limited sanctions as punishment .
diplomats told afp that while everyone was trying to find a formula to start talks , the two sides remain far apart on a crisis that began in 2002 when it was revealed that iran was secretly building nuclear facilities .
the united states , europe , russia and china are ready in a compromise gesture to give iran a chance to edge its way slowly into stopping uranium enrichment , diplomats said .
the six world powers - britain , china , france , germany , russia and the united states - had last june offered economic , technical and security benefits if iran would agree to the suspension .

" the company needs clarity with regard to its leadership during these times , " kleinfeld said .
" i have therefore decided not to make myself available for an extension of my contract . " his successor has not been named . kleinfeld refused to accept the board delaying a vote on the contract , company officials said , as a result paving the way for a major shakeout in the group 's top management . his decision to leave the company after a two-decade career followed last week 's dramatic announcement by siemens chairman heinrich von pierer that he was resigning . slush-fund probe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner von siemens started the company in 1847 although cleared of any wrongdoing , kleinfeld 's future had hung in the balance as the siemens ' board considered whether far-reaching changes of the group 's management were necessary to help give the group a new start as it contended with an ongoing slush-fund probe . ahead of wednesday 's meeting , german media had reported that supervisory board members had started a search for a possible successor for kleinfeld as part of a push for a major shakeout of the company 's top management . despite launching an internal company investigation into recent scandals and stepping up corporate control procedures , kleinfeld has come under fire for failing to act sooner in dealing with allegations of corruption . this included claims that funds totaling as much as 420 million euros -lrb- $ 573 million dollars -rrb- had been siphoned off into illicit accounts over the last seven years . won praise during his two years at the helm of siemens , kleinfeld has also won plaudits from investors for his efforts to boost the company 's finances through big cuts in the company 's workforce and a major acquisitions drive . siemens ' shares edged down 0.94 percent to 88.36 euros as trading drew to a close wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinrich von pierer said last week he would step down the almost herculean task of steering siemens out of the crisis that has engulfed the company in recent months now falls on german steel giant thyssenkrupp ag 's chairman gerhard cromme , who is to takeover as board chairman from von pierer . ending his long career with the company , von pierer insisted he was not taking personal responsibility for the scandals that have badly shaken the company .
these included allegations that members of management channeled funds into an employer-friendly labor group . at the helm 66-year-old von pierer had presided over the company 's management both as chief executive and then as chairman during the time the corruption was alleged to have taken place . von pierer stepped aside as chief executive in 2005 to make way for kleinfeld , who was his protégé . the scandals have , however , also largely overshadowed siemens ' recent solid financial performance . data released tuesday evening by the company showed second-quarter net profit surged 36 percent to 1.259 billion euros .
this beat analysts ' forecasts of a rise to 1.193 billion euros . the group said revenues jumped 10 percent in the quarter to 20.626 billion euros . at the same time , siemens said orders increased nine percent to 23.469 billion euros , while group profit climbed 49 percent to 1.964 billion euros . dw staff / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de uncertainty continues at the top of siemens the supervisory board of siemens will determine on wednesday whether ceo klaus kleinfeld will stay on at the german electronics giant .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 25.04.2007 eu member states differ on anti-terror measures großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suveillance is increasingly used as a counterterrorist measure even though the european union has a common counter-terrorism strategy , its implementation is left to individual member states .
that is why anti-terror legislations differ from country to country . terrorism is not a new phenomenon in europe .
in the united kingdom , spain and ireland alone , it has claimed 5,000 deaths over the last 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the effects of sept .
11 are felt strongly in europe the sept .
11 attacks on the united states , however , have had a rippling effect across the atlantic as well .
faced with the challenges posed by the war against international terrorism , which were only heightened by the attacks in london and madrid , european countries were forced to adapt and expand their anti-terror legislations .
" legislative and institutional requirements have definitely become stricter in all 27 member states of the european union , " said annegret bendiek of the german institute for international and security affairs and author of a study on fighting terrorism in the eu .
yet striking the right balance between efficient engagement in the war on terror and protection of civil liberties has n't been easy to achieve .
one policy , many implementations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the end of privacy ?
in june 2002 , the eu council passed two resolutions - one establishing a common european arrest warrant and one defining a common concept of terrorist offences which all the member states of the european union had to include in their legal system .
in december 2005 , the eu adopted its eu counter-terrorism strategy , but it left the responsibility for its implementation in the hands of individual member states .
" states like the united kingdom , france and also germany are of course very engaged , " bendiek said .
but european states continue to differ greatly in their institutional and legislative approaches .
tough measures of all the eu member states , the united kingdom has gone the farthest in expanding the legislation meant to counter acts of terrorism .
several months after the 2001 attacks on new york and washington , d.c , britain 's terrorism act of 2000 was replaced by the anti-terrorism , crime and security act which stipulated that foreign terrorist suspects could be detained indefinitely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2005 attacks in london lead to even stricter anti-terror laws after a public outcry and an intervention from the law lords - a judicial body of the upper house of the british parliament which serves as a court of last instance in the uk - this measure was abolished for being incompatible with the european convention of human rights .
its powers were later replaced by the so-called control order in the 2005 prevention of terrorism act .
the control order , however , still allows for comprehensive restriction of an individual 's liberties for the purpose of " protecting members of the public from a risk of terrorism . "
after the london bomb attacks in the summer of 2005 , the british legislation was made even stricter .
according to the terrorism act of 2006 , for example , " glorification of terrorist acts " can lead to a seven-year prison sentence .
it 's legal to eavesdrop ever since july 2005 , italy 's secret service has been allowed to monitor telephone conversations for the sake of preventing terrorist attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police surveillance is a cause of concern for privacy activists france adopted a new law this year that follows the british model allowing for surveillance cameras to be placed in public spaces such as train stations , churches and mosques , shops , factories or nuclear plants .
after a failed terrorist attack , in which crude propane gas bombs were primed to explode on two german trains on july 31 , the german government introduced a new law on fighting terrorism .
germany now has a computer databank which allows police and intelligence agencies easier access to a range of information on terrorism suspects , including membership of terrorist groups , firearms registration information as well as internet and telecommunications data .
not everybody can do it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you never know who 's listening in but smaller and less affluent eu countries are often lagging behind in terms of their legislative apparatus and implementation of counter-terrorist measures .
according to bendiek , malta , portugal or greece , for example , lack the administrative infrastructure , personnel and funds for implementing anti-terrorism laws .
in other countries , it is above all different legal traditions that cancel each other in various legislations .
" the british have fewer problems with video surveillance than the germans , " bendiek said .
" but as war as telephone surveillance is concerned , it could be the other way around .

wisniewski was not charged in the slaying of harm 's predecessor , siegfried buback .
his murder was one of a series of raf assassinations that rocked former west germany in what later became known as " the german autumn . "
but in an interview with the newsmagazine der spiegel this week , another former terrorist , peter-jürgen boock , said wisniewski was probably the motorcycle gunman who fired the fatal shots that killed buback and two companions in april 1977 .
three other members of the raf , also known as the baader-meinhof gang , were convicted of the buback killing , but it never became clear who pulled the trigger .
maintained silence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chief federal prosecutor monika harms is reopening the case one of those convicted in the murder , christian klar , remains in prison and has applied for a presidential pardon .
brigitte mohnhaupt , found guilty as an accomplice , was released last month after serving 24 years .
knut folkerts , who was released from prison in 1995 , was the third man convicted , but two other former terrorists told der spiegel they did not believe he was involved in the murder .
all three convicted of the buback killing have remained silent .
buback 's son , michael , said last week that he might support klar 's clemency appeal after receiving new information which suggested that he had n't carried out the killing .
the 1977 assassination of buback was intended to free imprisoned raf members , including its co-founder , andreas baader .
the raf , which disbanded in 1998 , is suspected of killing 34 people between 1972 and 1991 .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economy minister michael glos " the upturn is continuing , growth remains strong and the situation in the labor market keeps getting better , " glos said .
citing germany 's robust export performance , glos said the present level of the euro was " sustainable , " but warned that a strong currency can threaten a country 's exports , making them more expensive and less competitive on world markets .
" if it -lrb- the euro -rrb- were to rise still more strongly , there would be risks , " glos said .
he was speaking as the euro moved closer to an all-time high point against the dollar , soaring to 1.3656 on wednesday , well within striking distance of 1.3666 , its record level reached on dec 30 , 2004 .

" germany is profiting from the extraordinary international investment boom , which due to germany 's specialization is having a stronger cyclical impact than in the other major european countries , " ifo president hans-werner sinn said in a statement .
for its monthly survey , ifo polls some 7,000 companies about their assessment of current business and their expectations for the next six months .
a breakdown of the data showed that the current sentiment sub-index rose to 113.2 points in april from 112.4 points in march .

the unemployment rate in march fell to 9.8 percent .

" of course , a considerable share of those exports would go to other euro area countries .
but , thus far , the mood amongst german manufacturers seems to be defiant regarding the euro , " she said , adding that the strong single currency and a us slowdown could leave " skid marks " in the future .

" german exports are competitive .
so far , strong demand from asia , central and eastern europe as well as the oil countries seems to offset the rise in the euro and weaker us demand . "
the sunny outlook in germany would provide additional arguments for the european central bank to continue raising its key interest rates , analysts said .
" along with rises in business confidence in belgium and netherlands , the surveys released so far this month support our view that the ecb will raise rates to 4.00 percent in june and once again in to 4.25 percent by year-end , " said sunil kapadia of ubs investment research . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de soccer world cup hardly touched german economy the patriotism and high spirits unleashed by this past summer 's world cup were expected to boost the german economy , but experts say the soccer event had virtually no impact on growth and employment .

wisniewski was not charged in the slaying of harm 's predecessor , siegfried buback .
his murder was one of a series of raf assassinations that rocked former west germany in what later became known as " the german autumn . "
but in an interview with the newsmagazine der spiegel this week , another former terrorist , peter-jürgen boock , said wisniewski was probably the motorcycle gunman who fired the fatal shots that killed buback and two companions in april 1977 .
three other members of the raf , also known as the baader-meinhof gang , were convicted of the buback killing , but it never became clear who pulled the trigger .
maintained silence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chief federal prosecutor monika harms is reopening the case one of those convicted in the murder , christian klar , remains in prison and has applied for a presidential pardon .
brigitte mohnhaupt , found guilty as an accomplice , was released last month after serving 24 years .
knut folkerts , who was released from prison in 1995 , was the third man convicted , but two other former terrorists told der spiegel they did not believe he was involved in the murder .
all three convicted of the buback killing have remained silent .
buback 's son , michael , said last week that he might support klar 's clemency appeal after receiving new information which suggested that he had n't carried out the killing .
the 1977 assassination of buback was intended to free imprisoned raf members , including its co-founder , andreas baader .
the raf , which disbanded in 1998 , is suspected of killing 34 people between 1972 and 1991 .

german chancellor angela merkel aimed to make climate change a central theme at the summit , being held under the german g8 presidency , pfaffenbach reiterated in berlin on tuesday .

g8 members aimed to offer african countries a " broad political partnership " with the aim of promoting democracy and reducing corruption , pfaffenbach said .
he stressed that money was not the solution to everything , although the industrialized countries stood by their longstanding commitments , including allocating 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product to development aid by 2012 .
african countries needed to improve their governmental structures and attract more private capital , he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 25.04.2007 " an important signal to immigrants " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gualtiero zambonini said tv networks need to do more to hire immigrant journalists dw-world.de spoke with the commissioner for integration at german broadcaster wdr about the need for tv networks to recruit more journalists and presenters from immigrant minorities . gualtiero zambonini has been the commissioner for integration at the cologne-based german public broadcaster , wdr , since 2003 . dw-world.de : the zdf public network will have a new german-iraqi presenter for their main news show starting end of april .
some media experts have called the appointment of a minority anchorwoman " revolutionary . "
do you see it that way too ? gualtiero zambonini : i would n't call it revolutionary , but it 's definitely an important signal in the right direction .
at wdr , we 've had asli sevindim , a turkish-german journalist , as the main anchorwoman of our evening prime-time news show for over a year now .
another of our turkish-german editors , birand bingül , belongs to the team of commentators on the prime-time news show on the ard network . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-iraqi journalist dunja hayali is the new face of german tv network zdf so , in a way zdf is following us .
but that 's also important because it 's a sign that the public broadcasters in germany have realized the necessity of reflecting this development in society both in their programs as well as in the profiles of their presenters . there are still very few minority presenters on the german networks .
why is that the case ? at wdr , we 've been developing measures for the past four years at least to try and get immigrant journalists on mainstream programs .
but in reality , we are only at the beginning of the road .
nobody should be under the illusion that just because we have a presenter of iraqi origin on zdf or an anchorwoman with a turkish background on wdr , we 've taken care of the problem .
these examples are important for two reasons .
firstly , because they show how seriously we want to promote the issue .
and secondly , because these role models are a sign to potential journalists who perhaps have n't trusted themselves up to now or did n't think that presenting a prime-time news show on major networks could be something for a person with an iraqi or an italian name .
it provides encouragement for more immigrants to pursue journalism careers . in the past , these signs were missing as was a hiring policy among media companies that consciously looked for minority journalists and signaled " we want more of them . "
that 's part of the problem why there are such few minority journalists in newsrooms and in front of cameras and microphones .
we simply realized the problem too late in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's immigrants do n't usually have the chance to study journalism the other part of the problem is that it 's only now in the second and third generation of immigrants that talent and potential is coming to the fore in the german media market .
these are children from immigrant families who grew up here and went to school and university .
this is a development that took place much earlier in countries such as britain or the netherlands partly because some of these nations have a history of immigration different from germany 's . how does germany compare with other countries in europe when it comes to integrating its immigrants into television ? we can definitely learn from good examples in europe , for instance from countries such as sweden or the netherlands where there are integration policies at the broadcasters and corresponding laws .
in the netherlands for example , minorities are entitled to have a certain share of programming in the media and there are laws governing it .
that obviously creates a whole new basis for the question about which journalists the networks hire . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british tv comes closer to reflecting social reality at the same time , that does n't mean there are no problems in these countries .
in the netherlands , there are still too many programs that are white - that means there are too many white dutch faces and not enough immigrants .
in britain , the situation is slightly different .
for instance , bbc international is a wonderful example of journalistic diversity , but that 's not the case in all bbc programs .
my colleagues at bbc say , ' it 's good that we 've achieved some goals , but we 're still far removed from truly representing society in the media . ' we can learn from the french too , who are redoubling efforts to tackle the problem of a lack of minority journalists .
but we 're generally lagging behind in europe .
the important thing is that we 've all recognized the problem . what else needs to be done at the networks for there to be a real change ? a rethink is already taking place among the top managers at the broadcasters as a result of pressure from politicians , societal developments as well as pressure from european policies which have placed integration of minorities high on the agenda .
one has to say that is not just a question of values and good sense but also a question of the market .
we have to take demographic developments into account .
today every fifth person in germany has an immigrant background .
among the younger generations in big cities , it 's every second person .
that means that viewers too have changed and this viewer ship lives in a culture of diversity .
if we do n't take these viewers into account , then we lose the right to exist .
it really is a question of our existence . but to really make progress on the issue , there has to be a change in the media company culture as well as in the way funds are managed .
in addition , the issue has to be anchored in the guiding principles of the broadcasters and supported with further training programs for employees as well as managers .
if nothing changes in the minds of the decision-makers , then we ca n't solve the problem . i believe that the public broadcasters bear a special responsibility towards promoting integration of immigrants .
we 're all financed by licensing fees , the public networks need to all take a stand on the issue . when do you think we 'll see a black presenter or a turkish-german anchor on " tagesschau " ?
-lrb- germany 's most popular news program -rrb- that wo n't take too long .
i hope that this healthy competition among the networks on the issue will soon generate a new face for the program . sonia phalnikar interviewed gualtiero zambonini send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new face on german tv highlights dearth of minority presenters the choice of a minority presenter for the main news show on a major network is almost revolutionary in germany .

another of our turkish-german editors , birand bingül , belongs to the team of commentators on the prime-time news show on the ard network . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-iraqi journalist dunja hayali is the new face of german tv network zdf so , in a way zdf is following us .
but that 's also important because it 's a sign that the public broadcasters in germany have realized the necessity of reflecting this development in society both in their programs as well as in the profiles of their presenters . there are still very few minority presenters on the german networks .
why is that the case ? at wdr , we 've been developing measures for the past four years at least to try and get immigrant journalists on mainstream programs .
but in reality , we are only at the beginning of the road .
nobody should be under the illusion that just because we have a presenter of iraqi origin on zdf or an anchorwoman with a turkish background on wdr , we 've taken care of the problem .
these examples are important for two reasons .
firstly , because they show how seriously we want to promote the issue .
and secondly , because these role models are a sign to potential journalists who perhaps have n't trusted themselves up to now or did n't think that presenting a prime-time news show on major networks could be something for a person with an iraqi or an italian name .
it provides encouragement for more immigrants to pursue journalism careers . in the past , these signs were missing as was a hiring policy among media companies that consciously looked for minority journalists and signaled " we want more of them . "
that 's part of the problem why there are such few minority journalists in newsrooms and in front of cameras and microphones .
we simply realized the problem too late in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's immigrants do n't usually have the chance to study journalism the other part of the problem is that it 's only now in the second and third generation of immigrants that talent and potential is coming to the fore in the german media market .
these are children from immigrant families who grew up here and went to school and university .
this is a development that took place much earlier in countries such as britain or the netherlands partly because some of these nations have a history of immigration different from germany 's . how does germany compare with other countries in europe when it comes to integrating its immigrants into television ? we can definitely learn from good examples in europe , for instance from countries such as sweden or the netherlands where there are integration policies at the broadcasters and corresponding laws .
in the netherlands for example , minorities are entitled to have a certain share of programming in the media and there are laws governing it .
that obviously creates a whole new basis for the question about which journalists the networks hire . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british tv comes closer to reflecting social reality at the same time , that does n't mean there are no problems in these countries .
in the netherlands , there are still too many programs that are white - that means there are too many white dutch faces and not enough immigrants .
in britain , the situation is slightly different .
for instance , bbc international is a wonderful example of journalistic diversity , but that 's not the case in all bbc programs .
my colleagues at bbc say , ' it 's good that we 've achieved some goals , but we 're still far removed from truly representing society in the media . ' we can learn from the french too , who are redoubling efforts to tackle the problem of a lack of minority journalists .
but we 're generally lagging behind in europe .
the important thing is that we 've all recognized the problem . what else needs to be done at the networks for there to be a real change ? a rethink is already taking place among the top managers at the broadcasters as a result of pressure from politicians , societal developments as well as pressure from european policies which have placed integration of minorities high on the agenda .
one has to say that is not just a question of values and good sense but also a question of the market .
we have to take demographic developments into account .
today every fifth person in germany has an immigrant background .
among the younger generations in big cities , it 's every second person .
that means that viewers too have changed and this viewer ship lives in a culture of diversity .
if we do n't take these viewers into account , then we lose the right to exist .
it really is a question of our existence . but to really make progress on the issue , there has to be a change in the media company culture as well as in the way funds are managed .
in addition , the issue has to be anchored in the guiding principles of the broadcasters and supported with further training programs for employees as well as managers .
if nothing changes in the minds of the decision-makers , then we ca n't solve the problem . i believe that the public broadcasters bear a special responsibility towards promoting integration of immigrants .
we 're all financed by licensing fees , the public networks need to all take a stand on the issue . when do you think we 'll see a black presenter or a turkish-german anchor on " tagesschau " ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 25.04.2007 " an important signal to immigrants " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gualtiero zambonini said tv networks need to do more to hire immigrant journalists dw-world.de spoke with the commissioner for integration at german broadcaster wdr about the need for tv networks to recruit more journalists and presenters from immigrant minorities . gualtiero zambonini has been the commissioner for integration at the cologne-based german public broadcaster , wdr , since 2003 . dw-world.de : the zdf public network will have a new german-iraqi presenter for their main news show starting end of april .
some media experts have called the appointment of a minority anchorwoman " revolutionary . "
do you see it that way too ? gualtiero zambonini : i would n't call it revolutionary , but it 's definitely an important signal in the right direction .
at wdr , we 've had asli sevindim , a turkish-german journalist , as the main anchorwoman of our evening prime-time news show for over a year now .
another of our turkish-german editors , birand bingül , belongs to the team of commentators on the prime-time news show on the ard network . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-iraqi journalist dunja hayali is the new face of german tv network zdf so , in a way zdf is following us .
but that 's also important because it 's a sign that the public broadcasters in germany have realized the necessity of reflecting this development in society both in their programs as well as in the profiles of their presenters . there are still very few minority presenters on the german networks .
why is that the case ? at wdr , we 've been developing measures for the past four years at least to try and get immigrant journalists on mainstream programs .
but in reality , we are only at the beginning of the road .
nobody should be under the illusion that just because we have a presenter of iraqi origin on zdf or an anchorwoman with a turkish background on wdr , we 've taken care of the problem .
these examples are important for two reasons .
firstly , because they show how seriously we want to promote the issue .
and secondly , because these role models are a sign to potential journalists who perhaps have n't trusted themselves up to now or did n't think that presenting a prime-time news show on major networks could be something for a person with an iraqi or an italian name .
it provides encouragement for more immigrants to pursue journalism careers . in the past , these signs were missing as was a hiring policy among media companies that consciously looked for minority journalists and signaled " we want more of them . "
that 's part of the problem why there are such few minority journalists in newsrooms and in front of cameras and microphones .
we simply realized the problem too late in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's immigrants do n't usually have the chance to study journalism the other part of the problem is that it 's only now in the second and third generation of immigrants that talent and potential is coming to the fore in the german media market .
these are children from immigrant families who grew up here and went to school and university .
this is a development that took place much earlier in countries such as britain or the netherlands partly because some of these nations have a history of immigration different from germany 's . how does germany compare with other countries in europe when it comes to integrating its immigrants into television ? we can definitely learn from good examples in europe , for instance from countries such as sweden or the netherlands where there are integration policies at the broadcasters and corresponding laws .
in the netherlands for example , minorities are entitled to have a certain share of programming in the media and there are laws governing it .
that obviously creates a whole new basis for the question about which journalists the networks hire . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british tv comes closer to reflecting social reality at the same time , that does n't mean there are no problems in these countries .
in the netherlands , there are still too many programs that are white - that means there are too many white dutch faces and not enough immigrants .
in britain , the situation is slightly different .
for instance , bbc international is a wonderful example of journalistic diversity , but that 's not the case in all bbc programs .
my colleagues at bbc say , ' it 's good that we 've achieved some goals , but we 're still far removed from truly representing society in the media . ' we can learn from the french too , who are redoubling efforts to tackle the problem of a lack of minority journalists .
but we 're generally lagging behind in europe .
the important thing is that we 've all recognized the problem . what else needs to be done at the networks for there to be a real change ? a rethink is already taking place among the top managers at the broadcasters as a result of pressure from politicians , societal developments as well as pressure from european policies which have placed integration of minorities high on the agenda .
one has to say that is not just a question of values and good sense but also a question of the market .
we have to take demographic developments into account .
today every fifth person in germany has an immigrant background .
among the younger generations in big cities , it 's every second person .
that means that viewers too have changed and this viewer ship lives in a culture of diversity .
if we do n't take these viewers into account , then we lose the right to exist .
it really is a question of our existence . but to really make progress on the issue , there has to be a change in the media company culture as well as in the way funds are managed .
in addition , the issue has to be anchored in the guiding principles of the broadcasters and supported with further training programs for employees as well as managers .
if nothing changes in the minds of the decision-makers , then we ca n't solve the problem . i believe that the public broadcasters bear a special responsibility towards promoting integration of immigrants .
we 're all financed by licensing fees , the public networks need to all take a stand on the issue . when do you think we 'll see a black presenter or a turkish-german anchor on " tagesschau " ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economy minister michael glos " the upturn is continuing , growth remains strong and the situation in the labor market keeps getting better , " glos said .
citing germany 's robust export performance , glos said the present level of the euro was " sustainable , " but warned that a strong currency can threaten a country 's exports , making them more expensive and less competitive on world markets .
" if it -lrb- the euro -rrb- were to rise still more strongly , there would be risks , " glos said .
he was speaking as the euro moved closer to an all-time high point against the dollar , soaring to 1.3656 on wednesday , well within striking distance of 1.3666 , its record level reached on dec 30 , 2004 .
surpassing expectations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro moved closer to an all-time high point against the dollar the influential ifo index rose to 108.6 points in april from 107.7 points in march , putting it just one-tenth of a point away from the record score of 108.7 points recorded in december .
analysts polled by news agency thomson financial had predicted a far more modest surge , to 107.8 points .
" germany is profiting from the extraordinary international investment boom , which due to germany 's specialization is having a stronger cyclical impact than in the other major european countries , " ifo president hans-werner sinn said in a statement .
for its monthly survey , ifo polls some 7,000 companies about their assessment of current business and their expectations for the next six months .
a breakdown of the data showed that the current sentiment sub-index rose to 113.2 points in april from 112.4 points in march .
and the expectations sub-index also increased , rising to 104.3 points from 103.2 points , ifo said .
analysts said the data were further proof that the german economy has weathered a steep hike in value-added tax this year .
jumping over hurdles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany increased its vat to 19 procent this year on jan 1 , the german government increased vat by three full percentage points to 19 percent , the biggest-ever single rise in a move experts said would put the brakes on consumer spending and therefore drag on overall growth .
the robust health of the economy is now expected to reduce public debt and buoy the job market .
the unemployment rate in march fell to 9.8 percent .
ifo said in retailing and wholesaling , the business climate had also brightened noticeably in march with companies giving more positive appraisals of both their current situation and their six-month outlook .
sentiment in the construction industry , however , remained unchanged .
positive outlook bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german manufacturers are confident about their exports elga bartsch of morgan stanley said the fact the euro had hit a two-year peak against the dollar had not hurt germany 's export-driven economy .
" notwithstanding the stronger euro , the ifo institute also reported an improvement in the export expectations of german manufacturers , " bartsch said .
" of course , a considerable share of those exports would go to other euro area countries .
but , thus far , the mood amongst german manufacturers seems to be defiant regarding the euro , " she said , adding that the strong single currency and a us slowdown could leave " skid marks " in the future .
laying the groundwork bank of america 's holger schmieding said german companies had helped lay the groundwork for the sharp economic upturn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank may end up raising its interest rates " with export expectations up according to an ifo spokesman , it shows that the severe slashing of costs that german corporations had to do in the years since 2000 is paying off nicely , " he said .
" german exports are competitive .
so far , strong demand from asia , central and eastern europe as well as the oil countries seems to offset the rise in the euro and weaker us demand . "
the sunny outlook in germany would provide additional arguments for the european central bank to continue raising its key interest rates , analysts said .
" along with rises in business confidence in belgium and netherlands , the surveys released so far this month support our view that the ecb will raise rates to 4.00 percent in june and once again in to 4.25 percent by year-end , " said sunil kapadia of ubs investment research . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de soccer world cup hardly touched german economy the patriotism and high spirits unleashed by this past summer 's world cup were expected to boost the german economy , but experts say the soccer event had virtually no impact on growth and employment .

iran denies us and eu charges that it is trying to build nuclear weapons .
larijani told reporters that the talks with solana aimed to evaluate " new ideas " that might be put on the table , the anatolia news agency said .
but solana 's spokesperson cristina gallach said there were " no changes in the position of the international community " and added that the priority was simply to " create conditions for the beginning of negotiations . "
diplomats said there was little hope of a breakthrough given iran 's steadfast refusal to freeze its enrichment work .
an ongoing crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is unlikely that larijani and solana will reach a breakthrough solana will travel on thursday to oslo , where he will brief eu foreign ministers on his meeting with larijani .
iran is defying two un security council resolutions to halt enrichment , saying its program is a legitimate effort to generate civilian nuclear power .
the council has imposed limited sanctions as punishment .
diplomats told afp that while everyone was trying to find a formula to start talks , the two sides remain far apart on a crisis that began in 2002 when it was revealed that iran was secretly building nuclear facilities .
the united states , europe , russia and china are ready in a compromise gesture to give iran a chance to edge its way slowly into stopping uranium enrichment , diplomats said .
the six world powers - britain , china , france , germany , russia and the united states - had last june offered economic , technical and security benefits if iran would agree to the suspension .
but iran pressed ahead and negotiations never started .
several rounds of talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has imposed sanctions on iran because of its nuclear activities larijani and solana held several rounds of talks that failed to find a way to start meetings with the six powers .
the two envoys last met face-to-face on the sidelines of a munich security conference on feb 11 .
larijani said on wednesday that progress had been blocked when " some unacceptable , irrational conditions were put forward " - a clear reference to the demands that iran suspend enrichment .
" if a solution can be found , it will cost the price of suspension , " a european diplomat said .
a second diplomat said one idea would be for iran to declare a moratorium on moving beyond activities it has already started , such as installing and running some 1,300 centrifuge machines as it seeks to upgrade from current research levels of enrichment to industrial production .
the moratorium could open the way for further talks with solana , with the un security council holding off on further sanctions against the islamic republic .
iran 's proposals involve it keeping at least a reduced level of enrichment work , diplomats said .
suspension or dismantling ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad vowed to push forward with efforts to enrich uranium non-proliferation expert gary samore told afp by telephone from washington that tehran wants the eu to agree to setting up an international consortium in iran for uranium enrichment .
but the major powers want such a consortium , which would process fuel for iran , to be set up outside the islamic republic .
a western diplomat said talks with the five permanent security council members plus germany would not in any case start before iran suspends enrichment .
" suspension does not mean dismantling what they have built , " the diplomat said , adding that the major powers were primarily interested in stopping the centrifuges from spinning in the refining of the u-235 isotope that makes for enriched uranium as well as keeping the iranians from learning how to run centrifuges .
iran faces a new security council deadline in one month , after which more sanctions could be imposed .
the united states has not ruled out a military attack to bring iran to heel . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran 's release of sailors gives hope in nuclear negotiations iran 's release of the captured british sailors hints at a more pragmatic , less radical approach towards the west , say analysts .
the move stirs hope of a possible return to negotiations in the iran nuclear stand-off .
-lrb- 06.04.2007 -rrb- opinion : a pointless resolution the un security council 's latest resolution that imposes sanctions on iran for refusing to halt its nuclear program can only make it more difficult to solve the problem , writes dw 's peter philipp .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economy minister michael glos " the upturn is continuing , growth remains strong and the situation in the labor market keeps getting better , " glos said .
citing germany 's robust export performance , glos said the present level of the euro was " sustainable , " but warned that a strong currency can threaten a country 's exports , making them more expensive and less competitive on world markets .
" if it -lrb- the euro -rrb- were to rise still more strongly , there would be risks , " glos said .
he was speaking as the euro moved closer to an all-time high point against the dollar , soaring to 1.3656 on wednesday , well within striking distance of 1.3666 , its record level reached on dec 30 , 2004 .
surpassing expectations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro moved closer to an all-time high point against the dollar the influential ifo index rose to 108.6 points in april from 107.7 points in march , putting it just one-tenth of a point away from the record score of 108.7 points recorded in december .
analysts polled by news agency thomson financial had predicted a far more modest surge , to 107.8 points .
" germany is profiting from the extraordinary international investment boom , which due to germany 's specialization is having a stronger cyclical impact than in the other major european countries , " ifo president hans-werner sinn said in a statement .
for its monthly survey , ifo polls some 7,000 companies about their assessment of current business and their expectations for the next six months .
a breakdown of the data showed that the current sentiment sub-index rose to 113.2 points in april from 112.4 points in march .
and the expectations sub-index also increased , rising to 104.3 points from 103.2 points , ifo said .
analysts said the data were further proof that the german economy has weathered a steep hike in value-added tax this year .
jumping over hurdles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany increased its vat to 19 procent this year on jan 1 , the german government increased vat by three full percentage points to 19 percent , the biggest-ever single rise in a move experts said would put the brakes on consumer spending and therefore drag on overall growth .
the robust health of the economy is now expected to reduce public debt and buoy the job market .
the unemployment rate in march fell to 9.8 percent .
ifo said in retailing and wholesaling , the business climate had also brightened noticeably in march with companies giving more positive appraisals of both their current situation and their six-month outlook .
sentiment in the construction industry , however , remained unchanged .
positive outlook bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german manufacturers are confident about their exports elga bartsch of morgan stanley said the fact the euro had hit a two-year peak against the dollar had not hurt germany 's export-driven economy .
" notwithstanding the stronger euro , the ifo institute also reported an improvement in the export expectations of german manufacturers , " bartsch said .

iran denies us and eu charges that it is trying to build nuclear weapons .
larijani told reporters that the talks with solana aimed to evaluate " new ideas " that might be put on the table , the anatolia news agency said .
but solana 's spokesperson cristina gallach said there were " no changes in the position of the international community " and added that the priority was simply to " create conditions for the beginning of negotiations . "
diplomats said there was little hope of a breakthrough given iran 's steadfast refusal to freeze its enrichment work .
an ongoing crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is unlikely that larijani and solana will reach a breakthrough solana will travel on thursday to oslo , where he will brief eu foreign ministers on his meeting with larijani .
iran is defying two un security council resolutions to halt enrichment , saying its program is a legitimate effort to generate civilian nuclear power .
the council has imposed limited sanctions as punishment .
diplomats told afp that while everyone was trying to find a formula to start talks , the two sides remain far apart on a crisis that began in 2002 when it was revealed that iran was secretly building nuclear facilities .
the united states , europe , russia and china are ready in a compromise gesture to give iran a chance to edge its way slowly into stopping uranium enrichment , diplomats said .
the six world powers - britain , china , france , germany , russia and the united states - had last june offered economic , technical and security benefits if iran would agree to the suspension .
but iran pressed ahead and negotiations never started .
several rounds of talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has imposed sanctions on iran because of its nuclear activities larijani and solana held several rounds of talks that failed to find a way to start meetings with the six powers .
the two envoys last met face-to-face on the sidelines of a munich security conference on feb 11 .
larijani said on wednesday that progress had been blocked when " some unacceptable , irrational conditions were put forward " - a clear reference to the demands that iran suspend enrichment .
" if a solution can be found , it will cost the price of suspension , " a european diplomat said .
a second diplomat said one idea would be for iran to declare a moratorium on moving beyond activities it has already started , such as installing and running some 1,300 centrifuge machines as it seeks to upgrade from current research levels of enrichment to industrial production .
the moratorium could open the way for further talks with solana , with the un security council holding off on further sanctions against the islamic republic .
iran 's proposals involve it keeping at least a reduced level of enrichment work , diplomats said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad vowed to push forward with efforts to enrich uranium non-proliferation expert gary samore told afp by telephone from washington that tehran wants the eu to agree to setting up an international consortium in iran for uranium enrichment .
but the major powers want such a consortium , which would process fuel for iran , to be set up outside the islamic republic .
a western diplomat said talks with the five permanent security council members plus germany would not in any case start before iran suspends enrichment .
" suspension does not mean dismantling what they have built , " the diplomat said , adding that the major powers were primarily interested in stopping the centrifuges from spinning in the refining of the u-235 isotope that makes for enriched uranium as well as keeping the iranians from learning how to run centrifuges .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economy minister michael glos " the upturn is continuing , growth remains strong and the situation in the labor market keeps getting better , " glos said .
citing germany 's robust export performance , glos said the present level of the euro was " sustainable , " but warned that a strong currency can threaten a country 's exports , making them more expensive and less competitive on world markets .
" if it -lrb- the euro -rrb- were to rise still more strongly , there would be risks , " glos said .
he was speaking as the euro moved closer to an all-time high point against the dollar , soaring to 1.3656 on wednesday , well within striking distance of 1.3666 , its record level reached on dec 30 , 2004 .
surpassing expectations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro moved closer to an all-time high point against the dollar the influential ifo index rose to 108.6 points in april from 107.7 points in march , putting it just one-tenth of a point away from the record score of 108.7 points recorded in december .
analysts polled by news agency thomson financial had predicted a far more modest surge , to 107.8 points .
" germany is profiting from the extraordinary international investment boom , which due to germany 's specialization is having a stronger cyclical impact than in the other major european countries , " ifo president hans-werner sinn said in a statement .
for its monthly survey , ifo polls some 7,000 companies about their assessment of current business and their expectations for the next six months .
a breakdown of the data showed that the current sentiment sub-index rose to 113.2 points in april from 112.4 points in march .

but they 're not willing to put up with the ill treatment any longer . then again , maybe it 's less the animals and more the people outside the german capital who are vying for the limelight in the cute animal arena .
it 's not really a stretch anyway for the citizens of cologne , who have a penchant for thinking themselves the center of the universe .
so , true to form , they 've started a major campaign to name their city 's latest animal addition : a baby elephant that glimpsed the world last week .
its release from the womb has unleashed a provincial media frenzy in the rhine river city .
bildunterschrift : is that a taunt we detect peeking out of knut 's mouth ?
since the animal 's birth , the city 's tabloid kölner express has been urging readers to send in their name suggestions for the baby boy born to mother tong koon on april 16 .
submissions have ranged from " somo , " to " marlon , " " pano " and " benjathong . "
" an asian ring to it " topping the list , however , -lrb- and my personal favorite -rrb- was " bendetto " - the nickname given to pope benedict xvi when he took up his post two years ago .
express readers thought it appropriate that pope and elephant partake in a mutual term of endearment since they share the same birthday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coverboy knut but cologne 's ego-centrism has won out .
the " mini-phant " -lrb- as the city 's express readers had dubbed their little darling for the short term -rrb- is due to be christened " ming jung " on wednesday , april 25 .
after a series of intense jury deliberations about the trunkster 's alias , cologne zoo director theo pagel said the " ming jung " suggestion was perfect .
" it sounds like the cologne dialect and has an asian ring to it at the same time , " he said .
he added that its melodious sound rolled off the tongue quite well .
" ming jung , " one might add , is the cologne dialect expression for mein junge , or " my boy . "
only the people of cologne could detect the symmetries between their city and the orient .
breeding zoo for asian elephants bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marlar , just one year ago then again , ming jung 's mother tong koon immigrated with four other elephants to the cologne zoo just last september , so we 'll cut ' em a little slack .
meanwhile , the other stellar-phant marlar has just celebrated her first birthday at the zoo .
" marlar is a bit dazed and confused about her new little playmate , ming jung , " said zookeeper werner naß .
if the births of the baby-phants keep going -lrb- another one is expected at the end of may -rrb- , knut may just get a run for his money after all .

that is why anti-terror legislations differ from country to country . terrorism is not a new phenomenon in europe .
in the united kingdom , spain and ireland alone , it has claimed 5,000 deaths over the last 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the effects of sept .
11 are felt strongly in europe the sept .
11 attacks on the united states , however , have had a rippling effect across the atlantic as well .
faced with the challenges posed by the war against international terrorism , which were only heightened by the attacks in london and madrid , european countries were forced to adapt and expand their anti-terror legislations .
" legislative and institutional requirements have definitely become stricter in all 27 member states of the european union , " said annegret bendiek of the german institute for international and security affairs and author of a study on fighting terrorism in the eu .
yet striking the right balance between efficient engagement in the war on terror and protection of civil liberties has n't been easy to achieve .
one policy , many implementations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the end of privacy ?
in june 2002 , the eu council passed two resolutions - one establishing a common european arrest warrant and one defining a common concept of terrorist offences which all the member states of the european union had to include in their legal system .
in december 2005 , the eu adopted its eu counter-terrorism strategy , but it left the responsibility for its implementation in the hands of individual member states .
" states like the united kingdom , france and also germany are of course very engaged , " bendiek said .
but european states continue to differ greatly in their institutional and legislative approaches .
tough measures of all the eu member states , the united kingdom has gone the farthest in expanding the legislation meant to counter acts of terrorism .
several months after the 2001 attacks on new york and washington , d.c , britain 's terrorism act of 2000 was replaced by the anti-terrorism , crime and security act which stipulated that foreign terrorist suspects could be detained indefinitely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2005 attacks in london lead to even stricter anti-terror laws after a public outcry and an intervention from the law lords - a judicial body of the upper house of the british parliament which serves as a court of last instance in the uk - this measure was abolished for being incompatible with the european convention of human rights .
its powers were later replaced by the so-called control order in the 2005 prevention of terrorism act .
the control order , however , still allows for comprehensive restriction of an individual 's liberties for the purpose of " protecting members of the public from a risk of terrorism . "
after the london bomb attacks in the summer of 2005 , the british legislation was made even stricter .
according to the terrorism act of 2006 , for example , " glorification of terrorist acts " can lead to a seven-year prison sentence .
it 's legal to eavesdrop ever since july 2005 , italy 's secret service has been allowed to monitor telephone conversations for the sake of preventing terrorist attacks .

after a failed terrorist attack , in which crude propane gas bombs were primed to explode on two german trains on july 31 , the german government introduced a new law on fighting terrorism .
germany now has a computer databank which allows police and intelligence agencies easier access to a range of information on terrorism suspects , including membership of terrorist groups , firearms registration information as well as internet and telecommunications data .
not everybody can do it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you never know who 's listening in but smaller and less affluent eu countries are often lagging behind in terms of their legislative apparatus and implementation of counter-terrorist measures .
according to bendiek , malta , portugal or greece , for example , lack the administrative infrastructure , personnel and funds for implementing anti-terrorism laws .
in other countries , it is above all different legal traditions that cancel each other in various legislations .

gates , who was speaking after a meeting in berlin with german defense minister franz josef jung and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , said he would return to russia soon to continue discussions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gates -lrb- l -rrb- with german foreign minister steinmeier he said the us had offered to work closely with moscow and negotiate limits that would ensure the shield would not pose a threat to russia 's nuclear deterence .
" we will continue to consult with russia on missile defence as well as with our allies , " gates said .
" we 've made some very far-reaching proposals . "
" there is some debate in moscow about this dialogue , " he added .
attempts to alleviate russia 's concerns however , addressing a press conference in berlin with gates , jung said the aim was a " total concept " on missile defense and that the russian objections were " unjustified . "
the missile shield was intended as a " defensive function for the population , " jung said , adding that it was aimed at countering a threat that could be 10 years away .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gates with defense minister franz josef jung jung also said earlier in an interview with the daily sächsische zeitung published wednesday that he was confident the united states could alleviate russia 's concerns .
russia can be convinced of the necessity of the missile defense system " by explaining to them that there is a shared interest in security against missiles - for example from rogue states , " jung said .
german chancellor angela merkel has urged washington to engage russia on its concerns about us plans to deploy 10 interceptor missiles in poland and a radar in the czech republic by 2012 .
the four-billion-dollar project is aimed at countering a potential missile threat from iran , not russia .
scepticism about plan but the plan has antagonized moscow , which sees it as a further military encroachment in its former sphere of influence , and has aroused misgivings among some european allies .
on tuesday in warsaw , gates said he did not believe that russia was a military threat to poland " either now or -lrb- in the event that -rrb- we should install a missile defense . "
" the world changes in dramatic ways , and what we are talking about here is indivisible security for the united states and for our nato allies , " he said .
" we would like to extend that umbrella to russia , and partner with russia and have russia be with us in this program , " he said .
poland 's willingness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are many critics but also supporters of the plan poland 's conservative government , led by the president 's twin brother , prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , has signaled its willingness to host the base , but formal negotiations between washington and warsaw have not yet begun .
gates , who started the trip monday in moscow , has invited the russians to inspect a us missile defense interceptor site in fort greely , alaska and a radar in california to clear up what he said was russian misunderstanding about the capability of the system being proposed for europe .
" in terms of assurances that the system would not be changed years from now in a way that might be more threatening to the russian deterrent , it seems to me that it is a matter that can be negotiated , " he said .
gates provided no details and it was unclear whether the scope of such negotiations would involve the broader us missile defense system , or only the proposed european component . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu-russia mistrust nears cold war level , eu commissioner says mistrust and a lack of respect in the relations between the european union and russia are at their lowest level since the fall of communism , according to eu trade commissioner peter mandelson .

the four-billion-dollar project is aimed at countering a potential missile threat from iran , not russia .
scepticism about plan but the plan has antagonized moscow , which sees it as a further military encroachment in its former sphere of influence , and has aroused misgivings among some european allies .
on tuesday in warsaw , gates said he did not believe that russia was a military threat to poland " either now or -lrb- in the event that -rrb- we should install a missile defense . "
" the world changes in dramatic ways , and what we are talking about here is indivisible security for the united states and for our nato allies , " he said .
" we would like to extend that umbrella to russia , and partner with russia and have russia be with us in this program , " he said .
poland 's willingness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are many critics but also supporters of the plan poland 's conservative government , led by the president 's twin brother , prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , has signaled its willingness to host the base , but formal negotiations between washington and warsaw have not yet begun .
gates , who started the trip monday in moscow , has invited the russians to inspect a us missile defense interceptor site in fort greely , alaska and a radar in california to clear up what he said was russian misunderstanding about the capability of the system being proposed for europe .
" in terms of assurances that the system would not be changed years from now in a way that might be more threatening to the russian deterrent , it seems to me that it is a matter that can be negotiated , " he said .
gates provided no details and it was unclear whether the scope of such negotiations would involve the broader us missile defense system , or only the proposed european component . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu-russia mistrust nears cold war level , eu commissioner says mistrust and a lack of respect in the relations between the european union and russia are at their lowest level since the fall of communism , according to eu trade commissioner peter mandelson .

wisniewski was not charged in the slaying of harm 's predecessor , siegfried buback .
his murder was one of a series of raf assassinations that rocked former west germany in what later became known as " the german autumn . "
but in an interview with the newsmagazine der spiegel this week , another former terrorist , peter-jürgen boock , said wisniewski was probably the motorcycle gunman who fired the fatal shots that killed buback and two companions in april 1977 .

all three convicted of the buback killing have remained silent .
buback 's son , michael , said last week that he might support klar 's clemency appeal after receiving new information which suggested that he had n't carried out the killing .
the 1977 assassination of buback was intended to free imprisoned raf members , including its co-founder , andreas baader .

but experts say it spotlights the long way the country needs to go to visibly integrate its immigrants . at the end of april , dunja hayali , a german journalist of iraqi origin , will break the mold when she begins co-anchoring the main news show on zdf , one of germany 's biggest public television networks . in a country where a fifth of the population has an immigrant background , experts said minority presenters of all backgrounds remain conspicuously absent on mainstream television information and news programs . " it does n't matter whether you have turkish roots and look obviously different or have blond hair and blue eyes and blend in with germans , " said minou amir-sehhi , a freelance german-iranian tv journalist for the publicly funded ard network who coordinates the " intercultural network " at the german association of journalists -lrb- djv -rrb- . " there 's been a general wariness about contact with other accents and cultures in the country , and that 's reflected on television . " in the entire media industry , about 3 percent of journalists are estimated to have an immigrant background . striving for normality a sprinkling of immigrant presenters is currently to be found on some private channels and stations such as mtv .
on the influential public broadcasters , a few tend to be on niche programs devoted to issues of multiculturalism and integration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cherno jobatey is one of the few minority presenters on german television in that context , hayali 's appointment is " quite revolutionary , " said amir-sehhi . " it 's a sign of normality when you have a person with an immigrant background casually reading the news or the sports results on a major network instead of being shown as a problem or an exotic stereotype , " she said . experts added that in recent years a vocal debate about integration of immigrants has raised awareness about the role media , especially television with its high-profile visibility and reach , can play . the german government has also weighed in , urging the networks to recruit more journalists and tv presenters from immigrant minorities . " we have to make immigrants more visible in german television , " state secretary for integration maria böhmer told the daily süddeutsche zeitung .
" i keep hearing from immigrants that they do n't see themselves represented by the public sector broadcasters .
there is n't enough awareness of their experience of life , and there are n't enough immigrants in front of or behind the camera . " for example , having a turkish anchorwoman needs to become a normal thing , " she added .
" we need more reporters who themselves know the immigrants ’ world and can convey it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presenter arabella kiesbauer is a popular face on the private prosieben channel some observers said further examples such as hayali 's could also provide much-needed role models for immigrants . " it 's a sign to potential journalists who perhaps have n't trusted themselves to think that presenting a prime-time news show on a major network could be a job for a person with an italian or an iraqi name , " said gualtiero zambonini , commissioner for integration at cologne-based public network wdr , one of the few broadcasters to have such a post . learning from the netherlands ? at a european level , germany lags behind countries such as britain , where black and asian presenters are established on the bbc , and france , where a black anchorman , harry roselmack , has been hosting the country 's most popular news program . immigrants in those countries come largely from former colonies and share the language of the adopted nation , making it easier for them to break into the media . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harry roselmack is the first black anchorman on france 's most popular tv news show zambonini pointed out that germany could take a page from the netherlands ' book . " for example , minorities in the netherlands are entitled to have a certain share of programming in the media and there are laws governing it , " said zambonini .
" that obviously creates a whole new basis for the question about which journalists the networks hire . " networks doing a rethink german broadcasters , prodded by the government , are also reexamining their policies . dunja hayali said broadcaster zdf made no secret of the fact they were consciously seeking a minority presenter when they hired her . " of course my qualifications were the most important criterion , but there 's no denying my immigrant background was an added plus in bagging the job , " said hayali , who previously moderated a news show at dw-tv . demographic pressures are also forcing public broadcasters , which are partly financed by tv licensing fees , to adapt to a changed viewership . " today every fifth person in germany has an immigrant background , among the young generation in the big cities it 's every second , " said zambonini .
" we just have to take these viewers into account , otherwise we lose our right to exist . " not enough immigrant journalists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children with immigrant backgrounds often perform poorly at schools in germany but the biggest problem for the networks , experts said , is finding minority journalists . " the pool of potential immigrant journalists is tiny , which shows that promoting diversity has just not been a priority for media networks , " said lutz michel , head of the mmb institute for media research in essen . he added that a combination of poor language skills , lack of an academic environment at home and insufficient educational qualifications prevent many from opting for a career in journalism . an oecd study last year found that children from immigrant families in germany have fewer chances to succeed at school than in almost any other industrialized country . a long way to go most media observers agree that only a shared drive by politicians , media companies and journalism schools to fix problems in the education system as well as consciously seek and train budding immigrant journalists is the only way to boost the presence of minority reporters in the long term . minou amir-sehhi said german media needed to do more than appoint a few minority journalists to be a true mirror of society .

germany has already heated up by 0.9 degrees celsius in the past century . germany can expect heavy storms and intense heat waves that cause numerous deaths , said wolfgang kusch , head of germany 's state-run meteorology service dwd , announcing the results of the meteorologists ' observations .
" climate change has become a fact of life , " he told a news conference .
germany 's annual median temperature increased by 0.9 degrees celsius to 8.2 c -lrb- 46 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- since 1901 and could rise another 2 to 5 degrees by 2100 , according to the dwd .
germany experienced the warmest decade of the 20th century from 1990 to 1999 as well as seeing a 9-percent rise in precipitation .
germany should be better prepared for global warming , kusch said , stressing that farmers in particular would be forced to deal with the effects .
the changing climate would also unleash greater risks for people 's health , such as infectious diseases and skin cancer .
heat islands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 2006 deviation of temperature from the 1960-1990 average " we have to do all we can to ensure that the earth does not become uninhabitable , " kusch said .
as a result of the higher temperatures , germany would be subject to more rain and less snow in winter , causing ski resorts in the country 's south to close down , as tourism flourishes on the north and baltic seas .
cities would also see their temperatures rise beyond the 2 degree difference the dwd has already observed between urban areas and the surrounding countryside .
" german cities will increasingly become ' heat islands ' and there will be a growing need for fresh air corridors into cities , " he said .

germany 's annual median temperature increased by 0.9 degrees celsius to 8.2 c -lrb- 46 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- since 1901 and could rise another 2 to 5 degrees by 2100 , according to the dwd .
germany experienced the warmest decade of the 20th century from 1990 to 1999 as well as seeing a 9-percent rise in precipitation .
germany should be better prepared for global warming , kusch said , stressing that farmers in particular would be forced to deal with the effects .
the changing climate would also unleash greater risks for people 's health , such as infectious diseases and skin cancer .
heat islands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 2006 deviation of temperature from the 1960-1990 average " we have to do all we can to ensure that the earth does not become uninhabitable , " kusch said .
as a result of the higher temperatures , germany would be subject to more rain and less snow in winter , causing ski resorts in the country 's south to close down , as tourism flourishes on the north and baltic seas .
cities would also see their temperatures rise beyond the 2 degree difference the dwd has already observed between urban areas and the surrounding countryside .
" german cities will increasingly become ' heat islands ' and there will be a growing need for fresh air corridors into cities , " he said .

was it a coincidence ? stephane udry : no , of course not .
we 're working on a complete research project to discover such planets .
we 're tracking several thousand stars to get hints about planets from them .
our planet circles around a home star .
we 're mainly interested in the traveling speed of such stars , because it helps us to calculate the existence of a planet . what 's the name of the planet ? we do n't name them , because there are too many of them .
we 're using the name of the home star and add a letter that references the date of discovery .
the first planet that 's discovered around a star gets a " b , " the second a " c. "
the new planet is called gliese 581 c , because it 's the second that we 've discovered near the star gliese 581 . what kind of conditions exist on gliese 581 c ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : udry -lrb- right -rrb- with the director of the geneva observatory , michel mayor that 's a difficult questions .

a year only lasts 13 days on the planet , because it circles near its star . does organic life maybe exist there ? i can only say that the size and the temperature of the planet would be good for that .
the planet is in the so-called habitable zone , because it 's highly probable that water exists there .
there are probably several sources of water .
there are probably comets that bring water to the planet , as happened on earth during the early phase of the solar system .
there could be ice .
but the basic requirements for life are chemical components such as carbon and oxygen .
if they exists , conditions are good .
but i can not say much at the moment .
it 's possible that we 'll be able to do so in 20 years .
we need light from the planet 's atmosphere to determine that . can you use research probes to examine the planet further ? no , it 's too far away for that - 20 light years .
if we could travel at one tenth of the speed of light , which would be wonderful , we 'd still need two centuries to get there .
that 's why we have to continue to analyze the information from here . how important is this discovery for science ? it 's certainly an important discovery .

for the first time , european scientists have discovered another habitable planet .
dw-world.de talked with one of the discoverers , stephane udry of the geneva observatory . dw-world.de : how did you discover the planet ?
was it a coincidence ? stephane udry : no , of course not .
we 're working on a complete research project to discover such planets .
we 're tracking several thousand stars to get hints about planets from them .
our planet circles around a home star .
we 're mainly interested in the traveling speed of such stars , because it helps us to calculate the existence of a planet . what 's the name of the planet ? we do n't name them , because there are too many of them .
we 're using the name of the home star and add a letter that references the date of discovery .
the first planet that 's discovered around a star gets a " b , " the second a " c. "
the new planet is called gliese 581 c , because it 's the second that we 've discovered near the star gliese 581 . what kind of conditions exist on gliese 581 c ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : udry -lrb- right -rrb- with the director of the geneva observatory , michel mayor that 's a difficult questions .
it probably has a hard surface structure , because that 's the case with most planets of this size .
the mass of our planet is five times as big as that of the earth .
the average temperature should be between 0 and 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 32 and 104 degrees fahrenheit . -rrb-
a year only lasts 13 days on the planet , because it circles near its star . does organic life maybe exist there ? i can only say that the size and the temperature of the planet would be good for that .
the planet is in the so-called habitable zone , because it 's highly probable that water exists there .
there are probably several sources of water .
there are probably comets that bring water to the planet , as happened on earth during the early phase of the solar system .
there could be ice .
but the basic requirements for life are chemical components such as carbon and oxygen .
if they exists , conditions are good .
but i can not say much at the moment .
it 's possible that we 'll be able to do so in 20 years .
we need light from the planet 's atmosphere to determine that . can you use research probes to examine the planet further ? no , it 's too far away for that - 20 light years .
if we could travel at one tenth of the speed of light , which would be wonderful , we 'd still need two centuries to get there .
that 's why we have to continue to analyze the information from here . how important is this discovery for science ? it 's certainly an important discovery .

starting jan 1 , 2008 , letters weighing up to 50 grams -lrb- 1.8 ounces -rrb- will no longer be the monopoly of deutsche post , the world 's biggest post and logistics group .
according to government sources , chancellor angela merkel and head of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- kurt beck reached an agreement on tuesday evening .
the spd had previously sought to extend the monopoly beyond the deadline , partly because other eu member states will have to open up their mail service markets in 2009 .
a controversial issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : private delivery services are in favor of market liberalization the dismantling of deutsche post 's monopoly on letter delivery remains , however , a thorn in the eyes of the coalition partners .
a spokesperson for the ministry of finance said late on tuesday evening that the social democrats remained convinced that the deregulation of the post service in germany ought to take place only in concert with other european countries to make sure deutsche post does n't suffer unfair competition .
with the countdown underway to the end of its letter monopoly , deutsche post has been moving to diversify away from its dependence on its german operations and is hoping that its international businesses will help to offset the pressure on earnings in its domestic market .
deutsche post chief klaus zumwinkel , however , warned last week that the opening up of the letter delivery service could endanger up to 32,000 jobs . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's deutsche post wants europe to open markets deutsche post 's monopoly on letter delivery will end next year .
even as the company struggles to remain profitable , most other european union countries are reluctant to liberalize their mail markets .
-lrb- 20.03.2007 -rrb- eu seeks open postal markets by 2009 the european commission laid out plans to complete the opening of the european union 's postal-services market to competition by 2009 despite fierce opposition from some countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de champions league -pipe- 25.04.2007 chelsea wins narrowly in champions league semifinal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liverpool 's ready to take chelsea at home joe cole scored the only goal of the game as chelsea emerged from the first leg of their champions league semi-final with a 1-0 advantage over liverpool to take to anfield . after generating enough chances to put the tie beyond doubt , particularly in a first-half they comfortably dominated , jose mourinho 's side were put under sufficient pressure after the break for liverpool to head home believing they can turn things around in front of their own supporters . cole 's 29th-minute winner , a close-range effort created by didier drogba 's power-packed run and astute pass , was a fine goal .
drogba 's well-established capacity for ruffling the composure of the liverpool defense was underlined as early as the eighth minute , the ivory coast striker 's knockdown from ashley cole 's cross teeing up frank lampard on the penalty spot .
the england midfielder managed to get his foot over the bouncing ball but his shot was too straight and jose reina was able to make a good block . a minute later , andriy shevchenko curled a shot narrowly over the angle of post and bar and liverpool were reprieved again when drogba failed to pick out an unmarked joe cole in the middle after john arne riise 's slack back pass had sent him sprinting clear through the inside right channel .
liverpool unbowed twenty minutes had elapsed before liverpool managed to muster a shot on the chelsea goal , bolo zenden 's wayward effort only adding to the frustration of the increasingly agitated rafael benitez on the touchline . dirk kuyt finally gave petr cech something to do shortly afterwards , although a kindly deflection off ricardo carvalho ensured his header flew straight to the midriff of the czech goalkeeper . chelsea were soon threatening again and , after drogba had failed to connect with joe cole 's inviting cross , lampard sent a 25-yard free-kick fizzing inches outside the base of reina 's right-hand post . the pressure finally told in the 29th minute as chelsea took the lead with a move launched by carvalho on the edge of his own area . the portuguese carried the ball out to the edge of the center circle before spreading the ball wide to drogba , who muscled past daniel agger and advanced into the area before pulling the ball back behind jamie carragher .
cutting in from the opposite flank at pace , joe cole was able to get in front of alvaro arbeloa and finish the move with the most straightforward of finishes from eight yards out . but two fine saves from reina kept out efforts from drogba and lampard and ensured chelsea 's win was restricted to the narrowest of margins .
rooney trumps kaka fans at old trafford were cheering early on tuesday , as the hosts scored after a corner kick in the fifth minute .
striker cristiano ronaldo fired a short-range header at milan keeper , who could only deflect the ball into his own net . but any hopes that united would replicate their 7-1 thrashing of rome in the quarterfinals were soon dashed .
kaka caught manchester 's defense napping and left-footed the ball past edwin van der sar from a nearly impossible angle . manchester was playing with a makeshift back four due to injury , and it showed .
shortly before half-time , kaka power his way through three defenders to send the visitors into the locker room with a 2-1 lead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaka twisted manchester 's defense into knots the hosts were clearly shocked and looked tentative when play resumed .
but paul scholes got them back on track in the sixtieth minute with a nifty lob pass in the box to rooney , who slipped the ball under dida . from there on in it was all united .
darren fletcher had two excellent scoring opportunities late in the match , only to be narrowly denied .
and rooney sealed the win for manchester in injury time with a curling blast into the lower left hand corner of the goal . it was a decent outcome for both sides .
manchester only need a draw in san siro next wednesday to progress , while milan can get through with a 1-nil win - a favorite milan result . dw staff / afp -lrb- jc , ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern munich loses chance of champions league semi-finals ac milan booked their place in the champions league semi-finals with a 2-0 win at bayern munich 's allianz arena on wednesday night to knock the german giants out of europe .

drogba 's well-established capacity for ruffling the composure of the liverpool defense was underlined as early as the eighth minute , the ivory coast striker 's knockdown from ashley cole 's cross teeing up frank lampard on the penalty spot .
the england midfielder managed to get his foot over the bouncing ball but his shot was too straight and jose reina was able to make a good block . a minute later , andriy shevchenko curled a shot narrowly over the angle of post and bar and liverpool were reprieved again when drogba failed to pick out an unmarked joe cole in the middle after john arne riise 's slack back pass had sent him sprinting clear through the inside right channel .
liverpool unbowed twenty minutes had elapsed before liverpool managed to muster a shot on the chelsea goal , bolo zenden 's wayward effort only adding to the frustration of the increasingly agitated rafael benitez on the touchline . dirk kuyt finally gave petr cech something to do shortly afterwards , although a kindly deflection off ricardo carvalho ensured his header flew straight to the midriff of the czech goalkeeper . chelsea were soon threatening again and , after drogba had failed to connect with joe cole 's inviting cross , lampard sent a 25-yard free-kick fizzing inches outside the base of reina 's right-hand post . the pressure finally told in the 29th minute as chelsea took the lead with a move launched by carvalho on the edge of his own area . the portuguese carried the ball out to the edge of the center circle before spreading the ball wide to drogba , who muscled past daniel agger and advanced into the area before pulling the ball back behind jamie carragher .
cutting in from the opposite flank at pace , joe cole was able to get in front of alvaro arbeloa and finish the move with the most straightforward of finishes from eight yards out . but two fine saves from reina kept out efforts from drogba and lampard and ensured chelsea 's win was restricted to the narrowest of margins .
rooney trumps kaka fans at old trafford were cheering early on tuesday , as the hosts scored after a corner kick in the fifth minute .
striker cristiano ronaldo fired a short-range header at milan keeper , who could only deflect the ball into his own net . but any hopes that united would replicate their 7-1 thrashing of rome in the quarterfinals were soon dashed .
kaka caught manchester 's defense napping and left-footed the ball past edwin van der sar from a nearly impossible angle . manchester was playing with a makeshift back four due to injury , and it showed .
shortly before half-time , kaka power his way through three defenders to send the visitors into the locker room with a 2-1 lead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaka twisted manchester 's defense into knots the hosts were clearly shocked and looked tentative when play resumed .
but paul scholes got them back on track in the sixtieth minute with a nifty lob pass in the box to rooney , who slipped the ball under dida . from there on in it was all united .
darren fletcher had two excellent scoring opportunities late in the match , only to be narrowly denied .
and rooney sealed the win for manchester in injury time with a curling blast into the lower left hand corner of the goal . it was a decent outcome for both sides .

cutting in from the opposite flank at pace , joe cole was able to get in front of alvaro arbeloa and finish the move with the most straightforward of finishes from eight yards out . but two fine saves from reina kept out efforts from drogba and lampard and ensured chelsea 's win was restricted to the narrowest of margins .
rooney trumps kaka fans at old trafford were cheering early on tuesday , as the hosts scored after a corner kick in the fifth minute .
striker cristiano ronaldo fired a short-range header at milan keeper , who could only deflect the ball into his own net . but any hopes that united would replicate their 7-1 thrashing of rome in the quarterfinals were soon dashed .
kaka caught manchester 's defense napping and left-footed the ball past edwin van der sar from a nearly impossible angle . manchester was playing with a makeshift back four due to injury , and it showed .
shortly before half-time , kaka power his way through three defenders to send the visitors into the locker room with a 2-1 lead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaka twisted manchester 's defense into knots the hosts were clearly shocked and looked tentative when play resumed .
but paul scholes got them back on track in the sixtieth minute with a nifty lob pass in the box to rooney , who slipped the ball under dida . from there on in it was all united .
darren fletcher had two excellent scoring opportunities late in the match , only to be narrowly denied .
and rooney sealed the win for manchester in injury time with a curling blast into the lower left hand corner of the goal . it was a decent outcome for both sides .

" in terms of assurances that the system would not be changed years from now in a way that might be more threatening to the russian deterrent , it seems to me that it is a matter that can be negotiated , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 25.04.2007 " an important signal to immigrants " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gualtiero zambonini said tv networks need to do more to hire immigrant journalists dw-world.de spoke with the commissioner for integration at german broadcaster wdr about the need for tv networks to recruit more journalists and presenters from immigrant minorities . gualtiero zambonini has been the commissioner for integration at the cologne-based german public broadcaster , wdr , since 2003 . dw-world.de : the zdf public network will have a new german-iraqi presenter for their main news show starting end of april .
some media experts have called the appointment of a minority anchorwoman " revolutionary . "
do you see it that way too ? gualtiero zambonini : i would n't call it revolutionary , but it 's definitely an important signal in the right direction .
at wdr , we 've had asli sevindim , a turkish-german journalist , as the main anchorwoman of our evening prime-time news show for over a year now .
another of our turkish-german editors , birand bingül , belongs to the team of commentators on the prime-time news show on the ard network . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-iraqi journalist dunja hayali is the new face of german tv network zdf so , in a way zdf is following us .
but that 's also important because it 's a sign that the public broadcasters in germany have realized the necessity of reflecting this development in society both in their programs as well as in the profiles of their presenters . there are still very few minority presenters on the german networks .
why is that the case ? at wdr , we 've been developing measures for the past four years at least to try and get immigrant journalists on mainstream programs .
but in reality , we are only at the beginning of the road .
nobody should be under the illusion that just because we have a presenter of iraqi origin on zdf or an anchorwoman with a turkish background on wdr , we 've taken care of the problem .
these examples are important for two reasons .
firstly , because they show how seriously we want to promote the issue .
and secondly , because these role models are a sign to potential journalists who perhaps have n't trusted themselves up to now or did n't think that presenting a prime-time news show on major networks could be something for a person with an iraqi or an italian name .
it provides encouragement for more immigrants to pursue journalism careers . in the past , these signs were missing as was a hiring policy among media companies that consciously looked for minority journalists and signaled " we want more of them . "
that 's part of the problem why there are such few minority journalists in newsrooms and in front of cameras and microphones .
we simply realized the problem too late in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's immigrants do n't usually have the chance to study journalism the other part of the problem is that it 's only now in the second and third generation of immigrants that talent and potential is coming to the fore in the german media market .
these are children from immigrant families who grew up here and went to school and university .
this is a development that took place much earlier in countries such as britain or the netherlands partly because some of these nations have a history of immigration different from germany 's . how does germany compare with other countries in europe when it comes to integrating its immigrants into television ? we can definitely learn from good examples in europe , for instance from countries such as sweden or the netherlands where there are integration policies at the broadcasters and corresponding laws .
in the netherlands for example , minorities are entitled to have a certain share of programming in the media and there are laws governing it .
that obviously creates a whole new basis for the question about which journalists the networks hire . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british tv comes closer to reflecting social reality at the same time , that does n't mean there are no problems in these countries .
in the netherlands , there are still too many programs that are white - that means there are too many white dutch faces and not enough immigrants .
in britain , the situation is slightly different .
for instance , bbc international is a wonderful example of journalistic diversity , but that 's not the case in all bbc programs .
my colleagues at bbc say , ' it 's good that we 've achieved some goals , but we 're still far removed from truly representing society in the media . ' we can learn from the french too , who are redoubling efforts to tackle the problem of a lack of minority journalists .
but we 're generally lagging behind in europe .
the important thing is that we 've all recognized the problem . what else needs to be done at the networks for there to be a real change ? a rethink is already taking place among the top managers at the broadcasters as a result of pressure from politicians , societal developments as well as pressure from european policies which have placed integration of minorities high on the agenda .
one has to say that is not just a question of values and good sense but also a question of the market .
we have to take demographic developments into account .
today every fifth person in germany has an immigrant background .
among the younger generations in big cities , it 's every second person .
that means that viewers too have changed and this viewer ship lives in a culture of diversity .
if we do n't take these viewers into account , then we lose the right to exist .
it really is a question of our existence . but to really make progress on the issue , there has to be a change in the media company culture as well as in the way funds are managed .
in addition , the issue has to be anchored in the guiding principles of the broadcasters and supported with further training programs for employees as well as managers .
if nothing changes in the minds of the decision-makers , then we ca n't solve the problem . i believe that the public broadcasters bear a special responsibility towards promoting integration of immigrants .
we 're all financed by licensing fees , the public networks need to all take a stand on the issue . when do you think we 'll see a black presenter or a turkish-german anchor on " tagesschau " ?
-lrb- germany 's most popular news program -rrb- that wo n't take too long .
i hope that this healthy competition among the networks on the issue will soon generate a new face for the program . sonia phalnikar interviewed gualtiero zambonini send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new face on german tv highlights dearth of minority presenters the choice of a minority presenter for the main news show on a major network is almost revolutionary in germany .

another of our turkish-german editors , birand bingül , belongs to the team of commentators on the prime-time news show on the ard network . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-iraqi journalist dunja hayali is the new face of german tv network zdf so , in a way zdf is following us .
but that 's also important because it 's a sign that the public broadcasters in germany have realized the necessity of reflecting this development in society both in their programs as well as in the profiles of their presenters . there are still very few minority presenters on the german networks .
why is that the case ? at wdr , we 've been developing measures for the past four years at least to try and get immigrant journalists on mainstream programs .
but in reality , we are only at the beginning of the road .
nobody should be under the illusion that just because we have a presenter of iraqi origin on zdf or an anchorwoman with a turkish background on wdr , we 've taken care of the problem .
these examples are important for two reasons .
firstly , because they show how seriously we want to promote the issue .
and secondly , because these role models are a sign to potential journalists who perhaps have n't trusted themselves up to now or did n't think that presenting a prime-time news show on major networks could be something for a person with an iraqi or an italian name .
it provides encouragement for more immigrants to pursue journalism careers . in the past , these signs were missing as was a hiring policy among media companies that consciously looked for minority journalists and signaled " we want more of them . "
that 's part of the problem why there are such few minority journalists in newsrooms and in front of cameras and microphones .
we simply realized the problem too late in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's immigrants do n't usually have the chance to study journalism the other part of the problem is that it 's only now in the second and third generation of immigrants that talent and potential is coming to the fore in the german media market .
these are children from immigrant families who grew up here and went to school and university .
this is a development that took place much earlier in countries such as britain or the netherlands partly because some of these nations have a history of immigration different from germany 's . how does germany compare with other countries in europe when it comes to integrating its immigrants into television ? we can definitely learn from good examples in europe , for instance from countries such as sweden or the netherlands where there are integration policies at the broadcasters and corresponding laws .
in the netherlands for example , minorities are entitled to have a certain share of programming in the media and there are laws governing it .
that obviously creates a whole new basis for the question about which journalists the networks hire . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british tv comes closer to reflecting social reality at the same time , that does n't mean there are no problems in these countries .
in the netherlands , there are still too many programs that are white - that means there are too many white dutch faces and not enough immigrants .
in britain , the situation is slightly different .
for instance , bbc international is a wonderful example of journalistic diversity , but that 's not the case in all bbc programs .
my colleagues at bbc say , ' it 's good that we 've achieved some goals , but we 're still far removed from truly representing society in the media . ' we can learn from the french too , who are redoubling efforts to tackle the problem of a lack of minority journalists .
but we 're generally lagging behind in europe .
the important thing is that we 've all recognized the problem . what else needs to be done at the networks for there to be a real change ? a rethink is already taking place among the top managers at the broadcasters as a result of pressure from politicians , societal developments as well as pressure from european policies which have placed integration of minorities high on the agenda .
one has to say that is not just a question of values and good sense but also a question of the market .
we have to take demographic developments into account .
today every fifth person in germany has an immigrant background .
among the younger generations in big cities , it 's every second person .
that means that viewers too have changed and this viewer ship lives in a culture of diversity .
if we do n't take these viewers into account , then we lose the right to exist .
it really is a question of our existence . but to really make progress on the issue , there has to be a change in the media company culture as well as in the way funds are managed .
in addition , the issue has to be anchored in the guiding principles of the broadcasters and supported with further training programs for employees as well as managers .
if nothing changes in the minds of the decision-makers , then we ca n't solve the problem . i believe that the public broadcasters bear a special responsibility towards promoting integration of immigrants .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 25.04.2007 " an important signal to immigrants " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gualtiero zambonini said tv networks need to do more to hire immigrant journalists dw-world.de spoke with the commissioner for integration at german broadcaster wdr about the need for tv networks to recruit more journalists and presenters from immigrant minorities . gualtiero zambonini has been the commissioner for integration at the cologne-based german public broadcaster , wdr , since 2003 . dw-world.de : the zdf public network will have a new german-iraqi presenter for their main news show starting end of april .
some media experts have called the appointment of a minority anchorwoman " revolutionary . "
do you see it that way too ? gualtiero zambonini : i would n't call it revolutionary , but it 's definitely an important signal in the right direction .
at wdr , we 've had asli sevindim , a turkish-german journalist , as the main anchorwoman of our evening prime-time news show for over a year now .
another of our turkish-german editors , birand bingül , belongs to the team of commentators on the prime-time news show on the ard network . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-iraqi journalist dunja hayali is the new face of german tv network zdf so , in a way zdf is following us .
but that 's also important because it 's a sign that the public broadcasters in germany have realized the necessity of reflecting this development in society both in their programs as well as in the profiles of their presenters . there are still very few minority presenters on the german networks .
why is that the case ? at wdr , we 've been developing measures for the past four years at least to try and get immigrant journalists on mainstream programs .
but in reality , we are only at the beginning of the road .
nobody should be under the illusion that just because we have a presenter of iraqi origin on zdf or an anchorwoman with a turkish background on wdr , we 've taken care of the problem .
these examples are important for two reasons .
firstly , because they show how seriously we want to promote the issue .
and secondly , because these role models are a sign to potential journalists who perhaps have n't trusted themselves up to now or did n't think that presenting a prime-time news show on major networks could be something for a person with an iraqi or an italian name .
it provides encouragement for more immigrants to pursue journalism careers . in the past , these signs were missing as was a hiring policy among media companies that consciously looked for minority journalists and signaled " we want more of them . "
that 's part of the problem why there are such few minority journalists in newsrooms and in front of cameras and microphones .
we simply realized the problem too late in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's immigrants do n't usually have the chance to study journalism the other part of the problem is that it 's only now in the second and third generation of immigrants that talent and potential is coming to the fore in the german media market .
these are children from immigrant families who grew up here and went to school and university .
this is a development that took place much earlier in countries such as britain or the netherlands partly because some of these nations have a history of immigration different from germany 's . how does germany compare with other countries in europe when it comes to integrating its immigrants into television ? we can definitely learn from good examples in europe , for instance from countries such as sweden or the netherlands where there are integration policies at the broadcasters and corresponding laws .
in the netherlands for example , minorities are entitled to have a certain share of programming in the media and there are laws governing it .
that obviously creates a whole new basis for the question about which journalists the networks hire . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british tv comes closer to reflecting social reality at the same time , that does n't mean there are no problems in these countries .
in the netherlands , there are still too many programs that are white - that means there are too many white dutch faces and not enough immigrants .
in britain , the situation is slightly different .
for instance , bbc international is a wonderful example of journalistic diversity , but that 's not the case in all bbc programs .
my colleagues at bbc say , ' it 's good that we 've achieved some goals , but we 're still far removed from truly representing society in the media . ' we can learn from the french too , who are redoubling efforts to tackle the problem of a lack of minority journalists .
but we 're generally lagging behind in europe .
the important thing is that we 've all recognized the problem . what else needs to be done at the networks for there to be a real change ? a rethink is already taking place among the top managers at the broadcasters as a result of pressure from politicians , societal developments as well as pressure from european policies which have placed integration of minorities high on the agenda .
one has to say that is not just a question of values and good sense but also a question of the market .
we have to take demographic developments into account .
today every fifth person in germany has an immigrant background .
among the younger generations in big cities , it 's every second person .
that means that viewers too have changed and this viewer ship lives in a culture of diversity .
if we do n't take these viewers into account , then we lose the right to exist .
it really is a question of our existence . but to really make progress on the issue , there has to be a change in the media company culture as well as in the way funds are managed .
in addition , the issue has to be anchored in the guiding principles of the broadcasters and supported with further training programs for employees as well as managers .
if nothing changes in the minds of the decision-makers , then we ca n't solve the problem . i believe that the public broadcasters bear a special responsibility towards promoting integration of immigrants .
we 're all financed by licensing fees , the public networks need to all take a stand on the issue . when do you think we 'll see a black presenter or a turkish-german anchor on " tagesschau " ?
-lrb- germany 's most popular news program -rrb- that wo n't take too long .
i hope that this healthy competition among the networks on the issue will soon generate a new face for the program . sonia phalnikar interviewed gualtiero zambonini send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new face on german tv highlights dearth of minority presenters the choice of a minority presenter for the main news show on a major network is almost revolutionary in germany .

german chancellor angela merkel aimed to make climate change a central theme at the summit , being held under the german g8 presidency , pfaffenbach reiterated in berlin on tuesday .

german chancellor angela merkel aimed to make climate change a central theme at the summit , being held under the german g8 presidency , pfaffenbach reiterated in berlin on tuesday .
in his remarks , pfaffenbach was careful not to mention the united states by name , however , it the recipient of his comments on climate change was clear . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : planes contribute to co2 emissions blamed for global warming he indicated the germany 's disappointment that the us was not yet prepared to submit to an internationally agreed climate protection regime along the lines of the 1997 kyoto protocol , which runs out in 2012 . pfaffenbach expressed optimism that criticism and protests by non-governmental organizations , which have voiced strident protest at past g8 summits , would be muted this time . anti-globalization organizations are predicting that up to 100,000 demonstrators will march in the eastern german city of rostock , while police estimate the number at half that .

g8 members aimed to offer african countries a " broad political partnership " with the aim of promoting democracy and reducing corruption , pfaffenbach said .
he stressed that money was not the solution to everything , although the industrialized countries stood by their longstanding commitments , including allocating 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product to development aid by 2012 .
african countries needed to improve their governmental structures and attract more private capital , he said .

german chancellor angela merkel aimed to make climate change a central theme at the summit , being held under the german g8 presidency , pfaffenbach reiterated in berlin on tuesday .
in his remarks , pfaffenbach was careful not to mention the united states by name , however , it the recipient of his comments on climate change was clear . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : planes contribute to co2 emissions blamed for global warming he indicated the germany 's disappointment that the us was not yet prepared to submit to an internationally agreed climate protection regime along the lines of the 1997 kyoto protocol , which runs out in 2012 . pfaffenbach expressed optimism that criticism and protests by non-governmental organizations , which have voiced strident protest at past g8 summits , would be muted this time . anti-globalization organizations are predicting that up to 100,000 demonstrators will march in the eastern german city of rostock , while police estimate the number at half that .
larger organizations , like attac and greenpeace , have committed themselves to peaceful marches , while smaller , more radical , groups have refused to rule out violent protests like that in genoa in 2001 .
africa also high on the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel pledged to push g8 members to meet their development aid commitments merkel intended to meet ngo representatives in mid-may , and the ngos had welcomed the fact that the chancellor also intended to place africa high on the agenda , he said .
g8 members aimed to offer african countries a " broad political partnership " with the aim of promoting democracy and reducing corruption , pfaffenbach said .
he stressed that money was not the solution to everything , although the industrialized countries stood by their longstanding commitments , including allocating 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product to development aid by 2012 .
african countries needed to improve their governmental structures and attract more private capital , he said .

but experts say it spotlights the long way the country needs to go to visibly integrate its immigrants . at the end of april , dunja hayali , a german journalist of iraqi origin , will break the mold when she begins co-anchoring the main news show on zdf , one of germany 's biggest public television networks . in a country where a fifth of the population has an immigrant background , experts said minority presenters of all backgrounds remain conspicuously absent on mainstream television information and news programs . " it does n't matter whether you have turkish roots and look obviously different or have blond hair and blue eyes and blend in with germans , " said minou amir-sehhi , a freelance german-iranian tv journalist for the publicly funded ard network who coordinates the " intercultural network " at the german association of journalists -lrb- djv -rrb- . " there 's been a general wariness about contact with other accents and cultures in the country , and that 's reflected on television .

" it 's a sign of normality when you have a person with an immigrant background casually reading the news or the sports results on a major network instead of being shown as a problem or an exotic stereotype , " she said . experts added that in recent years a vocal debate about integration of immigrants has raised awareness about the role media , especially television with its high-profile visibility and reach , can play . the german government has also weighed in , urging the networks to recruit more journalists and tv presenters from immigrant minorities . " we have to make immigrants more visible in german television , " state secretary for integration maria böhmer told the daily süddeutsche zeitung .
" i keep hearing from immigrants that they do n't see themselves represented by the public sector broadcasters .
there is n't enough awareness of their experience of life , and there are n't enough immigrants in front of or behind the camera . " for example , having a turkish anchorwoman needs to become a normal thing , " she added .

" it does n't matter whether you have turkish roots and look obviously different or have blond hair and blue eyes and blend in with germans , " said minou amir-sehhi , a freelance german-iranian tv journalist for the publicly funded ard network who coordinates the " intercultural network " at the german association of journalists -lrb- djv -rrb- . " there 's been a general wariness about contact with other accents and cultures in the country , and that 's reflected on television . " in the entire media industry , about 3 percent of journalists are estimated to have an immigrant background . striving for normality a sprinkling of immigrant presenters is currently to be found on some private channels and stations such as mtv .
on the influential public broadcasters , a few tend to be on niche programs devoted to issues of multiculturalism and integration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cherno jobatey is one of the few minority presenters on german television in that context , hayali 's appointment is " quite revolutionary , " said amir-sehhi . " it 's a sign of normality when you have a person with an immigrant background casually reading the news or the sports results on a major network instead of being shown as a problem or an exotic stereotype , " she said . experts added that in recent years a vocal debate about integration of immigrants has raised awareness about the role media , especially television with its high-profile visibility and reach , can play . the german government has also weighed in , urging the networks to recruit more journalists and tv presenters from immigrant minorities . " we have to make immigrants more visible in german television , " state secretary for integration maria böhmer told the daily süddeutsche zeitung .
" i keep hearing from immigrants that they do n't see themselves represented by the public sector broadcasters .
there is n't enough awareness of their experience of life , and there are n't enough immigrants in front of or behind the camera . " for example , having a turkish anchorwoman needs to become a normal thing , " she added .
" we need more reporters who themselves know the immigrants ’ world and can convey it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presenter arabella kiesbauer is a popular face on the private prosieben channel some observers said further examples such as hayali 's could also provide much-needed role models for immigrants . " it 's a sign to potential journalists who perhaps have n't trusted themselves to think that presenting a prime-time news show on a major network could be a job for a person with an italian or an iraqi name , " said gualtiero zambonini , commissioner for integration at cologne-based public network wdr , one of the few broadcasters to have such a post . learning from the netherlands ? at a european level , germany lags behind countries such as britain , where black and asian presenters are established on the bbc , and france , where a black anchorman , harry roselmack , has been hosting the country 's most popular news program . immigrants in those countries come largely from former colonies and share the language of the adopted nation , making it easier for them to break into the media . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harry roselmack is the first black anchorman on france 's most popular tv news show zambonini pointed out that germany could take a page from the netherlands ' book . " for example , minorities in the netherlands are entitled to have a certain share of programming in the media and there are laws governing it , " said zambonini .
" that obviously creates a whole new basis for the question about which journalists the networks hire . " networks doing a rethink german broadcasters , prodded by the government , are also reexamining their policies . dunja hayali said broadcaster zdf made no secret of the fact they were consciously seeking a minority presenter when they hired her . " of course my qualifications were the most important criterion , but there 's no denying my immigrant background was an added plus in bagging the job , " said hayali , who previously moderated a news show at dw-tv . demographic pressures are also forcing public broadcasters , which are partly financed by tv licensing fees , to adapt to a changed viewership . " today every fifth person in germany has an immigrant background , among the young generation in the big cities it 's every second , " said zambonini .
" we just have to take these viewers into account , otherwise we lose our right to exist . " not enough immigrant journalists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children with immigrant backgrounds often perform poorly at schools in germany but the biggest problem for the networks , experts said , is finding minority journalists . " the pool of potential immigrant journalists is tiny , which shows that promoting diversity has just not been a priority for media networks , " said lutz michel , head of the mmb institute for media research in essen . he added that a combination of poor language skills , lack of an academic environment at home and insufficient educational qualifications prevent many from opting for a career in journalism . an oecd study last year found that children from immigrant families in germany have fewer chances to succeed at school than in almost any other industrialized country . a long way to go most media observers agree that only a shared drive by politicians , media companies and journalism schools to fix problems in the education system as well as consciously seek and train budding immigrant journalists is the only way to boost the presence of minority reporters in the long term . minou amir-sehhi said german media needed to do more than appoint a few minority journalists to be a true mirror of society . " only when we have a dark-haired , dark-eyed presenter reporting from the german parliament then we can say we 've truly accepted reality and our status as an immigration country , " she said . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " an important signal to immigrants " dw-world.de spoke with the commissioner for integration at german broadcaster wdr about the need for tv networks to recruit more journalists and presenters from immigrant minorities .

iran denies us and eu charges that it is trying to build nuclear weapons .
larijani told reporters that the talks with solana aimed to evaluate " new ideas " that might be put on the table , the anatolia news agency said .
but solana 's spokesperson cristina gallach said there were " no changes in the position of the international community " and added that the priority was simply to " create conditions for the beginning of negotiations . "
diplomats said there was little hope of a breakthrough given iran 's steadfast refusal to freeze its enrichment work .
an ongoing crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is unlikely that larijani and solana will reach a breakthrough solana will travel on thursday to oslo , where he will brief eu foreign ministers on his meeting with larijani .
iran is defying two un security council resolutions to halt enrichment , saying its program is a legitimate effort to generate civilian nuclear power .
the council has imposed limited sanctions as punishment .
diplomats told afp that while everyone was trying to find a formula to start talks , the two sides remain far apart on a crisis that began in 2002 when it was revealed that iran was secretly building nuclear facilities .
the united states , europe , russia and china are ready in a compromise gesture to give iran a chance to edge its way slowly into stopping uranium enrichment , diplomats said .
the six world powers - britain , china , france , germany , russia and the united states - had last june offered economic , technical and security benefits if iran would agree to the suspension .
but iran pressed ahead and negotiations never started .
several rounds of talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has imposed sanctions on iran because of its nuclear activities larijani and solana held several rounds of talks that failed to find a way to start meetings with the six powers .
the two envoys last met face-to-face on the sidelines of a munich security conference on feb 11 .
larijani said on wednesday that progress had been blocked when " some unacceptable , irrational conditions were put forward " - a clear reference to the demands that iran suspend enrichment .
" if a solution can be found , it will cost the price of suspension , " a european diplomat said .
a second diplomat said one idea would be for iran to declare a moratorium on moving beyond activities it has already started , such as installing and running some 1,300 centrifuge machines as it seeks to upgrade from current research levels of enrichment to industrial production .
the moratorium could open the way for further talks with solana , with the un security council holding off on further sanctions against the islamic republic .
iran 's proposals involve it keeping at least a reduced level of enrichment work , diplomats said .
suspension or dismantling ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad vowed to push forward with efforts to enrich uranium non-proliferation expert gary samore told afp by telephone from washington that tehran wants the eu to agree to setting up an international consortium in iran for uranium enrichment .
but the major powers want such a consortium , which would process fuel for iran , to be set up outside the islamic republic .
a western diplomat said talks with the five permanent security council members plus germany would not in any case start before iran suspends enrichment .
" suspension does not mean dismantling what they have built , " the diplomat said , adding that the major powers were primarily interested in stopping the centrifuges from spinning in the refining of the u-235 isotope that makes for enriched uranium as well as keeping the iranians from learning how to run centrifuges .
iran faces a new security council deadline in one month , after which more sanctions could be imposed .
the united states has not ruled out a military attack to bring iran to heel . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran 's release of sailors gives hope in nuclear negotiations iran 's release of the captured british sailors hints at a more pragmatic , less radical approach towards the west , say analysts .

but solana 's spokesperson cristina gallach said there were " no changes in the position of the international community " and added that the priority was simply to " create conditions for the beginning of negotiations . "
diplomats said there was little hope of a breakthrough given iran 's steadfast refusal to freeze its enrichment work .

iran is defying two un security council resolutions to halt enrichment , saying its program is a legitimate effort to generate civilian nuclear power .
the council has imposed limited sanctions as punishment .
diplomats told afp that while everyone was trying to find a formula to start talks , the two sides remain far apart on a crisis that began in 2002 when it was revealed that iran was secretly building nuclear facilities .
the united states , europe , russia and china are ready in a compromise gesture to give iran a chance to edge its way slowly into stopping uranium enrichment , diplomats said .
the six world powers - britain , china , france , germany , russia and the united states - had last june offered economic , technical and security benefits if iran would agree to the suspension .

larijani said on wednesday that progress had been blocked when " some unacceptable , irrational conditions were put forward " - a clear reference to the demands that iran suspend enrichment .
" if a solution can be found , it will cost the price of suspension , " a european diplomat said .
a second diplomat said one idea would be for iran to declare a moratorium on moving beyond activities it has already started , such as installing and running some 1,300 centrifuge machines as it seeks to upgrade from current research levels of enrichment to industrial production .
the moratorium could open the way for further talks with solana , with the un security council holding off on further sanctions against the islamic republic .
iran 's proposals involve it keeping at least a reduced level of enrichment work , diplomats said .

but the major powers want such a consortium , which would process fuel for iran , to be set up outside the islamic republic .
a western diplomat said talks with the five permanent security council members plus germany would not in any case start before iran suspends enrichment .
" suspension does not mean dismantling what they have built , " the diplomat said , adding that the major powers were primarily interested in stopping the centrifuges from spinning in the refining of the u-235 isotope that makes for enriched uranium as well as keeping the iranians from learning how to run centrifuges .

iran denies us and eu charges that it is trying to build nuclear weapons .
larijani told reporters that the talks with solana aimed to evaluate " new ideas " that might be put on the table , the anatolia news agency said .
but solana 's spokesperson cristina gallach said there were " no changes in the position of the international community " and added that the priority was simply to " create conditions for the beginning of negotiations . "
diplomats said there was little hope of a breakthrough given iran 's steadfast refusal to freeze its enrichment work .
an ongoing crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is unlikely that larijani and solana will reach a breakthrough solana will travel on thursday to oslo , where he will brief eu foreign ministers on his meeting with larijani .
iran is defying two un security council resolutions to halt enrichment , saying its program is a legitimate effort to generate civilian nuclear power .
the council has imposed limited sanctions as punishment .
diplomats told afp that while everyone was trying to find a formula to start talks , the two sides remain far apart on a crisis that began in 2002 when it was revealed that iran was secretly building nuclear facilities .
the united states , europe , russia and china are ready in a compromise gesture to give iran a chance to edge its way slowly into stopping uranium enrichment , diplomats said .
the six world powers - britain , china , france , germany , russia and the united states - had last june offered economic , technical and security benefits if iran would agree to the suspension .
but iran pressed ahead and negotiations never started .
several rounds of talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has imposed sanctions on iran because of its nuclear activities larijani and solana held several rounds of talks that failed to find a way to start meetings with the six powers .
the two envoys last met face-to-face on the sidelines of a munich security conference on feb 11 .
larijani said on wednesday that progress had been blocked when " some unacceptable , irrational conditions were put forward " - a clear reference to the demands that iran suspend enrichment .
" if a solution can be found , it will cost the price of suspension , " a european diplomat said .
a second diplomat said one idea would be for iran to declare a moratorium on moving beyond activities it has already started , such as installing and running some 1,300 centrifuge machines as it seeks to upgrade from current research levels of enrichment to industrial production .
the moratorium could open the way for further talks with solana , with the un security council holding off on further sanctions against the islamic republic .
iran 's proposals involve it keeping at least a reduced level of enrichment work , diplomats said .
suspension or dismantling ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad vowed to push forward with efforts to enrich uranium non-proliferation expert gary samore told afp by telephone from washington that tehran wants the eu to agree to setting up an international consortium in iran for uranium enrichment .
but the major powers want such a consortium , which would process fuel for iran , to be set up outside the islamic republic .
a western diplomat said talks with the five permanent security council members plus germany would not in any case start before iran suspends enrichment .
" suspension does not mean dismantling what they have built , " the diplomat said , adding that the major powers were primarily interested in stopping the centrifuges from spinning in the refining of the u-235 isotope that makes for enriched uranium as well as keeping the iranians from learning how to run centrifuges .
iran faces a new security council deadline in one month , after which more sanctions could be imposed .

german chancellor angela merkel aimed to make climate change a central theme at the summit , being held under the german g8 presidency , pfaffenbach reiterated in berlin on tuesday .

g8 members aimed to offer african countries a " broad political partnership " with the aim of promoting democracy and reducing corruption , pfaffenbach said .
he stressed that money was not the solution to everything , although the industrialized countries stood by their longstanding commitments , including allocating 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product to development aid by 2012 .
african countries needed to improve their governmental structures and attract more private capital , he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.04.2007 business confidence surges as germany boosts growth outlook großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economic forecasters are promissing sunny and clear skies business confidence in germany continued to climb in april as the booming german economy , the biggest in the 13-country eurozone , was bolstered by international investment , a survey showed wednesday . the widely watched business climate index , calculated each month by the munich-based economic research institute ifo , came as economy minister michael glos raised the german economic growth forecast for 2007 to 2.3 percent - a sharp rise on the previous prediction of 1.7 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economy minister michael glos " the upturn is continuing , growth remains strong and the situation in the labor market keeps getting better , " glos said .
citing germany 's robust export performance , glos said the present level of the euro was " sustainable , " but warned that a strong currency can threaten a country 's exports , making them more expensive and less competitive on world markets .
" if it -lrb- the euro -rrb- were to rise still more strongly , there would be risks , " glos said .
he was speaking as the euro moved closer to an all-time high point against the dollar , soaring to 1.3656 on wednesday , well within striking distance of 1.3666 , its record level reached on dec 30 , 2004 .
surpassing expectations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro moved closer to an all-time high point against the dollar the influential ifo index rose to 108.6 points in april from 107.7 points in march , putting it just one-tenth of a point away from the record score of 108.7 points recorded in december .
analysts polled by news agency thomson financial had predicted a far more modest surge , to 107.8 points .
" germany is profiting from the extraordinary international investment boom , which due to germany 's specialization is having a stronger cyclical impact than in the other major european countries , " ifo president hans-werner sinn said in a statement .
for its monthly survey , ifo polls some 7,000 companies about their assessment of current business and their expectations for the next six months .
a breakdown of the data showed that the current sentiment sub-index rose to 113.2 points in april from 112.4 points in march .
and the expectations sub-index also increased , rising to 104.3 points from 103.2 points , ifo said .
analysts said the data were further proof that the german economy has weathered a steep hike in value-added tax this year .
jumping over hurdles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany increased its vat to 19 procent this year on jan 1 , the german government increased vat by three full percentage points to 19 percent , the biggest-ever single rise in a move experts said would put the brakes on consumer spending and therefore drag on overall growth .
the robust health of the economy is now expected to reduce public debt and buoy the job market .
the unemployment rate in march fell to 9.8 percent .
ifo said in retailing and wholesaling , the business climate had also brightened noticeably in march with companies giving more positive appraisals of both their current situation and their six-month outlook .
sentiment in the construction industry , however , remained unchanged .
positive outlook bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german manufacturers are confident about their exports elga bartsch of morgan stanley said the fact the euro had hit a two-year peak against the dollar had not hurt germany 's export-driven economy .
" notwithstanding the stronger euro , the ifo institute also reported an improvement in the export expectations of german manufacturers , " bartsch said .
" of course , a considerable share of those exports would go to other euro area countries .
but , thus far , the mood amongst german manufacturers seems to be defiant regarding the euro , " she said , adding that the strong single currency and a us slowdown could leave " skid marks " in the future .
laying the groundwork bank of america 's holger schmieding said german companies had helped lay the groundwork for the sharp economic upturn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank may end up raising its interest rates " with export expectations up according to an ifo spokesman , it shows that the severe slashing of costs that german corporations had to do in the years since 2000 is paying off nicely , " he said .
" german exports are competitive .
so far , strong demand from asia , central and eastern europe as well as the oil countries seems to offset the rise in the euro and weaker us demand . "
the sunny outlook in germany would provide additional arguments for the european central bank to continue raising its key interest rates , analysts said .
" along with rises in business confidence in belgium and netherlands , the surveys released so far this month support our view that the ecb will raise rates to 4.00 percent in june and once again in to 4.25 percent by year-end , " said sunil kapadia of ubs investment research . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de soccer world cup hardly touched german economy the patriotism and high spirits unleashed by this past summer 's world cup were expected to boost the german economy , but experts say the soccer event had virtually no impact on growth and employment .
-lrb- 21.04.2007 -rrb- outlook for german economy remains sunny the country 's top economic institutes are raising their forecast for economic growth this year by two thirds , which could mean a higher tax take , stronger domestic demand and lower unemployment .
-lrb- 19.04.2007 -rrb- optimism grows on outlook for german economy the run of good news for the german economy , europe 's biggest , looks set to continue for some time , with bundesbank president axel weber arguing on monday that current growth marks only the beginning of a longer upturn .

citing germany 's robust export performance , glos said the present level of the euro was " sustainable , " but warned that a strong currency can threaten a country 's exports , making them more expensive and less competitive on world markets .
" if it -lrb- the euro -rrb- were to rise still more strongly , there would be risks , " glos said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economy minister michael glos " the upturn is continuing , growth remains strong and the situation in the labor market keeps getting better , " glos said .
citing germany 's robust export performance , glos said the present level of the euro was " sustainable , " but warned that a strong currency can threaten a country 's exports , making them more expensive and less competitive on world markets .
" if it -lrb- the euro -rrb- were to rise still more strongly , there would be risks , " glos said .
he was speaking as the euro moved closer to an all-time high point against the dollar , soaring to 1.3656 on wednesday , well within striking distance of 1.3666 , its record level reached on dec 30 , 2004 .
surpassing expectations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro moved closer to an all-time high point against the dollar the influential ifo index rose to 108.6 points in april from 107.7 points in march , putting it just one-tenth of a point away from the record score of 108.7 points recorded in december .
analysts polled by news agency thomson financial had predicted a far more modest surge , to 107.8 points .
" germany is profiting from the extraordinary international investment boom , which due to germany 's specialization is having a stronger cyclical impact than in the other major european countries , " ifo president hans-werner sinn said in a statement .
for its monthly survey , ifo polls some 7,000 companies about their assessment of current business and their expectations for the next six months .
a breakdown of the data showed that the current sentiment sub-index rose to 113.2 points in april from 112.4 points in march .
and the expectations sub-index also increased , rising to 104.3 points from 103.2 points , ifo said .
analysts said the data were further proof that the german economy has weathered a steep hike in value-added tax this year .
jumping over hurdles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany increased its vat to 19 procent this year on jan 1 , the german government increased vat by three full percentage points to 19 percent , the biggest-ever single rise in a move experts said would put the brakes on consumer spending and therefore drag on overall growth .
the robust health of the economy is now expected to reduce public debt and buoy the job market .
the unemployment rate in march fell to 9.8 percent .
ifo said in retailing and wholesaling , the business climate had also brightened noticeably in march with companies giving more positive appraisals of both their current situation and their six-month outlook .
sentiment in the construction industry , however , remained unchanged .
positive outlook bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german manufacturers are confident about their exports elga bartsch of morgan stanley said the fact the euro had hit a two-year peak against the dollar had not hurt germany 's export-driven economy .
" notwithstanding the stronger euro , the ifo institute also reported an improvement in the export expectations of german manufacturers , " bartsch said .
" of course , a considerable share of those exports would go to other euro area countries .
but , thus far , the mood amongst german manufacturers seems to be defiant regarding the euro , " she said , adding that the strong single currency and a us slowdown could leave " skid marks " in the future .
laying the groundwork bank of america 's holger schmieding said german companies had helped lay the groundwork for the sharp economic upturn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank may end up raising its interest rates " with export expectations up according to an ifo spokesman , it shows that the severe slashing of costs that german corporations had to do in the years since 2000 is paying off nicely , " he said .
" german exports are competitive .
so far , strong demand from asia , central and eastern europe as well as the oil countries seems to offset the rise in the euro and weaker us demand . "
the sunny outlook in germany would provide additional arguments for the european central bank to continue raising its key interest rates , analysts said .
" along with rises in business confidence in belgium and netherlands , the surveys released so far this month support our view that the ecb will raise rates to 4.00 percent in june and once again in to 4.25 percent by year-end , " said sunil kapadia of ubs investment research . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de soccer world cup hardly touched german economy the patriotism and high spirits unleashed by this past summer 's world cup were expected to boost the german economy , but experts say the soccer event had virtually no impact on growth and employment .
-lrb- 21.04.2007 -rrb- outlook for german economy remains sunny the country 's top economic institutes are raising their forecast for economic growth this year by two thirds , which could mean a higher tax take , stronger domestic demand and lower unemployment .
-lrb- 19.04.2007 -rrb- optimism grows on outlook for german economy the run of good news for the german economy , europe 's biggest , looks set to continue for some time , with bundesbank president axel weber arguing on monday that current growth marks only the beginning of a longer upturn .

that is why anti-terror legislations differ from country to country . terrorism is not a new phenomenon in europe .
in the united kingdom , spain and ireland alone , it has claimed 5,000 deaths over the last 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the effects of sept .
11 are felt strongly in europe the sept .
11 attacks on the united states , however , have had a rippling effect across the atlantic as well .
faced with the challenges posed by the war against international terrorism , which were only heightened by the attacks in london and madrid , european countries were forced to adapt and expand their anti-terror legislations .
" legislative and institutional requirements have definitely become stricter in all 27 member states of the european union , " said annegret bendiek of the german institute for international and security affairs and author of a study on fighting terrorism in the eu .
yet striking the right balance between efficient engagement in the war on terror and protection of civil liberties has n't been easy to achieve .
one policy , many implementations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the end of privacy ?
in june 2002 , the eu council passed two resolutions - one establishing a common european arrest warrant and one defining a common concept of terrorist offences which all the member states of the european union had to include in their legal system .
in december 2005 , the eu adopted its eu counter-terrorism strategy , but it left the responsibility for its implementation in the hands of individual member states .
" states like the united kingdom , france and also germany are of course very engaged , " bendiek said .
but european states continue to differ greatly in their institutional and legislative approaches .
tough measures of all the eu member states , the united kingdom has gone the farthest in expanding the legislation meant to counter acts of terrorism .
several months after the 2001 attacks on new york and washington , d.c , britain 's terrorism act of 2000 was replaced by the anti-terrorism , crime and security act which stipulated that foreign terrorist suspects could be detained indefinitely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2005 attacks in london lead to even stricter anti-terror laws after a public outcry and an intervention from the law lords - a judicial body of the upper house of the british parliament which serves as a court of last instance in the uk - this measure was abolished for being incompatible with the european convention of human rights .
its powers were later replaced by the so-called control order in the 2005 prevention of terrorism act .
the control order , however , still allows for comprehensive restriction of an individual 's liberties for the purpose of " protecting members of the public from a risk of terrorism . "
after the london bomb attacks in the summer of 2005 , the british legislation was made even stricter .
according to the terrorism act of 2006 , for example , " glorification of terrorist acts " can lead to a seven-year prison sentence .
it 's legal to eavesdrop ever since july 2005 , italy 's secret service has been allowed to monitor telephone conversations for the sake of preventing terrorist attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police surveillance is a cause of concern for privacy activists france adopted a new law this year that follows the british model allowing for surveillance cameras to be placed in public spaces such as train stations , churches and mosques , shops , factories or nuclear plants .
after a failed terrorist attack , in which crude propane gas bombs were primed to explode on two german trains on july 31 , the german government introduced a new law on fighting terrorism .
germany now has a computer databank which allows police and intelligence agencies easier access to a range of information on terrorism suspects , including membership of terrorist groups , firearms registration information as well as internet and telecommunications data .
not everybody can do it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you never know who 's listening in but smaller and less affluent eu countries are often lagging behind in terms of their legislative apparatus and implementation of counter-terrorist measures .
according to bendiek , malta , portugal or greece , for example , lack the administrative infrastructure , personnel and funds for implementing anti-terrorism laws .
in other countries , it is above all different legal traditions that cancel each other in various legislations .

11 attacks on the united states , however , have had a rippling effect across the atlantic as well .
faced with the challenges posed by the war against international terrorism , which were only heightened by the attacks in london and madrid , european countries were forced to adapt and expand their anti-terror legislations .
" legislative and institutional requirements have definitely become stricter in all 27 member states of the european union , " said annegret bendiek of the german institute for international and security affairs and author of a study on fighting terrorism in the eu .
yet striking the right balance between efficient engagement in the war on terror and protection of civil liberties has n't been easy to achieve .

in june 2002 , the eu council passed two resolutions - one establishing a common european arrest warrant and one defining a common concept of terrorist offences which all the member states of the european union had to include in their legal system .
in december 2005 , the eu adopted its eu counter-terrorism strategy , but it left the responsibility for its implementation in the hands of individual member states .
" states like the united kingdom , france and also germany are of course very engaged , " bendiek said .
but european states continue to differ greatly in their institutional and legislative approaches .
tough measures of all the eu member states , the united kingdom has gone the farthest in expanding the legislation meant to counter acts of terrorism .
several months after the 2001 attacks on new york and washington , d.c , britain 's terrorism act of 2000 was replaced by the anti-terrorism , crime and security act which stipulated that foreign terrorist suspects could be detained indefinitely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2005 attacks in london lead to even stricter anti-terror laws after a public outcry and an intervention from the law lords - a judicial body of the upper house of the british parliament which serves as a court of last instance in the uk - this measure was abolished for being incompatible with the european convention of human rights .
its powers were later replaced by the so-called control order in the 2005 prevention of terrorism act .
the control order , however , still allows for comprehensive restriction of an individual 's liberties for the purpose of " protecting members of the public from a risk of terrorism . "
after the london bomb attacks in the summer of 2005 , the british legislation was made even stricter .
according to the terrorism act of 2006 , for example , " glorification of terrorist acts " can lead to a seven-year prison sentence .
it 's legal to eavesdrop ever since july 2005 , italy 's secret service has been allowed to monitor telephone conversations for the sake of preventing terrorist attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police surveillance is a cause of concern for privacy activists france adopted a new law this year that follows the british model allowing for surveillance cameras to be placed in public spaces such as train stations , churches and mosques , shops , factories or nuclear plants .
after a failed terrorist attack , in which crude propane gas bombs were primed to explode on two german trains on july 31 , the german government introduced a new law on fighting terrorism .
germany now has a computer databank which allows police and intelligence agencies easier access to a range of information on terrorism suspects , including membership of terrorist groups , firearms registration information as well as internet and telecommunications data .

in other countries , it is above all different legal traditions that cancel each other in various legislations .

that is why anti-terror legislations differ from country to country . terrorism is not a new phenomenon in europe .
in the united kingdom , spain and ireland alone , it has claimed 5,000 deaths over the last 30 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the effects of sept .
11 are felt strongly in europe the sept .
11 attacks on the united states , however , have had a rippling effect across the atlantic as well .
faced with the challenges posed by the war against international terrorism , which were only heightened by the attacks in london and madrid , european countries were forced to adapt and expand their anti-terror legislations .
" legislative and institutional requirements have definitely become stricter in all 27 member states of the european union , " said annegret bendiek of the german institute for international and security affairs and author of a study on fighting terrorism in the eu .
yet striking the right balance between efficient engagement in the war on terror and protection of civil liberties has n't been easy to achieve .
one policy , many implementations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the end of privacy ?
in june 2002 , the eu council passed two resolutions - one establishing a common european arrest warrant and one defining a common concept of terrorist offences which all the member states of the european union had to include in their legal system .
in december 2005 , the eu adopted its eu counter-terrorism strategy , but it left the responsibility for its implementation in the hands of individual member states .
" states like the united kingdom , france and also germany are of course very engaged , " bendiek said .
but european states continue to differ greatly in their institutional and legislative approaches .
tough measures of all the eu member states , the united kingdom has gone the farthest in expanding the legislation meant to counter acts of terrorism .
several months after the 2001 attacks on new york and washington , d.c , britain 's terrorism act of 2000 was replaced by the anti-terrorism , crime and security act which stipulated that foreign terrorist suspects could be detained indefinitely .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2005 attacks in london lead to even stricter anti-terror laws after a public outcry and an intervention from the law lords - a judicial body of the upper house of the british parliament which serves as a court of last instance in the uk - this measure was abolished for being incompatible with the european convention of human rights .
its powers were later replaced by the so-called control order in the 2005 prevention of terrorism act .
the control order , however , still allows for comprehensive restriction of an individual 's liberties for the purpose of " protecting members of the public from a risk of terrorism . "
after the london bomb attacks in the summer of 2005 , the british legislation was made even stricter .
according to the terrorism act of 2006 , for example , " glorification of terrorist acts " can lead to a seven-year prison sentence .
it 's legal to eavesdrop ever since july 2005 , italy 's secret service has been allowed to monitor telephone conversations for the sake of preventing terrorist attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police surveillance is a cause of concern for privacy activists france adopted a new law this year that follows the british model allowing for surveillance cameras to be placed in public spaces such as train stations , churches and mosques , shops , factories or nuclear plants .
after a failed terrorist attack , in which crude propane gas bombs were primed to explode on two german trains on july 31 , the german government introduced a new law on fighting terrorism .
germany now has a computer databank which allows police and intelligence agencies easier access to a range of information on terrorism suspects , including membership of terrorist groups , firearms registration information as well as internet and telecommunications data .
not everybody can do it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you never know who 's listening in but smaller and less affluent eu countries are often lagging behind in terms of their legislative apparatus and implementation of counter-terrorist measures .
according to bendiek , malta , portugal or greece , for example , lack the administrative infrastructure , personnel and funds for implementing anti-terrorism laws .
in other countries , it is above all different legal traditions that cancel each other in various legislations .
" the british have fewer problems with video surveillance than the germans , " bendiek said .
" but as war as telephone surveillance is concerned , it could be the other way around .

wisniewski was not charged in the slaying of harm 's predecessor , siegfried buback .
his murder was one of a series of raf assassinations that rocked former west germany in what later became known as " the german autumn . "
but in an interview with the newsmagazine der spiegel this week , another former terrorist , peter-jürgen boock , said wisniewski was probably the motorcycle gunman who fired the fatal shots that killed buback and two companions in april 1977 .
three other members of the raf , also known as the baader-meinhof gang , were convicted of the buback killing , but it never became clear who pulled the trigger .

knut folkerts , who was released from prison in 1995 , was the third man convicted , but two other former terrorists told der spiegel they did not believe he was involved in the murder .
all three convicted of the buback killing have remained silent .
buback 's son , michael , said last week that he might support klar 's clemency appeal after receiving new information which suggested that he had n't carried out the killing .
the 1977 assassination of buback was intended to free imprisoned raf members , including its co-founder , andreas baader .

his murder was one of a series of raf assassinations that rocked former west germany in what later became known as " the german autumn . "

germany 's annual median temperature increased by 0.9 degrees celsius to 8.2 c -lrb- 46 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- since 1901 and could rise another 2 to 5 degrees by 2100 , according to the dwd .
germany experienced the warmest decade of the 20th century from 1990 to 1999 as well as seeing a 9-percent rise in precipitation .
germany should be better prepared for global warming , kusch said , stressing that farmers in particular would be forced to deal with the effects .
the changing climate would also unleash greater risks for people 's health , such as infectious diseases and skin cancer .
heat islands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 2006 deviation of temperature from the 1960-1990 average " we have to do all we can to ensure that the earth does not become uninhabitable , " kusch said .
as a result of the higher temperatures , germany would be subject to more rain and less snow in winter , causing ski resorts in the country 's south to close down , as tourism flourishes on the north and baltic seas .
cities would also see their temperatures rise beyond the 2 degree difference the dwd has already observed between urban areas and the surrounding countryside .

for the first time , european scientists have discovered another habitable planet .
dw-world.de talked with one of the discoverers , stephane udry of the geneva observatory . dw-world.de : how did you discover the planet ?
was it a coincidence ? stephane udry : no , of course not .
we 're working on a complete research project to discover such planets .
we 're tracking several thousand stars to get hints about planets from them .
our planet circles around a home star .
we 're mainly interested in the traveling speed of such stars , because it helps us to calculate the existence of a planet . what 's the name of the planet ? we do n't name them , because there are too many of them .
we 're using the name of the home star and add a letter that references the date of discovery .
the first planet that 's discovered around a star gets a " b , " the second a " c. "
the new planet is called gliese 581 c , because it 's the second that we 've discovered near the star gliese 581 . what kind of conditions exist on gliese 581 c ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : udry -lrb- right -rrb- with the director of the geneva observatory , michel mayor that 's a difficult questions .
it probably has a hard surface structure , because that 's the case with most planets of this size .
the mass of our planet is five times as big as that of the earth .
the average temperature should be between 0 and 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 32 and 104 degrees fahrenheit . -rrb-
a year only lasts 13 days on the planet , because it circles near its star . does organic life maybe exist there ? i can only say that the size and the temperature of the planet would be good for that .
the planet is in the so-called habitable zone , because it 's highly probable that water exists there .
there are probably several sources of water .
there are probably comets that bring water to the planet , as happened on earth during the early phase of the solar system .
there could be ice .
but the basic requirements for life are chemical components such as carbon and oxygen .
if they exists , conditions are good .
but i can not say much at the moment .
it 's possible that we 'll be able to do so in 20 years .
we need light from the planet 's atmosphere to determine that . can you use research probes to examine the planet further ? no , it 's too far away for that - 20 light years .
if we could travel at one tenth of the speed of light , which would be wonderful , we 'd still need two centuries to get there .
that 's why we have to continue to analyze the information from here . how important is this discovery for science ? it 's certainly an important discovery .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de champions league -pipe- 25.04.2007 chelsea wins narrowly in champions league semifinal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liverpool 's ready to take chelsea at home joe cole scored the only goal of the game as chelsea emerged from the first leg of their champions league semi-final with a 1-0 advantage over liverpool to take to anfield . after generating enough chances to put the tie beyond doubt , particularly in a first-half they comfortably dominated , jose mourinho 's side were put under sufficient pressure after the break for liverpool to head home believing they can turn things around in front of their own supporters . cole 's 29th-minute winner , a close-range effort created by didier drogba 's power-packed run and astute pass , was a fine goal .
drogba 's well-established capacity for ruffling the composure of the liverpool defense was underlined as early as the eighth minute , the ivory coast striker 's knockdown from ashley cole 's cross teeing up frank lampard on the penalty spot .
the england midfielder managed to get his foot over the bouncing ball but his shot was too straight and jose reina was able to make a good block . a minute later , andriy shevchenko curled a shot narrowly over the angle of post and bar and liverpool were reprieved again when drogba failed to pick out an unmarked joe cole in the middle after john arne riise 's slack back pass had sent him sprinting clear through the inside right channel .
liverpool unbowed twenty minutes had elapsed before liverpool managed to muster a shot on the chelsea goal , bolo zenden 's wayward effort only adding to the frustration of the increasingly agitated rafael benitez on the touchline . dirk kuyt finally gave petr cech something to do shortly afterwards , although a kindly deflection off ricardo carvalho ensured his header flew straight to the midriff of the czech goalkeeper . chelsea were soon threatening again and , after drogba had failed to connect with joe cole 's inviting cross , lampard sent a 25-yard free-kick fizzing inches outside the base of reina 's right-hand post . the pressure finally told in the 29th minute as chelsea took the lead with a move launched by carvalho on the edge of his own area . the portuguese carried the ball out to the edge of the center circle before spreading the ball wide to drogba , who muscled past daniel agger and advanced into the area before pulling the ball back behind jamie carragher .
cutting in from the opposite flank at pace , joe cole was able to get in front of alvaro arbeloa and finish the move with the most straightforward of finishes from eight yards out . but two fine saves from reina kept out efforts from drogba and lampard and ensured chelsea 's win was restricted to the narrowest of margins .
rooney trumps kaka fans at old trafford were cheering early on tuesday , as the hosts scored after a corner kick in the fifth minute .
striker cristiano ronaldo fired a short-range header at milan keeper , who could only deflect the ball into his own net . but any hopes that united would replicate their 7-1 thrashing of rome in the quarterfinals were soon dashed .
kaka caught manchester 's defense napping and left-footed the ball past edwin van der sar from a nearly impossible angle . manchester was playing with a makeshift back four due to injury , and it showed .
shortly before half-time , kaka power his way through three defenders to send the visitors into the locker room with a 2-1 lead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaka twisted manchester 's defense into knots the hosts were clearly shocked and looked tentative when play resumed .
but paul scholes got them back on track in the sixtieth minute with a nifty lob pass in the box to rooney , who slipped the ball under dida . from there on in it was all united .
darren fletcher had two excellent scoring opportunities late in the match , only to be narrowly denied .

drogba 's well-established capacity for ruffling the composure of the liverpool defense was underlined as early as the eighth minute , the ivory coast striker 's knockdown from ashley cole 's cross teeing up frank lampard on the penalty spot .
the england midfielder managed to get his foot over the bouncing ball but his shot was too straight and jose reina was able to make a good block . a minute later , andriy shevchenko curled a shot narrowly over the angle of post and bar and liverpool were reprieved again when drogba failed to pick out an unmarked joe cole in the middle after john arne riise 's slack back pass had sent him sprinting clear through the inside right channel .
liverpool unbowed twenty minutes had elapsed before liverpool managed to muster a shot on the chelsea goal , bolo zenden 's wayward effort only adding to the frustration of the increasingly agitated rafael benitez on the touchline . dirk kuyt finally gave petr cech something to do shortly afterwards , although a kindly deflection off ricardo carvalho ensured his header flew straight to the midriff of the czech goalkeeper . chelsea were soon threatening again and , after drogba had failed to connect with joe cole 's inviting cross , lampard sent a 25-yard free-kick fizzing inches outside the base of reina 's right-hand post . the pressure finally told in the 29th minute as chelsea took the lead with a move launched by carvalho on the edge of his own area . the portuguese carried the ball out to the edge of the center circle before spreading the ball wide to drogba , who muscled past daniel agger and advanced into the area before pulling the ball back behind jamie carragher .
cutting in from the opposite flank at pace , joe cole was able to get in front of alvaro arbeloa and finish the move with the most straightforward of finishes from eight yards out . but two fine saves from reina kept out efforts from drogba and lampard and ensured chelsea 's win was restricted to the narrowest of margins .
rooney trumps kaka fans at old trafford were cheering early on tuesday , as the hosts scored after a corner kick in the fifth minute .
striker cristiano ronaldo fired a short-range header at milan keeper , who could only deflect the ball into his own net . but any hopes that united would replicate their 7-1 thrashing of rome in the quarterfinals were soon dashed .
kaka caught manchester 's defense napping and left-footed the ball past edwin van der sar from a nearly impossible angle . manchester was playing with a makeshift back four due to injury , and it showed .
shortly before half-time , kaka power his way through three defenders to send the visitors into the locker room with a 2-1 lead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaka twisted manchester 's defense into knots the hosts were clearly shocked and looked tentative when play resumed .
but paul scholes got them back on track in the sixtieth minute with a nifty lob pass in the box to rooney , who slipped the ball under dida . from there on in it was all united .
darren fletcher had two excellent scoring opportunities late in the match , only to be narrowly denied .
and rooney sealed the win for manchester in injury time with a curling blast into the lower left hand corner of the goal . it was a decent outcome for both sides .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 25.04.2007 europeans discover " second earth " in universe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the planet 's a bit hard to reach as it is 200 billion kilometers away from earth the first habitable planet similar in size and conditions to the earth has been located in a distant solar system , once again raising the possibility of life on other planets , scientists revealed wednesday . the as-yet unnamed planet is only about one-and-a-half times the size of earth and five times more massive , a team of european astronomers announced at the european southern observatory in garching , germany .
" we have estimated that the mean temperature of this super-earth lies between 0 and 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 32 and 104 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , and water would thus be liquid , " said stephane udry of the geneva observatory .
" models predict that the planet should be either rocky like our earth or covered with oceans . "
the planet is located around a star known as the gliese 581 , about 20.5 light years from the earth 's solar system and one of the 100 closest stars to the sun .

" we have estimated that the mean temperature of this super-earth lies between 0 and 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 32 and 104 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , and water would thus be liquid , " said stephane udry of the geneva observatory .
" models predict that the planet should be either rocky like our earth or covered with oceans . "
the planet is located around a star known as the gliese 581 , about 20.5 light years from the earth 's solar system and one of the 100 closest stars to the sun .
ideal habitat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : light on the plant could be similar to a sunset on earth , scientists say though the planet is much closer to its star than the earth is to the sun , conditions are similar because the gliese 581 , known as a red dwarf , is smaller and colder .
one year lasts only 13 days on the planet .
" red dwarfs are ideal targets for the search for such planets because they emit less light , and the habitable zone is thus much closer to them than it is around the sun , " said xavier bonfils of lisbon university .
more than 200 so-called exoplanets - planets outside of the sun 's solar system - have been discovered in the passed 12 years since the first one was found .
most are massive bowls of gas similar to jupiter .
universal treasure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the planet resemble earth one day ?
the same team of astronauts discovered a another planet around the same red dwarf two years ago - a neptune-sized planet about 15 times as massive as earth .
an extensive analysis of the latest find is to be revealed in the journal astronomy & astrophysics .
xavier delfosse of grenoble university in france said the newfound planet could inhabit life and will definitely be a target of future space missions to find extra-terrestrial beings .
" liquid water is critical to life as we know it , " he said .
" on the treasure map of the universe , one would be tempted to mark this planet with an x.

some media experts have called the appointment of a minority anchorwoman " revolutionary . "
do you see it that way too ? gualtiero zambonini : i would n't call it revolutionary , but it 's definitely an important signal in the right direction .
at wdr , we 've had asli sevindim , a turkish-german journalist , as the main anchorwoman of our evening prime-time news show for over a year now .
another of our turkish-german editors , birand bingül , belongs to the team of commentators on the prime-time news show on the ard network . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-iraqi journalist dunja hayali is the new face of german tv network zdf so , in a way zdf is following us .
but that 's also important because it 's a sign that the public broadcasters in germany have realized the necessity of reflecting this development in society both in their programs as well as in the profiles of their presenters . there are still very few minority presenters on the german networks .
why is that the case ? at wdr , we 've been developing measures for the past four years at least to try and get immigrant journalists on mainstream programs .
but in reality , we are only at the beginning of the road .
nobody should be under the illusion that just because we have a presenter of iraqi origin on zdf or an anchorwoman with a turkish background on wdr , we 've taken care of the problem .
these examples are important for two reasons .
firstly , because they show how seriously we want to promote the issue .
and secondly , because these role models are a sign to potential journalists who perhaps have n't trusted themselves up to now or did n't think that presenting a prime-time news show on major networks could be something for a person with an iraqi or an italian name .
it provides encouragement for more immigrants to pursue journalism careers . in the past , these signs were missing as was a hiring policy among media companies that consciously looked for minority journalists and signaled " we want more of them . "
that 's part of the problem why there are such few minority journalists in newsrooms and in front of cameras and microphones .
we simply realized the problem too late in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's immigrants do n't usually have the chance to study journalism the other part of the problem is that it 's only now in the second and third generation of immigrants that talent and potential is coming to the fore in the german media market .
these are children from immigrant families who grew up here and went to school and university .
this is a development that took place much earlier in countries such as britain or the netherlands partly because some of these nations have a history of immigration different from germany 's . how does germany compare with other countries in europe when it comes to integrating its immigrants into television ? we can definitely learn from good examples in europe , for instance from countries such as sweden or the netherlands where there are integration policies at the broadcasters and corresponding laws .
in the netherlands for example , minorities are entitled to have a certain share of programming in the media and there are laws governing it .
that obviously creates a whole new basis for the question about which journalists the networks hire . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british tv comes closer to reflecting social reality at the same time , that does n't mean there are no problems in these countries .
in the netherlands , there are still too many programs that are white - that means there are too many white dutch faces and not enough immigrants .
in britain , the situation is slightly different .
for instance , bbc international is a wonderful example of journalistic diversity , but that 's not the case in all bbc programs .
my colleagues at bbc say , ' it 's good that we 've achieved some goals , but we 're still far removed from truly representing society in the media . ' we can learn from the french too , who are redoubling efforts to tackle the problem of a lack of minority journalists .
but we 're generally lagging behind in europe .
the important thing is that we 've all recognized the problem . what else needs to be done at the networks for there to be a real change ? a rethink is already taking place among the top managers at the broadcasters as a result of pressure from politicians , societal developments as well as pressure from european policies which have placed integration of minorities high on the agenda .
one has to say that is not just a question of values and good sense but also a question of the market .
we have to take demographic developments into account .
today every fifth person in germany has an immigrant background .
among the younger generations in big cities , it 's every second person .
that means that viewers too have changed and this viewer ship lives in a culture of diversity .
if we do n't take these viewers into account , then we lose the right to exist .
it really is a question of our existence . but to really make progress on the issue , there has to be a change in the media company culture as well as in the way funds are managed .
in addition , the issue has to be anchored in the guiding principles of the broadcasters and supported with further training programs for employees as well as managers .
if nothing changes in the minds of the decision-makers , then we ca n't solve the problem . i believe that the public broadcasters bear a special responsibility towards promoting integration of immigrants .

some media experts have called the appointment of a minority anchorwoman " revolutionary . "
do you see it that way too ? gualtiero zambonini : i would n't call it revolutionary , but it 's definitely an important signal in the right direction .
at wdr , we 've had asli sevindim , a turkish-german journalist , as the main anchorwoman of our evening prime-time news show for over a year now .
another of our turkish-german editors , birand bingül , belongs to the team of commentators on the prime-time news show on the ard network . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-iraqi journalist dunja hayali is the new face of german tv network zdf so , in a way zdf is following us .
but that 's also important because it 's a sign that the public broadcasters in germany have realized the necessity of reflecting this development in society both in their programs as well as in the profiles of their presenters . there are still very few minority presenters on the german networks .
why is that the case ? at wdr , we 've been developing measures for the past four years at least to try and get immigrant journalists on mainstream programs .
but in reality , we are only at the beginning of the road .
nobody should be under the illusion that just because we have a presenter of iraqi origin on zdf or an anchorwoman with a turkish background on wdr , we 've taken care of the problem .
these examples are important for two reasons .
firstly , because they show how seriously we want to promote the issue .
and secondly , because these role models are a sign to potential journalists who perhaps have n't trusted themselves up to now or did n't think that presenting a prime-time news show on major networks could be something for a person with an iraqi or an italian name .
it provides encouragement for more immigrants to pursue journalism careers . in the past , these signs were missing as was a hiring policy among media companies that consciously looked for minority journalists and signaled " we want more of them . "
that 's part of the problem why there are such few minority journalists in newsrooms and in front of cameras and microphones .
we simply realized the problem too late in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's immigrants do n't usually have the chance to study journalism the other part of the problem is that it 's only now in the second and third generation of immigrants that talent and potential is coming to the fore in the german media market .
these are children from immigrant families who grew up here and went to school and university .
this is a development that took place much earlier in countries such as britain or the netherlands partly because some of these nations have a history of immigration different from germany 's . how does germany compare with other countries in europe when it comes to integrating its immigrants into television ? we can definitely learn from good examples in europe , for instance from countries such as sweden or the netherlands where there are integration policies at the broadcasters and corresponding laws .
in the netherlands for example , minorities are entitled to have a certain share of programming in the media and there are laws governing it .
that obviously creates a whole new basis for the question about which journalists the networks hire . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british tv comes closer to reflecting social reality at the same time , that does n't mean there are no problems in these countries .
in the netherlands , there are still too many programs that are white - that means there are too many white dutch faces and not enough immigrants .
in britain , the situation is slightly different .
for instance , bbc international is a wonderful example of journalistic diversity , but that 's not the case in all bbc programs .
my colleagues at bbc say , ' it 's good that we 've achieved some goals , but we 're still far removed from truly representing society in the media . ' we can learn from the french too , who are redoubling efforts to tackle the problem of a lack of minority journalists .
but we 're generally lagging behind in europe .
the important thing is that we 've all recognized the problem . what else needs to be done at the networks for there to be a real change ? a rethink is already taking place among the top managers at the broadcasters as a result of pressure from politicians , societal developments as well as pressure from european policies which have placed integration of minorities high on the agenda .
one has to say that is not just a question of values and good sense but also a question of the market .
we have to take demographic developments into account .
today every fifth person in germany has an immigrant background .
among the younger generations in big cities , it 's every second person .
that means that viewers too have changed and this viewer ship lives in a culture of diversity .
if we do n't take these viewers into account , then we lose the right to exist .
it really is a question of our existence . but to really make progress on the issue , there has to be a change in the media company culture as well as in the way funds are managed .
in addition , the issue has to be anchored in the guiding principles of the broadcasters and supported with further training programs for employees as well as managers .
if nothing changes in the minds of the decision-makers , then we ca n't solve the problem . i believe that the public broadcasters bear a special responsibility towards promoting integration of immigrants .
we 're all financed by licensing fees , the public networks need to all take a stand on the issue . when do you think we 'll see a black presenter or a turkish-german anchor on " tagesschau " ?

that obviously creates a whole new basis for the question about which journalists the networks hire . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british tv comes closer to reflecting social reality at the same time , that does n't mean there are no problems in these countries .
in the netherlands , there are still too many programs that are white - that means there are too many white dutch faces and not enough immigrants .
in britain , the situation is slightly different .
for instance , bbc international is a wonderful example of journalistic diversity , but that 's not the case in all bbc programs .
my colleagues at bbc say , ' it 's good that we 've achieved some goals , but we 're still far removed from truly representing society in the media . ' we can learn from the french too , who are redoubling efforts to tackle the problem of a lack of minority journalists .
but we 're generally lagging behind in europe .
the important thing is that we 've all recognized the problem . what else needs to be done at the networks for there to be a real change ? a rethink is already taking place among the top managers at the broadcasters as a result of pressure from politicians , societal developments as well as pressure from european policies which have placed integration of minorities high on the agenda .
one has to say that is not just a question of values and good sense but also a question of the market .
we have to take demographic developments into account .
today every fifth person in germany has an immigrant background .
among the younger generations in big cities , it 's every second person .
that means that viewers too have changed and this viewer ship lives in a culture of diversity .
if we do n't take these viewers into account , then we lose the right to exist .
it really is a question of our existence . but to really make progress on the issue , there has to be a change in the media company culture as well as in the way funds are managed .
in addition , the issue has to be anchored in the guiding principles of the broadcasters and supported with further training programs for employees as well as managers .
if nothing changes in the minds of the decision-makers , then we ca n't solve the problem . i believe that the public broadcasters bear a special responsibility towards promoting integration of immigrants .
we 're all financed by licensing fees , the public networks need to all take a stand on the issue . when do you think we 'll see a black presenter or a turkish-german anchor on " tagesschau " ?
-lrb- germany 's most popular news program -rrb- that wo n't take too long .
i hope that this healthy competition among the networks on the issue will soon generate a new face for the program . sonia phalnikar interviewed gualtiero zambonini send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new face on german tv highlights dearth of minority presenters the choice of a minority presenter for the main news show on a major network is almost revolutionary in germany .
but experts say it spotlights the long way the country needs to go to visibly integrate its immigrants .

g8 members aimed to offer african countries a " broad political partnership " with the aim of promoting democracy and reducing corruption , pfaffenbach said .
he stressed that money was not the solution to everything , although the industrialized countries stood by their longstanding commitments , including allocating 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product to development aid by 2012 .
african countries needed to improve their governmental structures and attract more private capital , he said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economy minister michael glos " the upturn is continuing , growth remains strong and the situation in the labor market keeps getting better , " glos said .
citing germany 's robust export performance , glos said the present level of the euro was " sustainable , " but warned that a strong currency can threaten a country 's exports , making them more expensive and less competitive on world markets .
" if it -lrb- the euro -rrb- were to rise still more strongly , there would be risks , " glos said .
he was speaking as the euro moved closer to an all-time high point against the dollar , soaring to 1.3656 on wednesday , well within striking distance of 1.3666 , its record level reached on dec 30 , 2004 .
surpassing expectations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro moved closer to an all-time high point against the dollar the influential ifo index rose to 108.6 points in april from 107.7 points in march , putting it just one-tenth of a point away from the record score of 108.7 points recorded in december .
analysts polled by news agency thomson financial had predicted a far more modest surge , to 107.8 points .
" germany is profiting from the extraordinary international investment boom , which due to germany 's specialization is having a stronger cyclical impact than in the other major european countries , " ifo president hans-werner sinn said in a statement .
for its monthly survey , ifo polls some 7,000 companies about their assessment of current business and their expectations for the next six months .
a breakdown of the data showed that the current sentiment sub-index rose to 113.2 points in april from 112.4 points in march .
and the expectations sub-index also increased , rising to 104.3 points from 103.2 points , ifo said .
analysts said the data were further proof that the german economy has weathered a steep hike in value-added tax this year .
jumping over hurdles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany increased its vat to 19 procent this year on jan 1 , the german government increased vat by three full percentage points to 19 percent , the biggest-ever single rise in a move experts said would put the brakes on consumer spending and therefore drag on overall growth .
the robust health of the economy is now expected to reduce public debt and buoy the job market .
the unemployment rate in march fell to 9.8 percent .
ifo said in retailing and wholesaling , the business climate had also brightened noticeably in march with companies giving more positive appraisals of both their current situation and their six-month outlook .
sentiment in the construction industry , however , remained unchanged .
positive outlook bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german manufacturers are confident about their exports elga bartsch of morgan stanley said the fact the euro had hit a two-year peak against the dollar had not hurt germany 's export-driven economy .
" notwithstanding the stronger euro , the ifo institute also reported an improvement in the export expectations of german manufacturers , " bartsch said .
" of course , a considerable share of those exports would go to other euro area countries .
but , thus far , the mood amongst german manufacturers seems to be defiant regarding the euro , " she said , adding that the strong single currency and a us slowdown could leave " skid marks " in the future .
laying the groundwork bank of america 's holger schmieding said german companies had helped lay the groundwork for the sharp economic upturn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank may end up raising its interest rates " with export expectations up according to an ifo spokesman , it shows that the severe slashing of costs that german corporations had to do in the years since 2000 is paying off nicely , " he said .
" german exports are competitive .
so far , strong demand from asia , central and eastern europe as well as the oil countries seems to offset the rise in the euro and weaker us demand . "
the sunny outlook in germany would provide additional arguments for the european central bank to continue raising its key interest rates , analysts said .
" along with rises in business confidence in belgium and netherlands , the surveys released so far this month support our view that the ecb will raise rates to 4.00 percent in june and once again in to 4.25 percent by year-end , " said sunil kapadia of ubs investment research . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de soccer world cup hardly touched german economy the patriotism and high spirits unleashed by this past summer 's world cup were expected to boost the german economy , but experts say the soccer event had virtually no impact on growth and employment .
-lrb- 21.04.2007 -rrb- outlook for german economy remains sunny the country 's top economic institutes are raising their forecast for economic growth this year by two thirds , which could mean a higher tax take , stronger domestic demand and lower unemployment .
-lrb- 19.04.2007 -rrb- optimism grows on outlook for german economy the run of good news for the german economy , europe 's biggest , looks set to continue for some time , with bundesbank president axel weber arguing on monday that current growth marks only the beginning of a longer upturn .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 25.04.2007 " an important signal to immigrants " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gualtiero zambonini said tv networks need to do more to hire immigrant journalists dw-world.de spoke with the commissioner for integration at german broadcaster wdr about the need for tv networks to recruit more journalists and presenters from immigrant minorities . gualtiero zambonini has been the commissioner for integration at the cologne-based german public broadcaster , wdr , since 2003 . dw-world.de : the zdf public network will have a new german-iraqi presenter for their main news show starting end of april .
some media experts have called the appointment of a minority anchorwoman " revolutionary . "
do you see it that way too ? gualtiero zambonini : i would n't call it revolutionary , but it 's definitely an important signal in the right direction .
at wdr , we 've had asli sevindim , a turkish-german journalist , as the main anchorwoman of our evening prime-time news show for over a year now .
another of our turkish-german editors , birand bingül , belongs to the team of commentators on the prime-time news show on the ard network . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-iraqi journalist dunja hayali is the new face of german tv network zdf so , in a way zdf is following us .
but that 's also important because it 's a sign that the public broadcasters in germany have realized the necessity of reflecting this development in society both in their programs as well as in the profiles of their presenters . there are still very few minority presenters on the german networks .
why is that the case ? at wdr , we 've been developing measures for the past four years at least to try and get immigrant journalists on mainstream programs .
but in reality , we are only at the beginning of the road .
nobody should be under the illusion that just because we have a presenter of iraqi origin on zdf or an anchorwoman with a turkish background on wdr , we 've taken care of the problem .
these examples are important for two reasons .
firstly , because they show how seriously we want to promote the issue .
and secondly , because these role models are a sign to potential journalists who perhaps have n't trusted themselves up to now or did n't think that presenting a prime-time news show on major networks could be something for a person with an iraqi or an italian name .
it provides encouragement for more immigrants to pursue journalism careers . in the past , these signs were missing as was a hiring policy among media companies that consciously looked for minority journalists and signaled " we want more of them . "
that 's part of the problem why there are such few minority journalists in newsrooms and in front of cameras and microphones .
we simply realized the problem too late in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's immigrants do n't usually have the chance to study journalism the other part of the problem is that it 's only now in the second and third generation of immigrants that talent and potential is coming to the fore in the german media market .
these are children from immigrant families who grew up here and went to school and university .
this is a development that took place much earlier in countries such as britain or the netherlands partly because some of these nations have a history of immigration different from germany 's . how does germany compare with other countries in europe when it comes to integrating its immigrants into television ? we can definitely learn from good examples in europe , for instance from countries such as sweden or the netherlands where there are integration policies at the broadcasters and corresponding laws .
in the netherlands for example , minorities are entitled to have a certain share of programming in the media and there are laws governing it .
that obviously creates a whole new basis for the question about which journalists the networks hire . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british tv comes closer to reflecting social reality at the same time , that does n't mean there are no problems in these countries .
in the netherlands , there are still too many programs that are white - that means there are too many white dutch faces and not enough immigrants .
in britain , the situation is slightly different .
for instance , bbc international is a wonderful example of journalistic diversity , but that 's not the case in all bbc programs .
my colleagues at bbc say , ' it 's good that we 've achieved some goals , but we 're still far removed from truly representing society in the media . ' we can learn from the french too , who are redoubling efforts to tackle the problem of a lack of minority journalists .
but we 're generally lagging behind in europe .
the important thing is that we 've all recognized the problem . what else needs to be done at the networks for there to be a real change ? a rethink is already taking place among the top managers at the broadcasters as a result of pressure from politicians , societal developments as well as pressure from european policies which have placed integration of minorities high on the agenda .
one has to say that is not just a question of values and good sense but also a question of the market .
we have to take demographic developments into account .
today every fifth person in germany has an immigrant background .
among the younger generations in big cities , it 's every second person .
that means that viewers too have changed and this viewer ship lives in a culture of diversity .
if we do n't take these viewers into account , then we lose the right to exist .
it really is a question of our existence . but to really make progress on the issue , there has to be a change in the media company culture as well as in the way funds are managed .
in addition , the issue has to be anchored in the guiding principles of the broadcasters and supported with further training programs for employees as well as managers .
if nothing changes in the minds of the decision-makers , then we ca n't solve the problem . i believe that the public broadcasters bear a special responsibility towards promoting integration of immigrants .
we 're all financed by licensing fees , the public networks need to all take a stand on the issue . when do you think we 'll see a black presenter or a turkish-german anchor on " tagesschau " ?
-lrb- germany 's most popular news program -rrb- that wo n't take too long .
i hope that this healthy competition among the networks on the issue will soon generate a new face for the program . sonia phalnikar interviewed gualtiero zambonini send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new face on german tv highlights dearth of minority presenters the choice of a minority presenter for the main news show on a major network is almost revolutionary in germany .
but experts say it spotlights the long way the country needs to go to visibly integrate its immigrants .

" the company needs clarity with regard to its leadership during these times , " kleinfeld said .
" i have therefore decided not to make myself available for an extension of my contract . " his successor has not been named . kleinfeld refused to accept the board delaying a vote on the contract , company officials said , as a result paving the way for a major shakeout in the group 's top management . his decision to leave the company after a two-decade career followed last week 's dramatic announcement by siemens chairman heinrich von pierer that he was resigning . slush-fund probe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werner von siemens started the company in 1847 although cleared of any wrongdoing , kleinfeld 's future had hung in the balance as the siemens ' board considered whether far-reaching changes of the group 's management were necessary to help give the group a new start as it contended with an ongoing slush-fund probe . ahead of wednesday 's meeting , german media had reported that supervisory board members had started a search for a possible successor for kleinfeld as part of a push for a major shakeout of the company 's top management . despite launching an internal company investigation into recent scandals and stepping up corporate control procedures , kleinfeld has come under fire for failing to act sooner in dealing with allegations of corruption . this included claims that funds totaling as much as 420 million euros -lrb- $ 573 million dollars -rrb- had been siphoned off into illicit accounts over the last seven years . won praise during his two years at the helm of siemens , kleinfeld has also won plaudits from investors for his efforts to boost the company 's finances through big cuts in the company 's workforce and a major acquisitions drive . siemens ' shares edged down 0.94 percent to 88.36 euros as trading drew to a close wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinrich von pierer said last week he would step down the almost herculean task of steering siemens out of the crisis that has engulfed the company in recent months now falls on german steel giant thyssenkrupp ag 's chairman gerhard cromme , who is to takeover as board chairman from von pierer . ending his long career with the company , von pierer insisted he was not taking personal responsibility for the scandals that have badly shaken the company .
these included allegations that members of management channeled funds into an employer-friendly labor group . at the helm 66-year-old von pierer had presided over the company 's management both as chief executive and then as chairman during the time the corruption was alleged to have taken place . von pierer stepped aside as chief executive in 2005 to make way for kleinfeld , who was his protégé . the scandals have , however , also largely overshadowed siemens ' recent solid financial performance . data released tuesday evening by the company showed second-quarter net profit surged 36 percent to 1.259 billion euros .
this beat analysts ' forecasts of a rise to 1.193 billion euros . the group said revenues jumped 10 percent in the quarter to 20.626 billion euros . at the same time , siemens said orders increased nine percent to 23.469 billion euros , while group profit climbed 49 percent to 1.964 billion euros . dw staff / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de uncertainty continues at the top of siemens the supervisory board of siemens will determine on wednesday whether ceo klaus kleinfeld will stay on at the german electronics giant .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economy minister michael glos " the upturn is continuing , growth remains strong and the situation in the labor market keeps getting better , " glos said .
citing germany 's robust export performance , glos said the present level of the euro was " sustainable , " but warned that a strong currency can threaten a country 's exports , making them more expensive and less competitive on world markets .
" if it -lrb- the euro -rrb- were to rise still more strongly , there would be risks , " glos said .
he was speaking as the euro moved closer to an all-time high point against the dollar , soaring to 1.3656 on wednesday , well within striking distance of 1.3666 , its record level reached on dec 30 , 2004 .
surpassing expectations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro moved closer to an all-time high point against the dollar the influential ifo index rose to 108.6 points in april from 107.7 points in march , putting it just one-tenth of a point away from the record score of 108.7 points recorded in december .
analysts polled by news agency thomson financial had predicted a far more modest surge , to 107.8 points .
" germany is profiting from the extraordinary international investment boom , which due to germany 's specialization is having a stronger cyclical impact than in the other major european countries , " ifo president hans-werner sinn said in a statement .
for its monthly survey , ifo polls some 7,000 companies about their assessment of current business and their expectations for the next six months .
a breakdown of the data showed that the current sentiment sub-index rose to 113.2 points in april from 112.4 points in march .
and the expectations sub-index also increased , rising to 104.3 points from 103.2 points , ifo said .
analysts said the data were further proof that the german economy has weathered a steep hike in value-added tax this year .
jumping over hurdles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany increased its vat to 19 procent this year on jan 1 , the german government increased vat by three full percentage points to 19 percent , the biggest-ever single rise in a move experts said would put the brakes on consumer spending and therefore drag on overall growth .
the robust health of the economy is now expected to reduce public debt and buoy the job market .
the unemployment rate in march fell to 9.8 percent .
ifo said in retailing and wholesaling , the business climate had also brightened noticeably in march with companies giving more positive appraisals of both their current situation and their six-month outlook .
sentiment in the construction industry , however , remained unchanged .
positive outlook bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german manufacturers are confident about their exports elga bartsch of morgan stanley said the fact the euro had hit a two-year peak against the dollar had not hurt germany 's export-driven economy .
" notwithstanding the stronger euro , the ifo institute also reported an improvement in the export expectations of german manufacturers , " bartsch said .
" of course , a considerable share of those exports would go to other euro area countries .
but , thus far , the mood amongst german manufacturers seems to be defiant regarding the euro , " she said , adding that the strong single currency and a us slowdown could leave " skid marks " in the future .
laying the groundwork bank of america 's holger schmieding said german companies had helped lay the groundwork for the sharp economic upturn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank may end up raising its interest rates " with export expectations up according to an ifo spokesman , it shows that the severe slashing of costs that german corporations had to do in the years since 2000 is paying off nicely , " he said .
" german exports are competitive .
so far , strong demand from asia , central and eastern europe as well as the oil countries seems to offset the rise in the euro and weaker us demand . "
the sunny outlook in germany would provide additional arguments for the european central bank to continue raising its key interest rates , analysts said .
" along with rises in business confidence in belgium and netherlands , the surveys released so far this month support our view that the ecb will raise rates to 4.00 percent in june and once again in to 4.25 percent by year-end , " said sunil kapadia of ubs investment research . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de soccer world cup hardly touched german economy the patriotism and high spirits unleashed by this past summer 's world cup were expected to boost the german economy , but experts say the soccer event had virtually no impact on growth and employment .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economy minister michael glos " the upturn is continuing , growth remains strong and the situation in the labor market keeps getting better , " glos said .
citing germany 's robust export performance , glos said the present level of the euro was " sustainable , " but warned that a strong currency can threaten a country 's exports , making them more expensive and less competitive on world markets .
" if it -lrb- the euro -rrb- were to rise still more strongly , there would be risks , " glos said .
he was speaking as the euro moved closer to an all-time high point against the dollar , soaring to 1.3656 on wednesday , well within striking distance of 1.3666 , its record level reached on dec 30 , 2004 .
surpassing expectations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro moved closer to an all-time high point against the dollar the influential ifo index rose to 108.6 points in april from 107.7 points in march , putting it just one-tenth of a point away from the record score of 108.7 points recorded in december .
analysts polled by news agency thomson financial had predicted a far more modest surge , to 107.8 points .
" germany is profiting from the extraordinary international investment boom , which due to germany 's specialization is having a stronger cyclical impact than in the other major european countries , " ifo president hans-werner sinn said in a statement .
for its monthly survey , ifo polls some 7,000 companies about their assessment of current business and their expectations for the next six months .
a breakdown of the data showed that the current sentiment sub-index rose to 113.2 points in april from 112.4 points in march .
and the expectations sub-index also increased , rising to 104.3 points from 103.2 points , ifo said .
analysts said the data were further proof that the german economy has weathered a steep hike in value-added tax this year .
jumping over hurdles bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany increased its vat to 19 procent this year on jan 1 , the german government increased vat by three full percentage points to 19 percent , the biggest-ever single rise in a move experts said would put the brakes on consumer spending and therefore drag on overall growth .
the robust health of the economy is now expected to reduce public debt and buoy the job market .
the unemployment rate in march fell to 9.8 percent .
ifo said in retailing and wholesaling , the business climate had also brightened noticeably in march with companies giving more positive appraisals of both their current situation and their six-month outlook .
sentiment in the construction industry , however , remained unchanged .
positive outlook bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german manufacturers are confident about their exports elga bartsch of morgan stanley said the fact the euro had hit a two-year peak against the dollar had not hurt germany 's export-driven economy .
" notwithstanding the stronger euro , the ifo institute also reported an improvement in the export expectations of german manufacturers , " bartsch said .
" of course , a considerable share of those exports would go to other euro area countries .
but , thus far , the mood amongst german manufacturers seems to be defiant regarding the euro , " she said , adding that the strong single currency and a us slowdown could leave " skid marks " in the future .
laying the groundwork bank of america 's holger schmieding said german companies had helped lay the groundwork for the sharp economic upturn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european central bank may end up raising its interest rates " with export expectations up according to an ifo spokesman , it shows that the severe slashing of costs that german corporations had to do in the years since 2000 is paying off nicely , " he said .
" german exports are competitive .
so far , strong demand from asia , central and eastern europe as well as the oil countries seems to offset the rise in the euro and weaker us demand . "
the sunny outlook in germany would provide additional arguments for the european central bank to continue raising its key interest rates , analysts said .
" along with rises in business confidence in belgium and netherlands , the surveys released so far this month support our view that the ecb will raise rates to 4.00 percent in june and once again in to 4.25 percent by year-end , " said sunil kapadia of ubs investment research . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de soccer world cup hardly touched german economy the patriotism and high spirits unleashed by this past summer 's world cup were expected to boost the german economy , but experts say the soccer event had virtually no impact on growth and employment .

wisniewski was not charged in the slaying of harm 's predecessor , siegfried buback .
his murder was one of a series of raf assassinations that rocked former west germany in what later became known as " the german autumn . "
but in an interview with the newsmagazine der spiegel this week , another former terrorist , peter-jürgen boock , said wisniewski was probably the motorcycle gunman who fired the fatal shots that killed buback and two companions in april 1977 .

all three convicted of the buback killing have remained silent .
buback 's son , michael , said last week that he might support klar 's clemency appeal after receiving new information which suggested that he had n't carried out the killing .
the 1977 assassination of buback was intended to free imprisoned raf members , including its co-founder , andreas baader .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 25.04.2007 " an important signal to immigrants " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gualtiero zambonini said tv networks need to do more to hire immigrant journalists dw-world.de spoke with the commissioner for integration at german broadcaster wdr about the need for tv networks to recruit more journalists and presenters from immigrant minorities . gualtiero zambonini has been the commissioner for integration at the cologne-based german public broadcaster , wdr , since 2003 . dw-world.de : the zdf public network will have a new german-iraqi presenter for their main news show starting end of april .
some media experts have called the appointment of a minority anchorwoman " revolutionary . "
do you see it that way too ? gualtiero zambonini : i would n't call it revolutionary , but it 's definitely an important signal in the right direction .
at wdr , we 've had asli sevindim , a turkish-german journalist , as the main anchorwoman of our evening prime-time news show for over a year now .
another of our turkish-german editors , birand bingül , belongs to the team of commentators on the prime-time news show on the ard network . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-iraqi journalist dunja hayali is the new face of german tv network zdf so , in a way zdf is following us .
but that 's also important because it 's a sign that the public broadcasters in germany have realized the necessity of reflecting this development in society both in their programs as well as in the profiles of their presenters . there are still very few minority presenters on the german networks .
why is that the case ? at wdr , we 've been developing measures for the past four years at least to try and get immigrant journalists on mainstream programs .
but in reality , we are only at the beginning of the road .
nobody should be under the illusion that just because we have a presenter of iraqi origin on zdf or an anchorwoman with a turkish background on wdr , we 've taken care of the problem .
these examples are important for two reasons .
firstly , because they show how seriously we want to promote the issue .
and secondly , because these role models are a sign to potential journalists who perhaps have n't trusted themselves up to now or did n't think that presenting a prime-time news show on major networks could be something for a person with an iraqi or an italian name .
it provides encouragement for more immigrants to pursue journalism careers . in the past , these signs were missing as was a hiring policy among media companies that consciously looked for minority journalists and signaled " we want more of them . "
that 's part of the problem why there are such few minority journalists in newsrooms and in front of cameras and microphones .
we simply realized the problem too late in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's immigrants do n't usually have the chance to study journalism the other part of the problem is that it 's only now in the second and third generation of immigrants that talent and potential is coming to the fore in the german media market .
these are children from immigrant families who grew up here and went to school and university .
this is a development that took place much earlier in countries such as britain or the netherlands partly because some of these nations have a history of immigration different from germany 's . how does germany compare with other countries in europe when it comes to integrating its immigrants into television ? we can definitely learn from good examples in europe , for instance from countries such as sweden or the netherlands where there are integration policies at the broadcasters and corresponding laws .
in the netherlands for example , minorities are entitled to have a certain share of programming in the media and there are laws governing it .
that obviously creates a whole new basis for the question about which journalists the networks hire . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british tv comes closer to reflecting social reality at the same time , that does n't mean there are no problems in these countries .
in the netherlands , there are still too many programs that are white - that means there are too many white dutch faces and not enough immigrants .
in britain , the situation is slightly different .
for instance , bbc international is a wonderful example of journalistic diversity , but that 's not the case in all bbc programs .
my colleagues at bbc say , ' it 's good that we 've achieved some goals , but we 're still far removed from truly representing society in the media . ' we can learn from the french too , who are redoubling efforts to tackle the problem of a lack of minority journalists .
but we 're generally lagging behind in europe .
the important thing is that we 've all recognized the problem . what else needs to be done at the networks for there to be a real change ? a rethink is already taking place among the top managers at the broadcasters as a result of pressure from politicians , societal developments as well as pressure from european policies which have placed integration of minorities high on the agenda .
one has to say that is not just a question of values and good sense but also a question of the market .
we have to take demographic developments into account .
today every fifth person in germany has an immigrant background .
among the younger generations in big cities , it 's every second person .
that means that viewers too have changed and this viewer ship lives in a culture of diversity .
if we do n't take these viewers into account , then we lose the right to exist .
it really is a question of our existence . but to really make progress on the issue , there has to be a change in the media company culture as well as in the way funds are managed .
in addition , the issue has to be anchored in the guiding principles of the broadcasters and supported with further training programs for employees as well as managers .
if nothing changes in the minds of the decision-makers , then we ca n't solve the problem . i believe that the public broadcasters bear a special responsibility towards promoting integration of immigrants .
we 're all financed by licensing fees , the public networks need to all take a stand on the issue . when do you think we 'll see a black presenter or a turkish-german anchor on " tagesschau " ?
-lrb- germany 's most popular news program -rrb- that wo n't take too long .
i hope that this healthy competition among the networks on the issue will soon generate a new face for the program . sonia phalnikar interviewed gualtiero zambonini send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new face on german tv highlights dearth of minority presenters the choice of a minority presenter for the main news show on a major network is almost revolutionary in germany .

gates , who was speaking after a meeting in berlin with german defense minister franz josef jung and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , said he would return to russia soon to continue discussions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gates -lrb- l -rrb- with german foreign minister steinmeier he said the us had offered to work closely with moscow and negotiate limits that would ensure the shield would not pose a threat to russia 's nuclear deterence .
" we will continue to consult with russia on missile defence as well as with our allies , " gates said .
" we 've made some very far-reaching proposals . "
" there is some debate in moscow about this dialogue , " he added .
attempts to alleviate russia 's concerns however , addressing a press conference in berlin with gates , jung said the aim was a " total concept " on missile defense and that the russian objections were " unjustified . "
the missile shield was intended as a " defensive function for the population , " jung said , adding that it was aimed at countering a threat that could be 10 years away .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gates with defense minister franz josef jung jung also said earlier in an interview with the daily sächsische zeitung published wednesday that he was confident the united states could alleviate russia 's concerns .
russia can be convinced of the necessity of the missile defense system " by explaining to them that there is a shared interest in security against missiles - for example from rogue states , " jung said .
german chancellor angela merkel has urged washington to engage russia on its concerns about us plans to deploy 10 interceptor missiles in poland and a radar in the czech republic by 2012 .
the four-billion-dollar project is aimed at countering a potential missile threat from iran , not russia .
scepticism about plan but the plan has antagonized moscow , which sees it as a further military encroachment in its former sphere of influence , and has aroused misgivings among some european allies .
on tuesday in warsaw , gates said he did not believe that russia was a military threat to poland " either now or -lrb- in the event that -rrb- we should install a missile defense . "
" the world changes in dramatic ways , and what we are talking about here is indivisible security for the united states and for our nato allies , " he said .
" we would like to extend that umbrella to russia , and partner with russia and have russia be with us in this program , " he said .
poland 's willingness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are many critics but also supporters of the plan poland 's conservative government , led by the president 's twin brother , prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , has signaled its willingness to host the base , but formal negotiations between washington and warsaw have not yet begun .
gates , who started the trip monday in moscow , has invited the russians to inspect a us missile defense interceptor site in fort greely , alaska and a radar in california to clear up what he said was russian misunderstanding about the capability of the system being proposed for europe .
" in terms of assurances that the system would not be changed years from now in a way that might be more threatening to the russian deterrent , it seems to me that it is a matter that can be negotiated , " he said .
gates provided no details and it was unclear whether the scope of such negotiations would involve the broader us missile defense system , or only the proposed european component . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu-russia mistrust nears cold war level , eu commissioner says mistrust and a lack of respect in the relations between the european union and russia are at their lowest level since the fall of communism , according to eu trade commissioner peter mandelson .

wisniewski was not charged in the slaying of harm 's predecessor , siegfried buback .
his murder was one of a series of raf assassinations that rocked former west germany in what later became known as " the german autumn . "
but in an interview with the newsmagazine der spiegel this week , another former terrorist , peter-jürgen boock , said wisniewski was probably the motorcycle gunman who fired the fatal shots that killed buback and two companions in april 1977 .
three other members of the raf , also known as the baader-meinhof gang , were convicted of the buback killing , but it never became clear who pulled the trigger .
maintained silence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chief federal prosecutor monika harms is reopening the case one of those convicted in the murder , christian klar , remains in prison and has applied for a presidential pardon .
brigitte mohnhaupt , found guilty as an accomplice , was released last month after serving 24 years .
knut folkerts , who was released from prison in 1995 , was the third man convicted , but two other former terrorists told der spiegel they did not believe he was involved in the murder .
all three convicted of the buback killing have remained silent .
buback 's son , michael , said last week that he might support klar 's clemency appeal after receiving new information which suggested that he had n't carried out the killing .
the 1977 assassination of buback was intended to free imprisoned raf members , including its co-founder , andreas baader .
the raf , which disbanded in 1998 , is suspected of killing 34 people between 1972 and 1991 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 25.04.2007 " an important signal to immigrants " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gualtiero zambonini said tv networks need to do more to hire immigrant journalists dw-world.de spoke with the commissioner for integration at german broadcaster wdr about the need for tv networks to recruit more journalists and presenters from immigrant minorities . gualtiero zambonini has been the commissioner for integration at the cologne-based german public broadcaster , wdr , since 2003 . dw-world.de : the zdf public network will have a new german-iraqi presenter for their main news show starting end of april .
some media experts have called the appointment of a minority anchorwoman " revolutionary . "
do you see it that way too ? gualtiero zambonini : i would n't call it revolutionary , but it 's definitely an important signal in the right direction .
at wdr , we 've had asli sevindim , a turkish-german journalist , as the main anchorwoman of our evening prime-time news show for over a year now .
another of our turkish-german editors , birand bingül , belongs to the team of commentators on the prime-time news show on the ard network . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-iraqi journalist dunja hayali is the new face of german tv network zdf so , in a way zdf is following us .
but that 's also important because it 's a sign that the public broadcasters in germany have realized the necessity of reflecting this development in society both in their programs as well as in the profiles of their presenters . there are still very few minority presenters on the german networks .
why is that the case ? at wdr , we 've been developing measures for the past four years at least to try and get immigrant journalists on mainstream programs .
but in reality , we are only at the beginning of the road .
nobody should be under the illusion that just because we have a presenter of iraqi origin on zdf or an anchorwoman with a turkish background on wdr , we 've taken care of the problem .
these examples are important for two reasons .
firstly , because they show how seriously we want to promote the issue .
and secondly , because these role models are a sign to potential journalists who perhaps have n't trusted themselves up to now or did n't think that presenting a prime-time news show on major networks could be something for a person with an iraqi or an italian name .
it provides encouragement for more immigrants to pursue journalism careers . in the past , these signs were missing as was a hiring policy among media companies that consciously looked for minority journalists and signaled " we want more of them . "
that 's part of the problem why there are such few minority journalists in newsrooms and in front of cameras and microphones .
we simply realized the problem too late in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's immigrants do n't usually have the chance to study journalism the other part of the problem is that it 's only now in the second and third generation of immigrants that talent and potential is coming to the fore in the german media market .
these are children from immigrant families who grew up here and went to school and university .
this is a development that took place much earlier in countries such as britain or the netherlands partly because some of these nations have a history of immigration different from germany 's . how does germany compare with other countries in europe when it comes to integrating its immigrants into television ? we can definitely learn from good examples in europe , for instance from countries such as sweden or the netherlands where there are integration policies at the broadcasters and corresponding laws .
in the netherlands for example , minorities are entitled to have a certain share of programming in the media and there are laws governing it .
that obviously creates a whole new basis for the question about which journalists the networks hire . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british tv comes closer to reflecting social reality at the same time , that does n't mean there are no problems in these countries .
in the netherlands , there are still too many programs that are white - that means there are too many white dutch faces and not enough immigrants .
in britain , the situation is slightly different .
for instance , bbc international is a wonderful example of journalistic diversity , but that 's not the case in all bbc programs .
my colleagues at bbc say , ' it 's good that we 've achieved some goals , but we 're still far removed from truly representing society in the media . ' we can learn from the french too , who are redoubling efforts to tackle the problem of a lack of minority journalists .
but we 're generally lagging behind in europe .
the important thing is that we 've all recognized the problem . what else needs to be done at the networks for there to be a real change ? a rethink is already taking place among the top managers at the broadcasters as a result of pressure from politicians , societal developments as well as pressure from european policies which have placed integration of minorities high on the agenda .
one has to say that is not just a question of values and good sense but also a question of the market .
we have to take demographic developments into account .
today every fifth person in germany has an immigrant background .
among the younger generations in big cities , it 's every second person .
that means that viewers too have changed and this viewer ship lives in a culture of diversity .
if we do n't take these viewers into account , then we lose the right to exist .
it really is a question of our existence . but to really make progress on the issue , there has to be a change in the media company culture as well as in the way funds are managed .
in addition , the issue has to be anchored in the guiding principles of the broadcasters and supported with further training programs for employees as well as managers .
if nothing changes in the minds of the decision-makers , then we ca n't solve the problem . i believe that the public broadcasters bear a special responsibility towards promoting integration of immigrants .
we 're all financed by licensing fees , the public networks need to all take a stand on the issue . when do you think we 'll see a black presenter or a turkish-german anchor on " tagesschau " ?
-lrb- germany 's most popular news program -rrb- that wo n't take too long .
i hope that this healthy competition among the networks on the issue will soon generate a new face for the program . sonia phalnikar interviewed gualtiero zambonini send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new face on german tv highlights dearth of minority presenters the choice of a minority presenter for the main news show on a major network is almost revolutionary in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 25.04.2007 " an important signal to immigrants " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gualtiero zambonini said tv networks need to do more to hire immigrant journalists dw-world.de spoke with the commissioner for integration at german broadcaster wdr about the need for tv networks to recruit more journalists and presenters from immigrant minorities . gualtiero zambonini has been the commissioner for integration at the cologne-based german public broadcaster , wdr , since 2003 . dw-world.de : the zdf public network will have a new german-iraqi presenter for their main news show starting end of april .
some media experts have called the appointment of a minority anchorwoman " revolutionary . "
do you see it that way too ? gualtiero zambonini : i would n't call it revolutionary , but it 's definitely an important signal in the right direction .
at wdr , we 've had asli sevindim , a turkish-german journalist , as the main anchorwoman of our evening prime-time news show for over a year now .
another of our turkish-german editors , birand bingül , belongs to the team of commentators on the prime-time news show on the ard network . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-iraqi journalist dunja hayali is the new face of german tv network zdf so , in a way zdf is following us .
but that 's also important because it 's a sign that the public broadcasters in germany have realized the necessity of reflecting this development in society both in their programs as well as in the profiles of their presenters . there are still very few minority presenters on the german networks .
why is that the case ? at wdr , we 've been developing measures for the past four years at least to try and get immigrant journalists on mainstream programs .
but in reality , we are only at the beginning of the road .
nobody should be under the illusion that just because we have a presenter of iraqi origin on zdf or an anchorwoman with a turkish background on wdr , we 've taken care of the problem .
these examples are important for two reasons .
firstly , because they show how seriously we want to promote the issue .
and secondly , because these role models are a sign to potential journalists who perhaps have n't trusted themselves up to now or did n't think that presenting a prime-time news show on major networks could be something for a person with an iraqi or an italian name .
it provides encouragement for more immigrants to pursue journalism careers . in the past , these signs were missing as was a hiring policy among media companies that consciously looked for minority journalists and signaled " we want more of them . "
that 's part of the problem why there are such few minority journalists in newsrooms and in front of cameras and microphones .
we simply realized the problem too late in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's immigrants do n't usually have the chance to study journalism the other part of the problem is that it 's only now in the second and third generation of immigrants that talent and potential is coming to the fore in the german media market .
these are children from immigrant families who grew up here and went to school and university .
this is a development that took place much earlier in countries such as britain or the netherlands partly because some of these nations have a history of immigration different from germany 's . how does germany compare with other countries in europe when it comes to integrating its immigrants into television ? we can definitely learn from good examples in europe , for instance from countries such as sweden or the netherlands where there are integration policies at the broadcasters and corresponding laws .
in the netherlands for example , minorities are entitled to have a certain share of programming in the media and there are laws governing it .
that obviously creates a whole new basis for the question about which journalists the networks hire . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british tv comes closer to reflecting social reality at the same time , that does n't mean there are no problems in these countries .
in the netherlands , there are still too many programs that are white - that means there are too many white dutch faces and not enough immigrants .
in britain , the situation is slightly different .
for instance , bbc international is a wonderful example of journalistic diversity , but that 's not the case in all bbc programs .
my colleagues at bbc say , ' it 's good that we 've achieved some goals , but we 're still far removed from truly representing society in the media . ' we can learn from the french too , who are redoubling efforts to tackle the problem of a lack of minority journalists .
but we 're generally lagging behind in europe .
the important thing is that we 've all recognized the problem . what else needs to be done at the networks for there to be a real change ? a rethink is already taking place among the top managers at the broadcasters as a result of pressure from politicians , societal developments as well as pressure from european policies which have placed integration of minorities high on the agenda .
one has to say that is not just a question of values and good sense but also a question of the market .
we have to take demographic developments into account .
today every fifth person in germany has an immigrant background .
among the younger generations in big cities , it 's every second person .
that means that viewers too have changed and this viewer ship lives in a culture of diversity .
if we do n't take these viewers into account , then we lose the right to exist .
it really is a question of our existence . but to really make progress on the issue , there has to be a change in the media company culture as well as in the way funds are managed .
in addition , the issue has to be anchored in the guiding principles of the broadcasters and supported with further training programs for employees as well as managers .
if nothing changes in the minds of the decision-makers , then we ca n't solve the problem . i believe that the public broadcasters bear a special responsibility towards promoting integration of immigrants .
we 're all financed by licensing fees , the public networks need to all take a stand on the issue . when do you think we 'll see a black presenter or a turkish-german anchor on " tagesschau " ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 25.04.2007 " an important signal to immigrants " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gualtiero zambonini said tv networks need to do more to hire immigrant journalists dw-world.de spoke with the commissioner for integration at german broadcaster wdr about the need for tv networks to recruit more journalists and presenters from immigrant minorities . gualtiero zambonini has been the commissioner for integration at the cologne-based german public broadcaster , wdr , since 2003 . dw-world.de : the zdf public network will have a new german-iraqi presenter for their main news show starting end of april .
some media experts have called the appointment of a minority anchorwoman " revolutionary . "
do you see it that way too ? gualtiero zambonini : i would n't call it revolutionary , but it 's definitely an important signal in the right direction .
at wdr , we 've had asli sevindim , a turkish-german journalist , as the main anchorwoman of our evening prime-time news show for over a year now .
another of our turkish-german editors , birand bingül , belongs to the team of commentators on the prime-time news show on the ard network . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german-iraqi journalist dunja hayali is the new face of german tv network zdf so , in a way zdf is following us .
but that 's also important because it 's a sign that the public broadcasters in germany have realized the necessity of reflecting this development in society both in their programs as well as in the profiles of their presenters . there are still very few minority presenters on the german networks .
why is that the case ? at wdr , we 've been developing measures for the past four years at least to try and get immigrant journalists on mainstream programs .
but in reality , we are only at the beginning of the road .
nobody should be under the illusion that just because we have a presenter of iraqi origin on zdf or an anchorwoman with a turkish background on wdr , we 've taken care of the problem .
these examples are important for two reasons .
firstly , because they show how seriously we want to promote the issue .
and secondly , because these role models are a sign to potential journalists who perhaps have n't trusted themselves up to now or did n't think that presenting a prime-time news show on major networks could be something for a person with an iraqi or an italian name .
it provides encouragement for more immigrants to pursue journalism careers . in the past , these signs were missing as was a hiring policy among media companies that consciously looked for minority journalists and signaled " we want more of them . "
that 's part of the problem why there are such few minority journalists in newsrooms and in front of cameras and microphones .
we simply realized the problem too late in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's immigrants do n't usually have the chance to study journalism the other part of the problem is that it 's only now in the second and third generation of immigrants that talent and potential is coming to the fore in the german media market .
these are children from immigrant families who grew up here and went to school and university .
this is a development that took place much earlier in countries such as britain or the netherlands partly because some of these nations have a history of immigration different from germany 's . how does germany compare with other countries in europe when it comes to integrating its immigrants into television ? we can definitely learn from good examples in europe , for instance from countries such as sweden or the netherlands where there are integration policies at the broadcasters and corresponding laws .
in the netherlands for example , minorities are entitled to have a certain share of programming in the media and there are laws governing it .
that obviously creates a whole new basis for the question about which journalists the networks hire . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british tv comes closer to reflecting social reality at the same time , that does n't mean there are no problems in these countries .
in the netherlands , there are still too many programs that are white - that means there are too many white dutch faces and not enough immigrants .

but they 're not willing to put up with the ill treatment any longer . then again , maybe it 's less the animals and more the people outside the german capital who are vying for the limelight in the cute animal arena .
it 's not really a stretch anyway for the citizens of cologne , who have a penchant for thinking themselves the center of the universe .
so , true to form , they 've started a major campaign to name their city 's latest animal addition : a baby elephant that glimpsed the world last week .
its release from the womb has unleashed a provincial media frenzy in the rhine river city .
bildunterschrift : is that a taunt we detect peeking out of knut 's mouth ?
since the animal 's birth , the city 's tabloid kölner express has been urging readers to send in their name suggestions for the baby boy born to mother tong koon on april 16 .
submissions have ranged from " somo , " to " marlon , " " pano " and " benjathong . "
" an asian ring to it " topping the list , however , -lrb- and my personal favorite -rrb- was " bendetto " - the nickname given to pope benedict xvi when he took up his post two years ago .
express readers thought it appropriate that pope and elephant partake in a mutual term of endearment since they share the same birthday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coverboy knut but cologne 's ego-centrism has won out .
the " mini-phant " -lrb- as the city 's express readers had dubbed their little darling for the short term -rrb- is due to be christened " ming jung " on wednesday , april 25 .
after a series of intense jury deliberations about the trunkster 's alias , cologne zoo director theo pagel said the " ming jung " suggestion was perfect .
" it sounds like the cologne dialect and has an asian ring to it at the same time , " he said .
he added that its melodious sound rolled off the tongue quite well .
" ming jung , " one might add , is the cologne dialect expression for mein junge , or " my boy . "
only the people of cologne could detect the symmetries between their city and the orient .
breeding zoo for asian elephants bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marlar , just one year ago then again , ming jung 's mother tong koon immigrated with four other elephants to the cologne zoo just last september , so we 'll cut ' em a little slack .
meanwhile , the other stellar-phant marlar has just celebrated her first birthday at the zoo .
" marlar is a bit dazed and confused about her new little playmate , ming jung , " said zookeeper werner naß .
if the births of the baby-phants keep going -lrb- another one is expected at the end of may -rrb- , knut may just get a run for his money after all .
as cologne zoo director pagel said : " who 's knut , anyway ? " louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de knut must die , says crazed killer cuddly knut the polar bear has bounced back into the headlines - but this time , the news wo n't warm your heart .

the four-billion-dollar project is aimed at countering a potential missile threat from iran , not russia .

iran denies us and eu charges that it is trying to build nuclear weapons .
larijani told reporters that the talks with solana aimed to evaluate " new ideas " that might be put on the table , the anatolia news agency said .
but solana 's spokesperson cristina gallach said there were " no changes in the position of the international community " and added that the priority was simply to " create conditions for the beginning of negotiations . "
diplomats said there was little hope of a breakthrough given iran 's steadfast refusal to freeze its enrichment work .
an ongoing crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is unlikely that larijani and solana will reach a breakthrough solana will travel on thursday to oslo , where he will brief eu foreign ministers on his meeting with larijani .
iran is defying two un security council resolutions to halt enrichment , saying its program is a legitimate effort to generate civilian nuclear power .
the council has imposed limited sanctions as punishment .
diplomats told afp that while everyone was trying to find a formula to start talks , the two sides remain far apart on a crisis that began in 2002 when it was revealed that iran was secretly building nuclear facilities .
the united states , europe , russia and china are ready in a compromise gesture to give iran a chance to edge its way slowly into stopping uranium enrichment , diplomats said .
the six world powers - britain , china , france , germany , russia and the united states - had last june offered economic , technical and security benefits if iran would agree to the suspension .
but iran pressed ahead and negotiations never started .
several rounds of talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has imposed sanctions on iran because of its nuclear activities larijani and solana held several rounds of talks that failed to find a way to start meetings with the six powers .
the two envoys last met face-to-face on the sidelines of a munich security conference on feb 11 .
larijani said on wednesday that progress had been blocked when " some unacceptable , irrational conditions were put forward " - a clear reference to the demands that iran suspend enrichment .
" if a solution can be found , it will cost the price of suspension , " a european diplomat said .
a second diplomat said one idea would be for iran to declare a moratorium on moving beyond activities it has already started , such as installing and running some 1,300 centrifuge machines as it seeks to upgrade from current research levels of enrichment to industrial production .
the moratorium could open the way for further talks with solana , with the un security council holding off on further sanctions against the islamic republic .
iran 's proposals involve it keeping at least a reduced level of enrichment work , diplomats said .
suspension or dismantling ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad vowed to push forward with efforts to enrich uranium non-proliferation expert gary samore told afp by telephone from washington that tehran wants the eu to agree to setting up an international consortium in iran for uranium enrichment .
but the major powers want such a consortium , which would process fuel for iran , to be set up outside the islamic republic .
a western diplomat said talks with the five permanent security council members plus germany would not in any case start before iran suspends enrichment .
" suspension does not mean dismantling what they have built , " the diplomat said , adding that the major powers were primarily interested in stopping the centrifuges from spinning in the refining of the u-235 isotope that makes for enriched uranium as well as keeping the iranians from learning how to run centrifuges .
iran faces a new security council deadline in one month , after which more sanctions could be imposed .
the united states has not ruled out a military attack to bring iran to heel . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran 's release of sailors gives hope in nuclear negotiations iran 's release of the captured british sailors hints at a more pragmatic , less radical approach towards the west , say analysts .

" we have estimated that the mean temperature of this super-earth lies between 0 and 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 32 and 104 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , and water would thus be liquid , " said stephane udry of the geneva observatory .
" models predict that the planet should be either rocky like our earth or covered with oceans . "
the planet is located around a star known as the gliese 581 , about 20.5 light years from the earth 's solar system and one of the 100 closest stars to the sun .
ideal habitat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : light on the plant could be similar to a sunset on earth , scientists say though the planet is much closer to its star than the earth is to the sun , conditions are similar because the gliese 581 , known as a red dwarf , is smaller and colder .
one year lasts only 13 days on the planet .
" red dwarfs are ideal targets for the search for such planets because they emit less light , and the habitable zone is thus much closer to them than it is around the sun , " said xavier bonfils of lisbon university .
more than 200 so-called exoplanets - planets outside of the sun 's solar system - have been discovered in the passed 12 years since the first one was found .
most are massive bowls of gas similar to jupiter .
universal treasure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the planet resemble earth one day ?
the same team of astronauts discovered a another planet around the same red dwarf two years ago - a neptune-sized planet about 15 times as massive as earth .
an extensive analysis of the latest find is to be revealed in the journal astronomy & astrophysics .
xavier delfosse of grenoble university in france said the newfound planet could inhabit life and will definitely be a target of future space missions to find extra-terrestrial beings .
" liquid water is critical to life as we know it , " he said .
" on the treasure map of the universe , one would be tempted to mark this planet with an x.

ben brown , bbc moscow correspondent 1991-95 strangely , the only time i properly met boris yeltsin - apart from chaotic " doorstep " interviews - was outside the toilet of one of moscow 's rather grotty domestic airports .
it was when he was first campaigning to be president of russia , criss-crossing the country , and i was struck , in equal measure , by his charm , charisma and boundless energy .
like reagan or thatcher , you felt he had the sheer force of personality to take history by the scruff of the neck and change it .
maybe he was n't a profound thinker , but he spoke slowly , clearly and with utter certainty .
at first i admired him as a democrat and a reformer , but like many russians , my opinions of him gradually changed : year after year , day after day , i saw at first hand the misery of people plunged into poverty by his " shock therapy " economic reforms , and the wasteland of chechnya - the catastrophic war he launched .
still , if lenin was the midwife of the soviet union , yeltsin was the midwife of the new , democratic russia .
love him or loathe him , he 's one of the giant figures of the 20th century .
kevin connolly , bbc moscow correspondent 1989-94 when statesmen die , journalists write stories about how they met them , or knew them , or at least interviewed them , stretching moments of perfunctory connection into thousands of words of personal reminiscence .
but boris yeltsin of course , was no ordinary politician and so this is the story of how i did n't meet him .
mr yeltsin was in novokuznetsk in western siberia in the spring of 1991 , campaigning for the presidency of russia , which was then still merely part of a soviet union run by mikhail gorbachev .
many of the themes which came to define the yeltsin years were there to be seen in novokuznetsk .
there was the chaos he inherited .
there was no internal trade in the soviet union and provincial cities relied on deliveries of cash from moscow .
in the chaotic last months of communism , novokuznetsk had received no deliveries for months and had been reduced to barter .
there was the hope he inspired .
russian voters were n't used to voting , and they were n't used to politicians clambering onto platforms and talking to them in straightforward language .
and there was the vodka .
candidate yeltsin got through his speech , more or less , but after an epic evening 's drinking he slept through his appointments for the following morning , including one with me .
pressed for an explanation , a member of his entourage performed a lurching , staggering head-rolling mime of intoxication .
this was years before mr yeltsin 's thirst became standard fare for the world 's cartoonists .
within two months , though , as russia hung for three days suspended between the uncertainties of future democracy and horrors of a return to the totalitarian past , yeltsin was clambering onto a tank outside the white house to address the crowds , just as he 'd addressed his rally in novokuznetsk .
the populist skills he 'd honed were the saving of his country .
the weaknesses may have been there all along - so too was the touch of greatness .
steve rosenberg , producer / correspondent 1991-2006 there 's one russian word which boris yeltsin made his own - a word , in fact , which i never heard anyone else in russia using : " zagagoolinka " .
it roughly translates as " zigzag " or " surprise move " .
yeltsin became famous for his " zigzags " - in politics , in the economy , as well as in his own behaviour .
from russia 's first president you could always expect the unexpected : a sudden change of personnel , an unexpected new policy ; sometimes , due to ill health , he 'd disappear from view without warning for weeks on end .
i remember several occasions in the 1990s when rumours spread that he 'd actually died .
but he always seemed to bounce back .
for me , yeltsin 's most memorable " zigzag " was the surprise sacking of his government in 1998 .
i was a bbc producer in moscow at the time - it was early on monday morning , there were no reporters in the office , so i had to step forward to make my first ever report .
bridget kendall , moscow correspondent 1989-1994 i remember my first close-up glimpse of boris yeltsin .
i was hanging around in the break between sessions at the soviet parliament in moscow in 1989 .
i found myself standing next to him .
he was tall and upright , in a well-cut blue suit .
when i introduced myself , he courteously but abruptly shook my hand , and turned on his heel .
i assumed he thought talking to a foreign correspondent was beneath his dignity .
but i saw him again a few weeks ' later , again standing silently and somewhat awkwardly , and i realised he simply felt ill at ease and quite possibly shy .
fast forward to boris yeltsin as president , already in office several years in the mid-1990s .
again i am hanging around - this time waiting for a presidential press conference after a summit of leaders from former soviet republics .
the doors swing open and we are invited into a grand room dominated by a vast circular table , from where president yeltsin , red-faced and puffing slightly , summons us over and , slurring , starts to make a joke .
it becomes painfully obvious that he is seriously tipsy .
indeed he is still clutching a glass of champagne which slops bubbles on the table cloth .
kremlin officials hover anxiously .
the other leaders , many of them frowning in irritation and embarrassment , try not to catch anyone 's eye .
i wonder what matters of state they can have possibly discussed .
two memories of the same man , some five or six years apart .
it is hard to grasp this was the same person .
as one russian said to me , perhaps boris yeltsin 's biggest mistake was to stay in power as long as he did .
james rodgers , moscow correspondent for periods 1991-2007 boris yeltsin was the reason i first went to work in russia .
it was june 1991 .
he was running for election as the president of what was then called the russian soviet federative socialist republic .
by the end of the year , the soviet union had ceased to exist .
boris yeltsin had played a huge role in its demise .
my first assignment to russia had given me a front row seat at one of the major events of the 20th century .
three years later , i met boris yeltsin face to face .
he was on his way into the bolshoi theatre .
he was already dogged by rumours of hard drinking .
but that evening , he seemed full of energy as he wandered over to chat to the media .
his bodyguards moved around him nervously , as if wondering where he would decide to go next .
i will always associate boris yeltsin with my grimmest ever job as a journalist too .
in the spring of 1995 , i stood in a field in chechnya .
lines of civilian corpses , some charred by flames , lay awaiting burial .
this was the result of the kremlin 's heavy-handed response to the breakaway region 's bid for independence .

this was years before mr yeltsin 's thirst became standard fare for the world 's cartoonists .
within two months , though , as russia hung for three days suspended between the uncertainties of future democracy and horrors of a return to the totalitarian past , yeltsin was clambering onto a tank outside the white house to address the crowds , just as he 'd addressed his rally in novokuznetsk .

from russia 's first president you could always expect the unexpected : a sudden change of personnel , an unexpected new policy ; sometimes , due to ill health , he 'd disappear from view without warning for weeks on end .
i remember several occasions in the 1990s when rumours spread that he 'd actually died .
but he always seemed to bounce back .
for me , yeltsin 's most memorable " zigzag " was the surprise sacking of his government in 1998 .
i was a bbc producer in moscow at the time - it was early on monday morning , there were no reporters in the office , so i had to step forward to make my first ever report .
bridget kendall , moscow correspondent 1989-1994 i remember my first close-up glimpse of boris yeltsin .
i was hanging around in the break between sessions at the soviet parliament in moscow in 1989 .
i found myself standing next to him .
he was tall and upright , in a well-cut blue suit .
when i introduced myself , he courteously but abruptly shook my hand , and turned on his heel .
i assumed he thought talking to a foreign correspondent was beneath his dignity .
but i saw him again a few weeks ' later , again standing silently and somewhat awkwardly , and i realised he simply felt ill at ease and quite possibly shy .
fast forward to boris yeltsin as president , already in office several years in the mid-1990s .
again i am hanging around - this time waiting for a presidential press conference after a summit of leaders from former soviet republics .
the doors swing open and we are invited into a grand room dominated by a vast circular table , from where president yeltsin , red-faced and puffing slightly , summons us over and , slurring , starts to make a joke .
it becomes painfully obvious that he is seriously tipsy .
indeed he is still clutching a glass of champagne which slops bubbles on the table cloth .
kremlin officials hover anxiously .
the other leaders , many of them frowning in irritation and embarrassment , try not to catch anyone 's eye .
i wonder what matters of state they can have possibly discussed .
two memories of the same man , some five or six years apart .
it is hard to grasp this was the same person .
as one russian said to me , perhaps boris yeltsin 's biggest mistake was to stay in power as long as he did .
james rodgers , moscow correspondent for periods 1991-2007 boris yeltsin was the reason i first went to work in russia .
it was june 1991 .
he was running for election as the president of what was then called the russian soviet federative socialist republic .
by the end of the year , the soviet union had ceased to exist .
boris yeltsin had played a huge role in its demise .
my first assignment to russia had given me a front row seat at one of the major events of the 20th century .
three years later , i met boris yeltsin face to face .
he was on his way into the bolshoi theatre .
he was already dogged by rumours of hard drinking .
but that evening , he seemed full of energy as he wandered over to chat to the media .
his bodyguards moved around him nervously , as if wondering where he would decide to go next .
i will always associate boris yeltsin with my grimmest ever job as a journalist too .
in the spring of 1995 , i stood in a field in chechnya .
lines of civilian corpses , some charred by flames , lay awaiting burial .
this was the result of the kremlin 's heavy-handed response to the breakaway region 's bid for independence .

ben brown , bbc moscow correspondent 1991-95 strangely , the only time i properly met boris yeltsin - apart from chaotic " doorstep " interviews - was outside the toilet of one of moscow 's rather grotty domestic airports .
it was when he was first campaigning to be president of russia , criss-crossing the country , and i was struck , in equal measure , by his charm , charisma and boundless energy .
like other memorable figures , yeltsin had great force of personality like reagan or thatcher , you felt he had the sheer force of personality to take history by the scruff of the neck and change it .
maybe he was n't a profound thinker , but he spoke slowly , clearly and with utter certainty .
at first i admired him as a democrat and a reformer , but like many russians , my opinions of him gradually changed : year after year , day after day , i saw at first hand the misery of people plunged into poverty by his " shock therapy " economic reforms , and the wasteland of chechnya - the catastrophic war he launched .
still , if lenin was the midwife of the soviet union , yeltsin was the midwife of the new , democratic russia .
love him or loathe him , he 's one of the giant figures of the 20th century .
kevin connolly , bbc moscow correspondent 1989-94 when statesmen die , journalists write stories about how they met them , or knew them , or at least interviewed them , stretching moments of perfunctory connection into thousands of words of personal reminiscence .
but boris yeltsin of course , was no ordinary politician and so this is the story of how i did n't meet him .
mr yeltsin was in novokuznetsk in western siberia in the spring of 1991 , campaigning for the presidency of russia , which was then still merely part of a soviet union run by mikhail gorbachev .
many of the themes which came to define the yeltsin years were there to be seen in novokuznetsk .
there was the chaos he inherited .
there was no internal trade in the soviet union and provincial cities relied on deliveries of cash from moscow .
in the chaotic last months of communism , novokuznetsk had received no deliveries for months and had been reduced to barter .
there was the hope he inspired .
russian voters were n't used to voting , and they were n't used to politicians clambering onto platforms and talking to them in straightforward language .
and there was the vodka .
candidate yeltsin got through his speech , more or less , but after an epic evening 's drinking he slept through his appointments for the following morning , including one with me .
pressed for an explanation , a member of his entourage performed a lurching , staggering head-rolling mime of intoxication .
this was years before mr yeltsin 's thirst became standard fare for the world 's cartoonists .
within two months , though , as russia hung for three days suspended between the uncertainties of future democracy and horrors of a return to the totalitarian past , yeltsin was clambering onto a tank outside the white house to address the crowds , just as he 'd addressed his rally in novokuznetsk .
the populist skills he 'd honed were the saving of his country .
the weaknesses may have been there all along - so too was the touch of greatness .
steve rosenberg , producer / correspondent 1991-2006 there 's one russian word which boris yeltsin made his own - a word , in fact , which i never heard anyone else in russia using : " zagagoolinka " .
it roughly translates as " zigzag " or " surprise move " .
yeltsin 's popular touch headed off the communist backlash yeltsin became famous for his " zigzags " - in politics , in the economy , as well as in his own behaviour .

ben brown , bbc moscow correspondent 1991-95 strangely , the only time i properly met boris yeltsin - apart from chaotic " doorstep " interviews - was outside the toilet of one of moscow 's rather grotty domestic airports .
it was when he was first campaigning to be president of russia , criss-crossing the country , and i was struck , in equal measure , by his charm , charisma and boundless energy .
like other memorable figures , yeltsin had great force of personality like reagan or thatcher , you felt he had the sheer force of personality to take history by the scruff of the neck and change it .
maybe he was n't a profound thinker , but he spoke slowly , clearly and with utter certainty .
at first i admired him as a democrat and a reformer , but like many russians , my opinions of him gradually changed : year after year , day after day , i saw at first hand the misery of people plunged into poverty by his " shock therapy " economic reforms , and the wasteland of chechnya - the catastrophic war he launched .
still , if lenin was the midwife of the soviet union , yeltsin was the midwife of the new , democratic russia .
love him or loathe him , he 's one of the giant figures of the 20th century .
kevin connolly , bbc moscow correspondent 1989-94 when statesmen die , journalists write stories about how they met them , or knew them , or at least interviewed them , stretching moments of perfunctory connection into thousands of words of personal reminiscence .
but boris yeltsin of course , was no ordinary politician and so this is the story of how i did n't meet him .
mr yeltsin was in novokuznetsk in western siberia in the spring of 1991 , campaigning for the presidency of russia , which was then still merely part of a soviet union run by mikhail gorbachev .
many of the themes which came to define the yeltsin years were there to be seen in novokuznetsk .
there was the chaos he inherited .
there was no internal trade in the soviet union and provincial cities relied on deliveries of cash from moscow .
in the chaotic last months of communism , novokuznetsk had received no deliveries for months and had been reduced to barter .
there was the hope he inspired .
russian voters were n't used to voting , and they were n't used to politicians clambering onto platforms and talking to them in straightforward language .
and there was the vodka .
candidate yeltsin got through his speech , more or less , but after an epic evening 's drinking he slept through his appointments for the following morning , including one with me .
pressed for an explanation , a member of his entourage performed a lurching , staggering head-rolling mime of intoxication .
this was years before mr yeltsin 's thirst became standard fare for the world 's cartoonists .
within two months , though , as russia hung for three days suspended between the uncertainties of future democracy and horrors of a return to the totalitarian past , yeltsin was clambering onto a tank outside the white house to address the crowds , just as he 'd addressed his rally in novokuznetsk .
the populist skills he 'd honed were the saving of his country .
the weaknesses may have been there all along - so too was the touch of greatness .
steve rosenberg , producer / correspondent 1991-2006 there 's one russian word which boris yeltsin made his own - a word , in fact , which i never heard anyone else in russia using : " zagagoolinka " .
it roughly translates as " zigzag " or " surprise move " .
yeltsin 's popular touch headed off the communist backlash yeltsin became famous for his " zigzags " - in politics , in the economy , as well as in his own behaviour .
from russia 's first president you could always expect the unexpected : a sudden change of personnel , an unexpected new policy ; sometimes , due to ill health , he 'd disappear from view without warning for weeks on end .
i remember several occasions in the 1990s when rumours spread that he 'd actually died .
but he always seemed to bounce back .
for me , yeltsin 's most memorable " zigzag " was the surprise sacking of his government in 1998 .
i was a bbc producer in moscow at the time - it was early on monday morning , there were no reporters in the office , so i had to step forward to make my first ever report .
bridget kendall , moscow correspondent 1989-1994 i remember my first close-up glimpse of boris yeltsin .
i was hanging around in the break between sessions at the soviet parliament in moscow in 1989 .
i found myself standing next to him .
he was tall and upright , in a well-cut blue suit .
when i introduced myself , he courteously but abruptly shook my hand , and turned on his heel .
i assumed he thought talking to a foreign correspondent was beneath his dignity .
but i saw him again a few weeks ' later , again standing silently and somewhat awkwardly , and i realised he simply felt ill at ease and quite possibly shy .
fast forward to boris yeltsin as president , already in office several years in the mid-1990s .
again i am hanging around - this time waiting for a presidential press conference after a summit of leaders from former soviet republics .
the doors swing open and we are invited into a grand room dominated by a vast circular table , from where president yeltsin , red-faced and puffing slightly , summons us over and , slurring , starts to make a joke .
it becomes painfully obvious that he is seriously tipsy .
indeed he is still clutching a glass of champagne which slops bubbles on the table cloth .
kremlin officials hover anxiously .
the other leaders , many of them frowning in irritation and embarrassment , try not to catch anyone 's eye .
i wonder what matters of state they can have possibly discussed .
two memories of the same man , some five or six years apart .
it is hard to grasp this was the same person .
as one russian said to me , perhaps boris yeltsin 's biggest mistake was to stay in power as long as he did .
james rodgers , moscow correspondent for periods 1991-2007 boris yeltsin was the reason i first went to work in russia .
it was june 1991 .
he was running for election as the president of what was then called the russian soviet federative socialist republic .
by the end of the year , the soviet union had ceased to exist .
boris yeltsin had played a huge role in its demise .
my first assignment to russia had given me a front row seat at one of the major events of the 20th century .
three years later , i met boris yeltsin face to face .
he was on his way into the bolshoi theatre .
he was already dogged by rumours of hard drinking .
but that evening , he seemed full of energy as he wandered over to chat to the media .
his bodyguards moved around him nervously , as if wondering where he would decide to go next .
i will always associate boris yeltsin with my grimmest ever job as a journalist too .
in the spring of 1995 , i stood in a field in chechnya .
lines of civilian corpses , some charred by flames , lay awaiting burial .
this was the result of the kremlin 's heavy-handed response to the breakaway region 's bid for independence .

university college london professor mark maslin said many targets in their assembly election manifestos were below those of central government .
he warned wales could be " left behind " on tackling global warming despite having " several natural advantages " .
the parties said their policies were robust and would make a difference .
all four of them have put green issues at the forefront of their campaigns .
professor maslin , who was commissioned by bbc wales to examine the four main parties ' manifesto pledges , said that some of the parties appear to be unaware of the targets being set at a uk level for cutting co2 emissions .
" they 're in danger of being left behind with these pledges , " he said .
" i think the parties could go much further ... particularly as all the parties are very keen on renewable technologies like wind and tidal power , which are perfect for wales . "
" it 's important to set higher targets because historically , governments fall short of them " professor maslin he has called on them to set higher targets to help combat global warming .
professor maslin said that , while he was encouraged that all four parties were discussing the problems of climate change , there was a " lack of detail " on how many of their measures would be implemented .
he is also warning that the parties ' policies on transport , which result in up to 30 % of emissions , should be stronger .
" from the manifestos , it seems to me that the parties are avoiding some big problems like - how do you deal with business and transport which make up a large proportion of the emissions , " he said .
" you need to set targets that match or go beyond central government and you need to show how you will achieve them .
" ambitious aim " " it 's important to set higher targets because historically , governments fall short of them - if you set yourself an ambitious aim , then have a range of policies to achieve it - some will work , some will not , it 's a fact of political life . "
all four parties maintained that their policies would reduce wales ' carbon footprint .
plaid said its policy towards climate change was " both realistic and ambitious " and it would aim to reduce carbon emissions annually by 3 % .
a spokesman for the welsh conservatives said it believed acting locally made a difference globally and that the assembly 's new powers would give them the opportunity to prioritise the environment .
the lib dems said it set the " toughest green targets " of the parties and wanted to generate 100 % of wales ' energy from renewable sources .
a labour spokesman said it would be re-committing to a 20 % cut in carbon emissions by 2020 , which would see 20 % of energy generation coming from renewable sources and a 20 % reduction in energy demand .

it has also daubed its creation with white paint imitating bird droppings , so the birds will think it is an established nesting site .
montgomeryshire wildlife trust -lrb- mwt -rrb- came up with the idea for its morfa dyfi nature reserve near machynlleth .
ospreys have been seen regularly in the area in recent years , said the trust .
it hopes the man-made nest will give breeding ospreys a head start .
called a nesting platform , it has been placed among trees on the morfa dyfi reserve , which spans more than 40 acres .
it is built from sticks , held together with wire and attached to the end of a 50ft telegraph pole donated by energy company , scottish power .
volunteers helped build the osprey nest the wildlife trust explained why paint has been added .
conservation officer clive faulkner said : " the paint is added to emulate bird droppings , and will encourage ospreys to think that the nest is an established site . "
tony senior , the trust 's reserves officer , said volunteers had helped build the nesting platform , and that ospreys liked that " lived-in " look when it came to nests .
meanwhile , a herd of water buffalo at the neighbouring cors dyfi reserve has increased from three to 10 .
the animals are helping to maintain the area by eating scrub , gorse , birch and willow - a diet native cows would refuse to eat .
earlier this month , a pair of ospreys returned to breed in gwynedd for the fifth year running , and laid three eggs .
the birds , which breed at the aberglaslyn site near porthmadog , are thought to be wales ' only nesting pair .

the animals are helping to maintain the area by eating scrub , gorse , birch and willow - a diet native cows would refuse to eat .
earlier this month , a pair of ospreys returned to breed in gwynedd for the fifth year running , and laid three eggs .

some analysts have claimed that private equity firm kohlberg kravis roberts -lrb- kkr -rrb- and boots ' deputy chairman stefano pessina are paying too much .
trade unions warned that there may be job cuts and shop closures as a result .
however , kkr partner dominic murphy told the financial times that the firm would not fire staff or shut shops .
" the business has an important relationship with the british consumer and we want to nurture , invest and grow it and protect kkr 's reputation as well , " mr murphy explained in an interview with the newspaper .
he added that kkr would remain committed to boots for " at least five years " .
kkr told the bbc that it already owned 29.3 % of alliance boots stock .
it added : " we plan to grow the business and the brand and make the company a global leader . "
" this by implication means that in the years to come , if we own the business , we will employ more people in the future than we do today and the business will have received significant investments , " it added .
more risk ?
mr murphy 's comments come amid growing concerns about the number of buyouts being led by private equity firms and their motives behind the purchases .
critics have accused the firms of being asset raiders who spot undervalued companies , load them with large amounts of debt , cut costs and jobs , and then sell them off to make a profit with little regard for the long-term future .
they might struggle to get the right rate of return without big increases in revenues and margins nick bubb , pali international robert peston on boots battle alliance boots ' share price these fears have been fanned by the bidding war that briefly broke out for boots , and which led to kkr putting an extra £ 500m on the table .
the rival bidder for boots , a consortium led by private equity firm terra firma , decided to withdraw its interest on tuesday after kkr upped its offer .
earlier this month , the gmb trade union wrote to the health secretary patricia hewitt claiming that the takeover could lead to pharmacies being shut .
" the offer has now gone up , which must put even more pharmacies at risk , " said paul maloney , national officer of the gmb .
" the secretary of state must act now and call in the private equity bidders to explain how the numbers add up , " he added .
' rate of return ' analysts said that the more kkr pays , the more it will have to boost boots ' earnings to make the deal worthwhile .
" i think they might struggle to get the right rate of return without big increases in revenues and margins , " said nick bubb , an analyst at pali international .
" at the moment it is hard to see where they are coming from . "
another concern is that kkr and mr pessina may also have to lift payments to the boots pension fund , which is running a deficit .
" the higher the debt , the more the pension fund trustees are likely to want , " said richard ratner , an analyst at seymour pierce .
alliance boots is best known in the uk for its 2,600 boots the chemist shops , and it also has 400 overseas outlets in countries including thailand and italy .

some analysts have claimed that private equity firm kohlberg kravis roberts -lrb- kkr -rrb- and boots ' deputy chairman stefano pessina are paying too much .
trade unions warned that there may be job cuts and shop closures as a result .
however , kkr partner dominic murphy told the financial times that the firm would not fire staff or shut shops .
" the business has an important relationship with the british consumer and we want to nurture , invest and grow it and protect kkr 's reputation as well , " mr murphy explained in an interview with the newspaper .
he added that kkr would remain committed to boots for " at least five years " .
kkr told the bbc that it already owned 29.3 % of alliance boots stock .
it added : " we plan to grow the business and the brand and make the company a global leader . "
" this by implication means that in the years to come , if we own the business , we will employ more people in the future than we do today and the business will have received significant investments , " it added .

mr murphy 's comments come amid growing concerns about the number of buyouts being led by private equity firms and their motives behind the purchases .
critics have accused the firms of being asset raiders who spot undervalued companies , load them with large amounts of debt , cut costs and jobs , and then sell them off to make a profit with little regard for the long-term future .

earlier this month , the gmb trade union wrote to the health secretary patricia hewitt claiming that the takeover could lead to pharmacies being shut .
" the offer has now gone up , which must put even more pharmacies at risk , " said paul maloney , national officer of the gmb .
" the secretary of state must act now and call in the private equity bidders to explain how the numbers add up , " he added .

" i think they might struggle to get the right rate of return without big increases in revenues and margins , " said nick bubb , an analyst at pali international .
" at the moment it is hard to see where they are coming from . "
another concern is that kkr and mr pessina may also have to lift payments to the boots pension fund , which is running a deficit .

earlier this year ilm picked up a visual effects oscar for the work done on pirates of the caribbean : dead man 's chest .
for animation supervisor hal hickle , who picked up the award , it was the fulfilment of a boyhood dream , which began after he saw star wars in 1977 .
he says : " when i was 13 , i 'd heard they were making a second star wars film ; this was in 1978 .
i sent off an idea for the film . "
the script idea was returned with a letter , that said : " our legal counsel has advised us to return all unsolicited sequel ideas unread .
" the sequel is being written without the use of any outside contributions .
getting into movies requires a certain combination of talent and luck and is usually done through an agent in hollywood . "
ilm recent innovations attack of the clones - first major film shot entirely in hd application of sub-surface scattering - making digital skin more realistic developed open exr - open source high definition picture file format worked alongside stanford university to simulate the ocean in poseidon pioneering motion capture technology to blur the line between live action and post-production he may have abandoned his screenwriting hopes , but mr hickle kept that letter - which is now in a frame on his office wall - and showed it to director george lucas 21 years later when working together on the phantom menace .
lucas circled the words " talent and luck " , wrote " you have both " and signed the letter .
mr hickle picked up the oscar alongside john knoll , who has worked at ilm for 21 years - and also co-developed groundbreaking program photoshop .
it is a measure of the kind of staff that industrial light and magic employs .
mr hickle transferred to ilm from pixar , where he had worked on toy story , just for the chance to work on the star wars prequels .
industrial light and magic was founded by george lucas in 1975 when he needed specialised effects for star wars and learned that 20th century fox had shut down its own visual effects team .
the firm made its name by developing motion capture cameras , which made realistic and epic space battles possible on the big screen for the first time .
since then , the company has become synonymous with innovation in visual effects - from the dinosaurs in jurassic park to the computer generated tentacles and barnacles on davy jones ' face in pirates of the caribbean : dead man 's chest .
not content to bask in the glory of pirates 2 , the animators and technical staff are busy finishing the visual effects for the third film in the series .
eye patch the office walls at ilm are covered in flags sporting the jolly roger and even lucasfilm icons such as yoda have been co-opted - one model in the building now wears an eye-patch .
pirates 3 visual effects supervisor roger guyett says ilm has always prided itself on pushing the envelope .
" we are doing about 800 visual effects shots on pirates 3 .
it 's a huge movie and we are definitely pushing it even further .
" ilm has been doing this for a long time and are still at the forefront of the visual effects business and the kinds of projects they get mean they are always at the cutting edge of the spectrum .
" you are always being challenged creatively and technically . "
yoda the pirate in pictures : inside lucasfilm mr guyett says that the scale of ilm has allowed it to spend more time and money on research and development .
" often we take on projects like davy jones from pirates 2 , the wave in poseidon - the stuff that other companies ca n't deal with . "
miles perkins , director of marketing and communications at lucasfilm , says industrial light and magic has developed its reputation for " breaking new ground with projects and delivering them on time and on budget " .
' physical simulation ' " in terms of the technology and ideas we use it 's amazing how much software we have developed for pirates 3 , " explains mr guyett .
" a lot of that is based on physical simulation .
we have really smart people at stanford -lrb- university -rrb- who help us . "
my guyett says film-makers will increasingly turn to visual effects firms to create digital landscapes and digital actors .
" if you look at mission impossible 3 the idea of going to shanghai and filming stuff was appealing but a lot of stuff in the film was created with digital environments . "
george lucas , who owns the company , has really supported the work that is done here roger guyett if director jj abrams had wanted to film in shanghai he would have faced obstacles such as heavy smog , a ban on helicopter flight and the fact that lights in city are switched off after 10pm .
although ilm has pioneered completely cgi characters - such as the hulk and yoda - mr guyett says there is little appetite among the public for lead roles given over to digital personas .
" people are worried about synthetic actors , " says mr guyett , " but i do n't know if people want to see that . "
" but if it means you can do stuff that otherwise endangered people , then it 's a good idea , " he adds .
thirty two years after it was founded and george lucas is still helping lead the firm , explains mr guyett .
" george lucas , who owns the company , has really supported the work that is done here .
he has n't seen it as a company just to make money .

since then , the company has become synonymous with innovation in visual effects - from the dinosaurs in jurassic park to the computer generated tentacles and barnacles on davy jones ' face in pirates of the caribbean : dead man 's chest .
not content to bask in the glory of pirates 2 , the animators and technical staff are busy finishing the visual effects for the third film in the series .
eye patch the office walls at ilm are covered in flags sporting the jolly roger and even lucasfilm icons such as yoda have been co-opted - one model in the building now wears an eye-patch .
pirates 3 visual effects supervisor roger guyett says ilm has always prided itself on pushing the envelope .
" we are doing about 800 visual effects shots on pirates 3 .
it 's a huge movie and we are definitely pushing it even further .
" ilm has been doing this for a long time and are still at the forefront of the visual effects business and the kinds of projects they get mean they are always at the cutting edge of the spectrum .
" you are always being challenged creatively and technically . "
yoda the pirate in pictures : inside lucasfilm mr guyett says that the scale of ilm has allowed it to spend more time and money on research and development .
" often we take on projects like davy jones from pirates 2 , the wave in poseidon - the stuff that other companies ca n't deal with . "
miles perkins , director of marketing and communications at lucasfilm , says industrial light and magic has developed its reputation for " breaking new ground with projects and delivering them on time and on budget " .
' physical simulation ' " in terms of the technology and ideas we use it 's amazing how much software we have developed for pirates 3 , " explains mr guyett .
" a lot of that is based on physical simulation .
we have really smart people at stanford -lrb- university -rrb- who help us . "
my guyett says film-makers will increasingly turn to visual effects firms to create digital landscapes and digital actors .
" if you look at mission impossible 3 the idea of going to shanghai and filming stuff was appealing but a lot of stuff in the film was created with digital environments . "
george lucas , who owns the company , has really supported the work that is done here roger guyett if director jj abrams had wanted to film in shanghai he would have faced obstacles such as heavy smog , a ban on helicopter flight and the fact that lights in city are switched off after 10pm .
although ilm has pioneered completely cgi characters - such as the hulk and yoda - mr guyett says there is little appetite among the public for lead roles given over to digital personas .
" people are worried about synthetic actors , " says mr guyett , " but i do n't know if people want to see that . "
" but if it means you can do stuff that otherwise endangered people , then it 's a good idea , " he adds .
thirty two years after it was founded and george lucas is still helping lead the firm , explains mr guyett .
" george lucas , who owns the company , has really supported the work that is done here .
he has n't seen it as a company just to make money .
" he 's very interested in this business . "

earlier this year ilm picked up a visual effects oscar for the work done on pirates of the caribbean : dead man 's chest .
for animation supervisor hal hickle , who picked up the award , it was the fulfilment of a boyhood dream , which began after he saw star wars in 1977 .
he says : " when i was 13 , i 'd heard they were making a second star wars film ; this was in 1978 .
i sent off an idea for the film . "
the script idea was returned with a letter , that said : " our legal counsel has advised us to return all unsolicited sequel ideas unread .
" the sequel is being written without the use of any outside contributions .
getting into movies requires a certain combination of talent and luck and is usually done through an agent in hollywood . "
ilm recent innovations attack of the clones - first major film shot entirely in hd application of sub-surface scattering - making digital skin more realistic developed open exr - open source high definition picture file format worked alongside stanford university to simulate the ocean in poseidon pioneering motion capture technology to blur the line between live action and post-production he may have abandoned his screenwriting hopes , but mr hickle kept that letter - which is now in a frame on his office wall - and showed it to director george lucas 21 years later when working together on the phantom menace .
lucas circled the words " talent and luck " , wrote " you have both " and signed the letter .
mr hickle picked up the oscar alongside john knoll , who has worked at ilm for 21 years - and also co-developed groundbreaking program photoshop .
it is a measure of the kind of staff that industrial light and magic employs .
mr hickle transferred to ilm from pixar , where he had worked on toy story , just for the chance to work on the star wars prequels .
industrial light and magic was founded by george lucas in 1975 when he needed specialised effects for star wars and learned that 20th century fox had shut down its own visual effects team .
the firm made its name by developing motion capture cameras , which made realistic and epic space battles possible on the big screen for the first time .
since then , the company has become synonymous with innovation in visual effects - from the dinosaurs in jurassic park to the computer generated tentacles and barnacles on davy jones ' face in pirates of the caribbean : dead man 's chest .

pirates 3 visual effects supervisor roger guyett says ilm has always prided itself on pushing the envelope .
" we are doing about 800 visual effects shots on pirates 3 .
it 's a huge movie and we are definitely pushing it even further .
" ilm has been doing this for a long time and are still at the forefront of the visual effects business and the kinds of projects they get mean they are always at the cutting edge of the spectrum .

" often we take on projects like davy jones from pirates 2 , the wave in poseidon - the stuff that other companies ca n't deal with . "
miles perkins , director of marketing and communications at lucasfilm , says industrial light and magic has developed its reputation for " breaking new ground with projects and delivering them on time and on budget " .
' physical simulation ' " in terms of the technology and ideas we use it 's amazing how much software we have developed for pirates 3 , " explains mr guyett .
" a lot of that is based on physical simulation .
we have really smart people at stanford -lrb- university -rrb- who help us . "
my guyett says film-makers will increasingly turn to visual effects firms to create digital landscapes and digital actors .
" if you look at mission impossible 3 the idea of going to shanghai and filming stuff was appealing but a lot of stuff in the film was created with digital environments . "
george lucas , who owns the company , has really supported the work that is done here roger guyett if director jj abrams had wanted to film in shanghai he would have faced obstacles such as heavy smog , a ban on helicopter flight and the fact that lights in city are switched off after 10pm .

some analysts have claimed that private equity firm kohlberg kravis roberts -lrb- kkr -rrb- and boots ' deputy chairman stefano pessina are paying too much .
trade unions warned that there may be job cuts and shop closures as a result .
however , kkr partner dominic murphy told the financial times that the firm would not fire staff or shut shops .
" the business has an important relationship with the british consumer and we want to nurture , invest and grow it and protect kkr 's reputation as well , " mr murphy explained in an interview with the newspaper .
he added that kkr would remain committed to boots for " at least five years " .
kkr told the bbc that it already owned 29.3 % of alliance boots stock .
it added : " we plan to grow the business and the brand and make the company a global leader . "
" this by implication means that in the years to come , if we own the business , we will employ more people in the future than we do today and the business will have received significant investments , " it added .
more risk ?
mr murphy 's comments come amid growing concerns about the number of buyouts being led by private equity firms and their motives behind the purchases .
critics have accused the firms of being asset raiders who spot undervalued companies , load them with large amounts of debt , cut costs and jobs , and then sell them off to make a profit with little regard for the long-term future . "
they might struggle to get the right rate of return without big increases in revenues and margins " nick bubb , pali international these fears have been fanned by the bidding war that briefly broke out for boots , and which led to kkr putting an extra £ 500m on the table .
the rival bidder for boots , a consortium led by private equity firm terra firma , decided to withdraw its interest on tuesday after kkr upped its offer .
earlier this month , the gmb trade union wrote to the health secretary patricia hewitt claiming that the takeover could lead to pharmacies being shut .
" the offer has now gone up , which must put even more pharmacies at risk , " said paul maloney , national officer of the gmb .
" the secretary of state must act now and call in the private equity bidders to explain how the numbers add up , " he added .
' rate of return ' analysts said that the more kkr pays , the more it will have to boost boots ' earnings to make the deal worthwhile .
" i think they might struggle to get the right rate of return without big increases in revenues and margins , " said nick bubb , an analyst at pali international .
" at the moment it is hard to see where they are coming from . "
another concern is that kkr and mr pessina may also have to lift payments to the boots pension fund , which is running a deficit .
" the higher the debt , the more the pension fund trustees are likely to want , " said richard ratner , an analyst at seymour pierce .
alliance boots is best known in the uk for its 2,600 boots the chemist shops , and it also has 400 overseas outlets in countries including thailand and italy .
as well as the high street retail arm , the company is a wholesale supplier to more than 125,000 pharmacies , health centres and hospitals .
the company was formed last year through the merger of boots and alliance unichem .

bbc news -pipe- technology -pipe- the talent behind the visual effects bbc news / technology graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- wednesday , 25 april 2007 , 06:40 gmt 07:40 uk the talent behind the visual effects by darren waters technology editor , bbc news website the bbc news website speaks to two leading special effects professionals at the world famous industrial light and magic -lrb- ilm -rrb- firm in san francisco .
earlier this year ilm picked up a visual effects oscar for the work done on pirates of the caribbean : dead man 's chest .
for animation supervisor hal hickel , who picked up the award , it was the fulfilment of a boyhood dream , which began after he saw star wars in 1977 .
he says : " when i was 13 , i 'd heard they were making a second star wars film ; this was in 1978 .
i sent off an idea for the film . "
the script idea was returned with a letter , that said : " our legal counsel has advised us to return all unsolicited sequel ideas unread .
" the sequel is being written without the use of any outside contributions .
getting into movies requires a certain combination of talent and luck and is usually done through an agent in hollywood . "
ilm recent innovations attack of the clones - first major film shot entirely in hd application of sub-surface scattering - making digital skin more realistic developed open exr - open source high definition picture file format worked alongside stanford university to simulate the ocean in poseidon pioneering motion capture technology to blur the line between live action and post-production he may have abandoned his screenwriting hopes , but mr hickel kept that letter - which is now in a frame on his office wall - and showed it to director george lucas 21 years later when working together on the phantom menace .
lucas circled the words " talent and luck " , wrote " you have both " and signed the letter .
mr hickel picked up the oscar alongside john knoll , who has worked at ilm for 21 years - and also co-developed groundbreaking program photoshop .
it is a measure of the kind of staff that industrial light and magic employs .
mr hickel transferred to ilm from pixar , where he had worked on toy story , just for the chance to work on the star wars prequels .
industrial light and magic was founded by george lucas in 1975 when he needed specialised effects for star wars and learned that 20th century fox had shut down its own visual effects team .
the firm made its name by developing motion capture cameras , which made realistic and epic space battles possible on the big screen for the first time .
since then , the company has become synonymous with innovation in visual effects - from the dinosaurs in jurassic park to the computer generated tentacles and barnacles on davy jones ' face in pirates of the caribbean : dead man 's chest .
not content to bask in the glory of pirates 2 , the animators and technical staff are busy finishing the visual effects for the third film in the series .
eye patch the office walls at ilm are covered in flags sporting the jolly roger and even lucasfilm icons such as yoda have been co-opted - one model in the building now wears an eye-patch .
pirates 3 visual effects supervisor roger guyett says ilm has always prided itself on pushing the envelope .
" we are doing about 800 visual effects shots on pirates 3 .
it 's a huge movie and we are definitely pushing it even further .
" ilm has been doing this for a long time and are still at the forefront of the visual effects business and the kinds of projects they get mean they are always at the cutting edge of the spectrum .
" you are always being challenged creatively and technically . "
yoda the pirate in pictures : inside lucasfilm mr guyett says that the scale of ilm has allowed it to spend more time and money on research and development .
" often we take on projects like davy jones from pirates 2 , the wave in poseidon - the stuff that other companies ca n't deal with . "
miles perkins , director of marketing and communications at lucasfilm , says industrial light and magic has developed its reputation for " breaking new ground with projects and delivering them on time and on budget " .
' physical simulation ' " in terms of the technology and ideas we use it 's amazing how much software we have developed for pirates 3 , " explains mr guyett .
" a lot of that is based on physical simulation .
we have really smart people at stanford -lrb- university -rrb- who help us . "
my guyett says film-makers will increasingly turn to visual effects firms to create digital landscapes and digital actors .
" if you look at mission impossible 3 the idea of going to shanghai and filming stuff was appealing but a lot of stuff in the film was created with digital environments . "
" george lucas , who owns the company , has really supported the work that is done here " roger guyett if director jj abrams had wanted to film in shanghai he would have faced obstacles such as heavy smog , a ban on helicopter flight and the fact that lights in city are switched off after 10pm .
although ilm has pioneered completely cgi characters - such as the hulk and yoda - mr guyett says there is little appetite among the public for lead roles given over to digital personas .
" people are worried about synthetic actors , " says mr guyett , " but i do n't know if people want to see that . "
" but if it means you can do stuff that otherwise endangered people , then it 's a good idea , " he adds .
thirty two years after it was founded and george lucas is still helping lead the firm , explains mr guyett .
" george lucas , who owns the company , has really supported the work that is done here .
he has n't seen it as a company just to make money .
" he 's very interested in this business . "

by justin parkinson bbc news political reporter everyone creates it , but few like it .
rubbish can be unhygienic , smelly and generally unpleasant , but many parts of the uk are having to live with it for longer .
ministers want more household rubbish to be recycled about 140 councils in england now run an alternate weekly collection -lrb- awc -rrb- system , where ordinary household waste is taken once a fortnight , rather than once a week .
recyclable material , such as glass or paper , is removed on other weeks .
there is anecdotal evidence of rats and foxes and , in particular , maggots enjoying a feast of rotting food left in bins for longer .
whitehall advice to councils , who have to cut their waste levels or face fines , is not to introduce the idea of fortnightly collections too near polling day .
its waste and resources action programme -lrb- wrap -rrb- says : " the timing of local elections may affect your thinking on when best to introduce the concept to members and to the public , and the proposed rollout schedule for the awc . "
' roll out ' it adds : " it is advisable to roll out the scheme in autumn , winter or early spring such that by the time warmer weather arrives , residents are used to the scheme and initial resistance has faded . "
so , the best time to bring up the subject of awc would be when there is no election pending and when the weather is not too warm - not now , in other words .
britain is the dustbin of europe with more rubbish being thrown into landfill than any other country on the continen sandy bruce-lockhart local government association changes ' boost recycling ' but candidates in some areas are making it an issue .
some liberal democrat councillors are running on a policy of bringing back weekly household bin collections during the hottest - and smelliest - part of the summer .
one said : " we went out on the doorstep to ask people how they are coping with it and we were surprised by the result .
no one said they wanted the new system .
" there were stories about all sorts of things , such as maggots crawling out of bins , through an air vent and into one woman 's kitchen .
it 's horrible for people .
" the fact is we can still recycle without having to collect recyclables and ordinary rubbish alternately . "
' responsibility ' another said : " we are responding to customers .
we have had some people complaining about the green bin system , for stuff like food , garden waste and cardboard , and that they would like more summer collections .
if people do n't recycle there will be a cost which will have to be met elaine sherrington bolton council " it 's not a big issue in the sense that people are clamouring for a weekly service , but we have a responsibility to listen . "
at a national level , the tories say councils should be left to decide policy .
shadow local government secretary caroline spelman said : " conservative councils do n't want to cut services but with another hot summer on the way , millions of households across the country face the prospect of bags of household waste building up on doorsteps , in bins that smell or in their kitchens .
" i believe people genuinely want to improve recycling and go green ... forcing rubbish cuts is not the answer .
it can end up being bad for the local environment and bad for public health . "
the government has told councils to cut the amount of biodegradable waste - like paper and food - they transport to landfill sites .
if whitehall does not reach its own european targets by 2010 , it will face a fine , which it is promising to pass on to local authorities .
' political gain ' the theory is that awc is that fortnightly bin-emptying , combined with more recycyling , will ease the pressure on landfill sites .
but the whitehall advice is not to mention the scheme around election time : " as an awc is such a high-profile change in service provision , a party in opposition can use the change for political gain .
" this can cause unnecessary public opposition either in advance of , or following the introduction of , an awc scheme .
" there is evidence that such activity has resulted in an awc not being introduced .
there are also examples of awc schemes being withdrawn as a result of commitment to party manifestos on election .
" this risk should be identified at the outset and action taken to address it if necessary as soon as possible . "
to counter this " unnecessary public opposition " , the introduction of awcs is usually accompanied by an education programme on its environmental benefits .
' horror stories ' this usually advises that " good housekeeping " - such as shutting bin lids and keeping rubbish out of direct sunlight - removes most smells and lowers the risk of maggot infestation .
doretta cocks , founder of the campaign for weekly waste collection , says people are being " brainwashed " .
she wants more council candidates to run on a ticket of ending fortnightly bin removals .
mrs cocks said : " people are having to drive their cars to the dump more , which i do n't think is environmentally friendly .
" i 've also heard horror stories about what happens .
one man had to use a blow torch to get the maggots off his driveway .
" people understand how important an issue this is .
they want to recycle stuff , of course , but this is the wrong way to bring it about - it 's much more stick than carrot .
" people are being manipulated .
they are being brainwashed . "
the daily mail has also launched a campaign - " the great dustbin revolt " - calling for people living in areas with awc to vote against parties backing it in next week 's local elections .
' done properly ' a department for the environment , food and rural affairs spokeswoman said of awc : " it is n't a problem in most of the areas that have got it . "
she added that reported complaints , such as maggot infestations , were very unusual " as long as it -lsb- putting waste in bins and keeping it covered -rsb- is done properly . "
among the local authorities which have reverted from fortnightly to weekly collections are labour-controlled ones .
as one labour member said : " we responded to the people ... and brought back the weekly grey bin service , because we see it as a right to residents .
but , with all rights comes responsibilities .
" if people do n't recycle there will be a cost which will have to be met , and we will have to look at alternative ways of enforcing this . "
although all the main parties are keen to see an increase in recycling , it is up to councils themselves to decide whether or not to move to the awc system .
out on the doorstep , rubbish collection is clearly a concern .
whether it affects council elections remains to be seen .

by justin parkinson bbc news political reporter everyone creates it , but few like it .
rubbish can be unhygienic , smelly and generally unpleasant , but many parts of the uk are having to live with it for longer .
ministers want more household rubbish to be recycled about 140 councils in england now run an alternate weekly collection -lrb- awc -rrb- system , where ordinary household waste is taken once a fortnight , rather than once a week .
recyclable material , such as glass or paper , is removed on other weeks .
there is anecdotal evidence of rats and foxes and , in particular , maggots enjoying a feast of rotting food left in bins for longer .
whitehall advice to councils , who have to cut their waste levels or face fines , is not to introduce the idea of fortnightly collections too near polling day .
its waste and resources action programme -lrb- wrap -rrb- says : " the timing of local elections may affect your thinking on when best to introduce the concept to members and to the public , and the proposed rollout schedule for the awc . "
' roll out ' it adds : " it is advisable to roll out the scheme in autumn , winter or early spring such that by the time warmer weather arrives , residents are used to the scheme and initial resistance has faded . "
so , the best time to bring up the subject of awc would be when there is no election pending and when the weather is not too warm - not now , in other words .
britain is the dustbin of europe with more rubbish being thrown into landfill than any other country on the continen sandy bruce-lockhart local government association changes ' boost recycling ' but candidates in some areas are making it an issue .
some liberal democrat councillors are running on a policy of bringing back weekly household bin collections during the hottest - and smelliest - part of the summer .
one said : " we went out on the doorstep to ask people how they are coping with it and we were surprised by the result .
no one said they wanted the new system .
" there were stories about all sorts of things , such as maggots crawling out of bins , through an air vent and into one woman 's kitchen .

" the fact is we can still recycle without having to collect recyclables and ordinary rubbish alternately . "
' responsibility ' another said : " we are responding to customers .

at a national level , the tories say councils should be left to decide policy .
shadow local government secretary caroline spelman said : " conservative councils do n't want to cut services but with another hot summer on the way , millions of households across the country face the prospect of bags of household waste building up on doorsteps , in bins that smell or in their kitchens .
" i believe people genuinely want to improve recycling and go green ... forcing rubbish cuts is not the answer .
it can end up being bad for the local environment and bad for public health . "
the government has told councils to cut the amount of biodegradable waste - like paper and food - they transport to landfill sites .
if whitehall does not reach its own european targets by 2010 , it will face a fine , which it is promising to pass on to local authorities .
' political gain ' the theory is that awc is that fortnightly bin-emptying , combined with more recycyling , will ease the pressure on landfill sites .
but the whitehall advice is not to mention the scheme around election time : " as an awc is such a high-profile change in service provision , a party in opposition can use the change for political gain .
" this can cause unnecessary public opposition either in advance of , or following the introduction of , an awc scheme .
" there is evidence that such activity has resulted in an awc not being introduced .
there are also examples of awc schemes being withdrawn as a result of commitment to party manifestos on election .
" this risk should be identified at the outset and action taken to address it if necessary as soon as possible . "
to counter this " unnecessary public opposition " , the introduction of awcs is usually accompanied by an education programme on its environmental benefits .
' horror stories ' this usually advises that " good housekeeping " - such as shutting bin lids and keeping rubbish out of direct sunlight - removes most smells and lowers the risk of maggot infestation .
doretta cocks , founder of the campaign for weekly waste collection , says people are being " brainwashed " .
she wants more council candidates to run on a ticket of ending fortnightly bin removals .
mrs cocks said : " people are having to drive their cars to the dump more , which i do n't think is environmentally friendly .
" i 've also heard horror stories about what happens .
one man had to use a blow torch to get the maggots off his driveway .
" people understand how important an issue this is .
they want to recycle stuff , of course , but this is the wrong way to bring it about - it 's much more stick than carrot .
" people are being manipulated .
they are being brainwashed . "
the daily mail has also launched a campaign - " the great dustbin revolt " - calling for people living in areas with awc to vote against parties backing it in next week 's local elections .
' done properly ' a department for the environment , food and rural affairs spokeswoman said of awc : " it is n't a problem in most of the areas that have got it . "
she added that reported complaints , such as maggot infestations , were very unusual " as long as it -lsb- putting waste in bins and keeping it covered -rsb- is done properly . "
among the local authorities which have reverted from fortnightly to weekly collections are labour-controlled ones .
as one labour member said : " we responded to the people ... and brought back the weekly grey bin service , because we see it as a right to residents .
but , with all rights comes responsibilities .
" if people do n't recycle there will be a cost which will have to be met , and we will have to look at alternative ways of enforcing this . "
although all the main parties are keen to see an increase in recycling , it is up to councils themselves to decide whether or not to move to the awc system .
out on the doorstep , rubbish collection is clearly a concern .
whether it affects council elections remains to be seen .

by justin parkinson bbc news political reporter everyone creates it , but few like it .
rubbish can be unhygienic , smelly and generally unpleasant , but many parts of the uk are having to live with it for longer .
ministers want more household rubbish to be recycled about 140 councils in england now run an alternate weekly collection -lrb- awc -rrb- system , where ordinary household waste is taken once a fortnight , rather than once a week .
recyclable material , such as glass or paper , is removed on other weeks .
there is anecdotal evidence of rats and foxes and , in particular , maggots enjoying a feast of rotting food left in bins for longer .
whitehall advice to councils , who have to cut their waste levels or face fines , is not to introduce the idea of fortnightly collections too near polling day .
its waste and resources action programme -lrb- wrap -rrb- says : " the timing of local elections may affect your thinking on when best to introduce the concept to members and to the public , and the proposed rollout schedule for the awc . "
' roll out ' it adds : " it is advisable to roll out the scheme in autumn , winter or early spring such that by the time warmer weather arrives , residents are used to the scheme and initial resistance has faded . "
so , the best time to bring up the subject of awc would be when there is no election pending and when the weather is not too warm - not now , in other words .
britain is the dustbin of europe with more rubbish being thrown into landfill than any other country on the continen sandy bruce-lockhart local government association changes ' boost recycling ' but candidates in some areas are making it an issue .
some liberal democrat councillors are running on a policy of bringing back weekly household bin collections during the hottest - and smelliest - part of the summer .
one said : " we went out on the doorstep to ask people how they are coping with it and we were surprised by the result .
no one said they wanted the new system .
" there were stories about all sorts of things , such as maggots crawling out of bins , through an air vent and into one woman 's kitchen .

" i believe people genuinely want to improve recycling and go green ... forcing rubbish cuts is not the answer .
it can end up being bad for the local environment and bad for public health . "
the government has told councils to cut the amount of biodegradable waste - like paper and food - they transport to landfill sites .
if whitehall does not reach its own european targets by 2010 , it will face a fine , which it is promising to pass on to local authorities .
' political gain ' the theory is that awc is that fortnightly bin-emptying , combined with more recycyling , will ease the pressure on landfill sites .
but the whitehall advice is not to mention the scheme around election time : " as an awc is such a high-profile change in service provision , a party in opposition can use the change for political gain .
" this can cause unnecessary public opposition either in advance of , or following the introduction of , an awc scheme .

more are expected to follow , according to one of the mps , gloria gallardo .
some 24 mps have been accused of rising against the government , out of a total of 50 mps who were fired last month and reinstated on monday .
they were sacked for opposing a vote on constitutional reform which gives president rafael correa more power .
the referendum was approved by the overwhelming majority of voters last week .
on monday , the supreme court said the 50 mps ' dismissals were unconstitutional and reinstated them .
but congress , now led by supporters of mr correa , responded by sacking the court 's nine top judges on tuesday .
the 24 mps are accused of sedition for " rising against the government , refusing to recognise the constitution , and impeding a meeting of the congress " , prosecutor elsa moreno is quoted as saying by the afp news agency .
" we have come to colombia , which is a sister country , to ask for protection and political asylum , " said ms gallardo .
" we are being persecuted .
the government is violating our human rights . "
political crisis mr correa says the deputies were sacked for incompetence and did not deserve their jobs back .
mr correa took over as president in january promising radical change to the way the country is governed and hoping to end 10 years of political turmoil , but it has been a chaotic few months , says the bbc 's south america correspondent , daniel schweimler .

the heanor office is earmarked for closure , with 27 jobs being transferred three miles away to ilkeston .
royal mail said it had to make savings to remain competitive and customers would get a better service at ilkeston .
but the communication workers ' union said it had not been consulted and the move was an " absolute disgrace " .
lynn wilson , from royal mail , said the closure of the heanor office would cause few problems .
" just a very small proportion of people have to go and pick things up .
at the moment they can only go and pick them up until half past twelve in heanor .
when we move to ilkeston they 'll be able to go and pick them up until a quarter to seven in the evening . "
' no alternative ' but union regional representative mick kavanagh said in other areas the quality of service had dipped when a sorting office had closed .
he said there would be a ballot for industrial action " because the way they 've been treated is an absolute disgrace .
" at the end of the day we 're talking about people 's jobs and people 's livelihoods .
" royal mail have n't had the decency to come forward to the union and put forward these proposals .
quite clearly we 've been left with no alternative but to ballot our members for their protection . "
