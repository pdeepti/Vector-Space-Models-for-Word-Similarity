the security situation could further complicate turkey 's bid to join the european union . six turkish soldiers were killed by a roadside bomb thursday in southeast turkey near the border with iraq .
the attack on the military vehicle came two days after a suicide bomber killed a half dozen people in downtown ankara .
turkish political leaders have blamed kurdish rebels affiliated with the separatist kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk . -rrb-
twenty-six people , most of them students , have been arrested for alleged involvement in the attacks , according to media reports on friday .
the pkk is considered a terrorist organization by turkey , the eu and the united states .
the pkk has denied any involvement in the recent attacks , but turkish officials said the method of the bomb attack and the type of explosives were similar to past pkk attacks .
mending ties to eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy says turkey does n't belong in the eu the violence comes at a bad time for turkey .
the new french president nicolas sarkozy has made it clear he continues to oppose turkey 's bid to join the eu .
instead , he has proposed a mediterranean union between turkey and its neighbors .
" i do n't see how you can be a candidate with one opinion and a president with another , " he said during a press conference in brussels this week .
" i do n't think that turkey has a place in the union . " france has said it would consider vetoing turkey 's entry into the eu .
turkey began negotiations in 2005 .
turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan reportedly phoned sarkozy on thursday , in an apparent conciliatory gesture , according to reuters .
in his first call to sarkozy since his election , sources in erdogan 's office quoted the prime minister as congratulating the french president on his victory in the polls and told him that the two needed to work directly with each other , according to reuters .

fifty-two artists - roughly half of them german born and the other living and working here - will be showing their work at the show which being jointly organized by the kunstverein hannover , the kestnergesellschaft and the sprengel museum .
martin engler , curator at the hanover kunstverein , stressed that most of the 80 works do not relate to the theme of germany , but show a rich diversity .

the security situation could further complicate turkey 's bid to join the european union . six turkish soldiers were killed by a roadside bomb thursday in southeast turkey near the border with iraq .
the attack on the military vehicle came two days after a suicide bomber killed a half dozen people in downtown ankara .
turkish political leaders have blamed kurdish rebels affiliated with the separatist kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk . -rrb-
twenty-six people , most of them students , have been arrested for alleged involvement in the attacks , according to media reports on friday .
the pkk is considered a terrorist organization by turkey , the eu and the united states .
the pkk has denied any involvement in the recent attacks , but turkish officials said the method of the bomb attack and the type of explosives were similar to past pkk attacks .
mending ties to eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy says turkey does n't belong in the eu the violence comes at a bad time for turkey .
the new french president nicolas sarkozy has made it clear he continues to oppose turkey 's bid to join the eu .
instead , he has proposed a mediterranean union between turkey and its neighbors .
" i do n't see how you can be a candidate with one opinion and a president with another , " he said during a press conference in brussels this week .
" i do n't think that turkey has a place in the union . " france has said it would consider vetoing turkey 's entry into the eu .
turkey began negotiations in 2005 .
turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan reportedly phoned sarkozy on thursday , in an apparent conciliatory gesture , according to reuters .
in his first call to sarkozy since his election , sources in erdogan 's office quoted the prime minister as congratulating the french president on his victory in the polls and told him that the two needed to work directly with each other , according to reuters .
" we must not communicate via media statements , " erdogan was quoted as telling sarkozy .
" -lrb- we must -rrb- work together with direct talks . "
sarkozy reportedly offered his condolences for a bomb attack in ankara on tuesday and said he wanted to work together to overcome their common problems , according to reuters .
erdogan also noted france and turkey cooperate on economic , political and military issues and that turkey is already a nato member . too soon to say if turkey belongs in eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : talks continue about turkey 's place in the eu eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn said the european commission plans to continue accession negotiations with turkey and said it was too soon to judge whether turkey belonged in the 27-member bloc .
" we have a sound negotiating mandate with turkey and the commission 's view is that we will continue the accession negotiations with turkey because it is in the interests of both the european union and turkey , " he said at a news briefing .
" if we succeed , if turkey succeeds , turkey can become an even more important bridge of civilizations than it is today , " rehn said .
" and the time to judge whether turkey has been able to meet the conditions of eu accession is in the latter stages of the accession process . "
turkey has general elections scheduled for july 22 to decide a political conflict between the islamic-leaning government and the military-backed secular establishment .
military needs to show restraint bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish special forces fire tear gas at kurdish demonstrators the recent bombings further complicate turkey 's domestic and foreign politics .
the pkk is thought to have launched the attacks from hideouts in northern iraq .
turkish army chief yasar buyukanit last month called for a military operation into iraq to quash pkk guerrillas . the united states and iraqi kurdish leaders oppose the idea .
a kurdish iraqi official recently warned that talk of such a move would signal a " dangerous escalation " of the situation .
the us has also urged turkey to show restraint , fearing a cross-border operation could disrupt efforts to stabilize war-torn iraq .
attacks blamed on rebels continued friday when a bomb derailed seven cars of a freight train in southeast turkey .
no injuries were reported .
police arrested 26 people , most of them university students belonging to the separatist kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , media reported on friday .
eight of the arrested are women who were preparing attacks , local authorities were quoted by the anatolia news agency as saying .
the pkk has fought for an ethnic homeland since 1984 , and ankara blames it for 30,000 deaths . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey set for fresh membership talks with eu eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn played down concerns that nicolas sarkozy , french president-elect , would stop turkey 's membership bid , adding that new talks with ankara could begin within weeks .

on may 19 , the tally rose further after a suicide bomb killed three soldiers in kunduz , afghanistan .
the deaths of the soldiers , which brought the german fatality toll since the bundeswehr deployed to afghanistan in 2002 to a total of 21 , has not only generated hefty debate in parliament over the security of the troops in afghanistan , but on how to memorialize those who die while serving their country .
while there are little reservations about building a memorial to honor soldiers killed on duty in the country 's post-war armed forces , discussion has centered on the planned location for such a monument . bildunterschrift : a memorial service was held for the fallen soldiers on wednesday german defense minister franz josef jung , who has long harbored plans to honor the fallen soldiers , said the memorial would be erected within the ministry 's premises in berlin .
thomas raabe , spokesman for the defense ministry , said on thursday that the memorial would be located within the bendlerblock compound , the seat of germany 's defense ministry in berlin .
" there will be no changes to that , " he added .
a public memorial ?
but not everyone agrees with locating the memorial within a high-security tract not easily accessible to the general public .
the representative for the armed forces in the german parliament , reinhold robbe , said the majority of soldiers would prefer to see the monument built on a prominent site in berlin .
speaking on the television station rtl , robbe said the monument and its location needed to make clear to all who see it that the bundeswehr is a " parliament 's army . "
the recent fatalities in afghanistan have shown " just how dangerous the job of a soldier is , " and that the soldiers serve " in the name of germany , " robbe added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 3,000 german troops are stationed in afghanistan the head of the cross-party parliamentary committee for cultural affairs , hans-joachim otto , told deutsche welle it was " highly unfortunate that the defense ministry treats the matter of the memorial as its private business . "
" the bundeswehr is a conscription-based army and hence an army of the people .
bundeswehr missions are decided upon in parliament and not in the defense ministry , " he said , adding that as such a more public location would be more in keeping with the nature of germany 's armed forces .
more than a wreath depository peter steinbach , the head of berlin 's german resistance memorial site , also argued against placing the monument behind a closed-off gate at the defense ministry .
such a memorial belongs within view of the public , he said on german public radio .
otherwise , it risks becoming simply a " depository for wreaths . "
with a view to similar memorials in other countries , steinbach said , " no one would ever have suggested that the vietnam memorial in the united sites be built within the pentagon 's courtyard . "
chancellor angela merkel , who in february had suggested a more public location closer to the reichstag as a reminder to the role of parliament in deploying the armed forces , endorsed the ministry 's proposal for erecting the memorial within the bendlerblock compound .
her spokesman ulrich wilhelm said thursday she sees eye-to-eye with the defense minister and that details will be presented within due time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 25.05.2007 ladies and gentlemen , heidi klum presents hans and franz großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heidi klum quite aptly takes hans and franz to the golden globes awards german supermodel heidi klum has revealed that she calls her breasts hans and franz .
while that may be more information than most people need to know , others feel as though heidi has n't gone far enough . as two of the more obvious assets of a world famous lingerie model , hans and franz should be more or less used to the eyes of the world being trained on them .
however , despite one unexpected public appearance on the jay leno show in the us when they broke free of an 5.9 million-euro -lrb- $ 8 million -rrb- diamond-encrusted bra , heidi klum 's breasts are usually kept under wraps .
but after the german supermodel revealed her mammary monikers on thursday , worldwide attention has been more concentrated on the 35-inch bust than usual .
hans and franz have been stars of the victoria 's secrets lingerie catwalk shows and adverts for the past ten years but until heidi officially out-ed them as having names this week , they were more appreciated as just being part of the overall , highly aesthetic package .
now they are famous in the own right , people are clambering to know more and more about them .
and just like any new stars being embraced by the cult of celebrity , speculation about them is already rife on the international gossip pages .
no strangers to the limelight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans , franz and victoria 's secrets heidi herself is unique among supermodels for her openness , down-to-earth quality and sense of humor .
but , as with so many of her kind in the fashion world , she obviously believes that less is more .
while anyone who has seen her parading down a runway in the smallest of smalls will attest , this will come as no surprise .
however , in this case , the dearth is not of cloth covering her modesty but the information she is offering on hans and franz .
for one , which is which ?
does hans sit at her right hand or the left ?
also , from whom did the names originate ?
are they named after ex-partners , family relatives or friends ?
what are their likes and dislikes ?
-lrb- this last one will surely turn up in forthcoming interviews with heidi 's husband , the singer seal . -rrb-
all the 33-year-old from bergisch gladbach near cologne will say is that she gave her famous assets the stereotypically german names in homage to her homeland .
" they 've been an ongoing joke for , like , 12 years .
it started because i was from germany , and people always make fun of ze germans , yah ?
so when i began modeling i used to say , ' these are german breasts , one is called hans and one is called franz . " '
inspired by bodybuilder sketch ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did heidi name her breasts after a us comedy routine ?
from the fringe is just one of the many columns that believes there may be more to it that that .
one theory could be that the breasts are named after the characters of a sketch on us comedy show saturday night live .
comedians kevin nealon and dana carvey starred as hans and franz , two bodybuilders in the mould of arnold schwarzenegger who would appear to urge lesser men to get ' pumped ' .
the sketches would begin : " i am hans ... and i am franz ... and we are here to pump you up . "
if there is any truth in this tenuous link to heidi 's chest , it might explain why the klum version of hans and franz muscled their way out of a million-dollar bra live on american television .
however , the nealon and carvey versions were from austria which would render further investigation of this silly lead redundant .
more likely is that heidi named her breasts after famous germans , of which there have been many bearing the first names hans and franz .
being a well-known soccer fan , heidi could have paid homage to a couple of her country 's greats .
a homage to a solid pair ?

on may 19 , the tally rose further after a suicide bomb killed three soldiers in kunduz , afghanistan .
the deaths of the soldiers , which brought the german fatality toll since the bundeswehr deployed to afghanistan in 2002 to a total of 21 , has not only generated hefty debate in parliament over the security of the troops in afghanistan , but on how to memorialize those who die while serving their country .
while there are little reservations about building a memorial to honor soldiers killed on duty in the country 's post-war armed forces , discussion has centered on the planned location for such a monument . bildunterschrift : a memorial service was held for the fallen soldiers on wednesday german defense minister franz josef jung , who has long harbored plans to honor the fallen soldiers , said the memorial would be erected within the ministry 's premises in berlin .
thomas raabe , spokesman for the defense ministry , said on thursday that the memorial would be located within the bendlerblock compound , the seat of germany 's defense ministry in berlin .
" there will be no changes to that , " he added .
a public memorial ?
but not everyone agrees with locating the memorial within a high-security tract not easily accessible to the general public .
the representative for the armed forces in the german parliament , reinhold robbe , said the majority of soldiers would prefer to see the monument built on a prominent site in berlin .
speaking on the television station rtl , robbe said the monument and its location needed to make clear to all who see it that the bundeswehr is a " parliament 's army . "
the recent fatalities in afghanistan have shown " just how dangerous the job of a soldier is , " and that the soldiers serve " in the name of germany , " robbe added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 3,000 german troops are stationed in afghanistan the head of the cross-party parliamentary committee for cultural affairs , hans-joachim otto , told deutsche welle it was " highly unfortunate that the defense ministry treats the matter of the memorial as its private business . "
" the bundeswehr is a conscription-based army and hence an army of the people .
bundeswehr missions are decided upon in parliament and not in the defense ministry , " he said , adding that as such a more public location would be more in keeping with the nature of germany 's armed forces .
more than a wreath depository peter steinbach , the head of berlin 's german resistance memorial site , also argued against placing the monument behind a closed-off gate at the defense ministry .
such a memorial belongs within view of the public , he said on german public radio .
otherwise , it risks becoming simply a " depository for wreaths . "
with a view to similar memorials in other countries , steinbach said , " no one would ever have suggested that the vietnam memorial in the united sites be built within the pentagon 's courtyard . "
chancellor angela merkel , who in february had suggested a more public location closer to the reichstag as a reminder to the role of parliament in deploying the armed forces , endorsed the ministry 's proposal for erecting the memorial within the bendlerblock compound .
her spokesman ulrich wilhelm said thursday she sees eye-to-eye with the defense minister and that details will be presented within due time .

a german diplomat warned the move could harm the ukraine 's relationship with europe . ukraine 's political crisis escalated on friday as president viktor yushchenko attempted to take control of thousands of interior ministry troops away from his rival prime minister viktor yanukovych . the menacing new twist in a long-running power struggle between the two leaders drew expressions of concern from europe , russia and the united states , which warned against the use of violence . yushchenko ordered that authority over interior ministry forces be removed from the government headed by the premier and transferred to the president , in a decree published on his official website .
the president already controls the army under ukraine 's constitution . the decree covers interior ministry troops with military training often used for anti-riot operations and does not include the police force or the ministry 's elite berkut unit . yanukovych angrily rejected the president 's order as an anti-constitutional " interference in the activities of the executive branch , " while speaking to western diplomats in a televised meeting . parliamentary speaker and yanukovych ally oleksandr moroz went further during the same meeting with foreign diplomats , describing the president 's move as a " coup attempt . " us calls for peaceful resolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of prime minister yanukovych protested friday reacting to the rising political temperature in kiev , the united states called on both sides to resolve their dispute " without violence " and to abide by democratic rules . " we expect the ukrainians to follow their constitutional and legal processes and live up to their responsibilities in a democracy , " national security spokesman gordon johndroe told reporters . prime minister mikhail fradkov of russia , ukraine 's giant neighbor and main trading partner , said that he was " worried " about the escalating tensions and also urged authorities to abide by the law . germany urges restraint bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovych supporters also demonstrated in kiev johannes regenbrecht , a german diplomat at the meeting with yanukovych , warned that the use of force to solve the crisis would have serious consequences in ukraine 's relations with europe .
" all means must be used to avoid an escalation , " regenbrecht said . the european union expressed its and urged the feuding president and prime minister to try to settle the stand-off peacefully .
" the presidency of the european union is increasingly concerned about recent developments in ukraine , " the current german presidency of the eu said in a statement .
" the presidency urges president yushchenko and prime minister yanukovych to assume the responsibility which they have to resolve the political crisis in ukraine through negotiations , as agreed , " the statement said . " these events can not but aggravate the political situation in the country , " eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said in a separate statement from brussels .
" i call upon all political forces in ukraine to do their utmost , on the basis of a constructive attitude and in a peaceful and lawful manner , to find a viable political compromise to solve the current political impasse and to refrain from any action which would further exacerbate the situation , especially by involving the security forces , " she said . " this is vital for the people of ukraine , and for ukraine 's continued progress on the path of political and economic reform . " on thursday , the interior ministry 's elite berkut forces raised the president 's ire by defying his order to dismiss the country 's prosecutor general , a yanukovych ally , who refused to step down calling his dismissal illegal . the elite forces , which are not affected by friday 's decree , arrived at the offices where the prosecutor general was holed up , and scuffled with security personnel controlled by the president . dissolution of parliament prompts crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko dissolved parliament in april the latest round of political recriminations in ukraine began with yushchenko 's dissolution of parliament last month , part of an ongoing dispute with the prime minister over the course of the country . yushchenko , who cancelled a trip to the czech republic on friday due to the latest crisis , favors full integration with the west , including the nato military alliance , while the prime minister favors close ties with moscow . in recent weeks , the two have been locked in stalemate over the timing of new parliamentary elections , and a reported deal appears to be in tatters after the latest stand-off . " i would say that i no longer have any optimism that results can be achieved considering the opposition demonstrated by the two sides , " yushchenko told a meeting of regional leaders on friday , the interfax news agency reported . yanukovych struck a more optimistic note , calling for a " return to political dialogue , " during the televised meeting with foreign diplomats . control over interior ministry forces was crucial in the orange revolution of 2004 , when mass street protests helped bring yushchenko to the presidency , overturning a flawed vote initially granted to yanukovych . reports at the time said yushchenko 's victory over yanukovych was due to a refusal by interior ministry forces to follow orders to crush the " people power " protests . on friday , thousands of yanukovych supporters rallied outside the prosecutor 's office to protest against the president 's decree as part of ongoing anti-yushchenko demonstrations in kiev . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine gripped by stalemate as eu waits for compromise rival demonstrators rallied in the ukrainian capital as defiant prime minister viktor yanukovych rejected a possible concession by his political enemy , president viktor yushchenko .

he did n't forcefully condemn china 's human rights record , saying he would leave specific criticisms to the german government . köhler was almost euphoric as he recounted his " very good talks " with china 's leadership in beijing .
köhler managed to circumvent the minefield in which the issue of human rights had threatened to overshadow his visit , so that at the end , he was back in his element - advocating expanded cooperation with the world 's most populous country in the field of environmental and resource protection .
and , he reported , in this aspect he had found " open doors " in beijing .
köhler showed how impressed he was with china 's new generation of leaders : " they are aware of the problems and challenges of this society and its giant population number of 1.3 billion such as i have experienced from no other leadership , " said the man who had often visited china in the past in other functions .
" they are facing the problems and want to solve them , " he added .
leaving out details bildunterschrift : protestors bring attention to human rights abuses in china the chinese brought up the subject of human rights themselves , köhler said .
they admitted to " mistakes and problems " that they are working on .
but they did not speak about any specific cases .
köhler said that responsibility for talking about specifics rests with the german government .
" it was right for me to present the principles , but detailed human rights issues and cases are something that the german government has to talk about -lrb- with china -rrb- , " he said .
köhler was following a precedent set by former chancellors helmut kohl and gerhard schröder , an editorial in the friday edition of the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
he spoke in abstractions and " philosophized about human rights , but lacked the words to talk about the chinese problems . "
" it was important for me to bring forward the fundamentals , " köhler said .
the tensions in the run up to his meeting amog other things because of the resolution of the german parliament that criticized the " re-education through labor camps " in china , were not further talked about .
the resolution was rejected as " intervention " by beijing .
tapping köhler 's expertise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler said chinese leaders were eager for his advice the german president holds mostly ceremonial and diplomatic duties . he used to head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
state and party leader hu jintao was eager to tap into köhler 's experience in dealing with issues facing china , such as adequate employment for hundreds of millions of rural residents , or how to overcome the gap between the poor western regions and the wealthier coastal population .
they had talked at length , köhler said , about the rapid ageing of china 's population and the effects of this on the pensions and insurance sectors .
china 's leaders were " almost desperate " in asking how such problems might be resolved , he said .
" it was noticeable how he -lrb- hu -rrb- wanted to discuss with me in depth those problems he is itching to deal with , " köhler said .
climate change a central theme bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has serious problems with pollution china pushed for the german government to provide more investement and technology to help develop a key bilateral relationship between the two nations , köhler told reporters after meeting chinese premier wen jiabao in beijing on friday .
china also hopes to see " more action " from germany in areas such as regular bilateral dialogues , and technology transfer related to environmental protection and energy efficiency , köhler said .
koehler said he was impressed with the openness of chinese leaders on environmental protection and their apparent willingness to take more action on climate change .
" it 's the first time that the chinese understand it -lrb- climate change -rrb- as an important issue in itself , " koehler said at the conclusion of his talks in the zhongnanhai compound used by leaders of china 's ruling communist party .
china seemed committed to achieving its targets for reducing carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency , but it lacked capacity and expertise , he said .
köhler said he was optimistic that china would play a " constructive role " in global efforts against climate change .
" china is aware that it is part of the problem , " he said .
" they want to be part of the solution . "
on saturday , köhler will deliver a speech in shanghai to mark the 100th anniversary of tongji university .
he departs for germany later saturday . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german president köhler seeks balance in asia on a week-long tour of asia that includes both vietnam , where he arrived monday , and china , german president horst köhler has worked to find the delicate balance between diplomatic and economic interests .

he did n't forcefully condemn china 's human rights record , saying he would leave specific criticisms to the german government . köhler was almost euphoric as he recounted his " very good talks " with china 's leadership in beijing .
köhler managed to circumvent the minefield in which the issue of human rights had threatened to overshadow his visit , so that at the end , he was back in his element - advocating expanded cooperation with the world 's most populous country in the field of environmental and resource protection .
and , he reported , in this aspect he had found " open doors " in beijing .
köhler showed how impressed he was with china 's new generation of leaders : " they are aware of the problems and challenges of this society and its giant population number of 1.3 billion such as i have experienced from no other leadership , " said the man who had often visited china in the past in other functions .
" they are facing the problems and want to solve them , " he added .
leaving out details bildunterschrift : protestors bring attention to human rights abuses in china the chinese brought up the subject of human rights themselves , köhler said .
they admitted to " mistakes and problems " that they are working on .
but they did not speak about any specific cases .
köhler said that responsibility for talking about specifics rests with the german government .
" it was right for me to present the principles , but detailed human rights issues and cases are something that the german government has to talk about -lrb- with china -rrb- , " he said .
köhler was following a precedent set by former chancellors helmut kohl and gerhard schröder , an editorial in the friday edition of the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
he spoke in abstractions and " philosophized about human rights , but lacked the words to talk about the chinese problems . "
" it was important for me to bring forward the fundamentals , " köhler said .
the tensions in the run up to his meeting amog other things because of the resolution of the german parliament that criticized the " re-education through labor camps " in china , were not further talked about .
the resolution was rejected as " intervention " by beijing .

state and party leader hu jintao was eager to tap into köhler 's experience in dealing with issues facing china , such as adequate employment for hundreds of millions of rural residents , or how to overcome the gap between the poor western regions and the wealthier coastal population .
they had talked at length , köhler said , about the rapid ageing of china 's population and the effects of this on the pensions and insurance sectors .
china 's leaders were " almost desperate " in asking how such problems might be resolved , he said .
" it was noticeable how he -lrb- hu -rrb- wanted to discuss with me in depth those problems he is itching to deal with , " köhler said .
climate change a central theme bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has serious problems with pollution china pushed for the german government to provide more investement and technology to help develop a key bilateral relationship between the two nations , köhler told reporters after meeting chinese premier wen jiabao in beijing on friday .
china also hopes to see " more action " from germany in areas such as regular bilateral dialogues , and technology transfer related to environmental protection and energy efficiency , köhler said .
koehler said he was impressed with the openness of chinese leaders on environmental protection and their apparent willingness to take more action on climate change .
" it 's the first time that the chinese understand it -lrb- climate change -rrb- as an important issue in itself , " koehler said at the conclusion of his talks in the zhongnanhai compound used by leaders of china 's ruling communist party .
china seemed committed to achieving its targets for reducing carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency , but it lacked capacity and expertise , he said .
köhler said he was optimistic that china would play a " constructive role " in global efforts against climate change .
" china is aware that it is part of the problem , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de third reich -pipe- 25.05.2007 exhibit examines divergent fates of german-jewish exiles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new york was the dream destination of many german-jewish emigres .
a new museum exhibit on german jews who fled their homeland between 1933 and 1941 examines the life-changing - and ultimately life-saving - experiences of those who managed to escape the nazi threat . the multimedia exhibit " homeland and exile : emigration of german jews after 1933 " represents the most comprehensive look ever taken at jews who fled germany for over a hundred countries around the world .
the exhibit touches on the larger political issues of the era , but mostly it focuses on the people who were forced to turn their back on their " heimat " - a german word that encompasses both the concept of homeland and the feeling of emotional attachment to it - and their individual and collective journeys to a new life .
why did they go , where did they find refuge , and under what conditions ?
how did they build new lives for themselves , and how did they feel about their " home countries " both new and old ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young emigrants aboard the ship " martha washington , " en route to palestine the exhibit tackles these questions with commentated displays that briefly describe the widespread anti-semitism and curtailment of civil liberties that led some 280,000 of the 500,000 jews living in germany to emigrate , starting in 1933 .
-lrb- one artefact from that time on display : a children 's board game called jews out ! that involved driving out jew-shaped playing pieces from a town full of shops with names like " salomon 's money lenders . " -rrb-
from there , the story turns to the ways and means of leaving , with the show dividing thematically into rooms devoted to the stories of those who shipped off for destinations across europe , the americas , africa and asia .
on on a 3-d interactive map , museum-goers can pinpoint the 100 countries that eventually allowed jewish refugees entry .
farming in the dominican republic the curators make clear that some destinations were seen as more desirable than others .
the most sought after visa , limited in number and only available to those with an affidavit of support , was for the us .
less preferred was shanghai , which nonetheless became the last chance for escape for some 18,000 to 20,000 jews , thanks to its policy of allowing entry without a visa up to 1941 .
one of the odder histories in this section involves a plan hatched by the then-dictator of the dominican republic , rafael trujillo , to imported jewish " agricultural experts " in an effort to " whiten " his population , and give the country a needed injection of economic energy .
most of the artefacts on display are from the permanent collections of the jewish museum in berlin , where the show ran from sept . , 2006 to april , 2007 , and from other historical collections , explained cilly kugelmann , progam director of the berlin jewish museum .
" there are people who kept everything , every paper , every letter .
that generation is dying out , and they know their children wo n't take care of their things , so they donate it to historical collections , " she explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil liberties for jews were curtailed under the nazis kugelmann said her own favorite artefact is a coin purse kept by a man whose arduous journey out of germany involved going through numerous countries ; he eventually settled in portugal , but kept change in the purse from each stop along the way .
reconstructing lives from ephemera ephemera from the era -lrb- photographs , poems , diaries , ticket stubs , letters -rrb- is interspersed with objects. suitcases , clothing , coffee pots , dolls ; anything either left behind , taken along , or taken up as part of a new life in a new land .
possibly most compelling are the interactive kiosks that allow viewers to hear the emigres ' personal stories .
videotaped interviews are broken down into short , accessible segments under different categories , and english subtitles are available .
overall , kugelmann said , the exhibit tells a story of a people who did a " remarkably successful " job of adjusting to a difficult situation - even if some of the people faced depression , unhappiness , and even committed suicide .
their success as immigrants was one of the main reasons to create the exhibit , explained kugelmann .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a child 's view of its new world " many of the people who left embarked on their new lives with a certain distinctive , ironic pragmatism , " she said .
" we wondered , ' why were they relatively so successful ?
their children went on to be successful .
how did they do it ? "
a more positive view of the nazi era ?
kugelmann also implied that , more than half a century after the fact , it may be time for germany to start looking at the story of the holocaust from a new angle .
" over the past 60 years , german society has developed a relationship to the nazi period in which the mass murder has become the sole paradigm , " she said .
" the survival of almost two-thirds of german jews was simply ignored . "
and jürgen reiche , exhibitions director at the museum of contemporary history , also said he hoped the exhibit will incite young people to take a new look at germany , past and present .
" we sometimes forget that german-jewish history is also german history , " he said .
' they were robbed of a homeland " but hebrew university historian moshe zimmermann , who consulted on the exhibit , warned of the tendency to concentrate on the well-known successes among the refugees from the nazis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the exhibition focuses on the exiled children " the idea is often that the emigration didn ’ t destroy many lives .
people think of thomas mann , billy wilder , henry kissinger .
and they say , ' they left germany , it was n't so tragic , " he said .
" people say , ' they could find a home elsewhere because jews are like that . ' … but if you start thinking that way , you 're starting with the wrong idea . "
as the word " heimat " in the title of the exhibit makes clear , " the émigrés were , despite everything , german , " zimmermann said .
" they were germans who were jews .
and they were robbed of their homeland . "
" there is no plural for the word heimat .

a new museum exhibit on german jews who fled their homeland between 1933 and 1941 examines the life-changing - and ultimately life-saving - experiences of those who managed to escape the nazi threat . the multimedia exhibit " homeland and exile : emigration of german jews after 1933 " represents the most comprehensive look ever taken at jews who fled germany for over a hundred countries around the world .
the exhibit touches on the larger political issues of the era , but mostly it focuses on the people who were forced to turn their back on their " heimat " - a german word that encompasses both the concept of homeland and the feeling of emotional attachment to it - and their individual and collective journeys to a new life .
why did they go , where did they find refuge , and under what conditions ?
how did they build new lives for themselves , and how did they feel about their " home countries " both new and old ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young emigrants aboard the ship " martha washington , " en route to palestine the exhibit tackles these questions with commentated displays that briefly describe the widespread anti-semitism and curtailment of civil liberties that led some 280,000 of the 500,000 jews living in germany to emigrate , starting in 1933 .
-lrb- one artefact from that time on display : a children 's board game called jews out ! that involved driving out jew-shaped playing pieces from a town full of shops with names like " salomon 's money lenders . " -rrb-
from there , the story turns to the ways and means of leaving , with the show dividing thematically into rooms devoted to the stories of those who shipped off for destinations across europe , the americas , africa and asia .
on on a 3-d interactive map , museum-goers can pinpoint the 100 countries that eventually allowed jewish refugees entry .
farming in the dominican republic the curators make clear that some destinations were seen as more desirable than others .
the most sought after visa , limited in number and only available to those with an affidavit of support , was for the us .
less preferred was shanghai , which nonetheless became the last chance for escape for some 18,000 to 20,000 jews , thanks to its policy of allowing entry without a visa up to 1941 .
one of the odder histories in this section involves a plan hatched by the then-dictator of the dominican republic , rafael trujillo , to imported jewish " agricultural experts " in an effort to " whiten " his population , and give the country a needed injection of economic energy .
most of the artefacts on display are from the permanent collections of the jewish museum in berlin , where the show ran from sept . , 2006 to april , 2007 , and from other historical collections , explained cilly kugelmann , progam director of the berlin jewish museum .
" there are people who kept everything , every paper , every letter .
that generation is dying out , and they know their children wo n't take care of their things , so they donate it to historical collections , " she explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil liberties for jews were curtailed under the nazis kugelmann said her own favorite artefact is a coin purse kept by a man whose arduous journey out of germany involved going through numerous countries ; he eventually settled in portugal , but kept change in the purse from each stop along the way .
reconstructing lives from ephemera ephemera from the era -lrb- photographs , poems , diaries , ticket stubs , letters -rrb- is interspersed with objects. suitcases , clothing , coffee pots , dolls ; anything either left behind , taken along , or taken up as part of a new life in a new land .
possibly most compelling are the interactive kiosks that allow viewers to hear the emigres ' personal stories .
videotaped interviews are broken down into short , accessible segments under different categories , and english subtitles are available .
overall , kugelmann said , the exhibit tells a story of a people who did a " remarkably successful " job of adjusting to a difficult situation - even if some of the people faced depression , unhappiness , and even committed suicide .
their success as immigrants was one of the main reasons to create the exhibit , explained kugelmann .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a child 's view of its new world " many of the people who left embarked on their new lives with a certain distinctive , ironic pragmatism , " she said .
" we wondered , ' why were they relatively so successful ?
their children went on to be successful .
how did they do it ? "
a more positive view of the nazi era ?
kugelmann also implied that , more than half a century after the fact , it may be time for germany to start looking at the story of the holocaust from a new angle .
" over the past 60 years , german society has developed a relationship to the nazi period in which the mass murder has become the sole paradigm , " she said .
" the survival of almost two-thirds of german jews was simply ignored . "
and jürgen reiche , exhibitions director at the museum of contemporary history , also said he hoped the exhibit will incite young people to take a new look at germany , past and present .
" we sometimes forget that german-jewish history is also german history , " he said .
' they were robbed of a homeland " but hebrew university historian moshe zimmermann , who consulted on the exhibit , warned of the tendency to concentrate on the well-known successes among the refugees from the nazis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the exhibition focuses on the exiled children " the idea is often that the emigration didn ’ t destroy many lives .
people think of thomas mann , billy wilder , henry kissinger .
and they say , ' they left germany , it was n't so tragic , " he said .
" people say , ' they could find a home elsewhere because jews are like that . ' … but if you start thinking that way , you 're starting with the wrong idea . "

a new museum exhibit on german jews who fled their homeland between 1933 and 1941 examines the life-changing - and ultimately life-saving - experiences of those who managed to escape the nazi threat . the multimedia exhibit " homeland and exile : emigration of german jews after 1933 " represents the most comprehensive look ever taken at jews who fled germany for over a hundred countries around the world .
the exhibit touches on the larger political issues of the era , but mostly it focuses on the people who were forced to turn their back on their " heimat " - a german word that encompasses both the concept of homeland and the feeling of emotional attachment to it - and their individual and collective journeys to a new life .
why did they go , where did they find refuge , and under what conditions ?
how did they build new lives for themselves , and how did they feel about their " home countries " both new and old ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young emigrants aboard the ship " martha washington , " en route to palestine the exhibit tackles these questions with commentated displays that briefly describe the widespread anti-semitism and curtailment of civil liberties that led some 280,000 of the 500,000 jews living in germany to emigrate , starting in 1933 .
-lrb- one artefact from that time on display : a children 's board game called jews out ! that involved driving out jew-shaped playing pieces from a town full of shops with names like " salomon 's money lenders . " -rrb-
from there , the story turns to the ways and means of leaving , with the show dividing thematically into rooms devoted to the stories of those who shipped off for destinations across europe , the americas , africa and asia .
on on a 3-d interactive map , museum-goers can pinpoint the 100 countries that eventually allowed jewish refugees entry .
farming in the dominican republic the curators make clear that some destinations were seen as more desirable than others .
the most sought after visa , limited in number and only available to those with an affidavit of support , was for the us .
less preferred was shanghai , which nonetheless became the last chance for escape for some 18,000 to 20,000 jews , thanks to its policy of allowing entry without a visa up to 1941 .
one of the odder histories in this section involves a plan hatched by the then-dictator of the dominican republic , rafael trujillo , to imported jewish " agricultural experts " in an effort to " whiten " his population , and give the country a needed injection of economic energy .
most of the artefacts on display are from the permanent collections of the jewish museum in berlin , where the show ran from sept . , 2006 to april , 2007 , and from other historical collections , explained cilly kugelmann , progam director of the berlin jewish museum .
" there are people who kept everything , every paper , every letter .
that generation is dying out , and they know their children wo n't take care of their things , so they donate it to historical collections , " she explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil liberties for jews were curtailed under the nazis kugelmann said her own favorite artefact is a coin purse kept by a man whose arduous journey out of germany involved going through numerous countries ; he eventually settled in portugal , but kept change in the purse from each stop along the way .
reconstructing lives from ephemera ephemera from the era -lrb- photographs , poems , diaries , ticket stubs , letters -rrb- is interspersed with objects. suitcases , clothing , coffee pots , dolls ; anything either left behind , taken along , or taken up as part of a new life in a new land .
possibly most compelling are the interactive kiosks that allow viewers to hear the emigres ' personal stories .
videotaped interviews are broken down into short , accessible segments under different categories , and english subtitles are available .
overall , kugelmann said , the exhibit tells a story of a people who did a " remarkably successful " job of adjusting to a difficult situation - even if some of the people faced depression , unhappiness , and even committed suicide .
their success as immigrants was one of the main reasons to create the exhibit , explained kugelmann .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a child 's view of its new world " many of the people who left embarked on their new lives with a certain distinctive , ironic pragmatism , " she said .
" we wondered , ' why were they relatively so successful ?
their children went on to be successful .
how did they do it ? "
a more positive view of the nazi era ?
kugelmann also implied that , more than half a century after the fact , it may be time for germany to start looking at the story of the holocaust from a new angle .
" over the past 60 years , german society has developed a relationship to the nazi period in which the mass murder has become the sole paradigm , " she said .
" the survival of almost two-thirds of german jews was simply ignored . "
and jürgen reiche , exhibitions director at the museum of contemporary history , also said he hoped the exhibit will incite young people to take a new look at germany , past and present .
" we sometimes forget that german-jewish history is also german history , " he said .
' they were robbed of a homeland " but hebrew university historian moshe zimmermann , who consulted on the exhibit , warned of the tendency to concentrate on the well-known successes among the refugees from the nazis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the exhibition focuses on the exiled children " the idea is often that the emigration didn ’ t destroy many lives .
people think of thomas mann , billy wilder , henry kissinger .
and they say , ' they left germany , it was n't so tragic , " he said .
" people say , ' they could find a home elsewhere because jews are like that . ' … but if you start thinking that way , you 're starting with the wrong idea . "
as the word " heimat " in the title of the exhibit makes clear , " the émigrés were , despite everything , german , " zimmermann said .
" they were germans who were jews .
and they were robbed of their homeland . "
" there is no plural for the word heimat .

he did n't forcefully condemn china 's human rights record , saying he would leave specific criticisms to the german government . köhler was almost euphoric as he recounted his " very good talks " with china 's leadership in beijing .
köhler managed to circumvent the minefield in which the issue of human rights had threatened to overshadow his visit , so that at the end , he was back in his element - advocating expanded cooperation with the world 's most populous country in the field of environmental and resource protection .
and , he reported , in this aspect he had found " open doors " in beijing .
köhler showed how impressed he was with china 's new generation of leaders : " they are aware of the problems and challenges of this society and its giant population number of 1.3 billion such as i have experienced from no other leadership , " said the man who had often visited china in the past in other functions .
" they are facing the problems and want to solve them , " he added .

they admitted to " mistakes and problems " that they are working on .

köhler said that responsibility for talking about specifics rests with the german government .
" it was right for me to present the principles , but detailed human rights issues and cases are something that the german government has to talk about -lrb- with china -rrb- , " he said .
köhler was following a precedent set by former chancellors helmut kohl and gerhard schröder , an editorial in the friday edition of the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
he spoke in abstractions and " philosophized about human rights , but lacked the words to talk about the chinese problems . "
" it was important for me to bring forward the fundamentals , " köhler said .
the tensions in the run up to his meeting amog other things because of the resolution of the german parliament that criticized the " re-education through labor camps " in china , were not further talked about .
the resolution was rejected as " intervention " by beijing .

they had talked at length , köhler said , about the rapid ageing of china 's population and the effects of this on the pensions and insurance sectors .

finance minister peer steinbrück said the move will improve germany 's standing on the global market . the german parliament on friday paved the way for the country ’ s biggest corporate tax reform in post-world war ii history , which would put its rates on par with the rest of europe .
as of jan .
1 , 2008 , corporate tax will be lowered to 30 percent from the current rate of 39 percent - the highest in the european union .
" this corporate tax reform will make germany a more attractive place for investment , " said steinbrück .
he added in an interview broadcast on public radio friday that all citizens would benefit from the reform because tax revenues would actually increase , at least in the mid-term , though critics have warned of an initial loss of around 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.7 billion -rrb- . the bill , which is expected to be approved by germany 's upper parliamentary house before the summer recess , would also prevent companies from getting tax benefits in germany by taking loans via subsidiaries abroad .
a " blessing of billions " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister steinbrueck said the reform will make germany attractive to investors criticism of the reform has come mainly from the leftist fraction , the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the greens .
chairman of the left party 's parliamentary group , oskar lafontaine , called the corporate tax bill a " blessing of billions for big business , " adding that it would be better to adjust income tax rates for small companies .
jan paul bach , the owner of a 15-employee company near berlin that produces high-tech ceramic elements , said the changes were necessary for germany to keep up in the global marketplace .
" i think the tax reform is necessary to compete with new economies like china or india , which have lower ages and a better position in the global economy , " bach told deutsche welle .
he added , however that he did n't think it was fair that " big companies pay lower taxes while the employees have to pay higher taxes . " to make up for the cuts , germany is abolishing tax holidays , which have mainly benefited multinationals .
an inheritance tax reform is also in the works , on the initiative of the social democratic party , which is part of a series of tax adjustments meant to offset the corporate tax reform . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german family-owned businesses often upstage the big guys a new study has shown that family-owned businesses in germany from 2003 to 2005 performed better than dax firms in both job creation and sales growth .

protesters will be able to march through several country lanes but will not be allowed into the resort or closer than 200 meters -lrb- about 650 feet -rrb- to the barbed-wire-topped fence when leaders of eight main nations meet june 6-8 .
police search mail boxes anti-globalization groups have described a widening police probe into a spate of anti-g8 petrol bombings in hamburg and berlin as excessive .
the postal company , deutsche post , confirmed officers looked through mail from tuesday to thursday at a hamburg sorting center .
police also accompanied a postman who was clearing city letter-boxes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the green party set up paper version of g8 leaders this week to protest the summit " these were interceptions with judicial permission after letters claiming responsibility turned up , " said branch director detlef kreutzer .
there have been more than a dozen night-time attacks on cars and homes with petrol bombs in recent months in hamburg , but no arrests .
no one has been injured .
on may 9 , riots broke out in hamburg after police raids on a leftist center in the city .
the arson attacks have continued to damage property .
claims of responsibility sent to media have criticized both the g8 and german industry .
criticism for crack-down german police have faced criticism from the media for not catching any of the radicals , as well as criticism from anti-globalization activists that the hunt for a few has led to treating the whole movement as suspects .
mainstream aid and environmentalist groups said this week that the main rally in the nearby city of rostock before the summit would be peaceful .
monty schädel , a coordinator in rostock of the protests , welcomed the schwerin court ruling , saying it was a rebuke to police .
german interior minister wolfgang schäuble defended the restrictions , saying he had to ensure the safety of summit guests .

at the same time , the athlete is expected to be a clean-cut do-gooder , ready to cast aside all signs of exertion and bedazzle the cameras with an eloquent post-match interview . of course , the athlete will achieve all of this on bread and water alone . how one person is supposed to be all that , nobody wants to know . people who live in glass houses ... this rigmarole is not without hypocrisy .
for what is it that we non-athletes do ?
we send our kids to school with sedatives .
we indulge in a little booze during lunch time , or even before we arrive at the office .
we can barely survive without nicotine and alcohol .
and we drink liter after liter of coffee , so that we can do it all . we are a drug nation : at the first sign of a mild cold , we immediately pour a bottle of cough medicine - which , by the way , is prohibited for athletes - down our throats , or just stay in bed griping . ultimately , competitive sports are a mirror image of our society , and is therefore no better or worse than us .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 25.05.2007 opinion : reputation of competitive sports is on the line großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more professional cyclists are admitting to illegal doping .
if the sport is to change and become clean then the three-martini business lunch has to go , according to dw sports editor wolfgang von kann . this week , germany 's tabloid bild zeitung asked , " mr. ullrich , you really did n't know about this ? " but the affair has long gone beyond jan ullrich or any of the other big names .
sure , if yet another cyclist from ullrich & co. were to come out of the doping closet , it would help illuminate the situation further - but it would be essentially meaningless . that 's because today , much more is on the line than the careers of a few cyclists .
anyone who has been following recent developments in athletics , swimming , triathlon or cross-country skiing - to say nothing of weightlifting - will hardly claim that the morass of doping scandals is confined to the cycling arena . we are now talking about competitive sports in general .
this is about breaking up structures with unmistakably mafiaesque semblances .
ultimately , the reputation of all competitive sports is on the line . our unsung heroes but even that is a generalization that scratches at the surface but skirts the core of the issue .
indeed , the central question has yet to be asked : to what extent are we - consumers , viewers , fans and also the media - to blame for all of this ?
what kind of society are we living in , anyway ? it is time to examine the demands we place on our athletes .
barely 20 years old , they are expected to act as role models - a part only few come by voluntarily .
in their twenties , they are supposed to be the shining heroes who make no mistakes and scoop up all the medals at the olympic games .
and over 30 , they are meant to do everything they can to prove that age does n't matter . craving new records where do the fans of cycling races stand ?
at the top of the hill , where the riders hurt the most .
what do people want to see at track-and-field events ?
they are waiting for the world record .
and what do they want at weightlifting competitions ?
they want to see more weight loaded on the bar . the limits of athletic achievement are constantly being pushed .
at the same time , the athlete is expected to be a clean-cut do-gooder , ready to cast aside all signs of exertion and bedazzle the cameras with an eloquent post-match interview . of course , the athlete will achieve all of this on bread and water alone . how one person is supposed to be all that , nobody wants to know . people who live in glass houses ... this rigmarole is not without hypocrisy .

" we have all adopted specific legislation to fight this phenomenon , but we still have to make progress in transferring international agreements in this area into our domestic laws , " zypries said .
the ministers also discussed the necessity of getting help from internet providers since the internet makes it easy for pedophiles to share child pornography .
" we need to put in place rules in every country to ensure that internet providers inform the authorities if they find images of pedophilia , " said french justice minister rachida dati .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 25.05.2007 opinion : reputation of competitive sports is on the line großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more professional cyclists are admitting to illegal doping .
if the sport is to change and become clean then the three-martini business lunch has to go , according to dw sports editor wolfgang von kann . this week , germany 's tabloid bild zeitung asked , " mr. ullrich , you really did n't know about this ? " but the affair has long gone beyond jan ullrich or any of the other big names .
sure , if yet another cyclist from ullrich & co. were to come out of the doping closet , it would help illuminate the situation further - but it would be essentially meaningless . that 's because today , much more is on the line than the careers of a few cyclists .
anyone who has been following recent developments in athletics , swimming , triathlon or cross-country skiing - to say nothing of weightlifting - will hardly claim that the morass of doping scandals is confined to the cycling arena . we are now talking about competitive sports in general .
this is about breaking up structures with unmistakably mafiaesque semblances .
ultimately , the reputation of all competitive sports is on the line . our unsung heroes but even that is a generalization that scratches at the surface but skirts the core of the issue .
indeed , the central question has yet to be asked : to what extent are we - consumers , viewers , fans and also the media - to blame for all of this ?
what kind of society are we living in , anyway ? it is time to examine the demands we place on our athletes .
barely 20 years old , they are expected to act as role models - a part only few come by voluntarily .
in their twenties , they are supposed to be the shining heroes who make no mistakes and scoop up all the medals at the olympic games .
and over 30 , they are meant to do everything they can to prove that age does n't matter . craving new records where do the fans of cycling races stand ?
at the top of the hill , where the riders hurt the most .
what do people want to see at track-and-field events ?
they are waiting for the world record .
and what do they want at weightlifting competitions ?
they want to see more weight loaded on the bar . the limits of athletic achievement are constantly being pushed .
at the same time , the athlete is expected to be a clean-cut do-gooder , ready to cast aside all signs of exertion and bedazzle the cameras with an eloquent post-match interview . of course , the athlete will achieve all of this on bread and water alone . how one person is supposed to be all that , nobody wants to know . people who live in glass houses ... this rigmarole is not without hypocrisy .
for what is it that we non-athletes do ?
we send our kids to school with sedatives .
we indulge in a little booze during lunch time , or even before we arrive at the office .
we can barely survive without nicotine and alcohol .
and we drink liter after liter of coffee , so that we can do it all . we are a drug nation : at the first sign of a mild cold , we immediately pour a bottle of cough medicine - which , by the way , is prohibited for athletes - down our throats , or just stay in bed griping . ultimately , competitive sports are a mirror image of our society , and is therefore no better or worse than us .

on may 19 , the tally rose further after a suicide bomb killed three soldiers in kunduz , afghanistan .
the deaths of the soldiers , which brought the german fatality toll since the bundeswehr deployed to afghanistan in 2002 to a total of 21 , has not only generated hefty debate in parliament over the security of the troops in afghanistan , but on how to memorialize those who die while serving their country .
while there are little reservations about building a memorial to honor soldiers killed on duty in the country 's post-war armed forces , discussion has centered on the planned location for such a monument . bildunterschrift : a memorial service was held for the fallen soldiers on wednesday german defense minister franz josef jung , who has long harbored plans to honor the fallen soldiers , said the memorial would be erected within the ministry 's premises in berlin .
thomas raabe , spokesman for the defense ministry , said on thursday that the memorial would be located within the bendlerblock compound , the seat of germany 's defense ministry in berlin .
" there will be no changes to that , " he added .
a public memorial ?
but not everyone agrees with locating the memorial within a high-security tract not easily accessible to the general public .
the representative for the armed forces in the german parliament , reinhold robbe , said the majority of soldiers would prefer to see the monument built on a prominent site in berlin .
speaking on the television station rtl , robbe said the monument and its location needed to make clear to all who see it that the bundeswehr is a " parliament 's army . "
the recent fatalities in afghanistan have shown " just how dangerous the job of a soldier is , " and that the soldiers serve " in the name of germany , " robbe added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 3,000 german troops are stationed in afghanistan the head of the cross-party parliamentary committee for cultural affairs , hans-joachim otto , told deutsche welle it was " highly unfortunate that the defense ministry treats the matter of the memorial as its private business . "
" the bundeswehr is a conscription-based army and hence an army of the people .
bundeswehr missions are decided upon in parliament and not in the defense ministry , " he said , adding that as such a more public location would be more in keeping with the nature of germany 's armed forces .
more than a wreath depository peter steinbach , the head of berlin 's german resistance memorial site , also argued against placing the monument behind a closed-off gate at the defense ministry .
such a memorial belongs within view of the public , he said on german public radio .
otherwise , it risks becoming simply a " depository for wreaths . "
with a view to similar memorials in other countries , steinbach said , " no one would ever have suggested that the vietnam memorial in the united sites be built within the pentagon 's courtyard . "
chancellor angela merkel , who in february had suggested a more public location closer to the reichstag as a reminder to the role of parliament in deploying the armed forces , endorsed the ministry 's proposal for erecting the memorial within the bendlerblock compound .
her spokesman ulrich wilhelm said thursday she sees eye-to-eye with the defense minister and that details will be presented within due time .

thomas raabe , spokesman for the defense ministry , said on thursday that the memorial would be located within the bendlerblock compound , the seat of germany 's defense ministry in berlin .
" there will be no changes to that , " he added .
a public memorial ?
but not everyone agrees with locating the memorial within a high-security tract not easily accessible to the general public .
the representative for the armed forces in the german parliament , reinhold robbe , said the majority of soldiers would prefer to see the monument built on a prominent site in berlin .
speaking on the television station rtl , robbe said the monument and its location needed to make clear to all who see it that the bundeswehr is a " parliament 's army . "
the recent fatalities in afghanistan have shown " just how dangerous the job of a soldier is , " and that the soldiers serve " in the name of germany , " robbe added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 3,000 german troops are stationed in afghanistan the head of the cross-party parliamentary committee for cultural affairs , hans-joachim otto , told deutsche welle it was " highly unfortunate that the defense ministry treats the matter of the memorial as its private business . "
" the bundeswehr is a conscription-based army and hence an army of the people .
bundeswehr missions are decided upon in parliament and not in the defense ministry , " he said , adding that as such a more public location would be more in keeping with the nature of germany 's armed forces .
more than a wreath depository peter steinbach , the head of berlin 's german resistance memorial site , also argued against placing the monument behind a closed-off gate at the defense ministry .
such a memorial belongs within view of the public , he said on german public radio .
otherwise , it risks becoming simply a " depository for wreaths . "
with a view to similar memorials in other countries , steinbach said , " no one would ever have suggested that the vietnam memorial in the united sites be built within the pentagon 's courtyard . "
chancellor angela merkel , who in february had suggested a more public location closer to the reichstag as a reminder to the role of parliament in deploying the armed forces , endorsed the ministry 's proposal for erecting the memorial within the bendlerblock compound .
her spokesman ulrich wilhelm said thursday she sees eye-to-eye with the defense minister and that details will be presented within due time .
despite the ongoing debate , jung is expected to lay the cornerstone for the memorial later this year . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " german military can be strong complement in afghanistan " additional questions about germany 's role in afghanistan arose when three of its soldiers lost their lives in a suicide bombing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 25.05.2007 ladies and gentlemen , heidi klum presents hans and franz großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heidi klum quite aptly takes hans and franz to the golden globes awards german supermodel heidi klum has revealed that she calls her breasts hans and franz .
while that may be more information than most people need to know , others feel as though heidi has n't gone far enough . as two of the more obvious assets of a world famous lingerie model , hans and franz should be more or less used to the eyes of the world being trained on them .
however , despite one unexpected public appearance on the jay leno show in the us when they broke free of an 5.9 million-euro -lrb- $ 8 million -rrb- diamond-encrusted bra , heidi klum 's breasts are usually kept under wraps .
but after the german supermodel revealed her mammary monikers on thursday , worldwide attention has been more concentrated on the 35-inch bust than usual .
hans and franz have been stars of the victoria 's secrets lingerie catwalk shows and adverts for the past ten years but until heidi officially out-ed them as having names this week , they were more appreciated as just being part of the overall , highly aesthetic package .
now they are famous in the own right , people are clambering to know more and more about them .
and just like any new stars being embraced by the cult of celebrity , speculation about them is already rife on the international gossip pages .
no strangers to the limelight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans , franz and victoria 's secrets heidi herself is unique among supermodels for her openness , down-to-earth quality and sense of humor .
but , as with so many of her kind in the fashion world , she obviously believes that less is more .
while anyone who has seen her parading down a runway in the smallest of smalls will attest , this will come as no surprise .
however , in this case , the dearth is not of cloth covering her modesty but the information she is offering on hans and franz .
for one , which is which ?
does hans sit at her right hand or the left ?
also , from whom did the names originate ?
are they named after ex-partners , family relatives or friends ?
what are their likes and dislikes ?
-lrb- this last one will surely turn up in forthcoming interviews with heidi 's husband , the singer seal . -rrb-
all the 33-year-old from bergisch gladbach near cologne will say is that she gave her famous assets the stereotypically german names in homage to her homeland .
" they 've been an ongoing joke for , like , 12 years .
it started because i was from germany , and people always make fun of ze germans , yah ?
so when i began modeling i used to say , ' these are german breasts , one is called hans and one is called franz . " '
inspired by bodybuilder sketch ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did heidi name her breasts after a us comedy routine ?
from the fringe is just one of the many columns that believes there may be more to it that that .
one theory could be that the breasts are named after the characters of a sketch on us comedy show saturday night live .
comedians kevin nealon and dana carvey starred as hans and franz , two bodybuilders in the mould of arnold schwarzenegger who would appear to urge lesser men to get ' pumped ' .
the sketches would begin : " i am hans ... and i am franz ... and we are here to pump you up . "
if there is any truth in this tenuous link to heidi 's chest , it might explain why the klum version of hans and franz muscled their way out of a million-dollar bra live on american television .
however , the nealon and carvey versions were from austria which would render further investigation of this silly lead redundant .
more likely is that heidi named her breasts after famous germans , of which there have been many bearing the first names hans and franz .
being a well-known soccer fan , heidi could have paid homage to a couple of her country 's greats .
a homage to a solid pair ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz -lrb- beckenbauer , that is -rrb- is the one on the right born a year before the 1974 world cup triumph on home soil , maybe ms. klum dedicated her own solid pairing to the central defensive stalwarts of the winning team hans-georg schwarzenbeck and franz beckenbauer .
again , this is pure speculation on from the fringe 's part .
other than the origins of their names and the positioning of each , other questions arising from hans and franz 's introduction to the world include those pertaining to worth .
while casual observers may conclude that they are indeed priceless , as a model whose earnings were estimated by forbes magazine last year at 4.7 million euros , heidi will surely be looking to put a price on her now even-more-famous breasts .
she did after all insure her legs for 3.18 million euros .
what price for hans and franz , one wonders ?
and will they both be worth the same ?
a small scar on one of heidi 's legs means that one is more expensive than the other .
what imperfections , if any , could reduce the worth of either hans or franz ?
come on heidi , enquiring minds need to know ! dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de heidi klum accused of promoting anorexia in germany german media has attacked supermodel heidi klum for a new fashion reality tv show that they charged promotes eating disorders among young women .

he did n't forcefully condemn china 's human rights record , saying he would leave specific criticisms to the german government . köhler was almost euphoric as he recounted his " very good talks " with china 's leadership in beijing .
köhler managed to circumvent the minefield in which the issue of human rights had threatened to overshadow his visit , so that at the end , he was back in his element - advocating expanded cooperation with the world 's most populous country in the field of environmental and resource protection .
and , he reported , in this aspect he had found " open doors " in beijing .
köhler showed how impressed he was with china 's new generation of leaders : " they are aware of the problems and challenges of this society and its giant population number of 1.3 billion such as i have experienced from no other leadership , " said the man who had often visited china in the past in other functions .
" they are facing the problems and want to solve them , " he added .
leaving out details bildunterschrift : protestors bring attention to human rights abuses in china the chinese brought up the subject of human rights themselves , köhler said .
they admitted to " mistakes and problems " that they are working on .
but they did not speak about any specific cases .
köhler said that responsibility for talking about specifics rests with the german government .
" it was right for me to present the principles , but detailed human rights issues and cases are something that the german government has to talk about -lrb- with china -rrb- , " he said .
köhler was following a precedent set by former chancellors helmut kohl and gerhard schröder , an editorial in the friday edition of the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
he spoke in abstractions and " philosophized about human rights , but lacked the words to talk about the chinese problems . "
" it was important for me to bring forward the fundamentals , " köhler said .
the tensions in the run up to his meeting amog other things because of the resolution of the german parliament that criticized the " re-education through labor camps " in china , were not further talked about .
the resolution was rejected as " intervention " by beijing .
tapping köhler 's expertise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler said chinese leaders were eager for his advice the german president holds mostly ceremonial and diplomatic duties . he used to head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
state and party leader hu jintao was eager to tap into köhler 's experience in dealing with issues facing china , such as adequate employment for hundreds of millions of rural residents , or how to overcome the gap between the poor western regions and the wealthier coastal population .
they had talked at length , köhler said , about the rapid ageing of china 's population and the effects of this on the pensions and insurance sectors .
china 's leaders were " almost desperate " in asking how such problems might be resolved , he said .
" it was noticeable how he -lrb- hu -rrb- wanted to discuss with me in depth those problems he is itching to deal with , " köhler said .
climate change a central theme bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has serious problems with pollution china pushed for the german government to provide more investement and technology to help develop a key bilateral relationship between the two nations , köhler told reporters after meeting chinese premier wen jiabao in beijing on friday .
china also hopes to see " more action " from germany in areas such as regular bilateral dialogues , and technology transfer related to environmental protection and energy efficiency , köhler said .
koehler said he was impressed with the openness of chinese leaders on environmental protection and their apparent willingness to take more action on climate change .
" it 's the first time that the chinese understand it -lrb- climate change -rrb- as an important issue in itself , " koehler said at the conclusion of his talks in the zhongnanhai compound used by leaders of china 's ruling communist party .
china seemed committed to achieving its targets for reducing carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency , but it lacked capacity and expertise , he said .
köhler said he was optimistic that china would play a " constructive role " in global efforts against climate change .
" china is aware that it is part of the problem , " he said .
" they want to be part of the solution . "
on saturday , köhler will deliver a speech in shanghai to mark the 100th anniversary of tongji university .

france 's sarkozy thinks not on a diplomatic tour of europe , french president nicolas sarkozy expressed his opposition to turkey 's eu membership bid .
the newly elected french leader also championed the idea of a " simplified treaty " for the eu . nicolas sarkozy has n't been in office for three weeks , but his policy offensive to reclaim france 's leadership in the european union is in full swing . on a diplomatic tour of european countries , sarkozy championed the idea of a " simplified treaty " to replace the failed eu constitution .
european commission chief jose manuel barroso said the idea was gaining support . " -lrb- sarkozy -rrb- was the first to suggest the idea of a simplified treaty , and today we see that there is a consensus forming around this idea , " barroso told reporters at a joint press conference with sarkozy . the french president also took the opportunity of his first visit to brussels since taking power on may 6 to reaffirm his opposition to turkey 's bid to join the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and barroso have differing views on turkey " i do n't see how you can be a candidate with one opinion and a president with another , " sarkozy said .
" i do n't think that turkey has a place in the union , " he concluded , but added that he did not want to dwell on the issue at present . " the question does n't arise at present and we already have enough on our plate , " sarkozy explained . barroso stressed that his european commission was " in favor of negotiations with turkey , " but concurred with sarkozy that " right now , our absolute priority is the treaty , the resolution of the institutional crisis . " constitution , mini-treaty , simplified treaty on the eu 's institutional gridlock , the french president said a european summit next month would be a success " if the 27 -lrb- eu member states -rrb- are in agreement for a simplified treaty . " in france , such a treaty could be submitted for approval by the parliament in order to avoid a repeat of the 2005 popular referenda that cut down the now moribund eu constitution . after french voters rejected the original constitution , france found itself playing an increasingly marginal role in the club of architects of the new europe .
sarkozy 's government now wants to reclaim france 's leadership in the eu , a campaign promise that had been trumpeted by both sarkozy and runner-up ségolène royal . last year , sarkozy had used the term " mini-treaty " to describe what he felt would be an acceptable constitutional framework for the eu .
the french leader said he recognized now that " mini-treaty " lacks ambition . eighteen member states have ratified the original constitution , which was deemed necessary to bring eu institutions up to date in the expanded bloc .
but any new treaty will have to revisit some controversial topics , such as references to " shared values , " which were understood by some observers as a coded exclusion of turkey from the eu club . " we must work together " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan called sarkozy to propose a get-together turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan phoned sarkozy on thursday , according to reuters .
the news agency cited " sources in erdogan 's office " who said erdogan congratulated the french leader on his victory at the polls and suggested the two should work together directly . " we must not communicate via media statements , " erdogan 's aides told reuters .
" -lrb- we must -rrb- work together with direct talks . " for his part , sarkozy offered his condolences for a bomb attack in ankara on tuesday , which killed six people and wounded dozens more in the worst bombing in the turkish capital in at least a decade . sarkozy said he wanted to work together with erdogan to overcome their common problems , the sources told reuters .
the heads of state went on to discuss cooperation between france and turkey , a nato member , on a broad range of economic , political and military issues . but on the campaign trail , sarkozy made it clear that he was staunchly opposed to turkey 's accession to the eu .
he has instead proposed a mediterranean union for turkey and its neighbors .
french secretary of state for european affairs jean-pierre jouyet has not ruled out a french veto of further entry talks . turkey began negotiating for membership with the eu in 2005 .
the talks are expected to last 10 to 15 years .
so far , turkey and the eu have successfully completed one of the 35 policy chapters required for accession . german chancellor angela merkel has also spoken out against turkey 's membership bid , preferring instead what she termed a " privileged partnership " with germany and the eu . as rotating eu president , merkel has been more cautious in her assertions vis-à-vis turkey .
and in brussels , eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn reiterated the eu 's plans to continue accession talks with turkey . " we have a sound negotiating mandate with turkey , " rehn said .
he added : " if we succeed - if turkey succeeds - turkey can become an even more important bridge of civilizations than it is today . " " strasbourg is non-negotiable " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament in strasbourg , eastern france sarkozy also rejected calls to shut down the eu parliament 's strasbourg seat . " strasbourg is non-negotiable , it is part of europe 's founding balances , " sarkozy said . european members of parliament currently commute between the two chambers in strasbourg and brussels , prompting calls from some mps to consolidate the chambers into one city to save time and resources , and to reduce carbon dioxide emissions caused by frequent travel . sarkozy is set to travel to spain next week as part of his comprehensive diplomatic drive .

france 's sarkozy thinks not on a diplomatic tour of europe , french president nicolas sarkozy expressed his opposition to turkey 's eu membership bid .
the newly elected french leader also championed the idea of a " simplified treaty " for the eu . nicolas sarkozy has n't been in office for three weeks , but his policy offensive to reclaim france 's leadership in the european union is in full swing . on a diplomatic tour of european countries , sarkozy championed the idea of a " simplified treaty " to replace the failed eu constitution .
european commission chief jose manuel barroso said the idea was gaining support . " -lrb- sarkozy -rrb- was the first to suggest the idea of a simplified treaty , and today we see that there is a consensus forming around this idea , " barroso told reporters at a joint press conference with sarkozy . the french president also took the opportunity of his first visit to brussels since taking power on may 6 to reaffirm his opposition to turkey 's bid to join the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and barroso have differing views on turkey " i do n't see how you can be a candidate with one opinion and a president with another , " sarkozy said .
" i do n't think that turkey has a place in the union , " he concluded , but added that he did not want to dwell on the issue at present . " the question does n't arise at present and we already have enough on our plate , " sarkozy explained . barroso stressed that his european commission was " in favor of negotiations with turkey , " but concurred with sarkozy that " right now , our absolute priority is the treaty , the resolution of the institutional crisis . " constitution , mini-treaty , simplified treaty on the eu 's institutional gridlock , the french president said a european summit next month would be a success " if the 27 -lrb- eu member states -rrb- are in agreement for a simplified treaty . " in france , such a treaty could be submitted for approval by the parliament in order to avoid a repeat of the 2005 popular referenda that cut down the now moribund eu constitution . after french voters rejected the original constitution , france found itself playing an increasingly marginal role in the club of architects of the new europe .
sarkozy 's government now wants to reclaim france 's leadership in the eu , a campaign promise that had been trumpeted by both sarkozy and runner-up ségolène royal . last year , sarkozy had used the term " mini-treaty " to describe what he felt would be an acceptable constitutional framework for the eu .
the french leader said he recognized now that " mini-treaty " lacks ambition . eighteen member states have ratified the original constitution , which was deemed necessary to bring eu institutions up to date in the expanded bloc .
but any new treaty will have to revisit some controversial topics , such as references to " shared values , " which were understood by some observers as a coded exclusion of turkey from the eu club . " we must work together " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan called sarkozy to propose a get-together turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan phoned sarkozy on thursday , according to reuters .
the news agency cited " sources in erdogan 's office " who said erdogan congratulated the french leader on his victory at the polls and suggested the two should work together directly . " we must not communicate via media statements , " erdogan 's aides told reuters .
" -lrb- we must -rrb- work together with direct talks . " for his part , sarkozy offered his condolences for a bomb attack in ankara on tuesday , which killed six people and wounded dozens more in the worst bombing in the turkish capital in at least a decade . sarkozy said he wanted to work together with erdogan to overcome their common problems , the sources told reuters .
the heads of state went on to discuss cooperation between france and turkey , a nato member , on a broad range of economic , political and military issues . but on the campaign trail , sarkozy made it clear that he was staunchly opposed to turkey 's accession to the eu .
he has instead proposed a mediterranean union for turkey and its neighbors .
french secretary of state for european affairs jean-pierre jouyet has not ruled out a french veto of further entry talks . turkey began negotiating for membership with the eu in 2005 .
the talks are expected to last 10 to 15 years .
so far , turkey and the eu have successfully completed one of the 35 policy chapters required for accession . german chancellor angela merkel has also spoken out against turkey 's membership bid , preferring instead what she termed a " privileged partnership " with germany and the eu . as rotating eu president , merkel has been more cautious in her assertions vis-à-vis turkey .
and in brussels , eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn reiterated the eu 's plans to continue accession talks with turkey . " we have a sound negotiating mandate with turkey , " rehn said .
he added : " if we succeed - if turkey succeeds - turkey can become an even more important bridge of civilizations than it is today . " " strasbourg is non-negotiable " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament in strasbourg , eastern france sarkozy also rejected calls to shut down the eu parliament 's strasbourg seat . " strasbourg is non-negotiable , it is part of europe 's founding balances , " sarkozy said . european members of parliament currently commute between the two chambers in strasbourg and brussels , prompting calls from some mps to consolidate the chambers into one city to save time and resources , and to reduce carbon dioxide emissions caused by frequent travel . sarkozy is set to travel to spain next week as part of his comprehensive diplomatic drive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 25.05.2007 ladies and gentlemen , heidi klum presents hans and franz großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heidi klum quite aptly takes hans and franz to the golden globes awards german supermodel heidi klum has revealed that she calls her breasts hans and franz .
while that may be more information than most people need to know , others feel as though heidi has n't gone far enough . as two of the more obvious assets of a world famous lingerie model , hans and franz should be more or less used to the eyes of the world being trained on them .
however , despite one unexpected public appearance on the jay leno show in the us when they broke free of an 5.9 million-euro -lrb- $ 8 million -rrb- diamond-encrusted bra , heidi klum 's breasts are usually kept under wraps .
but after the german supermodel revealed her mammary monikers on thursday , worldwide attention has been more concentrated on the 35-inch bust than usual .
hans and franz have been stars of the victoria 's secrets lingerie catwalk shows and adverts for the past ten years but until heidi officially out-ed them as having names this week , they were more appreciated as just being part of the overall , highly aesthetic package .
now they are famous in the own right , people are clambering to know more and more about them .
and just like any new stars being embraced by the cult of celebrity , speculation about them is already rife on the international gossip pages .
no strangers to the limelight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans , franz and victoria 's secrets heidi herself is unique among supermodels for her openness , down-to-earth quality and sense of humor .
but , as with so many of her kind in the fashion world , she obviously believes that less is more .
while anyone who has seen her parading down a runway in the smallest of smalls will attest , this will come as no surprise .
however , in this case , the dearth is not of cloth covering her modesty but the information she is offering on hans and franz .
for one , which is which ?
does hans sit at her right hand or the left ?
also , from whom did the names originate ?
are they named after ex-partners , family relatives or friends ?
what are their likes and dislikes ?
-lrb- this last one will surely turn up in forthcoming interviews with heidi 's husband , the singer seal . -rrb-
all the 33-year-old from bergisch gladbach near cologne will say is that she gave her famous assets the stereotypically german names in homage to her homeland .
" they 've been an ongoing joke for , like , 12 years .
it started because i was from germany , and people always make fun of ze germans , yah ?
so when i began modeling i used to say , ' these are german breasts , one is called hans and one is called franz . " '
inspired by bodybuilder sketch ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did heidi name her breasts after a us comedy routine ?
from the fringe is just one of the many columns that believes there may be more to it that that .
one theory could be that the breasts are named after the characters of a sketch on us comedy show saturday night live .
comedians kevin nealon and dana carvey starred as hans and franz , two bodybuilders in the mould of arnold schwarzenegger who would appear to urge lesser men to get ' pumped ' .
the sketches would begin : " i am hans ... and i am franz ... and we are here to pump you up . "
if there is any truth in this tenuous link to heidi 's chest , it might explain why the klum version of hans and franz muscled their way out of a million-dollar bra live on american television .
however , the nealon and carvey versions were from austria which would render further investigation of this silly lead redundant .
more likely is that heidi named her breasts after famous germans , of which there have been many bearing the first names hans and franz .
being a well-known soccer fan , heidi could have paid homage to a couple of her country 's greats .
a homage to a solid pair ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz -lrb- beckenbauer , that is -rrb- is the one on the right born a year before the 1974 world cup triumph on home soil , maybe ms. klum dedicated her own solid pairing to the central defensive stalwarts of the winning team hans-georg schwarzenbeck and franz beckenbauer .
again , this is pure speculation on from the fringe 's part .
other than the origins of their names and the positioning of each , other questions arising from hans and franz 's introduction to the world include those pertaining to worth .
while casual observers may conclude that they are indeed priceless , as a model whose earnings were estimated by forbes magazine last year at 4.7 million euros , heidi will surely be looking to put a price on her now even-more-famous breasts .
she did after all insure her legs for 3.18 million euros .
what price for hans and franz , one wonders ?
and will they both be worth the same ?
a small scar on one of heidi 's legs means that one is more expensive than the other .
what imperfections , if any , could reduce the worth of either hans or franz ?

he did n't forcefully condemn china 's human rights record , saying he would leave specific criticisms to the german government . köhler was almost euphoric as he recounted his " very good talks " with china 's leadership in beijing .
köhler managed to circumvent the minefield in which the issue of human rights had threatened to overshadow his visit , so that at the end , he was back in his element - advocating expanded cooperation with the world 's most populous country in the field of environmental and resource protection .
and , he reported , in this aspect he had found " open doors " in beijing .
köhler showed how impressed he was with china 's new generation of leaders : " they are aware of the problems and challenges of this society and its giant population number of 1.3 billion such as i have experienced from no other leadership , " said the man who had often visited china in the past in other functions .
" they are facing the problems and want to solve them , " he added .
leaving out details bildunterschrift : protestors bring attention to human rights abuses in china the chinese brought up the subject of human rights themselves , köhler said .
they admitted to " mistakes and problems " that they are working on .
but they did not speak about any specific cases .
köhler said that responsibility for talking about specifics rests with the german government .
" it was right for me to present the principles , but detailed human rights issues and cases are something that the german government has to talk about -lrb- with china -rrb- , " he said .
köhler was following a precedent set by former chancellors helmut kohl and gerhard schröder , an editorial in the friday edition of the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
he spoke in abstractions and " philosophized about human rights , but lacked the words to talk about the chinese problems . "
" it was important for me to bring forward the fundamentals , " köhler said .
the tensions in the run up to his meeting amog other things because of the resolution of the german parliament that criticized the " re-education through labor camps " in china , were not further talked about .
the resolution was rejected as " intervention " by beijing .
tapping köhler 's expertise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler said chinese leaders were eager for his advice the german president holds mostly ceremonial and diplomatic duties . he used to head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
state and party leader hu jintao was eager to tap into köhler 's experience in dealing with issues facing china , such as adequate employment for hundreds of millions of rural residents , or how to overcome the gap between the poor western regions and the wealthier coastal population .
they had talked at length , köhler said , about the rapid ageing of china 's population and the effects of this on the pensions and insurance sectors .
china 's leaders were " almost desperate " in asking how such problems might be resolved , he said .
" it was noticeable how he -lrb- hu -rrb- wanted to discuss with me in depth those problems he is itching to deal with , " köhler said .
climate change a central theme bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has serious problems with pollution china pushed for the german government to provide more investement and technology to help develop a key bilateral relationship between the two nations , köhler told reporters after meeting chinese premier wen jiabao in beijing on friday .
china also hopes to see " more action " from germany in areas such as regular bilateral dialogues , and technology transfer related to environmental protection and energy efficiency , köhler said .
koehler said he was impressed with the openness of chinese leaders on environmental protection and their apparent willingness to take more action on climate change .
" it 's the first time that the chinese understand it -lrb- climate change -rrb- as an important issue in itself , " koehler said at the conclusion of his talks in the zhongnanhai compound used by leaders of china 's ruling communist party .
china seemed committed to achieving its targets for reducing carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency , but it lacked capacity and expertise , he said .
köhler said he was optimistic that china would play a " constructive role " in global efforts against climate change .
" china is aware that it is part of the problem , " he said .
" they want to be part of the solution . "
on saturday , köhler will deliver a speech in shanghai to mark the 100th anniversary of tongji university .
he departs for germany later saturday . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german president köhler seeks balance in asia on a week-long tour of asia that includes both vietnam , where he arrived monday , and china , german president horst köhler has worked to find the delicate balance between diplomatic and economic interests .

fifty-two artists - roughly half of them german born and the other living and working here - will be showing their work at the show which being jointly organized by the kunstverein hannover , the kestnergesellschaft and the sprengel museum .
martin engler , curator at the hanover kunstverein , stressed that most of the 80 works do not relate to the theme of germany , but show a rich diversity .

" of course , in the art world there is always a degree of competition for funding and attention , but documenta exhibits artists from around the world .
we have focused on people working in germany , " engler .

a new museum exhibit on german jews who fled their homeland between 1933 and 1941 examines the life-changing - and ultimately life-saving - experiences of those who managed to escape the nazi threat . the multimedia exhibit " homeland and exile : emigration of german jews after 1933 " represents the most comprehensive look ever taken at jews who fled germany for over a hundred countries around the world .
the exhibit touches on the larger political issues of the era , but mostly it focuses on the people who were forced to turn their back on their " heimat " - a german word that encompasses both the concept of homeland and the feeling of emotional attachment to it - and their individual and collective journeys to a new life .
why did they go , where did they find refuge , and under what conditions ?
how did they build new lives for themselves , and how did they feel about their " home countries " both new and old ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young emigrants aboard the ship " martha washington , " en route to palestine the exhibit tackles these questions with commentated displays that briefly describe the widespread anti-semitism and curtailment of civil liberties that led some 280,000 of the 500,000 jews living in germany to emigrate , starting in 1933 .
-lrb- one artefact from that time on display : a children 's board game called jews out ! that involved driving out jew-shaped playing pieces from a town full of shops with names like " salomon 's money lenders . " -rrb-
from there , the story turns to the ways and means of leaving , with the show dividing thematically into rooms devoted to the stories of those who shipped off for destinations across europe , the americas , africa and asia .
on on a 3-d interactive map , museum-goers can pinpoint the 100 countries that eventually allowed jewish refugees entry .
farming in the dominican republic the curators make clear that some destinations were seen as more desirable than others .
the most sought after visa , limited in number and only available to those with an affidavit of support , was for the us .
less preferred was shanghai , which nonetheless became the last chance for escape for some 18,000 to 20,000 jews , thanks to its policy of allowing entry without a visa up to 1941 .
one of the odder histories in this section involves a plan hatched by the then-dictator of the dominican republic , rafael trujillo , to imported jewish " agricultural experts " in an effort to " whiten " his population , and give the country a needed injection of economic energy .
most of the artefacts on display are from the permanent collections of the jewish museum in berlin , where the show ran from sept . , 2006 to april , 2007 , and from other historical collections , explained cilly kugelmann , progam director of the berlin jewish museum .
" there are people who kept everything , every paper , every letter .
that generation is dying out , and they know their children wo n't take care of their things , so they donate it to historical collections , " she explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil liberties for jews were curtailed under the nazis kugelmann said her own favorite artefact is a coin purse kept by a man whose arduous journey out of germany involved going through numerous countries ; he eventually settled in portugal , but kept change in the purse from each stop along the way .
reconstructing lives from ephemera ephemera from the era -lrb- photographs , poems , diaries , ticket stubs , letters -rrb- is interspersed with objects. suitcases , clothing , coffee pots , dolls ; anything either left behind , taken along , or taken up as part of a new life in a new land .
possibly most compelling are the interactive kiosks that allow viewers to hear the emigres ' personal stories .
videotaped interviews are broken down into short , accessible segments under different categories , and english subtitles are available .
overall , kugelmann said , the exhibit tells a story of a people who did a " remarkably successful " job of adjusting to a difficult situation - even if some of the people faced depression , unhappiness , and even committed suicide .
their success as immigrants was one of the main reasons to create the exhibit , explained kugelmann .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a child 's view of its new world " many of the people who left embarked on their new lives with a certain distinctive , ironic pragmatism , " she said .
" we wondered , ' why were they relatively so successful ?
their children went on to be successful .
how did they do it ? "
a more positive view of the nazi era ?
kugelmann also implied that , more than half a century after the fact , it may be time for germany to start looking at the story of the holocaust from a new angle .
" over the past 60 years , german society has developed a relationship to the nazi period in which the mass murder has become the sole paradigm , " she said .
" the survival of almost two-thirds of german jews was simply ignored . "
and jürgen reiche , exhibitions director at the museum of contemporary history , also said he hoped the exhibit will incite young people to take a new look at germany , past and present .
" we sometimes forget that german-jewish history is also german history , " he said .
' they were robbed of a homeland " but hebrew university historian moshe zimmermann , who consulted on the exhibit , warned of the tendency to concentrate on the well-known successes among the refugees from the nazis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the exhibition focuses on the exiled children " the idea is often that the emigration didn ’ t destroy many lives .
people think of thomas mann , billy wilder , henry kissinger .
and they say , ' they left germany , it was n't so tragic , " he said .
" people say , ' they could find a home elsewhere because jews are like that . ' … but if you start thinking that way , you 're starting with the wrong idea . "
as the word " heimat " in the title of the exhibit makes clear , " the émigrés were , despite everything , german , " zimmermann said .
" they were germans who were jews .
and they were robbed of their homeland . "
" there is no plural for the word heimat .

a new museum exhibit on german jews who fled their homeland between 1933 and 1941 examines the life-changing - and ultimately life-saving - experiences of those who managed to escape the nazi threat . the multimedia exhibit " homeland and exile : emigration of german jews after 1933 " represents the most comprehensive look ever taken at jews who fled germany for over a hundred countries around the world .
the exhibit touches on the larger political issues of the era , but mostly it focuses on the people who were forced to turn their back on their " heimat " - a german word that encompasses both the concept of homeland and the feeling of emotional attachment to it - and their individual and collective journeys to a new life .
why did they go , where did they find refuge , and under what conditions ?
how did they build new lives for themselves , and how did they feel about their " home countries " both new and old ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young emigrants aboard the ship " martha washington , " en route to palestine the exhibit tackles these questions with commentated displays that briefly describe the widespread anti-semitism and curtailment of civil liberties that led some 280,000 of the 500,000 jews living in germany to emigrate , starting in 1933 .
-lrb- one artefact from that time on display : a children 's board game called jews out ! that involved driving out jew-shaped playing pieces from a town full of shops with names like " salomon 's money lenders . " -rrb-
from there , the story turns to the ways and means of leaving , with the show dividing thematically into rooms devoted to the stories of those who shipped off for destinations across europe , the americas , africa and asia .
on on a 3-d interactive map , museum-goers can pinpoint the 100 countries that eventually allowed jewish refugees entry .
farming in the dominican republic the curators make clear that some destinations were seen as more desirable than others .
the most sought after visa , limited in number and only available to those with an affidavit of support , was for the us .
less preferred was shanghai , which nonetheless became the last chance for escape for some 18,000 to 20,000 jews , thanks to its policy of allowing entry without a visa up to 1941 .
one of the odder histories in this section involves a plan hatched by the then-dictator of the dominican republic , rafael trujillo , to imported jewish " agricultural experts " in an effort to " whiten " his population , and give the country a needed injection of economic energy .
most of the artefacts on display are from the permanent collections of the jewish museum in berlin , where the show ran from sept . , 2006 to april , 2007 , and from other historical collections , explained cilly kugelmann , progam director of the berlin jewish museum .
" there are people who kept everything , every paper , every letter .
that generation is dying out , and they know their children wo n't take care of their things , so they donate it to historical collections , " she explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil liberties for jews were curtailed under the nazis kugelmann said her own favorite artefact is a coin purse kept by a man whose arduous journey out of germany involved going through numerous countries ; he eventually settled in portugal , but kept change in the purse from each stop along the way .
reconstructing lives from ephemera ephemera from the era -lrb- photographs , poems , diaries , ticket stubs , letters -rrb- is interspersed with objects. suitcases , clothing , coffee pots , dolls ; anything either left behind , taken along , or taken up as part of a new life in a new land .
possibly most compelling are the interactive kiosks that allow viewers to hear the emigres ' personal stories .
videotaped interviews are broken down into short , accessible segments under different categories , and english subtitles are available .
overall , kugelmann said , the exhibit tells a story of a people who did a " remarkably successful " job of adjusting to a difficult situation - even if some of the people faced depression , unhappiness , and even committed suicide .
their success as immigrants was one of the main reasons to create the exhibit , explained kugelmann .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a child 's view of its new world " many of the people who left embarked on their new lives with a certain distinctive , ironic pragmatism , " she said .
" we wondered , ' why were they relatively so successful ?
their children went on to be successful .
how did they do it ? "
a more positive view of the nazi era ?
kugelmann also implied that , more than half a century after the fact , it may be time for germany to start looking at the story of the holocaust from a new angle .
" over the past 60 years , german society has developed a relationship to the nazi period in which the mass murder has become the sole paradigm , " she said .
" the survival of almost two-thirds of german jews was simply ignored . "
and jürgen reiche , exhibitions director at the museum of contemporary history , also said he hoped the exhibit will incite young people to take a new look at germany , past and present .
" we sometimes forget that german-jewish history is also german history , " he said .
' they were robbed of a homeland " but hebrew university historian moshe zimmermann , who consulted on the exhibit , warned of the tendency to concentrate on the well-known successes among the refugees from the nazis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the exhibition focuses on the exiled children " the idea is often that the emigration didn ’ t destroy many lives .
people think of thomas mann , billy wilder , henry kissinger .
and they say , ' they left germany , it was n't so tragic , " he said .
" people say , ' they could find a home elsewhere because jews are like that . ' … but if you start thinking that way , you 're starting with the wrong idea . "
as the word " heimat " in the title of the exhibit makes clear , " the émigrés were , despite everything , german , " zimmermann said .
" they were germans who were jews .
and they were robbed of their homeland . "
" there is no plural for the word heimat .

twenty-six people , most of them students , have been arrested for alleged involvement in the attacks , according to media reports on friday .

the pkk has denied any involvement in the recent attacks , but turkish officials said the method of the bomb attack and the type of explosives were similar to past pkk attacks .
mending ties to eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy says turkey does n't belong in the eu the violence comes at a bad time for turkey .
the new french president nicolas sarkozy has made it clear he continues to oppose turkey 's bid to join the eu .
instead , he has proposed a mediterranean union between turkey and its neighbors .
" i do n't see how you can be a candidate with one opinion and a president with another , " he said during a press conference in brussels this week .
" i do n't think that turkey has a place in the union . " france has said it would consider vetoing turkey 's entry into the eu .
turkey began negotiations in 2005 .
turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan reportedly phoned sarkozy on thursday , in an apparent conciliatory gesture , according to reuters .
in his first call to sarkozy since his election , sources in erdogan 's office quoted the prime minister as congratulating the french president on his victory in the polls and told him that the two needed to work directly with each other , according to reuters .
" we must not communicate via media statements , " erdogan was quoted as telling sarkozy .
" -lrb- we must -rrb- work together with direct talks . "

" we have a sound negotiating mandate with turkey and the commission 's view is that we will continue the accession negotiations with turkey because it is in the interests of both the european union and turkey , " he said at a news briefing .
" if we succeed , if turkey succeeds , turkey can become an even more important bridge of civilizations than it is today , " rehn said .
" and the time to judge whether turkey has been able to meet the conditions of eu accession is in the latter stages of the accession process . "
turkey has general elections scheduled for july 22 to decide a political conflict between the islamic-leaning government and the military-backed secular establishment .

the pkk is thought to have launched the attacks from hideouts in northern iraq .
turkish army chief yasar buyukanit last month called for a military operation into iraq to quash pkk guerrillas . the united states and iraqi kurdish leaders oppose the idea .
a kurdish iraqi official recently warned that talk of such a move would signal a " dangerous escalation " of the situation .
the us has also urged turkey to show restraint , fearing a cross-border operation could disrupt efforts to stabilize war-torn iraq .
attacks blamed on rebels continued friday when a bomb derailed seven cars of a freight train in southeast turkey .
no injuries were reported .
police arrested 26 people , most of them university students belonging to the separatist kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , media reported on friday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundeswehr -pipe- 25.05.2007 germans divided on how to honor fallen soldiers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debate has centered on where a memorial for soldiers should be located less than a week after three german soldiers were killed in afghanistan , debate is heating up over a monument to honor the country 's post-world war ii armed forces members who died while on duty at home and abroad . since the establishment of the german army in the 1950s , more than 2,600 soldiers have died in accidents , maneuvers or peacekeeping missions at home and abroad .
on may 19 , the tally rose further after a suicide bomb killed three soldiers in kunduz , afghanistan .
the deaths of the soldiers , which brought the german fatality toll since the bundeswehr deployed to afghanistan in 2002 to a total of 21 , has not only generated hefty debate in parliament over the security of the troops in afghanistan , but on how to memorialize those who die while serving their country .
while there are little reservations about building a memorial to honor soldiers killed on duty in the country 's post-war armed forces , discussion has centered on the planned location for such a monument . bildunterschrift : a memorial service was held for the fallen soldiers on wednesday german defense minister franz josef jung , who has long harbored plans to honor the fallen soldiers , said the memorial would be erected within the ministry 's premises in berlin .
thomas raabe , spokesman for the defense ministry , said on thursday that the memorial would be located within the bendlerblock compound , the seat of germany 's defense ministry in berlin .
" there will be no changes to that , " he added .
a public memorial ?
but not everyone agrees with locating the memorial within a high-security tract not easily accessible to the general public .
the representative for the armed forces in the german parliament , reinhold robbe , said the majority of soldiers would prefer to see the monument built on a prominent site in berlin .
speaking on the television station rtl , robbe said the monument and its location needed to make clear to all who see it that the bundeswehr is a " parliament 's army . "
the recent fatalities in afghanistan have shown " just how dangerous the job of a soldier is , " and that the soldiers serve " in the name of germany , " robbe added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 3,000 german troops are stationed in afghanistan the head of the cross-party parliamentary committee for cultural affairs , hans-joachim otto , told deutsche welle it was " highly unfortunate that the defense ministry treats the matter of the memorial as its private business . "
" the bundeswehr is a conscription-based army and hence an army of the people .
bundeswehr missions are decided upon in parliament and not in the defense ministry , " he said , adding that as such a more public location would be more in keeping with the nature of germany 's armed forces .
more than a wreath depository peter steinbach , the head of berlin 's german resistance memorial site , also argued against placing the monument behind a closed-off gate at the defense ministry .
such a memorial belongs within view of the public , he said on german public radio .
otherwise , it risks becoming simply a " depository for wreaths . "
with a view to similar memorials in other countries , steinbach said , " no one would ever have suggested that the vietnam memorial in the united sites be built within the pentagon 's courtyard . "

on may 19 , the tally rose further after a suicide bomb killed three soldiers in kunduz , afghanistan .
the deaths of the soldiers , which brought the german fatality toll since the bundeswehr deployed to afghanistan in 2002 to a total of 21 , has not only generated hefty debate in parliament over the security of the troops in afghanistan , but on how to memorialize those who die while serving their country .
while there are little reservations about building a memorial to honor soldiers killed on duty in the country 's post-war armed forces , discussion has centered on the planned location for such a monument . bildunterschrift : a memorial service was held for the fallen soldiers on wednesday german defense minister franz josef jung , who has long harbored plans to honor the fallen soldiers , said the memorial would be erected within the ministry 's premises in berlin .
thomas raabe , spokesman for the defense ministry , said on thursday that the memorial would be located within the bendlerblock compound , the seat of germany 's defense ministry in berlin .
" there will be no changes to that , " he added .
a public memorial ?
but not everyone agrees with locating the memorial within a high-security tract not easily accessible to the general public .
the representative for the armed forces in the german parliament , reinhold robbe , said the majority of soldiers would prefer to see the monument built on a prominent site in berlin .
speaking on the television station rtl , robbe said the monument and its location needed to make clear to all who see it that the bundeswehr is a " parliament 's army . "
the recent fatalities in afghanistan have shown " just how dangerous the job of a soldier is , " and that the soldiers serve " in the name of germany , " robbe added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 3,000 german troops are stationed in afghanistan the head of the cross-party parliamentary committee for cultural affairs , hans-joachim otto , told deutsche welle it was " highly unfortunate that the defense ministry treats the matter of the memorial as its private business . "
" the bundeswehr is a conscription-based army and hence an army of the people .
bundeswehr missions are decided upon in parliament and not in the defense ministry , " he said , adding that as such a more public location would be more in keeping with the nature of germany 's armed forces .
more than a wreath depository peter steinbach , the head of berlin 's german resistance memorial site , also argued against placing the monument behind a closed-off gate at the defense ministry .
such a memorial belongs within view of the public , he said on german public radio .
otherwise , it risks becoming simply a " depository for wreaths . "
with a view to similar memorials in other countries , steinbach said , " no one would ever have suggested that the vietnam memorial in the united sites be built within the pentagon 's courtyard . "
chancellor angela merkel , who in february had suggested a more public location closer to the reichstag as a reminder to the role of parliament in deploying the armed forces , endorsed the ministry 's proposal for erecting the memorial within the bendlerblock compound .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 25.05.2007 opinion : reputation of competitive sports is on the line großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more professional cyclists are admitting to illegal doping .
if the sport is to change and become clean then the three-martini business lunch has to go , according to dw sports editor wolfgang von kann . this week , germany 's tabloid bild zeitung asked , " mr. ullrich , you really did n't know about this ? " but the affair has long gone beyond jan ullrich or any of the other big names .
sure , if yet another cyclist from ullrich & co. were to come out of the doping closet , it would help illuminate the situation further - but it would be essentially meaningless . that 's because today , much more is on the line than the careers of a few cyclists .
anyone who has been following recent developments in athletics , swimming , triathlon or cross-country skiing - to say nothing of weightlifting - will hardly claim that the morass of doping scandals is confined to the cycling arena . we are now talking about competitive sports in general .
this is about breaking up structures with unmistakably mafiaesque semblances .
ultimately , the reputation of all competitive sports is on the line . our unsung heroes but even that is a generalization that scratches at the surface but skirts the core of the issue .
indeed , the central question has yet to be asked : to what extent are we - consumers , viewers , fans and also the media - to blame for all of this ?
what kind of society are we living in , anyway ? it is time to examine the demands we place on our athletes .
barely 20 years old , they are expected to act as role models - a part only few come by voluntarily .
in their twenties , they are supposed to be the shining heroes who make no mistakes and scoop up all the medals at the olympic games .
and over 30 , they are meant to do everything they can to prove that age does n't matter . craving new records where do the fans of cycling races stand ?
at the top of the hill , where the riders hurt the most .
what do people want to see at track-and-field events ?
they are waiting for the world record .
and what do they want at weightlifting competitions ?
they want to see more weight loaded on the bar . the limits of athletic achievement are constantly being pushed .
at the same time , the athlete is expected to be a clean-cut do-gooder , ready to cast aside all signs of exertion and bedazzle the cameras with an eloquent post-match interview . of course , the athlete will achieve all of this on bread and water alone . how one person is supposed to be all that , nobody wants to know . people who live in glass houses ... this rigmarole is not without hypocrisy .
for what is it that we non-athletes do ?
we send our kids to school with sedatives .
we indulge in a little booze during lunch time , or even before we arrive at the office .
we can barely survive without nicotine and alcohol .
and we drink liter after liter of coffee , so that we can do it all . we are a drug nation : at the first sign of a mild cold , we immediately pour a bottle of cough medicine - which , by the way , is prohibited for athletes - down our throats , or just stay in bed griping . ultimately , competitive sports are a mirror image of our society , and is therefore no better or worse than us .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 25.05.2007 opinion : reputation of competitive sports is on the line großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more professional cyclists are admitting to illegal doping .
if the sport is to change and become clean then the three-martini business lunch has to go , according to dw sports editor wolfgang von kann . this week , germany 's tabloid bild zeitung asked , " mr. ullrich , you really did n't know about this ? " but the affair has long gone beyond jan ullrich or any of the other big names .
sure , if yet another cyclist from ullrich & co. were to come out of the doping closet , it would help illuminate the situation further - but it would be essentially meaningless . that 's because today , much more is on the line than the careers of a few cyclists .
anyone who has been following recent developments in athletics , swimming , triathlon or cross-country skiing - to say nothing of weightlifting - will hardly claim that the morass of doping scandals is confined to the cycling arena . we are now talking about competitive sports in general .
this is about breaking up structures with unmistakably mafiaesque semblances .
ultimately , the reputation of all competitive sports is on the line . our unsung heroes but even that is a generalization that scratches at the surface but skirts the core of the issue .
indeed , the central question has yet to be asked : to what extent are we - consumers , viewers , fans and also the media - to blame for all of this ?
what kind of society are we living in , anyway ? it is time to examine the demands we place on our athletes .
barely 20 years old , they are expected to act as role models - a part only few come by voluntarily .
in their twenties , they are supposed to be the shining heroes who make no mistakes and scoop up all the medals at the olympic games .
and over 30 , they are meant to do everything they can to prove that age does n't matter . craving new records where do the fans of cycling races stand ?
at the top of the hill , where the riders hurt the most .
what do people want to see at track-and-field events ?
they are waiting for the world record .
and what do they want at weightlifting competitions ?
they want to see more weight loaded on the bar . the limits of athletic achievement are constantly being pushed .
at the same time , the athlete is expected to be a clean-cut do-gooder , ready to cast aside all signs of exertion and bedazzle the cameras with an eloquent post-match interview . of course , the athlete will achieve all of this on bread and water alone . how one person is supposed to be all that , nobody wants to know . people who live in glass houses ... this rigmarole is not without hypocrisy .

" because no child should be victimized in this horrific way , today we pledge to re-double our efforts to enforce the international fight against child pornography , " the ministers said in a joint declaration . internet poses challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet service providers seen as partners in stopping child pornography german justice minister brigitte zypries said countries had been slow to adapt to the challenges produced by the rapid development of the internet which had facilitated the distribution of child pornography .
" we have all adopted specific legislation to fight this phenomenon , but we still have to make progress in transferring international agreements in this area into our domestic laws , " zypries said .
the ministers also discussed the necessity of getting help from internet providers since the internet makes it easy for pedophiles to share child pornography .

finance minister peer steinbrück said the move will improve germany 's standing on the global market . the german parliament on friday paved the way for the country ’ s biggest corporate tax reform in post-world war ii history , which would put its rates on par with the rest of europe .
as of jan .
1 , 2008 , corporate tax will be lowered to 30 percent from the current rate of 39 percent - the highest in the european union .
" this corporate tax reform will make germany a more attractive place for investment , " said steinbrück .
he added in an interview broadcast on public radio friday that all citizens would benefit from the reform because tax revenues would actually increase , at least in the mid-term , though critics have warned of an initial loss of around 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.7 billion -rrb- . the bill , which is expected to be approved by germany 's upper parliamentary house before the summer recess , would also prevent companies from getting tax benefits in germany by taking loans via subsidiaries abroad .

chairman of the left party 's parliamentary group , oskar lafontaine , called the corporate tax bill a " blessing of billions for big business , " adding that it would be better to adjust income tax rates for small companies .
jan paul bach , the owner of a 15-employee company near berlin that produces high-tech ceramic elements , said the changes were necessary for germany to keep up in the global marketplace .
" i think the tax reform is necessary to compete with new economies like china or india , which have lower ages and a better position in the global economy , " bach told deutsche welle .
he added , however that he did n't think it was fair that " big companies pay lower taxes while the employees have to pay higher taxes . " to make up for the cuts , germany is abolishing tax holidays , which have mainly benefited multinationals .
an inheritance tax reform is also in the works , on the initiative of the social democratic party , which is part of a series of tax adjustments meant to offset the corporate tax reform . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german family-owned businesses often upstage the big guys a new study has shown that family-owned businesses in germany from 2003 to 2005 performed better than dax firms in both job creation and sales growth .

while that may be more information than most people need to know , others feel as though heidi has n't gone far enough . as two of the more obvious assets of a world famous lingerie model , hans and franz should be more or less used to the eyes of the world being trained on them .
however , despite one unexpected public appearance on the jay leno show in the us when they broke free of an 5.9 million-euro -lrb- $ 8 million -rrb- diamond-encrusted bra , heidi klum 's breasts are usually kept under wraps .
but after the german supermodel revealed her mammary monikers on thursday , worldwide attention has been more concentrated on the 35-inch bust than usual .
hans and franz have been stars of the victoria 's secrets lingerie catwalk shows and adverts for the past ten years but until heidi officially out-ed them as having names this week , they were more appreciated as just being part of the overall , highly aesthetic package .
now they are famous in the own right , people are clambering to know more and more about them .
and just like any new stars being embraced by the cult of celebrity , speculation about them is already rife on the international gossip pages .
no strangers to the limelight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans , franz and victoria 's secrets heidi herself is unique among supermodels for her openness , down-to-earth quality and sense of humor .
but , as with so many of her kind in the fashion world , she obviously believes that less is more .
while anyone who has seen her parading down a runway in the smallest of smalls will attest , this will come as no surprise .
however , in this case , the dearth is not of cloth covering her modesty but the information she is offering on hans and franz .
for one , which is which ?
does hans sit at her right hand or the left ?
also , from whom did the names originate ?
are they named after ex-partners , family relatives or friends ?
what are their likes and dislikes ?
-lrb- this last one will surely turn up in forthcoming interviews with heidi 's husband , the singer seal . -rrb-
all the 33-year-old from bergisch gladbach near cologne will say is that she gave her famous assets the stereotypically german names in homage to her homeland .
" they 've been an ongoing joke for , like , 12 years .
it started because i was from germany , and people always make fun of ze germans , yah ?
so when i began modeling i used to say , ' these are german breasts , one is called hans and one is called franz . " '
inspired by bodybuilder sketch ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did heidi name her breasts after a us comedy routine ?
from the fringe is just one of the many columns that believes there may be more to it that that .
one theory could be that the breasts are named after the characters of a sketch on us comedy show saturday night live .
comedians kevin nealon and dana carvey starred as hans and franz , two bodybuilders in the mould of arnold schwarzenegger who would appear to urge lesser men to get ' pumped ' .
the sketches would begin : " i am hans ... and i am franz ... and we are here to pump you up . "
if there is any truth in this tenuous link to heidi 's chest , it might explain why the klum version of hans and franz muscled their way out of a million-dollar bra live on american television .
however , the nealon and carvey versions were from austria which would render further investigation of this silly lead redundant .
more likely is that heidi named her breasts after famous germans , of which there have been many bearing the first names hans and franz .
being a well-known soccer fan , heidi could have paid homage to a couple of her country 's greats .
a homage to a solid pair ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz -lrb- beckenbauer , that is -rrb- is the one on the right born a year before the 1974 world cup triumph on home soil , maybe ms. klum dedicated her own solid pairing to the central defensive stalwarts of the winning team hans-georg schwarzenbeck and franz beckenbauer .
again , this is pure speculation on from the fringe 's part .
other than the origins of their names and the positioning of each , other questions arising from hans and franz 's introduction to the world include those pertaining to worth .
while casual observers may conclude that they are indeed priceless , as a model whose earnings were estimated by forbes magazine last year at 4.7 million euros , heidi will surely be looking to put a price on her now even-more-famous breasts .
she did after all insure her legs for 3.18 million euros .
what price for hans and franz , one wonders ?
and will they both be worth the same ?
a small scar on one of heidi 's legs means that one is more expensive than the other .
what imperfections , if any , could reduce the worth of either hans or franz ?
come on heidi , enquiring minds need to know ! dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de heidi klum accused of promoting anorexia in germany german media has attacked supermodel heidi klum for a new fashion reality tv show that they charged promotes eating disorders among young women .

he did n't forcefully condemn china 's human rights record , saying he would leave specific criticisms to the german government . köhler was almost euphoric as he recounted his " very good talks " with china 's leadership in beijing .
köhler managed to circumvent the minefield in which the issue of human rights had threatened to overshadow his visit , so that at the end , he was back in his element - advocating expanded cooperation with the world 's most populous country in the field of environmental and resource protection .
and , he reported , in this aspect he had found " open doors " in beijing .
köhler showed how impressed he was with china 's new generation of leaders : " they are aware of the problems and challenges of this society and its giant population number of 1.3 billion such as i have experienced from no other leadership , " said the man who had often visited china in the past in other functions .
" they are facing the problems and want to solve them , " he added .
leaving out details bildunterschrift : protestors bring attention to human rights abuses in china the chinese brought up the subject of human rights themselves , köhler said .
they admitted to " mistakes and problems " that they are working on .
but they did not speak about any specific cases .
köhler said that responsibility for talking about specifics rests with the german government .
" it was right for me to present the principles , but detailed human rights issues and cases are something that the german government has to talk about -lrb- with china -rrb- , " he said .
köhler was following a precedent set by former chancellors helmut kohl and gerhard schröder , an editorial in the friday edition of the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 25.05.2007 sarkozy tackles turkey question during diplomatic tour großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should turkey join the eu ?
france 's sarkozy thinks not on a diplomatic tour of europe , french president nicolas sarkozy expressed his opposition to turkey 's eu membership bid .
the newly elected french leader also championed the idea of a " simplified treaty " for the eu . nicolas sarkozy has n't been in office for three weeks , but his policy offensive to reclaim france 's leadership in the european union is in full swing . on a diplomatic tour of european countries , sarkozy championed the idea of a " simplified treaty " to replace the failed eu constitution .
european commission chief jose manuel barroso said the idea was gaining support . " -lrb- sarkozy -rrb- was the first to suggest the idea of a simplified treaty , and today we see that there is a consensus forming around this idea , " barroso told reporters at a joint press conference with sarkozy . the french president also took the opportunity of his first visit to brussels since taking power on may 6 to reaffirm his opposition to turkey 's bid to join the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and barroso have differing views on turkey " i do n't see how you can be a candidate with one opinion and a president with another , " sarkozy said .
" i do n't think that turkey has a place in the union , " he concluded , but added that he did not want to dwell on the issue at present . " the question does n't arise at present and we already have enough on our plate , " sarkozy explained . barroso stressed that his european commission was " in favor of negotiations with turkey , " but concurred with sarkozy that " right now , our absolute priority is the treaty , the resolution of the institutional crisis . " constitution , mini-treaty , simplified treaty on the eu 's institutional gridlock , the french president said a european summit next month would be a success " if the 27 -lrb- eu member states -rrb- are in agreement for a simplified treaty . " in france , such a treaty could be submitted for approval by the parliament in order to avoid a repeat of the 2005 popular referenda that cut down the now moribund eu constitution . after french voters rejected the original constitution , france found itself playing an increasingly marginal role in the club of architects of the new europe .
sarkozy 's government now wants to reclaim france 's leadership in the eu , a campaign promise that had been trumpeted by both sarkozy and runner-up ségolène royal . last year , sarkozy had used the term " mini-treaty " to describe what he felt would be an acceptable constitutional framework for the eu .
the french leader said he recognized now that " mini-treaty " lacks ambition . eighteen member states have ratified the original constitution , which was deemed necessary to bring eu institutions up to date in the expanded bloc .
but any new treaty will have to revisit some controversial topics , such as references to " shared values , " which were understood by some observers as a coded exclusion of turkey from the eu club . " we must work together " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan called sarkozy to propose a get-together turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan phoned sarkozy on thursday , according to reuters .
the news agency cited " sources in erdogan 's office " who said erdogan congratulated the french leader on his victory at the polls and suggested the two should work together directly . " we must not communicate via media statements , " erdogan 's aides told reuters .
" -lrb- we must -rrb- work together with direct talks . " for his part , sarkozy offered his condolences for a bomb attack in ankara on tuesday , which killed six people and wounded dozens more in the worst bombing in the turkish capital in at least a decade . sarkozy said he wanted to work together with erdogan to overcome their common problems , the sources told reuters .
the heads of state went on to discuss cooperation between france and turkey , a nato member , on a broad range of economic , political and military issues . but on the campaign trail , sarkozy made it clear that he was staunchly opposed to turkey 's accession to the eu .
he has instead proposed a mediterranean union for turkey and its neighbors .

" -lrb- sarkozy -rrb- was the first to suggest the idea of a simplified treaty , and today we see that there is a consensus forming around this idea , " barroso told reporters at a joint press conference with sarkozy . the french president also took the opportunity of his first visit to brussels since taking power on may 6 to reaffirm his opposition to turkey 's bid to join the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and barroso have differing views on turkey " i do n't see how you can be a candidate with one opinion and a president with another , " sarkozy said .
" i do n't think that turkey has a place in the union , " he concluded , but added that he did not want to dwell on the issue at present . " the question does n't arise at present and we already have enough on our plate , " sarkozy explained . barroso stressed that his european commission was " in favor of negotiations with turkey , " but concurred with sarkozy that " right now , our absolute priority is the treaty , the resolution of the institutional crisis . " constitution , mini-treaty , simplified treaty on the eu 's institutional gridlock , the french president said a european summit next month would be a success " if the 27 -lrb- eu member states -rrb- are in agreement for a simplified treaty . " in france , such a treaty could be submitted for approval by the parliament in order to avoid a repeat of the 2005 popular referenda that cut down the now moribund eu constitution . after french voters rejected the original constitution , france found itself playing an increasingly marginal role in the club of architects of the new europe .
sarkozy 's government now wants to reclaim france 's leadership in the eu , a campaign promise that had been trumpeted by both sarkozy and runner-up ségolène royal . last year , sarkozy had used the term " mini-treaty " to describe what he felt would be an acceptable constitutional framework for the eu .
the french leader said he recognized now that " mini-treaty " lacks ambition . eighteen member states have ratified the original constitution , which was deemed necessary to bring eu institutions up to date in the expanded bloc .
but any new treaty will have to revisit some controversial topics , such as references to " shared values , " which were understood by some observers as a coded exclusion of turkey from the eu club . " we must work together " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan called sarkozy to propose a get-together turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan phoned sarkozy on thursday , according to reuters .
the news agency cited " sources in erdogan 's office " who said erdogan congratulated the french leader on his victory at the polls and suggested the two should work together directly . " we must not communicate via media statements , " erdogan 's aides told reuters .
" -lrb- we must -rrb- work together with direct talks . " for his part , sarkozy offered his condolences for a bomb attack in ankara on tuesday , which killed six people and wounded dozens more in the worst bombing in the turkish capital in at least a decade . sarkozy said he wanted to work together with erdogan to overcome their common problems , the sources told reuters .
the heads of state went on to discuss cooperation between france and turkey , a nato member , on a broad range of economic , political and military issues . but on the campaign trail , sarkozy made it clear that he was staunchly opposed to turkey 's accession to the eu .
he has instead proposed a mediterranean union for turkey and its neighbors .
french secretary of state for european affairs jean-pierre jouyet has not ruled out a french veto of further entry talks . turkey began negotiating for membership with the eu in 2005 .
the talks are expected to last 10 to 15 years .
so far , turkey and the eu have successfully completed one of the 35 policy chapters required for accession . german chancellor angela merkel has also spoken out against turkey 's membership bid , preferring instead what she termed a " privileged partnership " with germany and the eu . as rotating eu president , merkel has been more cautious in her assertions vis-à-vis turkey .
and in brussels , eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn reiterated the eu 's plans to continue accession talks with turkey . " we have a sound negotiating mandate with turkey , " rehn said .
he added : " if we succeed - if turkey succeeds - turkey can become an even more important bridge of civilizations than it is today . " " strasbourg is non-negotiable " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament in strasbourg , eastern france sarkozy also rejected calls to shut down the eu parliament 's strasbourg seat . " strasbourg is non-negotiable , it is part of europe 's founding balances , " sarkozy said . european members of parliament currently commute between the two chambers in strasbourg and brussels , prompting calls from some mps to consolidate the chambers into one city to save time and resources , and to reduce carbon dioxide emissions caused by frequent travel . sarkozy is set to travel to spain next week as part of his comprehensive diplomatic drive .
in madrid , he is scheduled to meet with spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero . dw staff / afp -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sarkozy to make berlin first official stop after taking office after his inauguration , french president elect nicolas sarkozy wo n't have much time to savor the feeling of stepping into jacques chirac 's shoes - he 'll be busy flying to germany .

a german diplomat warned the move could harm the ukraine 's relationship with europe . ukraine 's political crisis escalated on friday as president viktor yushchenko attempted to take control of thousands of interior ministry troops away from his rival prime minister viktor yanukovych . the menacing new twist in a long-running power struggle between the two leaders drew expressions of concern from europe , russia and the united states , which warned against the use of violence . yushchenko ordered that authority over interior ministry forces be removed from the government headed by the premier and transferred to the president , in a decree published on his official website .
the president already controls the army under ukraine 's constitution . the decree covers interior ministry troops with military training often used for anti-riot operations and does not include the police force or the ministry 's elite berkut unit . yanukovych angrily rejected the president 's order as an anti-constitutional " interference in the activities of the executive branch , " while speaking to western diplomats in a televised meeting . parliamentary speaker and yanukovych ally oleksandr moroz went further during the same meeting with foreign diplomats , describing the president 's move as a " coup attempt . " us calls for peaceful resolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of prime minister yanukovych protested friday reacting to the rising political temperature in kiev , the united states called on both sides to resolve their dispute " without violence " and to abide by democratic rules . " we expect the ukrainians to follow their constitutional and legal processes and live up to their responsibilities in a democracy , " national security spokesman gordon johndroe told reporters . prime minister mikhail fradkov of russia , ukraine 's giant neighbor and main trading partner , said that he was " worried " about the escalating tensions and also urged authorities to abide by the law . germany urges restraint bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovych supporters also demonstrated in kiev johannes regenbrecht , a german diplomat at the meeting with yanukovych , warned that the use of force to solve the crisis would have serious consequences in ukraine 's relations with europe .
" all means must be used to avoid an escalation , " regenbrecht said . the european union expressed its and urged the feuding president and prime minister to try to settle the stand-off peacefully .
" the presidency of the european union is increasingly concerned about recent developments in ukraine , " the current german presidency of the eu said in a statement .
" the presidency urges president yushchenko and prime minister yanukovych to assume the responsibility which they have to resolve the political crisis in ukraine through negotiations , as agreed , " the statement said . " these events can not but aggravate the political situation in the country , " eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said in a separate statement from brussels .
" i call upon all political forces in ukraine to do their utmost , on the basis of a constructive attitude and in a peaceful and lawful manner , to find a viable political compromise to solve the current political impasse and to refrain from any action which would further exacerbate the situation , especially by involving the security forces , " she said . " this is vital for the people of ukraine , and for ukraine 's continued progress on the path of political and economic reform . " on thursday , the interior ministry 's elite berkut forces raised the president 's ire by defying his order to dismiss the country 's prosecutor general , a yanukovych ally , who refused to step down calling his dismissal illegal . the elite forces , which are not affected by friday 's decree , arrived at the offices where the prosecutor general was holed up , and scuffled with security personnel controlled by the president . dissolution of parliament prompts crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko dissolved parliament in april the latest round of political recriminations in ukraine began with yushchenko 's dissolution of parliament last month , part of an ongoing dispute with the prime minister over the course of the country . yushchenko , who cancelled a trip to the czech republic on friday due to the latest crisis , favors full integration with the west , including the nato military alliance , while the prime minister favors close ties with moscow . in recent weeks , the two have been locked in stalemate over the timing of new parliamentary elections , and a reported deal appears to be in tatters after the latest stand-off . " i would say that i no longer have any optimism that results can be achieved considering the opposition demonstrated by the two sides , " yushchenko told a meeting of regional leaders on friday , the interfax news agency reported . yanukovych struck a more optimistic note , calling for a " return to political dialogue , " during the televised meeting with foreign diplomats . control over interior ministry forces was crucial in the orange revolution of 2004 , when mass street protests helped bring yushchenko to the presidency , overturning a flawed vote initially granted to yanukovych . reports at the time said yushchenko 's victory over yanukovych was due to a refusal by interior ministry forces to follow orders to crush the " people power " protests . on friday , thousands of yanukovych supporters rallied outside the prosecutor 's office to protest against the president 's decree as part of ongoing anti-yushchenko demonstrations in kiev . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine gripped by stalemate as eu waits for compromise rival demonstrators rallied in the ukrainian capital as defiant prime minister viktor yanukovych rejected a possible concession by his political enemy , president viktor yushchenko .

protesters will be able to march through several country lanes but will not be allowed into the resort or closer than 200 meters -lrb- about 650 feet -rrb- to the barbed-wire-topped fence when leaders of eight main nations meet june 6-8 .
police search mail boxes anti-globalization groups have described a widening police probe into a spate of anti-g8 petrol bombings in hamburg and berlin as excessive .
the postal company , deutsche post , confirmed officers looked through mail from tuesday to thursday at a hamburg sorting center .
police also accompanied a postman who was clearing city letter-boxes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the green party set up paper version of g8 leaders this week to protest the summit " these were interceptions with judicial permission after letters claiming responsibility turned up , " said branch director detlef kreutzer .
there have been more than a dozen night-time attacks on cars and homes with petrol bombs in recent months in hamburg , but no arrests .
no one has been injured .
on may 9 , riots broke out in hamburg after police raids on a leftist center in the city .
the arson attacks have continued to damage property .
claims of responsibility sent to media have criticized both the g8 and german industry .
criticism for crack-down german police have faced criticism from the media for not catching any of the radicals , as well as criticism from anti-globalization activists that the hunt for a few has led to treating the whole movement as suspects .
mainstream aid and environmentalist groups said this week that the main rally in the nearby city of rostock before the summit would be peaceful .
monty schädel , a coordinator in rostock of the protests , welcomed the schwerin court ruling , saying it was a rebuke to police .
german interior minister wolfgang schäuble defended the restrictions , saying he had to ensure the safety of summit guests .
he said riots at previous summits showed a fence was necessary .

if the sport is to change and become clean then the three-martini business lunch has to go , according to dw sports editor wolfgang von kann . this week , germany 's tabloid bild zeitung asked , " mr. ullrich , you really did n't know about this ? " but the affair has long gone beyond jan ullrich or any of the other big names .
sure , if yet another cyclist from ullrich & co. were to come out of the doping closet , it would help illuminate the situation further - but it would be essentially meaningless . that 's because today , much more is on the line than the careers of a few cyclists .
anyone who has been following recent developments in athletics , swimming , triathlon or cross-country skiing - to say nothing of weightlifting - will hardly claim that the morass of doping scandals is confined to the cycling arena . we are now talking about competitive sports in general .
this is about breaking up structures with unmistakably mafiaesque semblances .
ultimately , the reputation of all competitive sports is on the line . our unsung heroes but even that is a generalization that scratches at the surface but skirts the core of the issue .
indeed , the central question has yet to be asked : to what extent are we - consumers , viewers , fans and also the media - to blame for all of this ?
what kind of society are we living in , anyway ? it is time to examine the demands we place on our athletes .
barely 20 years old , they are expected to act as role models - a part only few come by voluntarily .
in their twenties , they are supposed to be the shining heroes who make no mistakes and scoop up all the medals at the olympic games .
and over 30 , they are meant to do everything they can to prove that age does n't matter . craving new records where do the fans of cycling races stand ?
at the top of the hill , where the riders hurt the most .
what do people want to see at track-and-field events ?
they are waiting for the world record .
and what do they want at weightlifting competitions ?
they want to see more weight loaded on the bar . the limits of athletic achievement are constantly being pushed .
at the same time , the athlete is expected to be a clean-cut do-gooder , ready to cast aside all signs of exertion and bedazzle the cameras with an eloquent post-match interview . of course , the athlete will achieve all of this on bread and water alone . how one person is supposed to be all that , nobody wants to know . people who live in glass houses ... this rigmarole is not without hypocrisy .
for what is it that we non-athletes do ?
we send our kids to school with sedatives .
we indulge in a little booze during lunch time , or even before we arrive at the office .
we can barely survive without nicotine and alcohol .
and we drink liter after liter of coffee , so that we can do it all . we are a drug nation : at the first sign of a mild cold , we immediately pour a bottle of cough medicine - which , by the way , is prohibited for athletes - down our throats , or just stay in bed griping . ultimately , competitive sports are a mirror image of our society , and is therefore no better or worse than us .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 25.05.2007 opinion : reputation of competitive sports is on the line großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more professional cyclists are admitting to illegal doping .
if the sport is to change and become clean then the three-martini business lunch has to go , according to dw sports editor wolfgang von kann . this week , germany 's tabloid bild zeitung asked , " mr. ullrich , you really did n't know about this ? " but the affair has long gone beyond jan ullrich or any of the other big names .
sure , if yet another cyclist from ullrich & co. were to come out of the doping closet , it would help illuminate the situation further - but it would be essentially meaningless . that 's because today , much more is on the line than the careers of a few cyclists .
anyone who has been following recent developments in athletics , swimming , triathlon or cross-country skiing - to say nothing of weightlifting - will hardly claim that the morass of doping scandals is confined to the cycling arena . we are now talking about competitive sports in general .
this is about breaking up structures with unmistakably mafiaesque semblances .
ultimately , the reputation of all competitive sports is on the line . our unsung heroes but even that is a generalization that scratches at the surface but skirts the core of the issue .
indeed , the central question has yet to be asked : to what extent are we - consumers , viewers , fans and also the media - to blame for all of this ?
what kind of society are we living in , anyway ? it is time to examine the demands we place on our athletes .
barely 20 years old , they are expected to act as role models - a part only few come by voluntarily .
in their twenties , they are supposed to be the shining heroes who make no mistakes and scoop up all the medals at the olympic games .
and over 30 , they are meant to do everything they can to prove that age does n't matter . craving new records where do the fans of cycling races stand ?
at the top of the hill , where the riders hurt the most .
what do people want to see at track-and-field events ?
they are waiting for the world record .
and what do they want at weightlifting competitions ?
they want to see more weight loaded on the bar . the limits of athletic achievement are constantly being pushed .
at the same time , the athlete is expected to be a clean-cut do-gooder , ready to cast aside all signs of exertion and bedazzle the cameras with an eloquent post-match interview . of course , the athlete will achieve all of this on bread and water alone . how one person is supposed to be all that , nobody wants to know . people who live in glass houses ... this rigmarole is not without hypocrisy .
for what is it that we non-athletes do ?
we send our kids to school with sedatives .
we indulge in a little booze during lunch time , or even before we arrive at the office .
we can barely survive without nicotine and alcohol .
and we drink liter after liter of coffee , so that we can do it all . we are a drug nation : at the first sign of a mild cold , we immediately pour a bottle of cough medicine - which , by the way , is prohibited for athletes - down our throats , or just stay in bed griping . ultimately , competitive sports are a mirror image of our society , and is therefore no better or worse than us .
if the sport is to change and become clean , then society has to change .
we have to change . wolfgang von kann is deutsche welle 's sports editor . wolfgang von kann -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " mass doping is now the order of the day " peter danckert , chairman of the parliamentary committee on sports , spoke with dw-world.de about the recent slough of doping confessions , germany 's new anti-doping law and what the sport world can do better .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de third reich -pipe- 25.05.2007 exhibit examines divergent fates of german-jewish exiles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new york was the dream destination of many german-jewish emigres .
a new museum exhibit on german jews who fled their homeland between 1933 and 1941 examines the life-changing - and ultimately life-saving - experiences of those who managed to escape the nazi threat . the multimedia exhibit " homeland and exile : emigration of german jews after 1933 " represents the most comprehensive look ever taken at jews who fled germany for over a hundred countries around the world .
the exhibit touches on the larger political issues of the era , but mostly it focuses on the people who were forced to turn their back on their " heimat " - a german word that encompasses both the concept of homeland and the feeling of emotional attachment to it - and their individual and collective journeys to a new life .
why did they go , where did they find refuge , and under what conditions ?
how did they build new lives for themselves , and how did they feel about their " home countries " both new and old ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young emigrants aboard the ship " martha washington , " en route to palestine the exhibit tackles these questions with commentated displays that briefly describe the widespread anti-semitism and curtailment of civil liberties that led some 280,000 of the 500,000 jews living in germany to emigrate , starting in 1933 .
-lrb- one artefact from that time on display : a children 's board game called jews out ! that involved driving out jew-shaped playing pieces from a town full of shops with names like " salomon 's money lenders . " -rrb-
from there , the story turns to the ways and means of leaving , with the show dividing thematically into rooms devoted to the stories of those who shipped off for destinations across europe , the americas , africa and asia .
on on a 3-d interactive map , museum-goers can pinpoint the 100 countries that eventually allowed jewish refugees entry .
farming in the dominican republic the curators make clear that some destinations were seen as more desirable than others .
the most sought after visa , limited in number and only available to those with an affidavit of support , was for the us .
less preferred was shanghai , which nonetheless became the last chance for escape for some 18,000 to 20,000 jews , thanks to its policy of allowing entry without a visa up to 1941 .
one of the odder histories in this section involves a plan hatched by the then-dictator of the dominican republic , rafael trujillo , to imported jewish " agricultural experts " in an effort to " whiten " his population , and give the country a needed injection of economic energy .
most of the artefacts on display are from the permanent collections of the jewish museum in berlin , where the show ran from sept . , 2006 to april , 2007 , and from other historical collections , explained cilly kugelmann , progam director of the berlin jewish museum .
" there are people who kept everything , every paper , every letter .
that generation is dying out , and they know their children wo n't take care of their things , so they donate it to historical collections , " she explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil liberties for jews were curtailed under the nazis kugelmann said her own favorite artefact is a coin purse kept by a man whose arduous journey out of germany involved going through numerous countries ; he eventually settled in portugal , but kept change in the purse from each stop along the way .
reconstructing lives from ephemera ephemera from the era -lrb- photographs , poems , diaries , ticket stubs , letters -rrb- is interspersed with objects. suitcases , clothing , coffee pots , dolls ; anything either left behind , taken along , or taken up as part of a new life in a new land .
possibly most compelling are the interactive kiosks that allow viewers to hear the emigres ' personal stories .
videotaped interviews are broken down into short , accessible segments under different categories , and english subtitles are available .
overall , kugelmann said , the exhibit tells a story of a people who did a " remarkably successful " job of adjusting to a difficult situation - even if some of the people faced depression , unhappiness , and even committed suicide .
their success as immigrants was one of the main reasons to create the exhibit , explained kugelmann .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a child 's view of its new world " many of the people who left embarked on their new lives with a certain distinctive , ironic pragmatism , " she said .
" we wondered , ' why were they relatively so successful ?
their children went on to be successful .
how did they do it ? "
a more positive view of the nazi era ?
kugelmann also implied that , more than half a century after the fact , it may be time for germany to start looking at the story of the holocaust from a new angle .
" over the past 60 years , german society has developed a relationship to the nazi period in which the mass murder has become the sole paradigm , " she said .
" the survival of almost two-thirds of german jews was simply ignored . "
and jürgen reiche , exhibitions director at the museum of contemporary history , also said he hoped the exhibit will incite young people to take a new look at germany , past and present .
" we sometimes forget that german-jewish history is also german history , " he said .
' they were robbed of a homeland " but hebrew university historian moshe zimmermann , who consulted on the exhibit , warned of the tendency to concentrate on the well-known successes among the refugees from the nazis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the exhibition focuses on the exiled children " the idea is often that the emigration didn ’ t destroy many lives .
people think of thomas mann , billy wilder , henry kissinger .
and they say , ' they left germany , it was n't so tragic , " he said .
" people say , ' they could find a home elsewhere because jews are like that . ' … but if you start thinking that way , you 're starting with the wrong idea . "
as the word " heimat " in the title of the exhibit makes clear , " the émigrés were , despite everything , german , " zimmermann said .
" they were germans who were jews .
and they were robbed of their homeland . "
" there is no plural for the word heimat .

a new museum exhibit on german jews who fled their homeland between 1933 and 1941 examines the life-changing - and ultimately life-saving - experiences of those who managed to escape the nazi threat . the multimedia exhibit " homeland and exile : emigration of german jews after 1933 " represents the most comprehensive look ever taken at jews who fled germany for over a hundred countries around the world .
the exhibit touches on the larger political issues of the era , but mostly it focuses on the people who were forced to turn their back on their " heimat " - a german word that encompasses both the concept of homeland and the feeling of emotional attachment to it - and their individual and collective journeys to a new life .
why did they go , where did they find refuge , and under what conditions ?
how did they build new lives for themselves , and how did they feel about their " home countries " both new and old ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young emigrants aboard the ship " martha washington , " en route to palestine the exhibit tackles these questions with commentated displays that briefly describe the widespread anti-semitism and curtailment of civil liberties that led some 280,000 of the 500,000 jews living in germany to emigrate , starting in 1933 .
-lrb- one artefact from that time on display : a children 's board game called jews out ! that involved driving out jew-shaped playing pieces from a town full of shops with names like " salomon 's money lenders . " -rrb-
from there , the story turns to the ways and means of leaving , with the show dividing thematically into rooms devoted to the stories of those who shipped off for destinations across europe , the americas , africa and asia .
on on a 3-d interactive map , museum-goers can pinpoint the 100 countries that eventually allowed jewish refugees entry .
farming in the dominican republic the curators make clear that some destinations were seen as more desirable than others .
the most sought after visa , limited in number and only available to those with an affidavit of support , was for the us .
less preferred was shanghai , which nonetheless became the last chance for escape for some 18,000 to 20,000 jews , thanks to its policy of allowing entry without a visa up to 1941 .
one of the odder histories in this section involves a plan hatched by the then-dictator of the dominican republic , rafael trujillo , to imported jewish " agricultural experts " in an effort to " whiten " his population , and give the country a needed injection of economic energy .
most of the artefacts on display are from the permanent collections of the jewish museum in berlin , where the show ran from sept . , 2006 to april , 2007 , and from other historical collections , explained cilly kugelmann , progam director of the berlin jewish museum .
" there are people who kept everything , every paper , every letter .
that generation is dying out , and they know their children wo n't take care of their things , so they donate it to historical collections , " she explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil liberties for jews were curtailed under the nazis kugelmann said her own favorite artefact is a coin purse kept by a man whose arduous journey out of germany involved going through numerous countries ; he eventually settled in portugal , but kept change in the purse from each stop along the way .
reconstructing lives from ephemera ephemera from the era -lrb- photographs , poems , diaries , ticket stubs , letters -rrb- is interspersed with objects. suitcases , clothing , coffee pots , dolls ; anything either left behind , taken along , or taken up as part of a new life in a new land .
possibly most compelling are the interactive kiosks that allow viewers to hear the emigres ' personal stories .
videotaped interviews are broken down into short , accessible segments under different categories , and english subtitles are available .
overall , kugelmann said , the exhibit tells a story of a people who did a " remarkably successful " job of adjusting to a difficult situation - even if some of the people faced depression , unhappiness , and even committed suicide .
their success as immigrants was one of the main reasons to create the exhibit , explained kugelmann .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a child 's view of its new world " many of the people who left embarked on their new lives with a certain distinctive , ironic pragmatism , " she said .
" we wondered , ' why were they relatively so successful ?
their children went on to be successful .
how did they do it ? "
a more positive view of the nazi era ?
kugelmann also implied that , more than half a century after the fact , it may be time for germany to start looking at the story of the holocaust from a new angle .
" over the past 60 years , german society has developed a relationship to the nazi period in which the mass murder has become the sole paradigm , " she said .
" the survival of almost two-thirds of german jews was simply ignored . "

on may 19 , the tally rose further after a suicide bomb killed three soldiers in kunduz , afghanistan .
the deaths of the soldiers , which brought the german fatality toll since the bundeswehr deployed to afghanistan in 2002 to a total of 21 , has not only generated hefty debate in parliament over the security of the troops in afghanistan , but on how to memorialize those who die while serving their country .
while there are little reservations about building a memorial to honor soldiers killed on duty in the country 's post-war armed forces , discussion has centered on the planned location for such a monument . bildunterschrift : a memorial service was held for the fallen soldiers on wednesday german defense minister franz josef jung , who has long harbored plans to honor the fallen soldiers , said the memorial would be erected within the ministry 's premises in berlin .
thomas raabe , spokesman for the defense ministry , said on thursday that the memorial would be located within the bendlerblock compound , the seat of germany 's defense ministry in berlin .
" there will be no changes to that , " he added .
a public memorial ?
but not everyone agrees with locating the memorial within a high-security tract not easily accessible to the general public .
the representative for the armed forces in the german parliament , reinhold robbe , said the majority of soldiers would prefer to see the monument built on a prominent site in berlin .
speaking on the television station rtl , robbe said the monument and its location needed to make clear to all who see it that the bundeswehr is a " parliament 's army . "
the recent fatalities in afghanistan have shown " just how dangerous the job of a soldier is , " and that the soldiers serve " in the name of germany , " robbe added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 3,000 german troops are stationed in afghanistan the head of the cross-party parliamentary committee for cultural affairs , hans-joachim otto , told deutsche welle it was " highly unfortunate that the defense ministry treats the matter of the memorial as its private business . "
" the bundeswehr is a conscription-based army and hence an army of the people .
bundeswehr missions are decided upon in parliament and not in the defense ministry , " he said , adding that as such a more public location would be more in keeping with the nature of germany 's armed forces .
more than a wreath depository peter steinbach , the head of berlin 's german resistance memorial site , also argued against placing the monument behind a closed-off gate at the defense ministry .
such a memorial belongs within view of the public , he said on german public radio .
otherwise , it risks becoming simply a " depository for wreaths . "
with a view to similar memorials in other countries , steinbach said , " no one would ever have suggested that the vietnam memorial in the united sites be built within the pentagon 's courtyard . "
chancellor angela merkel , who in february had suggested a more public location closer to the reichstag as a reminder to the role of parliament in deploying the armed forces , endorsed the ministry 's proposal for erecting the memorial within the bendlerblock compound .
her spokesman ulrich wilhelm said thursday she sees eye-to-eye with the defense minister and that details will be presented within due time .
despite the ongoing debate , jung is expected to lay the cornerstone for the memorial later this year . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " german military can be strong complement in afghanistan " additional questions about germany 's role in afghanistan arose when three of its soldiers lost their lives in a suicide bombing .

the representative for the armed forces in the german parliament , reinhold robbe , said the majority of soldiers would prefer to see the monument built on a prominent site in berlin .
speaking on the television station rtl , robbe said the monument and its location needed to make clear to all who see it that the bundeswehr is a " parliament 's army . "

" the bundeswehr is a conscription-based army and hence an army of the people .
bundeswehr missions are decided upon in parliament and not in the defense ministry , " he said , adding that as such a more public location would be more in keeping with the nature of germany 's armed forces .
more than a wreath depository peter steinbach , the head of berlin 's german resistance memorial site , also argued against placing the monument behind a closed-off gate at the defense ministry .
such a memorial belongs within view of the public , he said on german public radio .
otherwise , it risks becoming simply a " depository for wreaths . "
with a view to similar memorials in other countries , steinbach said , " no one would ever have suggested that the vietnam memorial in the united sites be built within the pentagon 's courtyard . "
chancellor angela merkel , who in february had suggested a more public location closer to the reichstag as a reminder to the role of parliament in deploying the armed forces , endorsed the ministry 's proposal for erecting the memorial within the bendlerblock compound .

turkey began negotiations in 2005 .
turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan reportedly phoned sarkozy on thursday , in an apparent conciliatory gesture , according to reuters .
in his first call to sarkozy since his election , sources in erdogan 's office quoted the prime minister as congratulating the french president on his victory in the polls and told him that the two needed to work directly with each other , according to reuters .
" we must not communicate via media statements , " erdogan was quoted as telling sarkozy .
" -lrb- we must -rrb- work together with direct talks . "
sarkozy reportedly offered his condolences for a bomb attack in ankara on tuesday and said he wanted to work together to overcome their common problems , according to reuters .

finance minister peer steinbrück said the move will improve germany 's standing on the global market . the german parliament on friday paved the way for the country ’ s biggest corporate tax reform in post-world war ii history , which would put its rates on par with the rest of europe .
as of jan .
1 , 2008 , corporate tax will be lowered to 30 percent from the current rate of 39 percent - the highest in the european union .
" this corporate tax reform will make germany a more attractive place for investment , " said steinbrück .
he added in an interview broadcast on public radio friday that all citizens would benefit from the reform because tax revenues would actually increase , at least in the mid-term , though critics have warned of an initial loss of around 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.7 billion -rrb- . the bill , which is expected to be approved by germany 's upper parliamentary house before the summer recess , would also prevent companies from getting tax benefits in germany by taking loans via subsidiaries abroad .
a " blessing of billions " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister steinbrueck said the reform will make germany attractive to investors criticism of the reform has come mainly from the leftist fraction , the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the greens .
chairman of the left party 's parliamentary group , oskar lafontaine , called the corporate tax bill a " blessing of billions for big business , " adding that it would be better to adjust income tax rates for small companies .
jan paul bach , the owner of a 15-employee company near berlin that produces high-tech ceramic elements , said the changes were necessary for germany to keep up in the global marketplace .
" i think the tax reform is necessary to compete with new economies like china or india , which have lower ages and a better position in the global economy , " bach told deutsche welle .
he added , however that he did n't think it was fair that " big companies pay lower taxes while the employees have to pay higher taxes . " to make up for the cuts , germany is abolishing tax holidays , which have mainly benefited multinationals .
an inheritance tax reform is also in the works , on the initiative of the social democratic party , which is part of a series of tax adjustments meant to offset the corporate tax reform . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german family-owned businesses often upstage the big guys a new study has shown that family-owned businesses in germany from 2003 to 2005 performed better than dax firms in both job creation and sales growth .

a german diplomat warned the move could harm the ukraine 's relationship with europe . ukraine 's political crisis escalated on friday as president viktor yushchenko attempted to take control of thousands of interior ministry troops away from his rival prime minister viktor yanukovych . the menacing new twist in a long-running power struggle between the two leaders drew expressions of concern from europe , russia and the united states , which warned against the use of violence . yushchenko ordered that authority over interior ministry forces be removed from the government headed by the premier and transferred to the president , in a decree published on his official website .
the president already controls the army under ukraine 's constitution . the decree covers interior ministry troops with military training often used for anti-riot operations and does not include the police force or the ministry 's elite berkut unit . yanukovych angrily rejected the president 's order as an anti-constitutional " interference in the activities of the executive branch , " while speaking to western diplomats in a televised meeting . parliamentary speaker and yanukovych ally oleksandr moroz went further during the same meeting with foreign diplomats , describing the president 's move as a " coup attempt .

" we expect the ukrainians to follow their constitutional and legal processes and live up to their responsibilities in a democracy , " national security spokesman gordon johndroe told reporters . prime minister mikhail fradkov of russia , ukraine 's giant neighbor and main trading partner , said that he was " worried " about the escalating tensions and also urged authorities to abide by the law . germany urges restraint bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovych supporters also demonstrated in kiev johannes regenbrecht , a german diplomat at the meeting with yanukovych , warned that the use of force to solve the crisis would have serious consequences in ukraine 's relations with europe .
" all means must be used to avoid an escalation , " regenbrecht said . the european union expressed its and urged the feuding president and prime minister to try to settle the stand-off peacefully .
" the presidency of the european union is increasingly concerned about recent developments in ukraine , " the current german presidency of the eu said in a statement .
" the presidency urges president yushchenko and prime minister yanukovych to assume the responsibility which they have to resolve the political crisis in ukraine through negotiations , as agreed , " the statement said . " these events can not but aggravate the political situation in the country , " eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said in a separate statement from brussels .
" i call upon all political forces in ukraine to do their utmost , on the basis of a constructive attitude and in a peaceful and lawful manner , to find a viable political compromise to solve the current political impasse and to refrain from any action which would further exacerbate the situation , especially by involving the security forces , " she said . " this is vital for the people of ukraine , and for ukraine 's continued progress on the path of political and economic reform . " on thursday , the interior ministry 's elite berkut forces raised the president 's ire by defying his order to dismiss the country 's prosecutor general , a yanukovych ally , who refused to step down calling his dismissal illegal . the elite forces , which are not affected by friday 's decree , arrived at the offices where the prosecutor general was holed up , and scuffled with security personnel controlled by the president . dissolution of parliament prompts crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko dissolved parliament in april the latest round of political recriminations in ukraine began with yushchenko 's dissolution of parliament last month , part of an ongoing dispute with the prime minister over the course of the country . yushchenko , who cancelled a trip to the czech republic on friday due to the latest crisis , favors full integration with the west , including the nato military alliance , while the prime minister favors close ties with moscow . in recent weeks , the two have been locked in stalemate over the timing of new parliamentary elections , and a reported deal appears to be in tatters after the latest stand-off . " i would say that i no longer have any optimism that results can be achieved considering the opposition demonstrated by the two sides , " yushchenko told a meeting of regional leaders on friday , the interfax news agency reported . yanukovych struck a more optimistic note , calling for a " return to political dialogue , " during the televised meeting with foreign diplomats . control over interior ministry forces was crucial in the orange revolution of 2004 , when mass street protests helped bring yushchenko to the presidency , overturning a flawed vote initially granted to yanukovych . reports at the time said yushchenko 's victory over yanukovych was due to a refusal by interior ministry forces to follow orders to crush the " people power " protests . on friday , thousands of yanukovych supporters rallied outside the prosecutor 's office to protest against the president 's decree as part of ongoing anti-yushchenko demonstrations in kiev . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine gripped by stalemate as eu waits for compromise rival demonstrators rallied in the ukrainian capital as defiant prime minister viktor yanukovych rejected a possible concession by his political enemy , president viktor yushchenko .

the president already controls the army under ukraine 's constitution . the decree covers interior ministry troops with military training often used for anti-riot operations and does not include the police force or the ministry 's elite berkut unit . yanukovych angrily rejected the president 's order as an anti-constitutional " interference in the activities of the executive branch , " while speaking to western diplomats in a televised meeting . parliamentary speaker and yanukovych ally oleksandr moroz went further during the same meeting with foreign diplomats , describing the president 's move as a " coup attempt . " us calls for peaceful resolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of prime minister yanukovych protested friday reacting to the rising political temperature in kiev , the united states called on both sides to resolve their dispute " without violence " and to abide by democratic rules . " we expect the ukrainians to follow their constitutional and legal processes and live up to their responsibilities in a democracy , " national security spokesman gordon johndroe told reporters . prime minister mikhail fradkov of russia , ukraine 's giant neighbor and main trading partner , said that he was " worried " about the escalating tensions and also urged authorities to abide by the law . germany urges restraint bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovych supporters also demonstrated in kiev johannes regenbrecht , a german diplomat at the meeting with yanukovych , warned that the use of force to solve the crisis would have serious consequences in ukraine 's relations with europe .
" all means must be used to avoid an escalation , " regenbrecht said . the european union expressed its and urged the feuding president and prime minister to try to settle the stand-off peacefully .
" the presidency of the european union is increasingly concerned about recent developments in ukraine , " the current german presidency of the eu said in a statement .
" the presidency urges president yushchenko and prime minister yanukovych to assume the responsibility which they have to resolve the political crisis in ukraine through negotiations , as agreed , " the statement said . " these events can not but aggravate the political situation in the country , " eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said in a separate statement from brussels .
" i call upon all political forces in ukraine to do their utmost , on the basis of a constructive attitude and in a peaceful and lawful manner , to find a viable political compromise to solve the current political impasse and to refrain from any action which would further exacerbate the situation , especially by involving the security forces , " she said . " this is vital for the people of ukraine , and for ukraine 's continued progress on the path of political and economic reform . " on thursday , the interior ministry 's elite berkut forces raised the president 's ire by defying his order to dismiss the country 's prosecutor general , a yanukovych ally , who refused to step down calling his dismissal illegal . the elite forces , which are not affected by friday 's decree , arrived at the offices where the prosecutor general was holed up , and scuffled with security personnel controlled by the president . dissolution of parliament prompts crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko dissolved parliament in april the latest round of political recriminations in ukraine began with yushchenko 's dissolution of parliament last month , part of an ongoing dispute with the prime minister over the course of the country . yushchenko , who cancelled a trip to the czech republic on friday due to the latest crisis , favors full integration with the west , including the nato military alliance , while the prime minister favors close ties with moscow . in recent weeks , the two have been locked in stalemate over the timing of new parliamentary elections , and a reported deal appears to be in tatters after the latest stand-off . " i would say that i no longer have any optimism that results can be achieved considering the opposition demonstrated by the two sides , " yushchenko told a meeting of regional leaders on friday , the interfax news agency reported . yanukovych struck a more optimistic note , calling for a " return to political dialogue , " during the televised meeting with foreign diplomats . control over interior ministry forces was crucial in the orange revolution of 2004 , when mass street protests helped bring yushchenko to the presidency , overturning a flawed vote initially granted to yanukovych . reports at the time said yushchenko 's victory over yanukovych was due to a refusal by interior ministry forces to follow orders to crush the " people power " protests . on friday , thousands of yanukovych supporters rallied outside the prosecutor 's office to protest against the president 's decree as part of ongoing anti-yushchenko demonstrations in kiev . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine gripped by stalemate as eu waits for compromise rival demonstrators rallied in the ukrainian capital as defiant prime minister viktor yanukovych rejected a possible concession by his political enemy , president viktor yushchenko .

france 's sarkozy thinks not on a diplomatic tour of europe , french president nicolas sarkozy expressed his opposition to turkey 's eu membership bid .
the newly elected french leader also championed the idea of a " simplified treaty " for the eu . nicolas sarkozy has n't been in office for three weeks , but his policy offensive to reclaim france 's leadership in the european union is in full swing . on a diplomatic tour of european countries , sarkozy championed the idea of a " simplified treaty " to replace the failed eu constitution .
european commission chief jose manuel barroso said the idea was gaining support . " -lrb- sarkozy -rrb- was the first to suggest the idea of a simplified treaty , and today we see that there is a consensus forming around this idea , " barroso told reporters at a joint press conference with sarkozy . the french president also took the opportunity of his first visit to brussels since taking power on may 6 to reaffirm his opposition to turkey 's bid to join the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and barroso have differing views on turkey " i do n't see how you can be a candidate with one opinion and a president with another , " sarkozy said .
" i do n't think that turkey has a place in the union , " he concluded , but added that he did not want to dwell on the issue at present . " the question does n't arise at present and we already have enough on our plate , " sarkozy explained . barroso stressed that his european commission was " in favor of negotiations with turkey , " but concurred with sarkozy that " right now , our absolute priority is the treaty , the resolution of the institutional crisis . " constitution , mini-treaty , simplified treaty on the eu 's institutional gridlock , the french president said a european summit next month would be a success " if the 27 -lrb- eu member states -rrb- are in agreement for a simplified treaty . " in france , such a treaty could be submitted for approval by the parliament in order to avoid a repeat of the 2005 popular referenda that cut down the now moribund eu constitution . after french voters rejected the original constitution , france found itself playing an increasingly marginal role in the club of architects of the new europe .
sarkozy 's government now wants to reclaim france 's leadership in the eu , a campaign promise that had been trumpeted by both sarkozy and runner-up ségolène royal . last year , sarkozy had used the term " mini-treaty " to describe what he felt would be an acceptable constitutional framework for the eu .
the french leader said he recognized now that " mini-treaty " lacks ambition . eighteen member states have ratified the original constitution , which was deemed necessary to bring eu institutions up to date in the expanded bloc .
but any new treaty will have to revisit some controversial topics , such as references to " shared values , " which were understood by some observers as a coded exclusion of turkey from the eu club . " we must work together " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan called sarkozy to propose a get-together turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan phoned sarkozy on thursday , according to reuters .
the news agency cited " sources in erdogan 's office " who said erdogan congratulated the french leader on his victory at the polls and suggested the two should work together directly . " we must not communicate via media statements , " erdogan 's aides told reuters .
" -lrb- we must -rrb- work together with direct talks . " for his part , sarkozy offered his condolences for a bomb attack in ankara on tuesday , which killed six people and wounded dozens more in the worst bombing in the turkish capital in at least a decade . sarkozy said he wanted to work together with erdogan to overcome their common problems , the sources told reuters .
the heads of state went on to discuss cooperation between france and turkey , a nato member , on a broad range of economic , political and military issues . but on the campaign trail , sarkozy made it clear that he was staunchly opposed to turkey 's accession to the eu .
he has instead proposed a mediterranean union for turkey and its neighbors .
french secretary of state for european affairs jean-pierre jouyet has not ruled out a french veto of further entry talks . turkey began negotiating for membership with the eu in 2005 .
the talks are expected to last 10 to 15 years .

he did n't forcefully condemn china 's human rights record , saying he would leave specific criticisms to the german government . köhler was almost euphoric as he recounted his " very good talks " with china 's leadership in beijing .
köhler managed to circumvent the minefield in which the issue of human rights had threatened to overshadow his visit , so that at the end , he was back in his element - advocating expanded cooperation with the world 's most populous country in the field of environmental and resource protection .
and , he reported , in this aspect he had found " open doors " in beijing .
köhler showed how impressed he was with china 's new generation of leaders : " they are aware of the problems and challenges of this society and its giant population number of 1.3 billion such as i have experienced from no other leadership , " said the man who had often visited china in the past in other functions .
" they are facing the problems and want to solve them , " he added .
leaving out details bildunterschrift : protestors bring attention to human rights abuses in china the chinese brought up the subject of human rights themselves , köhler said .
they admitted to " mistakes and problems " that they are working on .
but they did not speak about any specific cases .
köhler said that responsibility for talking about specifics rests with the german government .
" it was right for me to present the principles , but detailed human rights issues and cases are something that the german government has to talk about -lrb- with china -rrb- , " he said .
köhler was following a precedent set by former chancellors helmut kohl and gerhard schröder , an editorial in the friday edition of the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
he spoke in abstractions and " philosophized about human rights , but lacked the words to talk about the chinese problems . "
" it was important for me to bring forward the fundamentals , " köhler said .
the tensions in the run up to his meeting amog other things because of the resolution of the german parliament that criticized the " re-education through labor camps " in china , were not further talked about .
the resolution was rejected as " intervention " by beijing .
tapping köhler 's expertise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler said chinese leaders were eager for his advice the german president holds mostly ceremonial and diplomatic duties . he used to head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
state and party leader hu jintao was eager to tap into köhler 's experience in dealing with issues facing china , such as adequate employment for hundreds of millions of rural residents , or how to overcome the gap between the poor western regions and the wealthier coastal population .
they had talked at length , köhler said , about the rapid ageing of china 's population and the effects of this on the pensions and insurance sectors .
china 's leaders were " almost desperate " in asking how such problems might be resolved , he said .
" it was noticeable how he -lrb- hu -rrb- wanted to discuss with me in depth those problems he is itching to deal with , " köhler said .

he did n't forcefully condemn china 's human rights record , saying he would leave specific criticisms to the german government . köhler was almost euphoric as he recounted his " very good talks " with china 's leadership in beijing .
köhler managed to circumvent the minefield in which the issue of human rights had threatened to overshadow his visit , so that at the end , he was back in his element - advocating expanded cooperation with the world 's most populous country in the field of environmental and resource protection .
and , he reported , in this aspect he had found " open doors " in beijing .
köhler showed how impressed he was with china 's new generation of leaders : " they are aware of the problems and challenges of this society and its giant population number of 1.3 billion such as i have experienced from no other leadership , " said the man who had often visited china in the past in other functions .
" they are facing the problems and want to solve them , " he added .
leaving out details bildunterschrift : protestors bring attention to human rights abuses in china the chinese brought up the subject of human rights themselves , köhler said .
they admitted to " mistakes and problems " that they are working on .
but they did not speak about any specific cases .
köhler said that responsibility for talking about specifics rests with the german government .
" it was right for me to present the principles , but detailed human rights issues and cases are something that the german government has to talk about -lrb- with china -rrb- , " he said .
köhler was following a precedent set by former chancellors helmut kohl and gerhard schröder , an editorial in the friday edition of the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
he spoke in abstractions and " philosophized about human rights , but lacked the words to talk about the chinese problems . "
" it was important for me to bring forward the fundamentals , " köhler said .
the tensions in the run up to his meeting amog other things because of the resolution of the german parliament that criticized the " re-education through labor camps " in china , were not further talked about .
the resolution was rejected as " intervention " by beijing .

state and party leader hu jintao was eager to tap into köhler 's experience in dealing with issues facing china , such as adequate employment for hundreds of millions of rural residents , or how to overcome the gap between the poor western regions and the wealthier coastal population .
they had talked at length , köhler said , about the rapid ageing of china 's population and the effects of this on the pensions and insurance sectors .
china 's leaders were " almost desperate " in asking how such problems might be resolved , he said .
" it was noticeable how he -lrb- hu -rrb- wanted to discuss with me in depth those problems he is itching to deal with , " köhler said .

he did n't forcefully condemn china 's human rights record , saying he would leave specific criticisms to the german government . köhler was almost euphoric as he recounted his " very good talks " with china 's leadership in beijing .
köhler managed to circumvent the minefield in which the issue of human rights had threatened to overshadow his visit , so that at the end , he was back in his element - advocating expanded cooperation with the world 's most populous country in the field of environmental and resource protection .
and , he reported , in this aspect he had found " open doors " in beijing .
köhler showed how impressed he was with china 's new generation of leaders : " they are aware of the problems and challenges of this society and its giant population number of 1.3 billion such as i have experienced from no other leadership , " said the man who had often visited china in the past in other functions .
" they are facing the problems and want to solve them , " he added .
leaving out details bildunterschrift : protestors bring attention to human rights abuses in china the chinese brought up the subject of human rights themselves , köhler said .
they admitted to " mistakes and problems " that they are working on .
but they did not speak about any specific cases .
köhler said that responsibility for talking about specifics rests with the german government .
" it was right for me to present the principles , but detailed human rights issues and cases are something that the german government has to talk about -lrb- with china -rrb- , " he said .
köhler was following a precedent set by former chancellors helmut kohl and gerhard schröder , an editorial in the friday edition of the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
he spoke in abstractions and " philosophized about human rights , but lacked the words to talk about the chinese problems . "
" it was important for me to bring forward the fundamentals , " köhler said .
the tensions in the run up to his meeting amog other things because of the resolution of the german parliament that criticized the " re-education through labor camps " in china , were not further talked about .
the resolution was rejected as " intervention " by beijing .
tapping köhler 's expertise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler said chinese leaders were eager for his advice the german president holds mostly ceremonial and diplomatic duties . he used to head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
state and party leader hu jintao was eager to tap into köhler 's experience in dealing with issues facing china , such as adequate employment for hundreds of millions of rural residents , or how to overcome the gap between the poor western regions and the wealthier coastal population .
they had talked at length , köhler said , about the rapid ageing of china 's population and the effects of this on the pensions and insurance sectors .
china 's leaders were " almost desperate " in asking how such problems might be resolved , he said .
" it was noticeable how he -lrb- hu -rrb- wanted to discuss with me in depth those problems he is itching to deal with , " köhler said .
climate change a central theme bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has serious problems with pollution china pushed for the german government to provide more investement and technology to help develop a key bilateral relationship between the two nations , köhler told reporters after meeting chinese premier wen jiabao in beijing on friday .
china also hopes to see " more action " from germany in areas such as regular bilateral dialogues , and technology transfer related to environmental protection and energy efficiency , köhler said .
koehler said he was impressed with the openness of chinese leaders on environmental protection and their apparent willingness to take more action on climate change .
" it 's the first time that the chinese understand it -lrb- climate change -rrb- as an important issue in itself , " koehler said at the conclusion of his talks in the zhongnanhai compound used by leaders of china 's ruling communist party .
china seemed committed to achieving its targets for reducing carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency , but it lacked capacity and expertise , he said .
köhler said he was optimistic that china would play a " constructive role " in global efforts against climate change .
" china is aware that it is part of the problem , " he said .
" they want to be part of the solution . "
on saturday , köhler will deliver a speech in shanghai to mark the 100th anniversary of tongji university .
he departs for germany later saturday . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german president köhler seeks balance in asia on a week-long tour of asia that includes both vietnam , where he arrived monday , and china , german president horst köhler has worked to find the delicate balance between diplomatic and economic interests .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 25.05.2007 ladies and gentlemen , heidi klum presents hans and franz großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heidi klum quite aptly takes hans and franz to the golden globes awards german supermodel heidi klum has revealed that she calls her breasts hans and franz .
while that may be more information than most people need to know , others feel as though heidi has n't gone far enough . as two of the more obvious assets of a world famous lingerie model , hans and franz should be more or less used to the eyes of the world being trained on them .
however , despite one unexpected public appearance on the jay leno show in the us when they broke free of an 5.9 million-euro -lrb- $ 8 million -rrb- diamond-encrusted bra , heidi klum 's breasts are usually kept under wraps .
but after the german supermodel revealed her mammary monikers on thursday , worldwide attention has been more concentrated on the 35-inch bust than usual .
hans and franz have been stars of the victoria 's secrets lingerie catwalk shows and adverts for the past ten years but until heidi officially out-ed them as having names this week , they were more appreciated as just being part of the overall , highly aesthetic package .
now they are famous in the own right , people are clambering to know more and more about them .
and just like any new stars being embraced by the cult of celebrity , speculation about them is already rife on the international gossip pages .
no strangers to the limelight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans , franz and victoria 's secrets heidi herself is unique among supermodels for her openness , down-to-earth quality and sense of humor .
but , as with so many of her kind in the fashion world , she obviously believes that less is more .
while anyone who has seen her parading down a runway in the smallest of smalls will attest , this will come as no surprise .
however , in this case , the dearth is not of cloth covering her modesty but the information she is offering on hans and franz .
for one , which is which ?
does hans sit at her right hand or the left ?
also , from whom did the names originate ?
are they named after ex-partners , family relatives or friends ?
what are their likes and dislikes ?
-lrb- this last one will surely turn up in forthcoming interviews with heidi 's husband , the singer seal . -rrb-
all the 33-year-old from bergisch gladbach near cologne will say is that she gave her famous assets the stereotypically german names in homage to her homeland .
" they 've been an ongoing joke for , like , 12 years .
it started because i was from germany , and people always make fun of ze germans , yah ?
so when i began modeling i used to say , ' these are german breasts , one is called hans and one is called franz . " '
inspired by bodybuilder sketch ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did heidi name her breasts after a us comedy routine ?
from the fringe is just one of the many columns that believes there may be more to it that that .
one theory could be that the breasts are named after the characters of a sketch on us comedy show saturday night live .
comedians kevin nealon and dana carvey starred as hans and franz , two bodybuilders in the mould of arnold schwarzenegger who would appear to urge lesser men to get ' pumped ' .
the sketches would begin : " i am hans ... and i am franz ... and we are here to pump you up . "
if there is any truth in this tenuous link to heidi 's chest , it might explain why the klum version of hans and franz muscled their way out of a million-dollar bra live on american television .
however , the nealon and carvey versions were from austria which would render further investigation of this silly lead redundant .
more likely is that heidi named her breasts after famous germans , of which there have been many bearing the first names hans and franz .
being a well-known soccer fan , heidi could have paid homage to a couple of her country 's greats .
a homage to a solid pair ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz -lrb- beckenbauer , that is -rrb- is the one on the right born a year before the 1974 world cup triumph on home soil , maybe ms. klum dedicated her own solid pairing to the central defensive stalwarts of the winning team hans-georg schwarzenbeck and franz beckenbauer .
again , this is pure speculation on from the fringe 's part .
other than the origins of their names and the positioning of each , other questions arising from hans and franz 's introduction to the world include those pertaining to worth .
while casual observers may conclude that they are indeed priceless , as a model whose earnings were estimated by forbes magazine last year at 4.7 million euros , heidi will surely be looking to put a price on her now even-more-famous breasts .
she did after all insure her legs for 3.18 million euros .
what price for hans and franz , one wonders ?
and will they both be worth the same ?
a small scar on one of heidi 's legs means that one is more expensive than the other .
what imperfections , if any , could reduce the worth of either hans or franz ?

the security situation could further complicate turkey 's bid to join the european union . six turkish soldiers were killed by a roadside bomb thursday in southeast turkey near the border with iraq .
the attack on the military vehicle came two days after a suicide bomber killed a half dozen people in downtown ankara .
turkish political leaders have blamed kurdish rebels affiliated with the separatist kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk . -rrb-
twenty-six people , most of them students , have been arrested for alleged involvement in the attacks , according to media reports on friday .
the pkk is considered a terrorist organization by turkey , the eu and the united states .
the pkk has denied any involvement in the recent attacks , but turkish officials said the method of the bomb attack and the type of explosives were similar to past pkk attacks .
mending ties to eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy says turkey does n't belong in the eu the violence comes at a bad time for turkey .
the new french president nicolas sarkozy has made it clear he continues to oppose turkey 's bid to join the eu .
instead , he has proposed a mediterranean union between turkey and its neighbors .
" i do n't see how you can be a candidate with one opinion and a president with another , " he said during a press conference in brussels this week .
" i do n't think that turkey has a place in the union . " france has said it would consider vetoing turkey 's entry into the eu .
turkey began negotiations in 2005 .
turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan reportedly phoned sarkozy on thursday , in an apparent conciliatory gesture , according to reuters .
in his first call to sarkozy since his election , sources in erdogan 's office quoted the prime minister as congratulating the french president on his victory in the polls and told him that the two needed to work directly with each other , according to reuters .
" we must not communicate via media statements , " erdogan was quoted as telling sarkozy .
" -lrb- we must -rrb- work together with direct talks . "
sarkozy reportedly offered his condolences for a bomb attack in ankara on tuesday and said he wanted to work together to overcome their common problems , according to reuters .
erdogan also noted france and turkey cooperate on economic , political and military issues and that turkey is already a nato member . too soon to say if turkey belongs in eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : talks continue about turkey 's place in the eu eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn said the european commission plans to continue accession negotiations with turkey and said it was too soon to judge whether turkey belonged in the 27-member bloc .
" we have a sound negotiating mandate with turkey and the commission 's view is that we will continue the accession negotiations with turkey because it is in the interests of both the european union and turkey , " he said at a news briefing .
" if we succeed , if turkey succeeds , turkey can become an even more important bridge of civilizations than it is today , " rehn said .
" and the time to judge whether turkey has been able to meet the conditions of eu accession is in the latter stages of the accession process . "
turkey has general elections scheduled for july 22 to decide a political conflict between the islamic-leaning government and the military-backed secular establishment .
military needs to show restraint bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish special forces fire tear gas at kurdish demonstrators the recent bombings further complicate turkey 's domestic and foreign politics .
the pkk is thought to have launched the attacks from hideouts in northern iraq .
turkish army chief yasar buyukanit last month called for a military operation into iraq to quash pkk guerrillas . the united states and iraqi kurdish leaders oppose the idea .
a kurdish iraqi official recently warned that talk of such a move would signal a " dangerous escalation " of the situation .
the us has also urged turkey to show restraint , fearing a cross-border operation could disrupt efforts to stabilize war-torn iraq .
attacks blamed on rebels continued friday when a bomb derailed seven cars of a freight train in southeast turkey .
no injuries were reported .
police arrested 26 people , most of them university students belonging to the separatist kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , media reported on friday .
eight of the arrested are women who were preparing attacks , local authorities were quoted by the anatolia news agency as saying .
the pkk has fought for an ethnic homeland since 1984 , and ankara blames it for 30,000 deaths . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey set for fresh membership talks with eu eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn played down concerns that nicolas sarkozy , french president-elect , would stop turkey 's membership bid , adding that new talks with ankara could begin within weeks .

the security situation could further complicate turkey 's bid to join the european union . six turkish soldiers were killed by a roadside bomb thursday in southeast turkey near the border with iraq .
the attack on the military vehicle came two days after a suicide bomber killed a half dozen people in downtown ankara .
turkish political leaders have blamed kurdish rebels affiliated with the separatist kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk . -rrb-
twenty-six people , most of them students , have been arrested for alleged involvement in the attacks , according to media reports on friday .
the pkk is considered a terrorist organization by turkey , the eu and the united states .
the pkk has denied any involvement in the recent attacks , but turkish officials said the method of the bomb attack and the type of explosives were similar to past pkk attacks .
mending ties to eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy says turkey does n't belong in the eu the violence comes at a bad time for turkey .
the new french president nicolas sarkozy has made it clear he continues to oppose turkey 's bid to join the eu .
instead , he has proposed a mediterranean union between turkey and its neighbors .
" i do n't see how you can be a candidate with one opinion and a president with another , " he said during a press conference in brussels this week .
" i do n't think that turkey has a place in the union . " france has said it would consider vetoing turkey 's entry into the eu .
turkey began negotiations in 2005 .
turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan reportedly phoned sarkozy on thursday , in an apparent conciliatory gesture , according to reuters .
in his first call to sarkozy since his election , sources in erdogan 's office quoted the prime minister as congratulating the french president on his victory in the polls and told him that the two needed to work directly with each other , according to reuters .
" we must not communicate via media statements , " erdogan was quoted as telling sarkozy .
" -lrb- we must -rrb- work together with direct talks . "
sarkozy reportedly offered his condolences for a bomb attack in ankara on tuesday and said he wanted to work together to overcome their common problems , according to reuters .
erdogan also noted france and turkey cooperate on economic , political and military issues and that turkey is already a nato member . too soon to say if turkey belongs in eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : talks continue about turkey 's place in the eu eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn said the european commission plans to continue accession negotiations with turkey and said it was too soon to judge whether turkey belonged in the 27-member bloc .
" we have a sound negotiating mandate with turkey and the commission 's view is that we will continue the accession negotiations with turkey because it is in the interests of both the european union and turkey , " he said at a news briefing .
" if we succeed , if turkey succeeds , turkey can become an even more important bridge of civilizations than it is today , " rehn said .
" and the time to judge whether turkey has been able to meet the conditions of eu accession is in the latter stages of the accession process . "
turkey has general elections scheduled for july 22 to decide a political conflict between the islamic-leaning government and the military-backed secular establishment .
military needs to show restraint bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish special forces fire tear gas at kurdish demonstrators the recent bombings further complicate turkey 's domestic and foreign politics .
the pkk is thought to have launched the attacks from hideouts in northern iraq .
turkish army chief yasar buyukanit last month called for a military operation into iraq to quash pkk guerrillas . the united states and iraqi kurdish leaders oppose the idea .
a kurdish iraqi official recently warned that talk of such a move would signal a " dangerous escalation " of the situation .
the us has also urged turkey to show restraint , fearing a cross-border operation could disrupt efforts to stabilize war-torn iraq .
attacks blamed on rebels continued friday when a bomb derailed seven cars of a freight train in southeast turkey .
no injuries were reported .
police arrested 26 people , most of them university students belonging to the separatist kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , media reported on friday .
eight of the arrested are women who were preparing attacks , local authorities were quoted by the anatolia news agency as saying .
the pkk has fought for an ethnic homeland since 1984 , and ankara blames it for 30,000 deaths . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey set for fresh membership talks with eu eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn played down concerns that nicolas sarkozy , french president-elect , would stop turkey 's membership bid , adding that new talks with ankara could begin within weeks .

if the sport is to change and become clean then the three-martini business lunch has to go , according to dw sports editor wolfgang von kann . this week , germany 's tabloid bild zeitung asked , " mr. ullrich , you really did n't know about this ? " but the affair has long gone beyond jan ullrich or any of the other big names .
sure , if yet another cyclist from ullrich & co. were to come out of the doping closet , it would help illuminate the situation further - but it would be essentially meaningless . that 's because today , much more is on the line than the careers of a few cyclists .
anyone who has been following recent developments in athletics , swimming , triathlon or cross-country skiing - to say nothing of weightlifting - will hardly claim that the morass of doping scandals is confined to the cycling arena . we are now talking about competitive sports in general .
this is about breaking up structures with unmistakably mafiaesque semblances .
ultimately , the reputation of all competitive sports is on the line . our unsung heroes but even that is a generalization that scratches at the surface but skirts the core of the issue .
indeed , the central question has yet to be asked : to what extent are we - consumers , viewers , fans and also the media - to blame for all of this ?
what kind of society are we living in , anyway ? it is time to examine the demands we place on our athletes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de third reich -pipe- 25.05.2007 exhibit examines divergent fates of german-jewish exiles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new york was the dream destination of many german-jewish emigres .
a new museum exhibit on german jews who fled their homeland between 1933 and 1941 examines the life-changing - and ultimately life-saving - experiences of those who managed to escape the nazi threat . the multimedia exhibit " homeland and exile : emigration of german jews after 1933 " represents the most comprehensive look ever taken at jews who fled germany for over a hundred countries around the world .
the exhibit touches on the larger political issues of the era , but mostly it focuses on the people who were forced to turn their back on their " heimat " - a german word that encompasses both the concept of homeland and the feeling of emotional attachment to it - and their individual and collective journeys to a new life .
why did they go , where did they find refuge , and under what conditions ?
how did they build new lives for themselves , and how did they feel about their " home countries " both new and old ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young emigrants aboard the ship " martha washington , " en route to palestine the exhibit tackles these questions with commentated displays that briefly describe the widespread anti-semitism and curtailment of civil liberties that led some 280,000 of the 500,000 jews living in germany to emigrate , starting in 1933 .
-lrb- one artefact from that time on display : a children 's board game called jews out ! that involved driving out jew-shaped playing pieces from a town full of shops with names like " salomon 's money lenders . " -rrb-
from there , the story turns to the ways and means of leaving , with the show dividing thematically into rooms devoted to the stories of those who shipped off for destinations across europe , the americas , africa and asia .
on on a 3-d interactive map , museum-goers can pinpoint the 100 countries that eventually allowed jewish refugees entry .
farming in the dominican republic the curators make clear that some destinations were seen as more desirable than others .
the most sought after visa , limited in number and only available to those with an affidavit of support , was for the us .
less preferred was shanghai , which nonetheless became the last chance for escape for some 18,000 to 20,000 jews , thanks to its policy of allowing entry without a visa up to 1941 .
one of the odder histories in this section involves a plan hatched by the then-dictator of the dominican republic , rafael trujillo , to imported jewish " agricultural experts " in an effort to " whiten " his population , and give the country a needed injection of economic energy .
most of the artefacts on display are from the permanent collections of the jewish museum in berlin , where the show ran from sept . , 2006 to april , 2007 , and from other historical collections , explained cilly kugelmann , progam director of the berlin jewish museum .
" there are people who kept everything , every paper , every letter .
that generation is dying out , and they know their children wo n't take care of their things , so they donate it to historical collections , " she explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil liberties for jews were curtailed under the nazis kugelmann said her own favorite artefact is a coin purse kept by a man whose arduous journey out of germany involved going through numerous countries ; he eventually settled in portugal , but kept change in the purse from each stop along the way .
reconstructing lives from ephemera ephemera from the era -lrb- photographs , poems , diaries , ticket stubs , letters -rrb- is interspersed with objects. suitcases , clothing , coffee pots , dolls ; anything either left behind , taken along , or taken up as part of a new life in a new land .
possibly most compelling are the interactive kiosks that allow viewers to hear the emigres ' personal stories .
videotaped interviews are broken down into short , accessible segments under different categories , and english subtitles are available .
overall , kugelmann said , the exhibit tells a story of a people who did a " remarkably successful " job of adjusting to a difficult situation - even if some of the people faced depression , unhappiness , and even committed suicide .
their success as immigrants was one of the main reasons to create the exhibit , explained kugelmann .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a child 's view of its new world " many of the people who left embarked on their new lives with a certain distinctive , ironic pragmatism , " she said .
" we wondered , ' why were they relatively so successful ?
their children went on to be successful .
how did they do it ? "
a more positive view of the nazi era ?
kugelmann also implied that , more than half a century after the fact , it may be time for germany to start looking at the story of the holocaust from a new angle .
" over the past 60 years , german society has developed a relationship to the nazi period in which the mass murder has become the sole paradigm , " she said .
" the survival of almost two-thirds of german jews was simply ignored . "
and jürgen reiche , exhibitions director at the museum of contemporary history , also said he hoped the exhibit will incite young people to take a new look at germany , past and present .
" we sometimes forget that german-jewish history is also german history , " he said .
' they were robbed of a homeland " but hebrew university historian moshe zimmermann , who consulted on the exhibit , warned of the tendency to concentrate on the well-known successes among the refugees from the nazis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the exhibition focuses on the exiled children " the idea is often that the emigration didn ’ t destroy many lives .
people think of thomas mann , billy wilder , henry kissinger .
and they say , ' they left germany , it was n't so tragic , " he said .
" people say , ' they could find a home elsewhere because jews are like that . ' … but if you start thinking that way , you 're starting with the wrong idea . "
as the word " heimat " in the title of the exhibit makes clear , " the émigrés were , despite everything , german , " zimmermann said .
" they were germans who were jews .
and they were robbed of their homeland . "
" there is no plural for the word heimat .
you ca n't have more than one , " zimmermann said . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin exhibition honors little-known nazi opponent a new exhibition at a berlin museum - a former brush factory run by a german entrepreneur during the nazi era - throws light on a network of people who tried to save jews from deportation to hitler 's death camps .

a new museum exhibit on german jews who fled their homeland between 1933 and 1941 examines the life-changing - and ultimately life-saving - experiences of those who managed to escape the nazi threat . the multimedia exhibit " homeland and exile : emigration of german jews after 1933 " represents the most comprehensive look ever taken at jews who fled germany for over a hundred countries around the world .
the exhibit touches on the larger political issues of the era , but mostly it focuses on the people who were forced to turn their back on their " heimat " - a german word that encompasses both the concept of homeland and the feeling of emotional attachment to it - and their individual and collective journeys to a new life .
why did they go , where did they find refuge , and under what conditions ?
how did they build new lives for themselves , and how did they feel about their " home countries " both new and old ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young emigrants aboard the ship " martha washington , " en route to palestine the exhibit tackles these questions with commentated displays that briefly describe the widespread anti-semitism and curtailment of civil liberties that led some 280,000 of the 500,000 jews living in germany to emigrate , starting in 1933 .
-lrb- one artefact from that time on display : a children 's board game called jews out ! that involved driving out jew-shaped playing pieces from a town full of shops with names like " salomon 's money lenders . " -rrb-
from there , the story turns to the ways and means of leaving , with the show dividing thematically into rooms devoted to the stories of those who shipped off for destinations across europe , the americas , africa and asia .
on on a 3-d interactive map , museum-goers can pinpoint the 100 countries that eventually allowed jewish refugees entry .
farming in the dominican republic the curators make clear that some destinations were seen as more desirable than others .
the most sought after visa , limited in number and only available to those with an affidavit of support , was for the us .
less preferred was shanghai , which nonetheless became the last chance for escape for some 18,000 to 20,000 jews , thanks to its policy of allowing entry without a visa up to 1941 .
one of the odder histories in this section involves a plan hatched by the then-dictator of the dominican republic , rafael trujillo , to imported jewish " agricultural experts " in an effort to " whiten " his population , and give the country a needed injection of economic energy .
most of the artefacts on display are from the permanent collections of the jewish museum in berlin , where the show ran from sept . , 2006 to april , 2007 , and from other historical collections , explained cilly kugelmann , progam director of the berlin jewish museum .
" there are people who kept everything , every paper , every letter .
that generation is dying out , and they know their children wo n't take care of their things , so they donate it to historical collections , " she explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil liberties for jews were curtailed under the nazis kugelmann said her own favorite artefact is a coin purse kept by a man whose arduous journey out of germany involved going through numerous countries ; he eventually settled in portugal , but kept change in the purse from each stop along the way .
reconstructing lives from ephemera ephemera from the era -lrb- photographs , poems , diaries , ticket stubs , letters -rrb- is interspersed with objects. suitcases , clothing , coffee pots , dolls ; anything either left behind , taken along , or taken up as part of a new life in a new land .
possibly most compelling are the interactive kiosks that allow viewers to hear the emigres ' personal stories .
videotaped interviews are broken down into short , accessible segments under different categories , and english subtitles are available .
overall , kugelmann said , the exhibit tells a story of a people who did a " remarkably successful " job of adjusting to a difficult situation - even if some of the people faced depression , unhappiness , and even committed suicide .
their success as immigrants was one of the main reasons to create the exhibit , explained kugelmann .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a child 's view of its new world " many of the people who left embarked on their new lives with a certain distinctive , ironic pragmatism , " she said .
" we wondered , ' why were they relatively so successful ?
their children went on to be successful .
how did they do it ? "
a more positive view of the nazi era ?
kugelmann also implied that , more than half a century after the fact , it may be time for germany to start looking at the story of the holocaust from a new angle .
" over the past 60 years , german society has developed a relationship to the nazi period in which the mass murder has become the sole paradigm , " she said .
" the survival of almost two-thirds of german jews was simply ignored . "
and jürgen reiche , exhibitions director at the museum of contemporary history , also said he hoped the exhibit will incite young people to take a new look at germany , past and present .
" we sometimes forget that german-jewish history is also german history , " he said .
' they were robbed of a homeland " but hebrew university historian moshe zimmermann , who consulted on the exhibit , warned of the tendency to concentrate on the well-known successes among the refugees from the nazis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the exhibition focuses on the exiled children " the idea is often that the emigration didn ’ t destroy many lives .
people think of thomas mann , billy wilder , henry kissinger .
and they say , ' they left germany , it was n't so tragic , " he said .
" people say , ' they could find a home elsewhere because jews are like that . ' … but if you start thinking that way , you 're starting with the wrong idea . "
as the word " heimat " in the title of the exhibit makes clear , " the émigrés were , despite everything , german , " zimmermann said .
" they were germans who were jews .
and they were robbed of their homeland . "
" there is no plural for the word heimat .

a german diplomat warned the move could harm the ukraine 's relationship with europe . ukraine 's political crisis escalated on friday as president viktor yushchenko attempted to take control of thousands of interior ministry troops away from his rival prime minister viktor yanukovych . the menacing new twist in a long-running power struggle between the two leaders drew expressions of concern from europe , russia and the united states , which warned against the use of violence . yushchenko ordered that authority over interior ministry forces be removed from the government headed by the premier and transferred to the president , in a decree published on his official website .
the president already controls the army under ukraine 's constitution . the decree covers interior ministry troops with military training often used for anti-riot operations and does not include the police force or the ministry 's elite berkut unit . yanukovych angrily rejected the president 's order as an anti-constitutional " interference in the activities of the executive branch , " while speaking to western diplomats in a televised meeting . parliamentary speaker and yanukovych ally oleksandr moroz went further during the same meeting with foreign diplomats , describing the president 's move as a " coup attempt .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de third reich -pipe- 25.05.2007 exhibit examines divergent fates of german-jewish exiles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new york was the dream destination of many german-jewish emigres .
a new museum exhibit on german jews who fled their homeland between 1933 and 1941 examines the life-changing - and ultimately life-saving - experiences of those who managed to escape the nazi threat . the multimedia exhibit " homeland and exile : emigration of german jews after 1933 " represents the most comprehensive look ever taken at jews who fled germany for over a hundred countries around the world .
the exhibit touches on the larger political issues of the era , but mostly it focuses on the people who were forced to turn their back on their " heimat " - a german word that encompasses both the concept of homeland and the feeling of emotional attachment to it - and their individual and collective journeys to a new life .
why did they go , where did they find refuge , and under what conditions ?
how did they build new lives for themselves , and how did they feel about their " home countries " both new and old ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young emigrants aboard the ship " martha washington , " en route to palestine the exhibit tackles these questions with commentated displays that briefly describe the widespread anti-semitism and curtailment of civil liberties that led some 280,000 of the 500,000 jews living in germany to emigrate , starting in 1933 .
-lrb- one artefact from that time on display : a children 's board game called jews out ! that involved driving out jew-shaped playing pieces from a town full of shops with names like " salomon 's money lenders . " -rrb-
from there , the story turns to the ways and means of leaving , with the show dividing thematically into rooms devoted to the stories of those who shipped off for destinations across europe , the americas , africa and asia .
on on a 3-d interactive map , museum-goers can pinpoint the 100 countries that eventually allowed jewish refugees entry .
farming in the dominican republic the curators make clear that some destinations were seen as more desirable than others .
the most sought after visa , limited in number and only available to those with an affidavit of support , was for the us .
less preferred was shanghai , which nonetheless became the last chance for escape for some 18,000 to 20,000 jews , thanks to its policy of allowing entry without a visa up to 1941 .
one of the odder histories in this section involves a plan hatched by the then-dictator of the dominican republic , rafael trujillo , to imported jewish " agricultural experts " in an effort to " whiten " his population , and give the country a needed injection of economic energy .
most of the artefacts on display are from the permanent collections of the jewish museum in berlin , where the show ran from sept . , 2006 to april , 2007 , and from other historical collections , explained cilly kugelmann , progam director of the berlin jewish museum .
" there are people who kept everything , every paper , every letter .
that generation is dying out , and they know their children wo n't take care of their things , so they donate it to historical collections , " she explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil liberties for jews were curtailed under the nazis kugelmann said her own favorite artefact is a coin purse kept by a man whose arduous journey out of germany involved going through numerous countries ; he eventually settled in portugal , but kept change in the purse from each stop along the way .
reconstructing lives from ephemera ephemera from the era -lrb- photographs , poems , diaries , ticket stubs , letters -rrb- is interspersed with objects. suitcases , clothing , coffee pots , dolls ; anything either left behind , taken along , or taken up as part of a new life in a new land .
possibly most compelling are the interactive kiosks that allow viewers to hear the emigres ' personal stories .
videotaped interviews are broken down into short , accessible segments under different categories , and english subtitles are available .
overall , kugelmann said , the exhibit tells a story of a people who did a " remarkably successful " job of adjusting to a difficult situation - even if some of the people faced depression , unhappiness , and even committed suicide .
their success as immigrants was one of the main reasons to create the exhibit , explained kugelmann .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a child 's view of its new world " many of the people who left embarked on their new lives with a certain distinctive , ironic pragmatism , " she said .
" we wondered , ' why were they relatively so successful ?
their children went on to be successful .
how did they do it ? "
a more positive view of the nazi era ?
kugelmann also implied that , more than half a century after the fact , it may be time for germany to start looking at the story of the holocaust from a new angle .
" over the past 60 years , german society has developed a relationship to the nazi period in which the mass murder has become the sole paradigm , " she said .
" the survival of almost two-thirds of german jews was simply ignored . "
and jürgen reiche , exhibitions director at the museum of contemporary history , also said he hoped the exhibit will incite young people to take a new look at germany , past and present .
" we sometimes forget that german-jewish history is also german history , " he said .
' they were robbed of a homeland " but hebrew university historian moshe zimmermann , who consulted on the exhibit , warned of the tendency to concentrate on the well-known successes among the refugees from the nazis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the exhibition focuses on the exiled children " the idea is often that the emigration didn ’ t destroy many lives .
people think of thomas mann , billy wilder , henry kissinger .
and they say , ' they left germany , it was n't so tragic , " he said .
" people say , ' they could find a home elsewhere because jews are like that . ' … but if you start thinking that way , you 're starting with the wrong idea . "
as the word " heimat " in the title of the exhibit makes clear , " the émigrés were , despite everything , german , " zimmermann said .
" they were germans who were jews .
and they were robbed of their homeland . "
" there is no plural for the word heimat .
you ca n't have more than one , " zimmermann said . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin exhibition honors little-known nazi opponent a new exhibition at a berlin museum - a former brush factory run by a german entrepreneur during the nazi era - throws light on a network of people who tried to save jews from deportation to hitler 's death camps .

if the sport is to change and become clean then the three-martini business lunch has to go , according to dw sports editor wolfgang von kann . this week , germany 's tabloid bild zeitung asked , " mr. ullrich , you really did n't know about this ? " but the affair has long gone beyond jan ullrich or any of the other big names .
sure , if yet another cyclist from ullrich & co. were to come out of the doping closet , it would help illuminate the situation further - but it would be essentially meaningless . that 's because today , much more is on the line than the careers of a few cyclists .
anyone who has been following recent developments in athletics , swimming , triathlon or cross-country skiing - to say nothing of weightlifting - will hardly claim that the morass of doping scandals is confined to the cycling arena . we are now talking about competitive sports in general .
this is about breaking up structures with unmistakably mafiaesque semblances .
ultimately , the reputation of all competitive sports is on the line . our unsung heroes but even that is a generalization that scratches at the surface but skirts the core of the issue .
indeed , the central question has yet to be asked : to what extent are we - consumers , viewers , fans and also the media - to blame for all of this ?
what kind of society are we living in , anyway ? it is time to examine the demands we place on our athletes .
barely 20 years old , they are expected to act as role models - a part only few come by voluntarily .
in their twenties , they are supposed to be the shining heroes who make no mistakes and scoop up all the medals at the olympic games .
and over 30 , they are meant to do everything they can to prove that age does n't matter . craving new records where do the fans of cycling races stand ?
at the top of the hill , where the riders hurt the most .
what do people want to see at track-and-field events ?
they are waiting for the world record .
and what do they want at weightlifting competitions ?
they want to see more weight loaded on the bar . the limits of athletic achievement are constantly being pushed .
at the same time , the athlete is expected to be a clean-cut do-gooder , ready to cast aside all signs of exertion and bedazzle the cameras with an eloquent post-match interview . of course , the athlete will achieve all of this on bread and water alone . how one person is supposed to be all that , nobody wants to know . people who live in glass houses ... this rigmarole is not without hypocrisy .
for what is it that we non-athletes do ?
we send our kids to school with sedatives .
we indulge in a little booze during lunch time , or even before we arrive at the office .
we can barely survive without nicotine and alcohol .
and we drink liter after liter of coffee , so that we can do it all . we are a drug nation : at the first sign of a mild cold , we immediately pour a bottle of cough medicine - which , by the way , is prohibited for athletes - down our throats , or just stay in bed griping . ultimately , competitive sports are a mirror image of our society , and is therefore no better or worse than us .
if the sport is to change and become clean , then society has to change .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundeswehr -pipe- 25.05.2007 germans divided on how to honor fallen soldiers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debate has centered on where a memorial for soldiers should be located less than a week after three german soldiers were killed in afghanistan , debate is heating up over a monument to honor the country 's post-world war ii armed forces members who died while on duty at home and abroad . since the establishment of the german army in the 1950s , more than 2,600 soldiers have died in accidents , maneuvers or peacekeeping missions at home and abroad .
on may 19 , the tally rose further after a suicide bomb killed three soldiers in kunduz , afghanistan .
the deaths of the soldiers , which brought the german fatality toll since the bundeswehr deployed to afghanistan in 2002 to a total of 21 , has not only generated hefty debate in parliament over the security of the troops in afghanistan , but on how to memorialize those who die while serving their country .
while there are little reservations about building a memorial to honor soldiers killed on duty in the country 's post-war armed forces , discussion has centered on the planned location for such a monument . bildunterschrift : a memorial service was held for the fallen soldiers on wednesday german defense minister franz josef jung , who has long harbored plans to honor the fallen soldiers , said the memorial would be erected within the ministry 's premises in berlin .
thomas raabe , spokesman for the defense ministry , said on thursday that the memorial would be located within the bendlerblock compound , the seat of germany 's defense ministry in berlin .
" there will be no changes to that , " he added .
a public memorial ?
but not everyone agrees with locating the memorial within a high-security tract not easily accessible to the general public .
the representative for the armed forces in the german parliament , reinhold robbe , said the majority of soldiers would prefer to see the monument built on a prominent site in berlin .
speaking on the television station rtl , robbe said the monument and its location needed to make clear to all who see it that the bundeswehr is a " parliament 's army . "
the recent fatalities in afghanistan have shown " just how dangerous the job of a soldier is , " and that the soldiers serve " in the name of germany , " robbe added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 3,000 german troops are stationed in afghanistan the head of the cross-party parliamentary committee for cultural affairs , hans-joachim otto , told deutsche welle it was " highly unfortunate that the defense ministry treats the matter of the memorial as its private business . "
" the bundeswehr is a conscription-based army and hence an army of the people .
bundeswehr missions are decided upon in parliament and not in the defense ministry , " he said , adding that as such a more public location would be more in keeping with the nature of germany 's armed forces .
more than a wreath depository peter steinbach , the head of berlin 's german resistance memorial site , also argued against placing the monument behind a closed-off gate at the defense ministry .
such a memorial belongs within view of the public , he said on german public radio .
otherwise , it risks becoming simply a " depository for wreaths . "
with a view to similar memorials in other countries , steinbach said , " no one would ever have suggested that the vietnam memorial in the united sites be built within the pentagon 's courtyard . "
chancellor angela merkel , who in february had suggested a more public location closer to the reichstag as a reminder to the role of parliament in deploying the armed forces , endorsed the ministry 's proposal for erecting the memorial within the bendlerblock compound .
her spokesman ulrich wilhelm said thursday she sees eye-to-eye with the defense minister and that details will be presented within due time .
despite the ongoing debate , jung is expected to lay the cornerstone for the memorial later this year . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " german military can be strong complement in afghanistan " additional questions about germany 's role in afghanistan arose when three of its soldiers lost their lives in a suicide bombing .

finance minister peer steinbrück said the move will improve germany 's standing on the global market . the german parliament on friday paved the way for the country ’ s biggest corporate tax reform in post-world war ii history , which would put its rates on par with the rest of europe .
as of jan .
1 , 2008 , corporate tax will be lowered to 30 percent from the current rate of 39 percent - the highest in the european union .
" this corporate tax reform will make germany a more attractive place for investment , " said steinbrück .
he added in an interview broadcast on public radio friday that all citizens would benefit from the reform because tax revenues would actually increase , at least in the mid-term , though critics have warned of an initial loss of around 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.7 billion -rrb- . the bill , which is expected to be approved by germany 's upper parliamentary house before the summer recess , would also prevent companies from getting tax benefits in germany by taking loans via subsidiaries abroad .
a " blessing of billions " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister steinbrueck said the reform will make germany attractive to investors criticism of the reform has come mainly from the leftist fraction , the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the greens .
chairman of the left party 's parliamentary group , oskar lafontaine , called the corporate tax bill a " blessing of billions for big business , " adding that it would be better to adjust income tax rates for small companies .
jan paul bach , the owner of a 15-employee company near berlin that produces high-tech ceramic elements , said the changes were necessary for germany to keep up in the global marketplace .
" i think the tax reform is necessary to compete with new economies like china or india , which have lower ages and a better position in the global economy , " bach told deutsche welle .
he added , however that he did n't think it was fair that " big companies pay lower taxes while the employees have to pay higher taxes . " to make up for the cuts , germany is abolishing tax holidays , which have mainly benefited multinationals .
an inheritance tax reform is also in the works , on the initiative of the social democratic party , which is part of a series of tax adjustments meant to offset the corporate tax reform . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german family-owned businesses often upstage the big guys a new study has shown that family-owned businesses in germany from 2003 to 2005 performed better than dax firms in both job creation and sales growth .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundeswehr -pipe- 25.05.2007 germans divided on how to honor fallen soldiers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debate has centered on where a memorial for soldiers should be located less than a week after three german soldiers were killed in afghanistan , debate is heating up over a monument to honor the country 's post-world war ii armed forces members who died while on duty at home and abroad . since the establishment of the german army in the 1950s , more than 2,600 soldiers have died in accidents , maneuvers or peacekeeping missions at home and abroad .
on may 19 , the tally rose further after a suicide bomb killed three soldiers in kunduz , afghanistan .
the deaths of the soldiers , which brought the german fatality toll since the bundeswehr deployed to afghanistan in 2002 to a total of 21 , has not only generated hefty debate in parliament over the security of the troops in afghanistan , but on how to memorialize those who die while serving their country .
while there are little reservations about building a memorial to honor soldiers killed on duty in the country 's post-war armed forces , discussion has centered on the planned location for such a monument . bildunterschrift : a memorial service was held for the fallen soldiers on wednesday german defense minister franz josef jung , who has long harbored plans to honor the fallen soldiers , said the memorial would be erected within the ministry 's premises in berlin .
thomas raabe , spokesman for the defense ministry , said on thursday that the memorial would be located within the bendlerblock compound , the seat of germany 's defense ministry in berlin .
" there will be no changes to that , " he added .
a public memorial ?
but not everyone agrees with locating the memorial within a high-security tract not easily accessible to the general public .
the representative for the armed forces in the german parliament , reinhold robbe , said the majority of soldiers would prefer to see the monument built on a prominent site in berlin .
speaking on the television station rtl , robbe said the monument and its location needed to make clear to all who see it that the bundeswehr is a " parliament 's army . "
the recent fatalities in afghanistan have shown " just how dangerous the job of a soldier is , " and that the soldiers serve " in the name of germany , " robbe added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 3,000 german troops are stationed in afghanistan the head of the cross-party parliamentary committee for cultural affairs , hans-joachim otto , told deutsche welle it was " highly unfortunate that the defense ministry treats the matter of the memorial as its private business . "
" the bundeswehr is a conscription-based army and hence an army of the people .
bundeswehr missions are decided upon in parliament and not in the defense ministry , " he said , adding that as such a more public location would be more in keeping with the nature of germany 's armed forces .
more than a wreath depository peter steinbach , the head of berlin 's german resistance memorial site , also argued against placing the monument behind a closed-off gate at the defense ministry .
such a memorial belongs within view of the public , he said on german public radio .
otherwise , it risks becoming simply a " depository for wreaths . "
with a view to similar memorials in other countries , steinbach said , " no one would ever have suggested that the vietnam memorial in the united sites be built within the pentagon 's courtyard . "
chancellor angela merkel , who in february had suggested a more public location closer to the reichstag as a reminder to the role of parliament in deploying the armed forces , endorsed the ministry 's proposal for erecting the memorial within the bendlerblock compound .
her spokesman ulrich wilhelm said thursday she sees eye-to-eye with the defense minister and that details will be presented within due time .

however , the nealon and carvey versions were from austria which would render further investigation of this silly lead redundant .

he did n't forcefully condemn china 's human rights record , saying he would leave specific criticisms to the german government . köhler was almost euphoric as he recounted his " very good talks " with china 's leadership in beijing .
köhler managed to circumvent the minefield in which the issue of human rights had threatened to overshadow his visit , so that at the end , he was back in his element - advocating expanded cooperation with the world 's most populous country in the field of environmental and resource protection .
and , he reported , in this aspect he had found " open doors " in beijing .
köhler showed how impressed he was with china 's new generation of leaders : " they are aware of the problems and challenges of this society and its giant population number of 1.3 billion such as i have experienced from no other leadership , " said the man who had often visited china in the past in other functions .
" they are facing the problems and want to solve them , " he added .

köhler said that responsibility for talking about specifics rests with the german government .
" it was right for me to present the principles , but detailed human rights issues and cases are something that the german government has to talk about -lrb- with china -rrb- , " he said .
köhler was following a precedent set by former chancellors helmut kohl and gerhard schröder , an editorial in the friday edition of the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
he spoke in abstractions and " philosophized about human rights , but lacked the words to talk about the chinese problems . "
" it was important for me to bring forward the fundamentals , " köhler said .
the tensions in the run up to his meeting amog other things because of the resolution of the german parliament that criticized the " re-education through labor camps " in china , were not further talked about .
the resolution was rejected as " intervention " by beijing .

state and party leader hu jintao was eager to tap into köhler 's experience in dealing with issues facing china , such as adequate employment for hundreds of millions of rural residents , or how to overcome the gap between the poor western regions and the wealthier coastal population .
they had talked at length , köhler said , about the rapid ageing of china 's population and the effects of this on the pensions and insurance sectors .
china 's leaders were " almost desperate " in asking how such problems might be resolved , he said .
" it was noticeable how he -lrb- hu -rrb- wanted to discuss with me in depth those problems he is itching to deal with , " köhler said .
climate change a central theme bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has serious problems with pollution china pushed for the german government to provide more investement and technology to help develop a key bilateral relationship between the two nations , köhler told reporters after meeting chinese premier wen jiabao in beijing on friday .
china also hopes to see " more action " from germany in areas such as regular bilateral dialogues , and technology transfer related to environmental protection and energy efficiency , köhler said .
koehler said he was impressed with the openness of chinese leaders on environmental protection and their apparent willingness to take more action on climate change .
" it 's the first time that the chinese understand it -lrb- climate change -rrb- as an important issue in itself , " koehler said at the conclusion of his talks in the zhongnanhai compound used by leaders of china 's ruling communist party .
china seemed committed to achieving its targets for reducing carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency , but it lacked capacity and expertise , he said .
köhler said he was optimistic that china would play a " constructive role " in global efforts against climate change .
" china is aware that it is part of the problem , " he said .
" they want to be part of the solution . "

he did n't forcefully condemn china 's human rights record , saying he would leave specific criticisms to the german government . köhler was almost euphoric as he recounted his " very good talks " with china 's leadership in beijing .
köhler managed to circumvent the minefield in which the issue of human rights had threatened to overshadow his visit , so that at the end , he was back in his element - advocating expanded cooperation with the world 's most populous country in the field of environmental and resource protection .
and , he reported , in this aspect he had found " open doors " in beijing .
köhler showed how impressed he was with china 's new generation of leaders : " they are aware of the problems and challenges of this society and its giant population number of 1.3 billion such as i have experienced from no other leadership , " said the man who had often visited china in the past in other functions .
" they are facing the problems and want to solve them , " he added .

he spoke in abstractions and " philosophized about human rights , but lacked the words to talk about the chinese problems . "
" it was important for me to bring forward the fundamentals , " köhler said .
the tensions in the run up to his meeting amog other things because of the resolution of the german parliament that criticized the " re-education through labor camps " in china , were not further talked about .
the resolution was rejected as " intervention " by beijing .

they had talked at length , köhler said , about the rapid ageing of china 's population and the effects of this on the pensions and insurance sectors .

france 's sarkozy thinks not on a diplomatic tour of europe , french president nicolas sarkozy expressed his opposition to turkey 's eu membership bid .
the newly elected french leader also championed the idea of a " simplified treaty " for the eu . nicolas sarkozy has n't been in office for three weeks , but his policy offensive to reclaim france 's leadership in the european union is in full swing . on a diplomatic tour of european countries , sarkozy championed the idea of a " simplified treaty " to replace the failed eu constitution .
european commission chief jose manuel barroso said the idea was gaining support . " -lrb- sarkozy -rrb- was the first to suggest the idea of a simplified treaty , and today we see that there is a consensus forming around this idea , " barroso told reporters at a joint press conference with sarkozy . the french president also took the opportunity of his first visit to brussels since taking power on may 6 to reaffirm his opposition to turkey 's bid to join the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and barroso have differing views on turkey " i do n't see how you can be a candidate with one opinion and a president with another , " sarkozy said .
" i do n't think that turkey has a place in the union , " he concluded , but added that he did not want to dwell on the issue at present . " the question does n't arise at present and we already have enough on our plate , " sarkozy explained . barroso stressed that his european commission was " in favor of negotiations with turkey , " but concurred with sarkozy that " right now , our absolute priority is the treaty , the resolution of the institutional crisis . " constitution , mini-treaty , simplified treaty on the eu 's institutional gridlock , the french president said a european summit next month would be a success " if the 27 -lrb- eu member states -rrb- are in agreement for a simplified treaty . " in france , such a treaty could be submitted for approval by the parliament in order to avoid a repeat of the 2005 popular referenda that cut down the now moribund eu constitution . after french voters rejected the original constitution , france found itself playing an increasingly marginal role in the club of architects of the new europe .
sarkozy 's government now wants to reclaim france 's leadership in the eu , a campaign promise that had been trumpeted by both sarkozy and runner-up ségolène royal . last year , sarkozy had used the term " mini-treaty " to describe what he felt would be an acceptable constitutional framework for the eu .
the french leader said he recognized now that " mini-treaty " lacks ambition . eighteen member states have ratified the original constitution , which was deemed necessary to bring eu institutions up to date in the expanded bloc .
but any new treaty will have to revisit some controversial topics , such as references to " shared values , " which were understood by some observers as a coded exclusion of turkey from the eu club . " we must work together " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan called sarkozy to propose a get-together turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan phoned sarkozy on thursday , according to reuters .
the news agency cited " sources in erdogan 's office " who said erdogan congratulated the french leader on his victory at the polls and suggested the two should work together directly . " we must not communicate via media statements , " erdogan 's aides told reuters .
" -lrb- we must -rrb- work together with direct talks . " for his part , sarkozy offered his condolences for a bomb attack in ankara on tuesday , which killed six people and wounded dozens more in the worst bombing in the turkish capital in at least a decade . sarkozy said he wanted to work together with erdogan to overcome their common problems , the sources told reuters .
the heads of state went on to discuss cooperation between france and turkey , a nato member , on a broad range of economic , political and military issues . but on the campaign trail , sarkozy made it clear that he was staunchly opposed to turkey 's accession to the eu .
he has instead proposed a mediterranean union for turkey and its neighbors .

" because no child should be victimized in this horrific way , today we pledge to re-double our efforts to enforce the international fight against child pornography , " the ministers said in a joint declaration . internet poses challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet service providers seen as partners in stopping child pornography german justice minister brigitte zypries said countries had been slow to adapt to the challenges produced by the rapid development of the internet which had facilitated the distribution of child pornography .
" we have all adopted specific legislation to fight this phenomenon , but we still have to make progress in transferring international agreements in this area into our domestic laws , " zypries said .
the ministers also discussed the necessity of getting help from internet providers since the internet makes it easy for pedophiles to share child pornography .
" we need to put in place rules in every country to ensure that internet providers inform the authorities if they find images of pedophilia , " said french justice minister rachida dati .
the g8 ministers also want to encourage information technology professionals , banks , the media , parents and educators to " consider what role they could play in the fight , " according to a statement .
germany recently uncovered a child pornography ring by using credit card information . exploitation crosses borders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fight against child pornography needs to be as high tech as the perpetrators zypries used the recent case of a 4-year-old british girl who disappeared earlier this month in portugal , as an example of the need for international cooperation .
" we simply have to assume that this was done by a gang that passes on these children to be exploited , and russia as well mentioned the danger ... that such children may be abducted for adoption later on , " she said to reporters .
the g8 works with interpol to combat child pornography and helped establish the international child sexual exploitation image database , which helps police identify and rescue victims of such abuse .
the head of interpol briefed the ministers on its activities .
interpol secretary-general ronald k. noble said in an interview with reuters that the database now contains more than half a million images of children being sexually exploited and has helped secure the rescue of over 500 children worldwide .
noble showed reuters a number of database photos , which showed caucasian adult males engaged in sex acts with asian boys , activities that would be clearly illegal .
this reflects the majority of cases in which us or european males travel to countries like thailand or cambodia where they sexually exploit children , noble said in the reuters interview .

on may 19 , the tally rose further after a suicide bomb killed three soldiers in kunduz , afghanistan .
the deaths of the soldiers , which brought the german fatality toll since the bundeswehr deployed to afghanistan in 2002 to a total of 21 , has not only generated hefty debate in parliament over the security of the troops in afghanistan , but on how to memorialize those who die while serving their country .
while there are little reservations about building a memorial to honor soldiers killed on duty in the country 's post-war armed forces , discussion has centered on the planned location for such a monument . bildunterschrift : a memorial service was held for the fallen soldiers on wednesday german defense minister franz josef jung , who has long harbored plans to honor the fallen soldiers , said the memorial would be erected within the ministry 's premises in berlin .
thomas raabe , spokesman for the defense ministry , said on thursday that the memorial would be located within the bendlerblock compound , the seat of germany 's defense ministry in berlin .
" there will be no changes to that , " he added .
a public memorial ?
but not everyone agrees with locating the memorial within a high-security tract not easily accessible to the general public .
the representative for the armed forces in the german parliament , reinhold robbe , said the majority of soldiers would prefer to see the monument built on a prominent site in berlin .
speaking on the television station rtl , robbe said the monument and its location needed to make clear to all who see it that the bundeswehr is a " parliament 's army . "
the recent fatalities in afghanistan have shown " just how dangerous the job of a soldier is , " and that the soldiers serve " in the name of germany , " robbe added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 3,000 german troops are stationed in afghanistan the head of the cross-party parliamentary committee for cultural affairs , hans-joachim otto , told deutsche welle it was " highly unfortunate that the defense ministry treats the matter of the memorial as its private business . "
" the bundeswehr is a conscription-based army and hence an army of the people .
bundeswehr missions are decided upon in parliament and not in the defense ministry , " he said , adding that as such a more public location would be more in keeping with the nature of germany 's armed forces .
more than a wreath depository peter steinbach , the head of berlin 's german resistance memorial site , also argued against placing the monument behind a closed-off gate at the defense ministry .
such a memorial belongs within view of the public , he said on german public radio .
otherwise , it risks becoming simply a " depository for wreaths . "
with a view to similar memorials in other countries , steinbach said , " no one would ever have suggested that the vietnam memorial in the united sites be built within the pentagon 's courtyard . "
chancellor angela merkel , who in february had suggested a more public location closer to the reichstag as a reminder to the role of parliament in deploying the armed forces , endorsed the ministry 's proposal for erecting the memorial within the bendlerblock compound .
her spokesman ulrich wilhelm said thursday she sees eye-to-eye with the defense minister and that details will be presented within due time .

on may 19 , the tally rose further after a suicide bomb killed three soldiers in kunduz , afghanistan .
the deaths of the soldiers , which brought the german fatality toll since the bundeswehr deployed to afghanistan in 2002 to a total of 21 , has not only generated hefty debate in parliament over the security of the troops in afghanistan , but on how to memorialize those who die while serving their country .
while there are little reservations about building a memorial to honor soldiers killed on duty in the country 's post-war armed forces , discussion has centered on the planned location for such a monument . bildunterschrift : a memorial service was held for the fallen soldiers on wednesday german defense minister franz josef jung , who has long harbored plans to honor the fallen soldiers , said the memorial would be erected within the ministry 's premises in berlin .
thomas raabe , spokesman for the defense ministry , said on thursday that the memorial would be located within the bendlerblock compound , the seat of germany 's defense ministry in berlin .
" there will be no changes to that , " he added .
a public memorial ?
but not everyone agrees with locating the memorial within a high-security tract not easily accessible to the general public .
the representative for the armed forces in the german parliament , reinhold robbe , said the majority of soldiers would prefer to see the monument built on a prominent site in berlin .
speaking on the television station rtl , robbe said the monument and its location needed to make clear to all who see it that the bundeswehr is a " parliament 's army . "
the recent fatalities in afghanistan have shown " just how dangerous the job of a soldier is , " and that the soldiers serve " in the name of germany , " robbe added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 3,000 german troops are stationed in afghanistan the head of the cross-party parliamentary committee for cultural affairs , hans-joachim otto , told deutsche welle it was " highly unfortunate that the defense ministry treats the matter of the memorial as its private business .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de third reich -pipe- 25.05.2007 exhibit examines divergent fates of german-jewish exiles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new york was the dream destination of many german-jewish emigres .
a new museum exhibit on german jews who fled their homeland between 1933 and 1941 examines the life-changing - and ultimately life-saving - experiences of those who managed to escape the nazi threat . the multimedia exhibit " homeland and exile : emigration of german jews after 1933 " represents the most comprehensive look ever taken at jews who fled germany for over a hundred countries around the world .
the exhibit touches on the larger political issues of the era , but mostly it focuses on the people who were forced to turn their back on their " heimat " - a german word that encompasses both the concept of homeland and the feeling of emotional attachment to it - and their individual and collective journeys to a new life .
why did they go , where did they find refuge , and under what conditions ?
how did they build new lives for themselves , and how did they feel about their " home countries " both new and old ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young emigrants aboard the ship " martha washington , " en route to palestine the exhibit tackles these questions with commentated displays that briefly describe the widespread anti-semitism and curtailment of civil liberties that led some 280,000 of the 500,000 jews living in germany to emigrate , starting in 1933 .
-lrb- one artefact from that time on display : a children 's board game called jews out ! that involved driving out jew-shaped playing pieces from a town full of shops with names like " salomon 's money lenders . " -rrb-
from there , the story turns to the ways and means of leaving , with the show dividing thematically into rooms devoted to the stories of those who shipped off for destinations across europe , the americas , africa and asia .
on on a 3-d interactive map , museum-goers can pinpoint the 100 countries that eventually allowed jewish refugees entry .
farming in the dominican republic the curators make clear that some destinations were seen as more desirable than others .
the most sought after visa , limited in number and only available to those with an affidavit of support , was for the us .
less preferred was shanghai , which nonetheless became the last chance for escape for some 18,000 to 20,000 jews , thanks to its policy of allowing entry without a visa up to 1941 .
one of the odder histories in this section involves a plan hatched by the then-dictator of the dominican republic , rafael trujillo , to imported jewish " agricultural experts " in an effort to " whiten " his population , and give the country a needed injection of economic energy .
most of the artefacts on display are from the permanent collections of the jewish museum in berlin , where the show ran from sept . , 2006 to april , 2007 , and from other historical collections , explained cilly kugelmann , progam director of the berlin jewish museum .
" there are people who kept everything , every paper , every letter .
that generation is dying out , and they know their children wo n't take care of their things , so they donate it to historical collections , " she explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil liberties for jews were curtailed under the nazis kugelmann said her own favorite artefact is a coin purse kept by a man whose arduous journey out of germany involved going through numerous countries ; he eventually settled in portugal , but kept change in the purse from each stop along the way .
reconstructing lives from ephemera ephemera from the era -lrb- photographs , poems , diaries , ticket stubs , letters -rrb- is interspersed with objects. suitcases , clothing , coffee pots , dolls ; anything either left behind , taken along , or taken up as part of a new life in a new land .
possibly most compelling are the interactive kiosks that allow viewers to hear the emigres ' personal stories .
videotaped interviews are broken down into short , accessible segments under different categories , and english subtitles are available .
overall , kugelmann said , the exhibit tells a story of a people who did a " remarkably successful " job of adjusting to a difficult situation - even if some of the people faced depression , unhappiness , and even committed suicide .
their success as immigrants was one of the main reasons to create the exhibit , explained kugelmann .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a child 's view of its new world " many of the people who left embarked on their new lives with a certain distinctive , ironic pragmatism , " she said .
" we wondered , ' why were they relatively so successful ?
their children went on to be successful .
how did they do it ? "
a more positive view of the nazi era ?
kugelmann also implied that , more than half a century after the fact , it may be time for germany to start looking at the story of the holocaust from a new angle .
" over the past 60 years , german society has developed a relationship to the nazi period in which the mass murder has become the sole paradigm , " she said .
" the survival of almost two-thirds of german jews was simply ignored . "
and jürgen reiche , exhibitions director at the museum of contemporary history , also said he hoped the exhibit will incite young people to take a new look at germany , past and present .
" we sometimes forget that german-jewish history is also german history , " he said .
' they were robbed of a homeland " but hebrew university historian moshe zimmermann , who consulted on the exhibit , warned of the tendency to concentrate on the well-known successes among the refugees from the nazis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the exhibition focuses on the exiled children " the idea is often that the emigration didn ’ t destroy many lives .
people think of thomas mann , billy wilder , henry kissinger .

" because no child should be victimized in this horrific way , today we pledge to re-double our efforts to enforce the international fight against child pornography , " the ministers said in a joint declaration . internet poses challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet service providers seen as partners in stopping child pornography german justice minister brigitte zypries said countries had been slow to adapt to the challenges produced by the rapid development of the internet which had facilitated the distribution of child pornography .
" we have all adopted specific legislation to fight this phenomenon , but we still have to make progress in transferring international agreements in this area into our domestic laws , " zypries said .
the ministers also discussed the necessity of getting help from internet providers since the internet makes it easy for pedophiles to share child pornography .
" we need to put in place rules in every country to ensure that internet providers inform the authorities if they find images of pedophilia , " said french justice minister rachida dati .
the g8 ministers also want to encourage information technology professionals , banks , the media , parents and educators to " consider what role they could play in the fight , " according to a statement .
germany recently uncovered a child pornography ring by using credit card information . exploitation crosses borders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fight against child pornography needs to be as high tech as the perpetrators zypries used the recent case of a 4-year-old british girl who disappeared earlier this month in portugal , as an example of the need for international cooperation .
" we simply have to assume that this was done by a gang that passes on these children to be exploited , and russia as well mentioned the danger ... that such children may be abducted for adoption later on , " she said to reporters .
the g8 works with interpol to combat child pornography and helped establish the international child sexual exploitation image database , which helps police identify and rescue victims of such abuse .
the head of interpol briefed the ministers on its activities .
interpol secretary-general ronald k. noble said in an interview with reuters that the database now contains more than half a million images of children being sexually exploited and has helped secure the rescue of over 500 children worldwide .
noble showed reuters a number of database photos , which showed caucasian adult males engaged in sex acts with asian boys , activities that would be clearly illegal .
this reflects the majority of cases in which us or european males travel to countries like thailand or cambodia where they sexually exploit children , noble said in the reuters interview .

finance minister peer steinbrück said the move will improve germany 's standing on the global market . the german parliament on friday paved the way for the country ’ s biggest corporate tax reform in post-world war ii history , which would put its rates on par with the rest of europe .
as of jan .
1 , 2008 , corporate tax will be lowered to 30 percent from the current rate of 39 percent - the highest in the european union .
" this corporate tax reform will make germany a more attractive place for investment , " said steinbrück .
he added in an interview broadcast on public radio friday that all citizens would benefit from the reform because tax revenues would actually increase , at least in the mid-term , though critics have warned of an initial loss of around 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.7 billion -rrb- . the bill , which is expected to be approved by germany 's upper parliamentary house before the summer recess , would also prevent companies from getting tax benefits in germany by taking loans via subsidiaries abroad .
a " blessing of billions " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister steinbrueck said the reform will make germany attractive to investors criticism of the reform has come mainly from the leftist fraction , the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the greens .
chairman of the left party 's parliamentary group , oskar lafontaine , called the corporate tax bill a " blessing of billions for big business , " adding that it would be better to adjust income tax rates for small companies .
jan paul bach , the owner of a 15-employee company near berlin that produces high-tech ceramic elements , said the changes were necessary for germany to keep up in the global marketplace .
" i think the tax reform is necessary to compete with new economies like china or india , which have lower ages and a better position in the global economy , " bach told deutsche welle .
he added , however that he did n't think it was fair that " big companies pay lower taxes while the employees have to pay higher taxes . " to make up for the cuts , germany is abolishing tax holidays , which have mainly benefited multinationals .
an inheritance tax reform is also in the works , on the initiative of the social democratic party , which is part of a series of tax adjustments meant to offset the corporate tax reform . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german family-owned businesses often upstage the big guys a new study has shown that family-owned businesses in germany from 2003 to 2005 performed better than dax firms in both job creation and sales growth .

1 , 2008 , corporate tax will be lowered to 30 percent from the current rate of 39 percent - the highest in the european union .
" this corporate tax reform will make germany a more attractive place for investment , " said steinbrück .
he added in an interview broadcast on public radio friday that all citizens would benefit from the reform because tax revenues would actually increase , at least in the mid-term , though critics have warned of an initial loss of around 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.7 billion -rrb- . the bill , which is expected to be approved by germany 's upper parliamentary house before the summer recess , would also prevent companies from getting tax benefits in germany by taking loans via subsidiaries abroad .
a " blessing of billions " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister steinbrueck said the reform will make germany attractive to investors criticism of the reform has come mainly from the leftist fraction , the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the greens .
chairman of the left party 's parliamentary group , oskar lafontaine , called the corporate tax bill a " blessing of billions for big business , " adding that it would be better to adjust income tax rates for small companies .
jan paul bach , the owner of a 15-employee company near berlin that produces high-tech ceramic elements , said the changes were necessary for germany to keep up in the global marketplace .
" i think the tax reform is necessary to compete with new economies like china or india , which have lower ages and a better position in the global economy , " bach told deutsche welle .
he added , however that he did n't think it was fair that " big companies pay lower taxes while the employees have to pay higher taxes . " to make up for the cuts , germany is abolishing tax holidays , which have mainly benefited multinationals .
an inheritance tax reform is also in the works , on the initiative of the social democratic party , which is part of a series of tax adjustments meant to offset the corporate tax reform . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german family-owned businesses often upstage the big guys a new study has shown that family-owned businesses in germany from 2003 to 2005 performed better than dax firms in both job creation and sales growth .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de third reich -pipe- 25.05.2007 exhibit examines divergent fates of german-jewish exiles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new york was the dream destination of many german-jewish emigres .
a new museum exhibit on german jews who fled their homeland between 1933 and 1941 examines the life-changing - and ultimately life-saving - experiences of those who managed to escape the nazi threat . the multimedia exhibit " homeland and exile : emigration of german jews after 1933 " represents the most comprehensive look ever taken at jews who fled germany for over a hundred countries around the world .
the exhibit touches on the larger political issues of the era , but mostly it focuses on the people who were forced to turn their back on their " heimat " - a german word that encompasses both the concept of homeland and the feeling of emotional attachment to it - and their individual and collective journeys to a new life .
why did they go , where did they find refuge , and under what conditions ?
how did they build new lives for themselves , and how did they feel about their " home countries " both new and old ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young emigrants aboard the ship " martha washington , " en route to palestine the exhibit tackles these questions with commentated displays that briefly describe the widespread anti-semitism and curtailment of civil liberties that led some 280,000 of the 500,000 jews living in germany to emigrate , starting in 1933 .
-lrb- one artefact from that time on display : a children 's board game called jews out ! that involved driving out jew-shaped playing pieces from a town full of shops with names like " salomon 's money lenders . " -rrb-
from there , the story turns to the ways and means of leaving , with the show dividing thematically into rooms devoted to the stories of those who shipped off for destinations across europe , the americas , africa and asia .
on on a 3-d interactive map , museum-goers can pinpoint the 100 countries that eventually allowed jewish refugees entry .
farming in the dominican republic the curators make clear that some destinations were seen as more desirable than others .
the most sought after visa , limited in number and only available to those with an affidavit of support , was for the us .
less preferred was shanghai , which nonetheless became the last chance for escape for some 18,000 to 20,000 jews , thanks to its policy of allowing entry without a visa up to 1941 .
one of the odder histories in this section involves a plan hatched by the then-dictator of the dominican republic , rafael trujillo , to imported jewish " agricultural experts " in an effort to " whiten " his population , and give the country a needed injection of economic energy .
most of the artefacts on display are from the permanent collections of the jewish museum in berlin , where the show ran from sept . , 2006 to april , 2007 , and from other historical collections , explained cilly kugelmann , progam director of the berlin jewish museum .

finance minister peer steinbrück said the move will improve germany 's standing on the global market . the german parliament on friday paved the way for the country ’ s biggest corporate tax reform in post-world war ii history , which would put its rates on par with the rest of europe .
as of jan .
1 , 2008 , corporate tax will be lowered to 30 percent from the current rate of 39 percent - the highest in the european union .
" this corporate tax reform will make germany a more attractive place for investment , " said steinbrück .
he added in an interview broadcast on public radio friday that all citizens would benefit from the reform because tax revenues would actually increase , at least in the mid-term , though critics have warned of an initial loss of around 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.7 billion -rrb- . the bill , which is expected to be approved by germany 's upper parliamentary house before the summer recess , would also prevent companies from getting tax benefits in germany by taking loans via subsidiaries abroad .
a " blessing of billions " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister steinbrueck said the reform will make germany attractive to investors criticism of the reform has come mainly from the leftist fraction , the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the greens .
chairman of the left party 's parliamentary group , oskar lafontaine , called the corporate tax bill a " blessing of billions for big business , " adding that it would be better to adjust income tax rates for small companies .
jan paul bach , the owner of a 15-employee company near berlin that produces high-tech ceramic elements , said the changes were necessary for germany to keep up in the global marketplace .
" i think the tax reform is necessary to compete with new economies like china or india , which have lower ages and a better position in the global economy , " bach told deutsche welle .
he added , however that he did n't think it was fair that " big companies pay lower taxes while the employees have to pay higher taxes . " to make up for the cuts , germany is abolishing tax holidays , which have mainly benefited multinationals .
an inheritance tax reform is also in the works , on the initiative of the social democratic party , which is part of a series of tax adjustments meant to offset the corporate tax reform . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german family-owned businesses often upstage the big guys a new study has shown that family-owned businesses in germany from 2003 to 2005 performed better than dax firms in both job creation and sales growth .

a new museum exhibit on german jews who fled their homeland between 1933 and 1941 examines the life-changing - and ultimately life-saving - experiences of those who managed to escape the nazi threat . the multimedia exhibit " homeland and exile : emigration of german jews after 1933 " represents the most comprehensive look ever taken at jews who fled germany for over a hundred countries around the world .
the exhibit touches on the larger political issues of the era , but mostly it focuses on the people who were forced to turn their back on their " heimat " - a german word that encompasses both the concept of homeland and the feeling of emotional attachment to it - and their individual and collective journeys to a new life .
why did they go , where did they find refuge , and under what conditions ?
how did they build new lives for themselves , and how did they feel about their " home countries " both new and old ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young emigrants aboard the ship " martha washington , " en route to palestine the exhibit tackles these questions with commentated displays that briefly describe the widespread anti-semitism and curtailment of civil liberties that led some 280,000 of the 500,000 jews living in germany to emigrate , starting in 1933 .
-lrb- one artefact from that time on display : a children 's board game called jews out ! that involved driving out jew-shaped playing pieces from a town full of shops with names like " salomon 's money lenders . " -rrb-
from there , the story turns to the ways and means of leaving , with the show dividing thematically into rooms devoted to the stories of those who shipped off for destinations across europe , the americas , africa and asia .
on on a 3-d interactive map , museum-goers can pinpoint the 100 countries that eventually allowed jewish refugees entry .
farming in the dominican republic the curators make clear that some destinations were seen as more desirable than others .
the most sought after visa , limited in number and only available to those with an affidavit of support , was for the us .
less preferred was shanghai , which nonetheless became the last chance for escape for some 18,000 to 20,000 jews , thanks to its policy of allowing entry without a visa up to 1941 .
one of the odder histories in this section involves a plan hatched by the then-dictator of the dominican republic , rafael trujillo , to imported jewish " agricultural experts " in an effort to " whiten " his population , and give the country a needed injection of economic energy .
most of the artefacts on display are from the permanent collections of the jewish museum in berlin , where the show ran from sept . , 2006 to april , 2007 , and from other historical collections , explained cilly kugelmann , progam director of the berlin jewish museum .
" there are people who kept everything , every paper , every letter .
that generation is dying out , and they know their children wo n't take care of their things , so they donate it to historical collections , " she explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil liberties for jews were curtailed under the nazis kugelmann said her own favorite artefact is a coin purse kept by a man whose arduous journey out of germany involved going through numerous countries ; he eventually settled in portugal , but kept change in the purse from each stop along the way .

he did n't forcefully condemn china 's human rights record , saying he would leave specific criticisms to the german government . köhler was almost euphoric as he recounted his " very good talks " with china 's leadership in beijing .
köhler managed to circumvent the minefield in which the issue of human rights had threatened to overshadow his visit , so that at the end , he was back in his element - advocating expanded cooperation with the world 's most populous country in the field of environmental and resource protection .
and , he reported , in this aspect he had found " open doors " in beijing .
köhler showed how impressed he was with china 's new generation of leaders : " they are aware of the problems and challenges of this society and its giant population number of 1.3 billion such as i have experienced from no other leadership , " said the man who had often visited china in the past in other functions .
" they are facing the problems and want to solve them , " he added .
leaving out details bildunterschrift : protestors bring attention to human rights abuses in china the chinese brought up the subject of human rights themselves , köhler said .
they admitted to " mistakes and problems " that they are working on .
but they did not speak about any specific cases .
köhler said that responsibility for talking about specifics rests with the german government .
" it was right for me to present the principles , but detailed human rights issues and cases are something that the german government has to talk about -lrb- with china -rrb- , " he said .
köhler was following a precedent set by former chancellors helmut kohl and gerhard schröder , an editorial in the friday edition of the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
he spoke in abstractions and " philosophized about human rights , but lacked the words to talk about the chinese problems . "
" it was important for me to bring forward the fundamentals , " köhler said .
the tensions in the run up to his meeting amog other things because of the resolution of the german parliament that criticized the " re-education through labor camps " in china , were not further talked about .
the resolution was rejected as " intervention " by beijing .
tapping köhler 's expertise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler said chinese leaders were eager for his advice the german president holds mostly ceremonial and diplomatic duties . he used to head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
state and party leader hu jintao was eager to tap into köhler 's experience in dealing with issues facing china , such as adequate employment for hundreds of millions of rural residents , or how to overcome the gap between the poor western regions and the wealthier coastal population .
they had talked at length , köhler said , about the rapid ageing of china 's population and the effects of this on the pensions and insurance sectors .
china 's leaders were " almost desperate " in asking how such problems might be resolved , he said .
" it was noticeable how he -lrb- hu -rrb- wanted to discuss with me in depth those problems he is itching to deal with , " köhler said .
climate change a central theme bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has serious problems with pollution china pushed for the german government to provide more investement and technology to help develop a key bilateral relationship between the two nations , köhler told reporters after meeting chinese premier wen jiabao in beijing on friday .
china also hopes to see " more action " from germany in areas such as regular bilateral dialogues , and technology transfer related to environmental protection and energy efficiency , köhler said .
koehler said he was impressed with the openness of chinese leaders on environmental protection and their apparent willingness to take more action on climate change .
" it 's the first time that the chinese understand it -lrb- climate change -rrb- as an important issue in itself , " koehler said at the conclusion of his talks in the zhongnanhai compound used by leaders of china 's ruling communist party .
china seemed committed to achieving its targets for reducing carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency , but it lacked capacity and expertise , he said .
köhler said he was optimistic that china would play a " constructive role " in global efforts against climate change .
" china is aware that it is part of the problem , " he said .
" they want to be part of the solution . "
on saturday , köhler will deliver a speech in shanghai to mark the 100th anniversary of tongji university .

france 's sarkozy thinks not on a diplomatic tour of europe , french president nicolas sarkozy expressed his opposition to turkey 's eu membership bid .
the newly elected french leader also championed the idea of a " simplified treaty " for the eu . nicolas sarkozy has n't been in office for three weeks , but his policy offensive to reclaim france 's leadership in the european union is in full swing . on a diplomatic tour of european countries , sarkozy championed the idea of a " simplified treaty " to replace the failed eu constitution .
european commission chief jose manuel barroso said the idea was gaining support . " -lrb- sarkozy -rrb- was the first to suggest the idea of a simplified treaty , and today we see that there is a consensus forming around this idea , " barroso told reporters at a joint press conference with sarkozy . the french president also took the opportunity of his first visit to brussels since taking power on may 6 to reaffirm his opposition to turkey 's bid to join the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and barroso have differing views on turkey " i do n't see how you can be a candidate with one opinion and a president with another , " sarkozy said .
" i do n't think that turkey has a place in the union , " he concluded , but added that he did not want to dwell on the issue at present . " the question does n't arise at present and we already have enough on our plate , " sarkozy explained . barroso stressed that his european commission was " in favor of negotiations with turkey , " but concurred with sarkozy that " right now , our absolute priority is the treaty , the resolution of the institutional crisis . " constitution , mini-treaty , simplified treaty on the eu 's institutional gridlock , the french president said a european summit next month would be a success " if the 27 -lrb- eu member states -rrb- are in agreement for a simplified treaty . " in france , such a treaty could be submitted for approval by the parliament in order to avoid a repeat of the 2005 popular referenda that cut down the now moribund eu constitution . after french voters rejected the original constitution , france found itself playing an increasingly marginal role in the club of architects of the new europe .
sarkozy 's government now wants to reclaim france 's leadership in the eu , a campaign promise that had been trumpeted by both sarkozy and runner-up ségolène royal . last year , sarkozy had used the term " mini-treaty " to describe what he felt would be an acceptable constitutional framework for the eu .

he did n't forcefully condemn china 's human rights record , saying he would leave specific criticisms to the german government . köhler was almost euphoric as he recounted his " very good talks " with china 's leadership in beijing .

köhler showed how impressed he was with china 's new generation of leaders : " they are aware of the problems and challenges of this society and its giant population number of 1.3 billion such as i have experienced from no other leadership , " said the man who had often visited china in the past in other functions .

france 's sarkozy thinks not on a diplomatic tour of europe , french president nicolas sarkozy expressed his opposition to turkey 's eu membership bid .
the newly elected french leader also championed the idea of a " simplified treaty " for the eu . nicolas sarkozy has n't been in office for three weeks , but his policy offensive to reclaim france 's leadership in the european union is in full swing . on a diplomatic tour of european countries , sarkozy championed the idea of a " simplified treaty " to replace the failed eu constitution .
european commission chief jose manuel barroso said the idea was gaining support . " -lrb- sarkozy -rrb- was the first to suggest the idea of a simplified treaty , and today we see that there is a consensus forming around this idea , " barroso told reporters at a joint press conference with sarkozy . the french president also took the opportunity of his first visit to brussels since taking power on may 6 to reaffirm his opposition to turkey 's bid to join the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and barroso have differing views on turkey " i do n't see how you can be a candidate with one opinion and a president with another , " sarkozy said .
" i do n't think that turkey has a place in the union , " he concluded , but added that he did not want to dwell on the issue at present . " the question does n't arise at present and we already have enough on our plate , " sarkozy explained . barroso stressed that his european commission was " in favor of negotiations with turkey , " but concurred with sarkozy that " right now , our absolute priority is the treaty , the resolution of the institutional crisis . " constitution , mini-treaty , simplified treaty on the eu 's institutional gridlock , the french president said a european summit next month would be a success " if the 27 -lrb- eu member states -rrb- are in agreement for a simplified treaty . " in france , such a treaty could be submitted for approval by the parliament in order to avoid a repeat of the 2005 popular referenda that cut down the now moribund eu constitution . after french voters rejected the original constitution , france found itself playing an increasingly marginal role in the club of architects of the new europe .
sarkozy 's government now wants to reclaim france 's leadership in the eu , a campaign promise that had been trumpeted by both sarkozy and runner-up ségolène royal . last year , sarkozy had used the term " mini-treaty " to describe what he felt would be an acceptable constitutional framework for the eu .
the french leader said he recognized now that " mini-treaty " lacks ambition . eighteen member states have ratified the original constitution , which was deemed necessary to bring eu institutions up to date in the expanded bloc .
but any new treaty will have to revisit some controversial topics , such as references to " shared values , " which were understood by some observers as a coded exclusion of turkey from the eu club . " we must work together " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan called sarkozy to propose a get-together turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan phoned sarkozy on thursday , according to reuters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de third reich -pipe- 25.05.2007 exhibit examines divergent fates of german-jewish exiles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new york was the dream destination of many german-jewish emigres .
a new museum exhibit on german jews who fled their homeland between 1933 and 1941 examines the life-changing - and ultimately life-saving - experiences of those who managed to escape the nazi threat . the multimedia exhibit " homeland and exile : emigration of german jews after 1933 " represents the most comprehensive look ever taken at jews who fled germany for over a hundred countries around the world .
the exhibit touches on the larger political issues of the era , but mostly it focuses on the people who were forced to turn their back on their " heimat " - a german word that encompasses both the concept of homeland and the feeling of emotional attachment to it - and their individual and collective journeys to a new life .
why did they go , where did they find refuge , and under what conditions ?
how did they build new lives for themselves , and how did they feel about their " home countries " both new and old ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young emigrants aboard the ship " martha washington , " en route to palestine the exhibit tackles these questions with commentated displays that briefly describe the widespread anti-semitism and curtailment of civil liberties that led some 280,000 of the 500,000 jews living in germany to emigrate , starting in 1933 .
-lrb- one artefact from that time on display : a children 's board game called jews out ! that involved driving out jew-shaped playing pieces from a town full of shops with names like " salomon 's money lenders . " -rrb-
from there , the story turns to the ways and means of leaving , with the show dividing thematically into rooms devoted to the stories of those who shipped off for destinations across europe , the americas , africa and asia .
on on a 3-d interactive map , museum-goers can pinpoint the 100 countries that eventually allowed jewish refugees entry .
farming in the dominican republic the curators make clear that some destinations were seen as more desirable than others .
the most sought after visa , limited in number and only available to those with an affidavit of support , was for the us .
less preferred was shanghai , which nonetheless became the last chance for escape for some 18,000 to 20,000 jews , thanks to its policy of allowing entry without a visa up to 1941 .
one of the odder histories in this section involves a plan hatched by the then-dictator of the dominican republic , rafael trujillo , to imported jewish " agricultural experts " in an effort to " whiten " his population , and give the country a needed injection of economic energy .
most of the artefacts on display are from the permanent collections of the jewish museum in berlin , where the show ran from sept . , 2006 to april , 2007 , and from other historical collections , explained cilly kugelmann , progam director of the berlin jewish museum .
" there are people who kept everything , every paper , every letter .
that generation is dying out , and they know their children wo n't take care of their things , so they donate it to historical collections , " she explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil liberties for jews were curtailed under the nazis kugelmann said her own favorite artefact is a coin purse kept by a man whose arduous journey out of germany involved going through numerous countries ; he eventually settled in portugal , but kept change in the purse from each stop along the way .
reconstructing lives from ephemera ephemera from the era -lrb- photographs , poems , diaries , ticket stubs , letters -rrb- is interspersed with objects. suitcases , clothing , coffee pots , dolls ; anything either left behind , taken along , or taken up as part of a new life in a new land .
possibly most compelling are the interactive kiosks that allow viewers to hear the emigres ' personal stories .
videotaped interviews are broken down into short , accessible segments under different categories , and english subtitles are available .
overall , kugelmann said , the exhibit tells a story of a people who did a " remarkably successful " job of adjusting to a difficult situation - even if some of the people faced depression , unhappiness , and even committed suicide .
their success as immigrants was one of the main reasons to create the exhibit , explained kugelmann .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a child 's view of its new world " many of the people who left embarked on their new lives with a certain distinctive , ironic pragmatism , " she said .
" we wondered , ' why were they relatively so successful ?
their children went on to be successful .
how did they do it ? "
a more positive view of the nazi era ?
kugelmann also implied that , more than half a century after the fact , it may be time for germany to start looking at the story of the holocaust from a new angle .
" over the past 60 years , german society has developed a relationship to the nazi period in which the mass murder has become the sole paradigm , " she said .
" the survival of almost two-thirds of german jews was simply ignored . "
and jürgen reiche , exhibitions director at the museum of contemporary history , also said he hoped the exhibit will incite young people to take a new look at germany , past and present .
" we sometimes forget that german-jewish history is also german history , " he said .
' they were robbed of a homeland " but hebrew university historian moshe zimmermann , who consulted on the exhibit , warned of the tendency to concentrate on the well-known successes among the refugees from the nazis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the exhibition focuses on the exiled children " the idea is often that the emigration didn ’ t destroy many lives .

" people say , ' they could find a home elsewhere because jews are like that . ' … but if you start thinking that way , you 're starting with the wrong idea . "
as the word " heimat " in the title of the exhibit makes clear , " the émigrés were , despite everything , german , " zimmermann said .

a new museum exhibit on german jews who fled their homeland between 1933 and 1941 examines the life-changing - and ultimately life-saving - experiences of those who managed to escape the nazi threat . the multimedia exhibit " homeland and exile : emigration of german jews after 1933 " represents the most comprehensive look ever taken at jews who fled germany for over a hundred countries around the world .
the exhibit touches on the larger political issues of the era , but mostly it focuses on the people who were forced to turn their back on their " heimat " - a german word that encompasses both the concept of homeland and the feeling of emotional attachment to it - and their individual and collective journeys to a new life .
why did they go , where did they find refuge , and under what conditions ?
how did they build new lives for themselves , and how did they feel about their " home countries " both new and old ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young emigrants aboard the ship " martha washington , " en route to palestine the exhibit tackles these questions with commentated displays that briefly describe the widespread anti-semitism and curtailment of civil liberties that led some 280,000 of the 500,000 jews living in germany to emigrate , starting in 1933 .

a german diplomat warned the move could harm the ukraine 's relationship with europe . ukraine 's political crisis escalated on friday as president viktor yushchenko attempted to take control of thousands of interior ministry troops away from his rival prime minister viktor yanukovych . the menacing new twist in a long-running power struggle between the two leaders drew expressions of concern from europe , russia and the united states , which warned against the use of violence . yushchenko ordered that authority over interior ministry forces be removed from the government headed by the premier and transferred to the president , in a decree published on his official website .
the president already controls the army under ukraine 's constitution . the decree covers interior ministry troops with military training often used for anti-riot operations and does not include the police force or the ministry 's elite berkut unit . yanukovych angrily rejected the president 's order as an anti-constitutional " interference in the activities of the executive branch , " while speaking to western diplomats in a televised meeting . parliamentary speaker and yanukovych ally oleksandr moroz went further during the same meeting with foreign diplomats , describing the president 's move as a " coup attempt . " us calls for peaceful resolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of prime minister yanukovych protested friday reacting to the rising political temperature in kiev , the united states called on both sides to resolve their dispute " without violence " and to abide by democratic rules . " we expect the ukrainians to follow their constitutional and legal processes and live up to their responsibilities in a democracy , " national security spokesman gordon johndroe told reporters . prime minister mikhail fradkov of russia , ukraine 's giant neighbor and main trading partner , said that he was " worried " about the escalating tensions and also urged authorities to abide by the law . germany urges restraint bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovych supporters also demonstrated in kiev johannes regenbrecht , a german diplomat at the meeting with yanukovych , warned that the use of force to solve the crisis would have serious consequences in ukraine 's relations with europe .
" all means must be used to avoid an escalation , " regenbrecht said . the european union expressed its and urged the feuding president and prime minister to try to settle the stand-off peacefully .
" the presidency of the european union is increasingly concerned about recent developments in ukraine , " the current german presidency of the eu said in a statement .
" the presidency urges president yushchenko and prime minister yanukovych to assume the responsibility which they have to resolve the political crisis in ukraine through negotiations , as agreed , " the statement said . " these events can not but aggravate the political situation in the country , " eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said in a separate statement from brussels .
" i call upon all political forces in ukraine to do their utmost , on the basis of a constructive attitude and in a peaceful and lawful manner , to find a viable political compromise to solve the current political impasse and to refrain from any action which would further exacerbate the situation , especially by involving the security forces , " she said . " this is vital for the people of ukraine , and for ukraine 's continued progress on the path of political and economic reform . " on thursday , the interior ministry 's elite berkut forces raised the president 's ire by defying his order to dismiss the country 's prosecutor general , a yanukovych ally , who refused to step down calling his dismissal illegal . the elite forces , which are not affected by friday 's decree , arrived at the offices where the prosecutor general was holed up , and scuffled with security personnel controlled by the president . dissolution of parliament prompts crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko dissolved parliament in april the latest round of political recriminations in ukraine began with yushchenko 's dissolution of parliament last month , part of an ongoing dispute with the prime minister over the course of the country . yushchenko , who cancelled a trip to the czech republic on friday due to the latest crisis , favors full integration with the west , including the nato military alliance , while the prime minister favors close ties with moscow . in recent weeks , the two have been locked in stalemate over the timing of new parliamentary elections , and a reported deal appears to be in tatters after the latest stand-off . " i would say that i no longer have any optimism that results can be achieved considering the opposition demonstrated by the two sides , " yushchenko told a meeting of regional leaders on friday , the interfax news agency reported . yanukovych struck a more optimistic note , calling for a " return to political dialogue , " during the televised meeting with foreign diplomats . control over interior ministry forces was crucial in the orange revolution of 2004 , when mass street protests helped bring yushchenko to the presidency , overturning a flawed vote initially granted to yanukovych . reports at the time said yushchenko 's victory over yanukovych was due to a refusal by interior ministry forces to follow orders to crush the " people power " protests . on friday , thousands of yanukovych supporters rallied outside the prosecutor 's office to protest against the president 's decree as part of ongoing anti-yushchenko demonstrations in kiev . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine gripped by stalemate as eu waits for compromise rival demonstrators rallied in the ukrainian capital as defiant prime minister viktor yanukovych rejected a possible concession by his political enemy , president viktor yushchenko .

on may 19 , the tally rose further after a suicide bomb killed three soldiers in kunduz , afghanistan .
the deaths of the soldiers , which brought the german fatality toll since the bundeswehr deployed to afghanistan in 2002 to a total of 21 , has not only generated hefty debate in parliament over the security of the troops in afghanistan , but on how to memorialize those who die while serving their country .
while there are little reservations about building a memorial to honor soldiers killed on duty in the country 's post-war armed forces , discussion has centered on the planned location for such a monument . bildunterschrift : a memorial service was held for the fallen soldiers on wednesday german defense minister franz josef jung , who has long harbored plans to honor the fallen soldiers , said the memorial would be erected within the ministry 's premises in berlin .
thomas raabe , spokesman for the defense ministry , said on thursday that the memorial would be located within the bendlerblock compound , the seat of germany 's defense ministry in berlin .
" there will be no changes to that , " he added .
a public memorial ?
but not everyone agrees with locating the memorial within a high-security tract not easily accessible to the general public .
the representative for the armed forces in the german parliament , reinhold robbe , said the majority of soldiers would prefer to see the monument built on a prominent site in berlin .
speaking on the television station rtl , robbe said the monument and its location needed to make clear to all who see it that the bundeswehr is a " parliament 's army . "
the recent fatalities in afghanistan have shown " just how dangerous the job of a soldier is , " and that the soldiers serve " in the name of germany , " robbe added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 3,000 german troops are stationed in afghanistan the head of the cross-party parliamentary committee for cultural affairs , hans-joachim otto , told deutsche welle it was " highly unfortunate that the defense ministry treats the matter of the memorial as its private business . "
" the bundeswehr is a conscription-based army and hence an army of the people .
bundeswehr missions are decided upon in parliament and not in the defense ministry , " he said , adding that as such a more public location would be more in keeping with the nature of germany 's armed forces .
more than a wreath depository peter steinbach , the head of berlin 's german resistance memorial site , also argued against placing the monument behind a closed-off gate at the defense ministry .
such a memorial belongs within view of the public , he said on german public radio .
otherwise , it risks becoming simply a " depository for wreaths . "
with a view to similar memorials in other countries , steinbach said , " no one would ever have suggested that the vietnam memorial in the united sites be built within the pentagon 's courtyard . "
chancellor angela merkel , who in february had suggested a more public location closer to the reichstag as a reminder to the role of parliament in deploying the armed forces , endorsed the ministry 's proposal for erecting the memorial within the bendlerblock compound .
her spokesman ulrich wilhelm said thursday she sees eye-to-eye with the defense minister and that details will be presented within due time .
despite the ongoing debate , jung is expected to lay the cornerstone for the memorial later this year . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " german military can be strong complement in afghanistan " additional questions about germany 's role in afghanistan arose when three of its soldiers lost their lives in a suicide bombing .

a german diplomat warned the move could harm the ukraine 's relationship with europe . ukraine 's political crisis escalated on friday as president viktor yushchenko attempted to take control of thousands of interior ministry troops away from his rival prime minister viktor yanukovych . the menacing new twist in a long-running power struggle between the two leaders drew expressions of concern from europe , russia and the united states , which warned against the use of violence . yushchenko ordered that authority over interior ministry forces be removed from the government headed by the premier and transferred to the president , in a decree published on his official website .
the president already controls the army under ukraine 's constitution . the decree covers interior ministry troops with military training often used for anti-riot operations and does not include the police force or the ministry 's elite berkut unit . yanukovych angrily rejected the president 's order as an anti-constitutional " interference in the activities of the executive branch , " while speaking to western diplomats in a televised meeting . parliamentary speaker and yanukovych ally oleksandr moroz went further during the same meeting with foreign diplomats , describing the president 's move as a " coup attempt . " us calls for peaceful resolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of prime minister yanukovych protested friday reacting to the rising political temperature in kiev , the united states called on both sides to resolve their dispute " without violence " and to abide by democratic rules . " we expect the ukrainians to follow their constitutional and legal processes and live up to their responsibilities in a democracy , " national security spokesman gordon johndroe told reporters . prime minister mikhail fradkov of russia , ukraine 's giant neighbor and main trading partner , said that he was " worried " about the escalating tensions and also urged authorities to abide by the law . germany urges restraint bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovych supporters also demonstrated in kiev johannes regenbrecht , a german diplomat at the meeting with yanukovych , warned that the use of force to solve the crisis would have serious consequences in ukraine 's relations with europe .
" all means must be used to avoid an escalation , " regenbrecht said . the european union expressed its and urged the feuding president and prime minister to try to settle the stand-off peacefully .
" the presidency of the european union is increasingly concerned about recent developments in ukraine , " the current german presidency of the eu said in a statement .
" the presidency urges president yushchenko and prime minister yanukovych to assume the responsibility which they have to resolve the political crisis in ukraine through negotiations , as agreed , " the statement said . " these events can not but aggravate the political situation in the country , " eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said in a separate statement from brussels .
" i call upon all political forces in ukraine to do their utmost , on the basis of a constructive attitude and in a peaceful and lawful manner , to find a viable political compromise to solve the current political impasse and to refrain from any action which would further exacerbate the situation , especially by involving the security forces , " she said . " this is vital for the people of ukraine , and for ukraine 's continued progress on the path of political and economic reform . " on thursday , the interior ministry 's elite berkut forces raised the president 's ire by defying his order to dismiss the country 's prosecutor general , a yanukovych ally , who refused to step down calling his dismissal illegal . the elite forces , which are not affected by friday 's decree , arrived at the offices where the prosecutor general was holed up , and scuffled with security personnel controlled by the president . dissolution of parliament prompts crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko dissolved parliament in april the latest round of political recriminations in ukraine began with yushchenko 's dissolution of parliament last month , part of an ongoing dispute with the prime minister over the course of the country . yushchenko , who cancelled a trip to the czech republic on friday due to the latest crisis , favors full integration with the west , including the nato military alliance , while the prime minister favors close ties with moscow . in recent weeks , the two have been locked in stalemate over the timing of new parliamentary elections , and a reported deal appears to be in tatters after the latest stand-off . " i would say that i no longer have any optimism that results can be achieved considering the opposition demonstrated by the two sides , " yushchenko told a meeting of regional leaders on friday , the interfax news agency reported . yanukovych struck a more optimistic note , calling for a " return to political dialogue , " during the televised meeting with foreign diplomats . control over interior ministry forces was crucial in the orange revolution of 2004 , when mass street protests helped bring yushchenko to the presidency , overturning a flawed vote initially granted to yanukovych . reports at the time said yushchenko 's victory over yanukovych was due to a refusal by interior ministry forces to follow orders to crush the " people power " protests . on friday , thousands of yanukovych supporters rallied outside the prosecutor 's office to protest against the president 's decree as part of ongoing anti-yushchenko demonstrations in kiev . dw staff / afp -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine gripped by stalemate as eu waits for compromise rival demonstrators rallied in the ukrainian capital as defiant prime minister viktor yanukovych rejected a possible concession by his political enemy , president viktor yushchenko .

france 's sarkozy thinks not on a diplomatic tour of europe , french president nicolas sarkozy expressed his opposition to turkey 's eu membership bid .
the newly elected french leader also championed the idea of a " simplified treaty " for the eu . nicolas sarkozy has n't been in office for three weeks , but his policy offensive to reclaim france 's leadership in the european union is in full swing . on a diplomatic tour of european countries , sarkozy championed the idea of a " simplified treaty " to replace the failed eu constitution .
european commission chief jose manuel barroso said the idea was gaining support . " -lrb- sarkozy -rrb- was the first to suggest the idea of a simplified treaty , and today we see that there is a consensus forming around this idea , " barroso told reporters at a joint press conference with sarkozy . the french president also took the opportunity of his first visit to brussels since taking power on may 6 to reaffirm his opposition to turkey 's bid to join the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and barroso have differing views on turkey " i do n't see how you can be a candidate with one opinion and a president with another , " sarkozy said .
" i do n't think that turkey has a place in the union , " he concluded , but added that he did not want to dwell on the issue at present . " the question does n't arise at present and we already have enough on our plate , " sarkozy explained . barroso stressed that his european commission was " in favor of negotiations with turkey , " but concurred with sarkozy that " right now , our absolute priority is the treaty , the resolution of the institutional crisis . " constitution , mini-treaty , simplified treaty on the eu 's institutional gridlock , the french president said a european summit next month would be a success " if the 27 -lrb- eu member states -rrb- are in agreement for a simplified treaty . " in france , such a treaty could be submitted for approval by the parliament in order to avoid a repeat of the 2005 popular referenda that cut down the now moribund eu constitution . after french voters rejected the original constitution , france found itself playing an increasingly marginal role in the club of architects of the new europe .

the french leader said he recognized now that " mini-treaty " lacks ambition . eighteen member states have ratified the original constitution , which was deemed necessary to bring eu institutions up to date in the expanded bloc .
but any new treaty will have to revisit some controversial topics , such as references to " shared values , " which were understood by some observers as a coded exclusion of turkey from the eu club .

" -lrb- we must -rrb- work together with direct talks .

the heads of state went on to discuss cooperation between france and turkey , a nato member , on a broad range of economic , political and military issues . but on the campaign trail , sarkozy made it clear that he was staunchly opposed to turkey 's accession to the eu .
he has instead proposed a mediterranean union for turkey and its neighbors .

" because no child should be victimized in this horrific way , today we pledge to re-double our efforts to enforce the international fight against child pornography , " the ministers said in a joint declaration . internet poses challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet service providers seen as partners in stopping child pornography german justice minister brigitte zypries said countries had been slow to adapt to the challenges produced by the rapid development of the internet which had facilitated the distribution of child pornography .
" we have all adopted specific legislation to fight this phenomenon , but we still have to make progress in transferring international agreements in this area into our domestic laws , " zypries said .
the ministers also discussed the necessity of getting help from internet providers since the internet makes it easy for pedophiles to share child pornography .
" we need to put in place rules in every country to ensure that internet providers inform the authorities if they find images of pedophilia , " said french justice minister rachida dati .
the g8 ministers also want to encourage information technology professionals , banks , the media , parents and educators to " consider what role they could play in the fight , " according to a statement .
germany recently uncovered a child pornography ring by using credit card information . exploitation crosses borders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fight against child pornography needs to be as high tech as the perpetrators zypries used the recent case of a 4-year-old british girl who disappeared earlier this month in portugal , as an example of the need for international cooperation .
" we simply have to assume that this was done by a gang that passes on these children to be exploited , and russia as well mentioned the danger ... that such children may be abducted for adoption later on , " she said to reporters .
the g8 works with interpol to combat child pornography and helped establish the international child sexual exploitation image database , which helps police identify and rescue victims of such abuse .
the head of interpol briefed the ministers on its activities .
interpol secretary-general ronald k. noble said in an interview with reuters that the database now contains more than half a million images of children being sexually exploited and has helped secure the rescue of over 500 children worldwide .
noble showed reuters a number of database photos , which showed caucasian adult males engaged in sex acts with asian boys , activities that would be clearly illegal .
this reflects the majority of cases in which us or european males travel to countries like thailand or cambodia where they sexually exploit children , noble said in the reuters interview .

if the sport is to change and become clean then the three-martini business lunch has to go , according to dw sports editor wolfgang von kann . this week , germany 's tabloid bild zeitung asked , " mr. ullrich , you really did n't know about this ? " but the affair has long gone beyond jan ullrich or any of the other big names .
sure , if yet another cyclist from ullrich & co. were to come out of the doping closet , it would help illuminate the situation further - but it would be essentially meaningless . that 's because today , much more is on the line than the careers of a few cyclists .
anyone who has been following recent developments in athletics , swimming , triathlon or cross-country skiing - to say nothing of weightlifting - will hardly claim that the morass of doping scandals is confined to the cycling arena . we are now talking about competitive sports in general .
this is about breaking up structures with unmistakably mafiaesque semblances .
ultimately , the reputation of all competitive sports is on the line . our unsung heroes but even that is a generalization that scratches at the surface but skirts the core of the issue .
indeed , the central question has yet to be asked : to what extent are we - consumers , viewers , fans and also the media - to blame for all of this ?
what kind of society are we living in , anyway ? it is time to examine the demands we place on our athletes .
barely 20 years old , they are expected to act as role models - a part only few come by voluntarily .
in their twenties , they are supposed to be the shining heroes who make no mistakes and scoop up all the medals at the olympic games .
and over 30 , they are meant to do everything they can to prove that age does n't matter . craving new records where do the fans of cycling races stand ?
at the top of the hill , where the riders hurt the most .
what do people want to see at track-and-field events ?
they are waiting for the world record .
and what do they want at weightlifting competitions ?
they want to see more weight loaded on the bar . the limits of athletic achievement are constantly being pushed .
at the same time , the athlete is expected to be a clean-cut do-gooder , ready to cast aside all signs of exertion and bedazzle the cameras with an eloquent post-match interview . of course , the athlete will achieve all of this on bread and water alone . how one person is supposed to be all that , nobody wants to know . people who live in glass houses ... this rigmarole is not without hypocrisy .
for what is it that we non-athletes do ?
we send our kids to school with sedatives .
we indulge in a little booze during lunch time , or even before we arrive at the office .
we can barely survive without nicotine and alcohol .
and we drink liter after liter of coffee , so that we can do it all . we are a drug nation : at the first sign of a mild cold , we immediately pour a bottle of cough medicine - which , by the way , is prohibited for athletes - down our throats , or just stay in bed griping . ultimately , competitive sports are a mirror image of our society , and is therefore no better or worse than us .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 25.05.2007 opinion : reputation of competitive sports is on the line großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more professional cyclists are admitting to illegal doping .
if the sport is to change and become clean then the three-martini business lunch has to go , according to dw sports editor wolfgang von kann . this week , germany 's tabloid bild zeitung asked , " mr. ullrich , you really did n't know about this ? " but the affair has long gone beyond jan ullrich or any of the other big names .
sure , if yet another cyclist from ullrich & co. were to come out of the doping closet , it would help illuminate the situation further - but it would be essentially meaningless . that 's because today , much more is on the line than the careers of a few cyclists .
anyone who has been following recent developments in athletics , swimming , triathlon or cross-country skiing - to say nothing of weightlifting - will hardly claim that the morass of doping scandals is confined to the cycling arena . we are now talking about competitive sports in general .
this is about breaking up structures with unmistakably mafiaesque semblances .
ultimately , the reputation of all competitive sports is on the line . our unsung heroes but even that is a generalization that scratches at the surface but skirts the core of the issue .
indeed , the central question has yet to be asked : to what extent are we - consumers , viewers , fans and also the media - to blame for all of this ?
what kind of society are we living in , anyway ? it is time to examine the demands we place on our athletes .
barely 20 years old , they are expected to act as role models - a part only few come by voluntarily .
in their twenties , they are supposed to be the shining heroes who make no mistakes and scoop up all the medals at the olympic games .
and over 30 , they are meant to do everything they can to prove that age does n't matter . craving new records where do the fans of cycling races stand ?
at the top of the hill , where the riders hurt the most .
what do people want to see at track-and-field events ?
they are waiting for the world record .
and what do they want at weightlifting competitions ?
they want to see more weight loaded on the bar . the limits of athletic achievement are constantly being pushed .
at the same time , the athlete is expected to be a clean-cut do-gooder , ready to cast aside all signs of exertion and bedazzle the cameras with an eloquent post-match interview . of course , the athlete will achieve all of this on bread and water alone . how one person is supposed to be all that , nobody wants to know . people who live in glass houses ... this rigmarole is not without hypocrisy .
for what is it that we non-athletes do ?
we send our kids to school with sedatives .
we indulge in a little booze during lunch time , or even before we arrive at the office .
we can barely survive without nicotine and alcohol .
and we drink liter after liter of coffee , so that we can do it all . we are a drug nation : at the first sign of a mild cold , we immediately pour a bottle of cough medicine - which , by the way , is prohibited for athletes - down our throats , or just stay in bed griping . ultimately , competitive sports are a mirror image of our society , and is therefore no better or worse than us .

the security situation could further complicate turkey 's bid to join the european union . six turkish soldiers were killed by a roadside bomb thursday in southeast turkey near the border with iraq .
the attack on the military vehicle came two days after a suicide bomber killed a half dozen people in downtown ankara .
turkish political leaders have blamed kurdish rebels affiliated with the separatist kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk . -rrb-
twenty-six people , most of them students , have been arrested for alleged involvement in the attacks , according to media reports on friday .
the pkk is considered a terrorist organization by turkey , the eu and the united states .
the pkk has denied any involvement in the recent attacks , but turkish officials said the method of the bomb attack and the type of explosives were similar to past pkk attacks .
mending ties to eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy says turkey does n't belong in the eu the violence comes at a bad time for turkey .
the new french president nicolas sarkozy has made it clear he continues to oppose turkey 's bid to join the eu .
instead , he has proposed a mediterranean union between turkey and its neighbors .
" i do n't see how you can be a candidate with one opinion and a president with another , " he said during a press conference in brussels this week .
" i do n't think that turkey has a place in the union . " france has said it would consider vetoing turkey 's entry into the eu .
turkey began negotiations in 2005 .
turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan reportedly phoned sarkozy on thursday , in an apparent conciliatory gesture , according to reuters .
in his first call to sarkozy since his election , sources in erdogan 's office quoted the prime minister as congratulating the french president on his victory in the polls and told him that the two needed to work directly with each other , according to reuters .
" we must not communicate via media statements , " erdogan was quoted as telling sarkozy .
" -lrb- we must -rrb- work together with direct talks . "
sarkozy reportedly offered his condolences for a bomb attack in ankara on tuesday and said he wanted to work together to overcome their common problems , according to reuters .
erdogan also noted france and turkey cooperate on economic , political and military issues and that turkey is already a nato member . too soon to say if turkey belongs in eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : talks continue about turkey 's place in the eu eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn said the european commission plans to continue accession negotiations with turkey and said it was too soon to judge whether turkey belonged in the 27-member bloc .
" we have a sound negotiating mandate with turkey and the commission 's view is that we will continue the accession negotiations with turkey because it is in the interests of both the european union and turkey , " he said at a news briefing .
" if we succeed , if turkey succeeds , turkey can become an even more important bridge of civilizations than it is today , " rehn said .
" and the time to judge whether turkey has been able to meet the conditions of eu accession is in the latter stages of the accession process . "
turkey has general elections scheduled for july 22 to decide a political conflict between the islamic-leaning government and the military-backed secular establishment .
military needs to show restraint bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish special forces fire tear gas at kurdish demonstrators the recent bombings further complicate turkey 's domestic and foreign politics .
the pkk is thought to have launched the attacks from hideouts in northern iraq .
turkish army chief yasar buyukanit last month called for a military operation into iraq to quash pkk guerrillas . the united states and iraqi kurdish leaders oppose the idea .
a kurdish iraqi official recently warned that talk of such a move would signal a " dangerous escalation " of the situation .
the us has also urged turkey to show restraint , fearing a cross-border operation could disrupt efforts to stabilize war-torn iraq .
attacks blamed on rebels continued friday when a bomb derailed seven cars of a freight train in southeast turkey .
no injuries were reported .
police arrested 26 people , most of them university students belonging to the separatist kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , media reported on friday .
eight of the arrested are women who were preparing attacks , local authorities were quoted by the anatolia news agency as saying .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundeswehr -pipe- 25.05.2007 germans divided on how to honor fallen soldiers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debate has centered on where a memorial for soldiers should be located less than a week after three german soldiers were killed in afghanistan , debate is heating up over a monument to honor the country 's post-world war ii armed forces members who died while on duty at home and abroad . since the establishment of the german army in the 1950s , more than 2,600 soldiers have died in accidents , maneuvers or peacekeeping missions at home and abroad .
on may 19 , the tally rose further after a suicide bomb killed three soldiers in kunduz , afghanistan .
the deaths of the soldiers , which brought the german fatality toll since the bundeswehr deployed to afghanistan in 2002 to a total of 21 , has not only generated hefty debate in parliament over the security of the troops in afghanistan , but on how to memorialize those who die while serving their country .
while there are little reservations about building a memorial to honor soldiers killed on duty in the country 's post-war armed forces , discussion has centered on the planned location for such a monument . bildunterschrift : a memorial service was held for the fallen soldiers on wednesday german defense minister franz josef jung , who has long harbored plans to honor the fallen soldiers , said the memorial would be erected within the ministry 's premises in berlin .
thomas raabe , spokesman for the defense ministry , said on thursday that the memorial would be located within the bendlerblock compound , the seat of germany 's defense ministry in berlin .
" there will be no changes to that , " he added .
a public memorial ?
but not everyone agrees with locating the memorial within a high-security tract not easily accessible to the general public .
the representative for the armed forces in the german parliament , reinhold robbe , said the majority of soldiers would prefer to see the monument built on a prominent site in berlin .
speaking on the television station rtl , robbe said the monument and its location needed to make clear to all who see it that the bundeswehr is a " parliament 's army . "
the recent fatalities in afghanistan have shown " just how dangerous the job of a soldier is , " and that the soldiers serve " in the name of germany , " robbe added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 3,000 german troops are stationed in afghanistan the head of the cross-party parliamentary committee for cultural affairs , hans-joachim otto , told deutsche welle it was " highly unfortunate that the defense ministry treats the matter of the memorial as its private business . "
" the bundeswehr is a conscription-based army and hence an army of the people .
bundeswehr missions are decided upon in parliament and not in the defense ministry , " he said , adding that as such a more public location would be more in keeping with the nature of germany 's armed forces .
more than a wreath depository peter steinbach , the head of berlin 's german resistance memorial site , also argued against placing the monument behind a closed-off gate at the defense ministry .
such a memorial belongs within view of the public , he said on german public radio .
otherwise , it risks becoming simply a " depository for wreaths . "
with a view to similar memorials in other countries , steinbach said , " no one would ever have suggested that the vietnam memorial in the united sites be built within the pentagon 's courtyard . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 25.05.2007 ladies and gentlemen , heidi klum presents hans and franz großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heidi klum quite aptly takes hans and franz to the golden globes awards german supermodel heidi klum has revealed that she calls her breasts hans and franz .
while that may be more information than most people need to know , others feel as though heidi has n't gone far enough . as two of the more obvious assets of a world famous lingerie model , hans and franz should be more or less used to the eyes of the world being trained on them .
however , despite one unexpected public appearance on the jay leno show in the us when they broke free of an 5.9 million-euro -lrb- $ 8 million -rrb- diamond-encrusted bra , heidi klum 's breasts are usually kept under wraps .
but after the german supermodel revealed her mammary monikers on thursday , worldwide attention has been more concentrated on the 35-inch bust than usual .
hans and franz have been stars of the victoria 's secrets lingerie catwalk shows and adverts for the past ten years but until heidi officially out-ed them as having names this week , they were more appreciated as just being part of the overall , highly aesthetic package .
now they are famous in the own right , people are clambering to know more and more about them .
and just like any new stars being embraced by the cult of celebrity , speculation about them is already rife on the international gossip pages .
no strangers to the limelight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans , franz and victoria 's secrets heidi herself is unique among supermodels for her openness , down-to-earth quality and sense of humor .
but , as with so many of her kind in the fashion world , she obviously believes that less is more .
while anyone who has seen her parading down a runway in the smallest of smalls will attest , this will come as no surprise .
however , in this case , the dearth is not of cloth covering her modesty but the information she is offering on hans and franz .
for one , which is which ?
does hans sit at her right hand or the left ?
also , from whom did the names originate ?
are they named after ex-partners , family relatives or friends ?
what are their likes and dislikes ?
-lrb- this last one will surely turn up in forthcoming interviews with heidi 's husband , the singer seal . -rrb-
all the 33-year-old from bergisch gladbach near cologne will say is that she gave her famous assets the stereotypically german names in homage to her homeland .
" they 've been an ongoing joke for , like , 12 years .
it started because i was from germany , and people always make fun of ze germans , yah ?
so when i began modeling i used to say , ' these are german breasts , one is called hans and one is called franz . " '
inspired by bodybuilder sketch ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did heidi name her breasts after a us comedy routine ?
from the fringe is just one of the many columns that believes there may be more to it that that .
one theory could be that the breasts are named after the characters of a sketch on us comedy show saturday night live .
comedians kevin nealon and dana carvey starred as hans and franz , two bodybuilders in the mould of arnold schwarzenegger who would appear to urge lesser men to get ' pumped ' .
the sketches would begin : " i am hans ... and i am franz ... and we are here to pump you up . "
if there is any truth in this tenuous link to heidi 's chest , it might explain why the klum version of hans and franz muscled their way out of a million-dollar bra live on american television .
however , the nealon and carvey versions were from austria which would render further investigation of this silly lead redundant .
more likely is that heidi named her breasts after famous germans , of which there have been many bearing the first names hans and franz .
being a well-known soccer fan , heidi could have paid homage to a couple of her country 's greats .
a homage to a solid pair ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz -lrb- beckenbauer , that is -rrb- is the one on the right born a year before the 1974 world cup triumph on home soil , maybe ms. klum dedicated her own solid pairing to the central defensive stalwarts of the winning team hans-georg schwarzenbeck and franz beckenbauer .
again , this is pure speculation on from the fringe 's part .
other than the origins of their names and the positioning of each , other questions arising from hans and franz 's introduction to the world include those pertaining to worth .
while casual observers may conclude that they are indeed priceless , as a model whose earnings were estimated by forbes magazine last year at 4.7 million euros , heidi will surely be looking to put a price on her now even-more-famous breasts .
she did after all insure her legs for 3.18 million euros .
what price for hans and franz , one wonders ?
and will they both be worth the same ?
a small scar on one of heidi 's legs means that one is more expensive than the other .
what imperfections , if any , could reduce the worth of either hans or franz ?
come on heidi , enquiring minds need to know ! dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de heidi klum accused of promoting anorexia in germany german media has attacked supermodel heidi klum for a new fashion reality tv show that they charged promotes eating disorders among young women .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 25.05.2007 ladies and gentlemen , heidi klum presents hans and franz großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heidi klum quite aptly takes hans and franz to the golden globes awards german supermodel heidi klum has revealed that she calls her breasts hans and franz .
while that may be more information than most people need to know , others feel as though heidi has n't gone far enough . as two of the more obvious assets of a world famous lingerie model , hans and franz should be more or less used to the eyes of the world being trained on them .
however , despite one unexpected public appearance on the jay leno show in the us when they broke free of an 5.9 million-euro -lrb- $ 8 million -rrb- diamond-encrusted bra , heidi klum 's breasts are usually kept under wraps .
but after the german supermodel revealed her mammary monikers on thursday , worldwide attention has been more concentrated on the 35-inch bust than usual .
hans and franz have been stars of the victoria 's secrets lingerie catwalk shows and adverts for the past ten years but until heidi officially out-ed them as having names this week , they were more appreciated as just being part of the overall , highly aesthetic package .
now they are famous in the own right , people are clambering to know more and more about them .
and just like any new stars being embraced by the cult of celebrity , speculation about them is already rife on the international gossip pages .
no strangers to the limelight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans , franz and victoria 's secrets heidi herself is unique among supermodels for her openness , down-to-earth quality and sense of humor .
but , as with so many of her kind in the fashion world , she obviously believes that less is more .
while anyone who has seen her parading down a runway in the smallest of smalls will attest , this will come as no surprise .
however , in this case , the dearth is not of cloth covering her modesty but the information she is offering on hans and franz .
for one , which is which ?
does hans sit at her right hand or the left ?
also , from whom did the names originate ?
are they named after ex-partners , family relatives or friends ?
what are their likes and dislikes ?
-lrb- this last one will surely turn up in forthcoming interviews with heidi 's husband , the singer seal . -rrb-
all the 33-year-old from bergisch gladbach near cologne will say is that she gave her famous assets the stereotypically german names in homage to her homeland .
" they 've been an ongoing joke for , like , 12 years .
it started because i was from germany , and people always make fun of ze germans , yah ?
so when i began modeling i used to say , ' these are german breasts , one is called hans and one is called franz . " '
inspired by bodybuilder sketch ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did heidi name her breasts after a us comedy routine ?
from the fringe is just one of the many columns that believes there may be more to it that that .
one theory could be that the breasts are named after the characters of a sketch on us comedy show saturday night live .
comedians kevin nealon and dana carvey starred as hans and franz , two bodybuilders in the mould of arnold schwarzenegger who would appear to urge lesser men to get ' pumped ' .
the sketches would begin : " i am hans ... and i am franz ... and we are here to pump you up . "
if there is any truth in this tenuous link to heidi 's chest , it might explain why the klum version of hans and franz muscled their way out of a million-dollar bra live on american television .
however , the nealon and carvey versions were from austria which would render further investigation of this silly lead redundant .
more likely is that heidi named her breasts after famous germans , of which there have been many bearing the first names hans and franz .
being a well-known soccer fan , heidi could have paid homage to a couple of her country 's greats .
a homage to a solid pair ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz -lrb- beckenbauer , that is -rrb- is the one on the right born a year before the 1974 world cup triumph on home soil , maybe ms. klum dedicated her own solid pairing to the central defensive stalwarts of the winning team hans-georg schwarzenbeck and franz beckenbauer .
again , this is pure speculation on from the fringe 's part .
other than the origins of their names and the positioning of each , other questions arising from hans and franz 's introduction to the world include those pertaining to worth .
while casual observers may conclude that they are indeed priceless , as a model whose earnings were estimated by forbes magazine last year at 4.7 million euros , heidi will surely be looking to put a price on her now even-more-famous breasts .
she did after all insure her legs for 3.18 million euros .
what price for hans and franz , one wonders ?
and will they both be worth the same ?
a small scar on one of heidi 's legs means that one is more expensive than the other .
what imperfections , if any , could reduce the worth of either hans or franz ?
come on heidi , enquiring minds need to know ! dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de heidi klum accused of promoting anorexia in germany german media has attacked supermodel heidi klum for a new fashion reality tv show that they charged promotes eating disorders among young women .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de third reich -pipe- 25.05.2007 exhibit examines divergent fates of german-jewish exiles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new york was the dream destination of many german-jewish emigres .
a new museum exhibit on german jews who fled their homeland between 1933 and 1941 examines the life-changing - and ultimately life-saving - experiences of those who managed to escape the nazi threat . the multimedia exhibit " homeland and exile : emigration of german jews after 1933 " represents the most comprehensive look ever taken at jews who fled germany for over a hundred countries around the world .
the exhibit touches on the larger political issues of the era , but mostly it focuses on the people who were forced to turn their back on their " heimat " - a german word that encompasses both the concept of homeland and the feeling of emotional attachment to it - and their individual and collective journeys to a new life .
why did they go , where did they find refuge , and under what conditions ?
how did they build new lives for themselves , and how did they feel about their " home countries " both new and old ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young emigrants aboard the ship " martha washington , " en route to palestine the exhibit tackles these questions with commentated displays that briefly describe the widespread anti-semitism and curtailment of civil liberties that led some 280,000 of the 500,000 jews living in germany to emigrate , starting in 1933 .
-lrb- one artefact from that time on display : a children 's board game called jews out ! that involved driving out jew-shaped playing pieces from a town full of shops with names like " salomon 's money lenders . " -rrb-
from there , the story turns to the ways and means of leaving , with the show dividing thematically into rooms devoted to the stories of those who shipped off for destinations across europe , the americas , africa and asia .
on on a 3-d interactive map , museum-goers can pinpoint the 100 countries that eventually allowed jewish refugees entry .
farming in the dominican republic the curators make clear that some destinations were seen as more desirable than others .
the most sought after visa , limited in number and only available to those with an affidavit of support , was for the us .
less preferred was shanghai , which nonetheless became the last chance for escape for some 18,000 to 20,000 jews , thanks to its policy of allowing entry without a visa up to 1941 .
one of the odder histories in this section involves a plan hatched by the then-dictator of the dominican republic , rafael trujillo , to imported jewish " agricultural experts " in an effort to " whiten " his population , and give the country a needed injection of economic energy .
most of the artefacts on display are from the permanent collections of the jewish museum in berlin , where the show ran from sept . , 2006 to april , 2007 , and from other historical collections , explained cilly kugelmann , progam director of the berlin jewish museum .
" there are people who kept everything , every paper , every letter .
that generation is dying out , and they know their children wo n't take care of their things , so they donate it to historical collections , " she explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil liberties for jews were curtailed under the nazis kugelmann said her own favorite artefact is a coin purse kept by a man whose arduous journey out of germany involved going through numerous countries ; he eventually settled in portugal , but kept change in the purse from each stop along the way .
reconstructing lives from ephemera ephemera from the era -lrb- photographs , poems , diaries , ticket stubs , letters -rrb- is interspersed with objects. suitcases , clothing , coffee pots , dolls ; anything either left behind , taken along , or taken up as part of a new life in a new land .
possibly most compelling are the interactive kiosks that allow viewers to hear the emigres ' personal stories .
videotaped interviews are broken down into short , accessible segments under different categories , and english subtitles are available .
overall , kugelmann said , the exhibit tells a story of a people who did a " remarkably successful " job of adjusting to a difficult situation - even if some of the people faced depression , unhappiness , and even committed suicide .
their success as immigrants was one of the main reasons to create the exhibit , explained kugelmann .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a child 's view of its new world " many of the people who left embarked on their new lives with a certain distinctive , ironic pragmatism , " she said .
" we wondered , ' why were they relatively so successful ?
their children went on to be successful .
how did they do it ? "
a more positive view of the nazi era ?
kugelmann also implied that , more than half a century after the fact , it may be time for germany to start looking at the story of the holocaust from a new angle .
" over the past 60 years , german society has developed a relationship to the nazi period in which the mass murder has become the sole paradigm , " she said .
" the survival of almost two-thirds of german jews was simply ignored . "
and jürgen reiche , exhibitions director at the museum of contemporary history , also said he hoped the exhibit will incite young people to take a new look at germany , past and present .
" we sometimes forget that german-jewish history is also german history , " he said .
' they were robbed of a homeland " but hebrew university historian moshe zimmermann , who consulted on the exhibit , warned of the tendency to concentrate on the well-known successes among the refugees from the nazis .

on may 19 , the tally rose further after a suicide bomb killed three soldiers in kunduz , afghanistan .
the deaths of the soldiers , which brought the german fatality toll since the bundeswehr deployed to afghanistan in 2002 to a total of 21 , has not only generated hefty debate in parliament over the security of the troops in afghanistan , but on how to memorialize those who die while serving their country .
while there are little reservations about building a memorial to honor soldiers killed on duty in the country 's post-war armed forces , discussion has centered on the planned location for such a monument . bildunterschrift : a memorial service was held for the fallen soldiers on wednesday german defense minister franz josef jung , who has long harbored plans to honor the fallen soldiers , said the memorial would be erected within the ministry 's premises in berlin .
thomas raabe , spokesman for the defense ministry , said on thursday that the memorial would be located within the bendlerblock compound , the seat of germany 's defense ministry in berlin .
" there will be no changes to that , " he added .
a public memorial ?
but not everyone agrees with locating the memorial within a high-security tract not easily accessible to the general public .
the representative for the armed forces in the german parliament , reinhold robbe , said the majority of soldiers would prefer to see the monument built on a prominent site in berlin .
speaking on the television station rtl , robbe said the monument and its location needed to make clear to all who see it that the bundeswehr is a " parliament 's army . "
the recent fatalities in afghanistan have shown " just how dangerous the job of a soldier is , " and that the soldiers serve " in the name of germany , " robbe added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 3,000 german troops are stationed in afghanistan the head of the cross-party parliamentary committee for cultural affairs , hans-joachim otto , told deutsche welle it was " highly unfortunate that the defense ministry treats the matter of the memorial as its private business . "
" the bundeswehr is a conscription-based army and hence an army of the people .
bundeswehr missions are decided upon in parliament and not in the defense ministry , " he said , adding that as such a more public location would be more in keeping with the nature of germany 's armed forces .
more than a wreath depository peter steinbach , the head of berlin 's german resistance memorial site , also argued against placing the monument behind a closed-off gate at the defense ministry .
such a memorial belongs within view of the public , he said on german public radio .
otherwise , it risks becoming simply a " depository for wreaths . "
with a view to similar memorials in other countries , steinbach said , " no one would ever have suggested that the vietnam memorial in the united sites be built within the pentagon 's courtyard . "
chancellor angela merkel , who in february had suggested a more public location closer to the reichstag as a reminder to the role of parliament in deploying the armed forces , endorsed the ministry 's proposal for erecting the memorial within the bendlerblock compound .
her spokesman ulrich wilhelm said thursday she sees eye-to-eye with the defense minister and that details will be presented within due time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 25.05.2007 ladies and gentlemen , heidi klum presents hans and franz großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heidi klum quite aptly takes hans and franz to the golden globes awards german supermodel heidi klum has revealed that she calls her breasts hans and franz .
while that may be more information than most people need to know , others feel as though heidi has n't gone far enough . as two of the more obvious assets of a world famous lingerie model , hans and franz should be more or less used to the eyes of the world being trained on them .
however , despite one unexpected public appearance on the jay leno show in the us when they broke free of an 5.9 million-euro -lrb- $ 8 million -rrb- diamond-encrusted bra , heidi klum 's breasts are usually kept under wraps .
but after the german supermodel revealed her mammary monikers on thursday , worldwide attention has been more concentrated on the 35-inch bust than usual .
hans and franz have been stars of the victoria 's secrets lingerie catwalk shows and adverts for the past ten years but until heidi officially out-ed them as having names this week , they were more appreciated as just being part of the overall , highly aesthetic package .
now they are famous in the own right , people are clambering to know more and more about them .
and just like any new stars being embraced by the cult of celebrity , speculation about them is already rife on the international gossip pages .
no strangers to the limelight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans , franz and victoria 's secrets heidi herself is unique among supermodels for her openness , down-to-earth quality and sense of humor .
but , as with so many of her kind in the fashion world , she obviously believes that less is more .
while anyone who has seen her parading down a runway in the smallest of smalls will attest , this will come as no surprise .
however , in this case , the dearth is not of cloth covering her modesty but the information she is offering on hans and franz .
for one , which is which ?
does hans sit at her right hand or the left ?
also , from whom did the names originate ?
are they named after ex-partners , family relatives or friends ?
what are their likes and dislikes ?
-lrb- this last one will surely turn up in forthcoming interviews with heidi 's husband , the singer seal . -rrb-
all the 33-year-old from bergisch gladbach near cologne will say is that she gave her famous assets the stereotypically german names in homage to her homeland .
" they 've been an ongoing joke for , like , 12 years .
it started because i was from germany , and people always make fun of ze germans , yah ?
so when i began modeling i used to say , ' these are german breasts , one is called hans and one is called franz . " '
inspired by bodybuilder sketch ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did heidi name her breasts after a us comedy routine ?
from the fringe is just one of the many columns that believes there may be more to it that that .
one theory could be that the breasts are named after the characters of a sketch on us comedy show saturday night live .
comedians kevin nealon and dana carvey starred as hans and franz , two bodybuilders in the mould of arnold schwarzenegger who would appear to urge lesser men to get ' pumped ' .
the sketches would begin : " i am hans ... and i am franz ... and we are here to pump you up . "
if there is any truth in this tenuous link to heidi 's chest , it might explain why the klum version of hans and franz muscled their way out of a million-dollar bra live on american television .
however , the nealon and carvey versions were from austria which would render further investigation of this silly lead redundant .
more likely is that heidi named her breasts after famous germans , of which there have been many bearing the first names hans and franz .
being a well-known soccer fan , heidi could have paid homage to a couple of her country 's greats .
a homage to a solid pair ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz -lrb- beckenbauer , that is -rrb- is the one on the right born a year before the 1974 world cup triumph on home soil , maybe ms. klum dedicated her own solid pairing to the central defensive stalwarts of the winning team hans-georg schwarzenbeck and franz beckenbauer .
again , this is pure speculation on from the fringe 's part .
other than the origins of their names and the positioning of each , other questions arising from hans and franz 's introduction to the world include those pertaining to worth .
while casual observers may conclude that they are indeed priceless , as a model whose earnings were estimated by forbes magazine last year at 4.7 million euros , heidi will surely be looking to put a price on her now even-more-famous breasts .
she did after all insure her legs for 3.18 million euros .
what price for hans and franz , one wonders ?
and will they both be worth the same ?
a small scar on one of heidi 's legs means that one is more expensive than the other .
what imperfections , if any , could reduce the worth of either hans or franz ?
come on heidi , enquiring minds need to know ! dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de heidi klum accused of promoting anorexia in germany german media has attacked supermodel heidi klum for a new fashion reality tv show that they charged promotes eating disorders among young women .

they can laugh or be laughable at times , and you can chuckle right along .

he did n't forcefully condemn china 's human rights record , saying he would leave specific criticisms to the german government . köhler was almost euphoric as he recounted his " very good talks " with china 's leadership in beijing .
köhler managed to circumvent the minefield in which the issue of human rights had threatened to overshadow his visit , so that at the end , he was back in his element - advocating expanded cooperation with the world 's most populous country in the field of environmental and resource protection .
and , he reported , in this aspect he had found " open doors " in beijing .
köhler showed how impressed he was with china 's new generation of leaders : " they are aware of the problems and challenges of this society and its giant population number of 1.3 billion such as i have experienced from no other leadership , " said the man who had often visited china in the past in other functions .
" they are facing the problems and want to solve them , " he added .

they admitted to " mistakes and problems " that they are working on .
but they did not speak about any specific cases .
köhler said that responsibility for talking about specifics rests with the german government .
" it was right for me to present the principles , but detailed human rights issues and cases are something that the german government has to talk about -lrb- with china -rrb- , " he said .
köhler was following a precedent set by former chancellors helmut kohl and gerhard schröder , an editorial in the friday edition of the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
he spoke in abstractions and " philosophized about human rights , but lacked the words to talk about the chinese problems . "
" it was important for me to bring forward the fundamentals , " köhler said .
the tensions in the run up to his meeting amog other things because of the resolution of the german parliament that criticized the " re-education through labor camps " in china , were not further talked about .
the resolution was rejected as " intervention " by beijing .

state and party leader hu jintao was eager to tap into köhler 's experience in dealing with issues facing china , such as adequate employment for hundreds of millions of rural residents , or how to overcome the gap between the poor western regions and the wealthier coastal population .
they had talked at length , köhler said , about the rapid ageing of china 's population and the effects of this on the pensions and insurance sectors .
china 's leaders were " almost desperate " in asking how such problems might be resolved , he said .
" it was noticeable how he -lrb- hu -rrb- wanted to discuss with me in depth those problems he is itching to deal with , " köhler said .

china also hopes to see " more action " from germany in areas such as regular bilateral dialogues , and technology transfer related to environmental protection and energy efficiency , köhler said .
koehler said he was impressed with the openness of chinese leaders on environmental protection and their apparent willingness to take more action on climate change .
" it 's the first time that the chinese understand it -lrb- climate change -rrb- as an important issue in itself , " koehler said at the conclusion of his talks in the zhongnanhai compound used by leaders of china 's ruling communist party .
china seemed committed to achieving its targets for reducing carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency , but it lacked capacity and expertise , he said .
köhler said he was optimistic that china would play a " constructive role " in global efforts against climate change .
" china is aware that it is part of the problem , " he said .

he did n't forcefully condemn china 's human rights record , saying he would leave specific criticisms to the german government . köhler was almost euphoric as he recounted his " very good talks " with china 's leadership in beijing .
köhler managed to circumvent the minefield in which the issue of human rights had threatened to overshadow his visit , so that at the end , he was back in his element - advocating expanded cooperation with the world 's most populous country in the field of environmental and resource protection .
and , he reported , in this aspect he had found " open doors " in beijing .
köhler showed how impressed he was with china 's new generation of leaders : " they are aware of the problems and challenges of this society and its giant population number of 1.3 billion such as i have experienced from no other leadership , " said the man who had often visited china in the past in other functions .
" they are facing the problems and want to solve them , " he added .
leaving out details bildunterschrift : protestors bring attention to human rights abuses in china the chinese brought up the subject of human rights themselves , köhler said .
they admitted to " mistakes and problems " that they are working on .
but they did not speak about any specific cases .
köhler said that responsibility for talking about specifics rests with the german government .
" it was right for me to present the principles , but detailed human rights issues and cases are something that the german government has to talk about -lrb- with china -rrb- , " he said .
köhler was following a precedent set by former chancellors helmut kohl and gerhard schröder , an editorial in the friday edition of the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
he spoke in abstractions and " philosophized about human rights , but lacked the words to talk about the chinese problems . "
" it was important for me to bring forward the fundamentals , " köhler said .
the tensions in the run up to his meeting amog other things because of the resolution of the german parliament that criticized the " re-education through labor camps " in china , were not further talked about .
the resolution was rejected as " intervention " by beijing .
tapping köhler 's expertise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler said chinese leaders were eager for his advice the german president holds mostly ceremonial and diplomatic duties . he used to head of the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
state and party leader hu jintao was eager to tap into köhler 's experience in dealing with issues facing china , such as adequate employment for hundreds of millions of rural residents , or how to overcome the gap between the poor western regions and the wealthier coastal population .
they had talked at length , köhler said , about the rapid ageing of china 's population and the effects of this on the pensions and insurance sectors .
china 's leaders were " almost desperate " in asking how such problems might be resolved , he said .
" it was noticeable how he -lrb- hu -rrb- wanted to discuss with me in depth those problems he is itching to deal with , " köhler said .
climate change a central theme bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has serious problems with pollution china pushed for the german government to provide more investement and technology to help develop a key bilateral relationship between the two nations , köhler told reporters after meeting chinese premier wen jiabao in beijing on friday .
china also hopes to see " more action " from germany in areas such as regular bilateral dialogues , and technology transfer related to environmental protection and energy efficiency , köhler said .
koehler said he was impressed with the openness of chinese leaders on environmental protection and their apparent willingness to take more action on climate change .
" it 's the first time that the chinese understand it -lrb- climate change -rrb- as an important issue in itself , " koehler said at the conclusion of his talks in the zhongnanhai compound used by leaders of china 's ruling communist party .
china seemed committed to achieving its targets for reducing carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency , but it lacked capacity and expertise , he said .
köhler said he was optimistic that china would play a " constructive role " in global efforts against climate change .
" china is aware that it is part of the problem , " he said .
" they want to be part of the solution . "
on saturday , köhler will deliver a speech in shanghai to mark the 100th anniversary of tongji university .
he departs for germany later saturday . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german president köhler seeks balance in asia on a week-long tour of asia that includes both vietnam , where he arrived monday , and china , german president horst köhler has worked to find the delicate balance between diplomatic and economic interests .

" -lrb- sarkozy -rrb- was the first to suggest the idea of a simplified treaty , and today we see that there is a consensus forming around this idea , " barroso told reporters at a joint press conference with sarkozy . the french president also took the opportunity of his first visit to brussels since taking power on may 6 to reaffirm his opposition to turkey 's bid to join the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and barroso have differing views on turkey " i do n't see how you can be a candidate with one opinion and a president with another , " sarkozy said .
" i do n't think that turkey has a place in the union , " he concluded , but added that he did not want to dwell on the issue at present . " the question does n't arise at present and we already have enough on our plate , " sarkozy explained . barroso stressed that his european commission was " in favor of negotiations with turkey , " but concurred with sarkozy that " right now , our absolute priority is the treaty , the resolution of the institutional crisis . " constitution , mini-treaty , simplified treaty on the eu 's institutional gridlock , the french president said a european summit next month would be a success " if the 27 -lrb- eu member states -rrb- are in agreement for a simplified treaty . " in france , such a treaty could be submitted for approval by the parliament in order to avoid a repeat of the 2005 popular referenda that cut down the now moribund eu constitution . after french voters rejected the original constitution , france found itself playing an increasingly marginal role in the club of architects of the new europe .
sarkozy 's government now wants to reclaim france 's leadership in the eu , a campaign promise that had been trumpeted by both sarkozy and runner-up ségolène royal . last year , sarkozy had used the term " mini-treaty " to describe what he felt would be an acceptable constitutional framework for the eu .
the french leader said he recognized now that " mini-treaty " lacks ambition . eighteen member states have ratified the original constitution , which was deemed necessary to bring eu institutions up to date in the expanded bloc .
but any new treaty will have to revisit some controversial topics , such as references to " shared values , " which were understood by some observers as a coded exclusion of turkey from the eu club . " we must work together " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan called sarkozy to propose a get-together turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan phoned sarkozy on thursday , according to reuters .
the news agency cited " sources in erdogan 's office " who said erdogan congratulated the french leader on his victory at the polls and suggested the two should work together directly . " we must not communicate via media statements , " erdogan 's aides told reuters .
" -lrb- we must -rrb- work together with direct talks . " for his part , sarkozy offered his condolences for a bomb attack in ankara on tuesday , which killed six people and wounded dozens more in the worst bombing in the turkish capital in at least a decade . sarkozy said he wanted to work together with erdogan to overcome their common problems , the sources told reuters .
the heads of state went on to discuss cooperation between france and turkey , a nato member , on a broad range of economic , political and military issues . but on the campaign trail , sarkozy made it clear that he was staunchly opposed to turkey 's accession to the eu .
he has instead proposed a mediterranean union for turkey and its neighbors .
french secretary of state for european affairs jean-pierre jouyet has not ruled out a french veto of further entry talks . turkey began negotiating for membership with the eu in 2005 .
the talks are expected to last 10 to 15 years .
so far , turkey and the eu have successfully completed one of the 35 policy chapters required for accession . german chancellor angela merkel has also spoken out against turkey 's membership bid , preferring instead what she termed a " privileged partnership " with germany and the eu . as rotating eu president , merkel has been more cautious in her assertions vis-à-vis turkey .
and in brussels , eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn reiterated the eu 's plans to continue accession talks with turkey . " we have a sound negotiating mandate with turkey , " rehn said .
he added : " if we succeed - if turkey succeeds - turkey can become an even more important bridge of civilizations than it is today . " " strasbourg is non-negotiable " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament in strasbourg , eastern france sarkozy also rejected calls to shut down the eu parliament 's strasbourg seat . " strasbourg is non-negotiable , it is part of europe 's founding balances , " sarkozy said . european members of parliament currently commute between the two chambers in strasbourg and brussels , prompting calls from some mps to consolidate the chambers into one city to save time and resources , and to reduce carbon dioxide emissions caused by frequent travel . sarkozy is set to travel to spain next week as part of his comprehensive diplomatic drive .

" for his part , sarkozy offered his condolences for a bomb attack in ankara on tuesday , which killed six people and wounded dozens more in the worst bombing in the turkish capital in at least a decade . sarkozy said he wanted to work together with erdogan to overcome their common problems , the sources told reuters .
the heads of state went on to discuss cooperation between france and turkey , a nato member , on a broad range of economic , political and military issues . but on the campaign trail , sarkozy made it clear that he was staunchly opposed to turkey 's accession to the eu .
he has instead proposed a mediterranean union for turkey and its neighbors .
french secretary of state for european affairs jean-pierre jouyet has not ruled out a french veto of further entry talks . turkey began negotiating for membership with the eu in 2005 .
the talks are expected to last 10 to 15 years .
so far , turkey and the eu have successfully completed one of the 35 policy chapters required for accession . german chancellor angela merkel has also spoken out against turkey 's membership bid , preferring instead what she termed a " privileged partnership " with germany and the eu . as rotating eu president , merkel has been more cautious in her assertions vis-à-vis turkey .
and in brussels , eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn reiterated the eu 's plans to continue accession talks with turkey . " we have a sound negotiating mandate with turkey , " rehn said .
he added : " if we succeed - if turkey succeeds - turkey can become an even more important bridge of civilizations than it is today . " " strasbourg is non-negotiable " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament in strasbourg , eastern france sarkozy also rejected calls to shut down the eu parliament 's strasbourg seat . " strasbourg is non-negotiable , it is part of europe 's founding balances , " sarkozy said . european members of parliament currently commute between the two chambers in strasbourg and brussels , prompting calls from some mps to consolidate the chambers into one city to save time and resources , and to reduce carbon dioxide emissions caused by frequent travel . sarkozy is set to travel to spain next week as part of his comprehensive diplomatic drive .
in madrid , he is scheduled to meet with spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero . dw staff / afp -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sarkozy to make berlin first official stop after taking office after his inauguration , french president elect nicolas sarkozy wo n't have much time to savor the feeling of stepping into jacques chirac 's shoes - he 'll be busy flying to germany .

" because no child should be victimized in this horrific way , today we pledge to re-double our efforts to enforce the international fight against child pornography , " the ministers said in a joint declaration . internet poses challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet service providers seen as partners in stopping child pornography german justice minister brigitte zypries said countries had been slow to adapt to the challenges produced by the rapid development of the internet which had facilitated the distribution of child pornography .
" we have all adopted specific legislation to fight this phenomenon , but we still have to make progress in transferring international agreements in this area into our domestic laws , " zypries said .
the ministers also discussed the necessity of getting help from internet providers since the internet makes it easy for pedophiles to share child pornography .
" we need to put in place rules in every country to ensure that internet providers inform the authorities if they find images of pedophilia , " said french justice minister rachida dati .
the g8 ministers also want to encourage information technology professionals , banks , the media , parents and educators to " consider what role they could play in the fight , " according to a statement .
germany recently uncovered a child pornography ring by using credit card information . exploitation crosses borders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fight against child pornography needs to be as high tech as the perpetrators zypries used the recent case of a 4-year-old british girl who disappeared earlier this month in portugal , as an example of the need for international cooperation .
" we simply have to assume that this was done by a gang that passes on these children to be exploited , and russia as well mentioned the danger ... that such children may be abducted for adoption later on , " she said to reporters .
the g8 works with interpol to combat child pornography and helped establish the international child sexual exploitation image database , which helps police identify and rescue victims of such abuse .
the head of interpol briefed the ministers on its activities .
interpol secretary-general ronald k. noble said in an interview with reuters that the database now contains more than half a million images of children being sexually exploited and has helped secure the rescue of over 500 children worldwide .
noble showed reuters a number of database photos , which showed caucasian adult males engaged in sex acts with asian boys , activities that would be clearly illegal .
this reflects the majority of cases in which us or european males travel to countries like thailand or cambodia where they sexually exploit children , noble said in the reuters interview .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 25.05.2007 ladies and gentlemen , heidi klum presents hans and franz großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heidi klum quite aptly takes hans and franz to the golden globes awards german supermodel heidi klum has revealed that she calls her breasts hans and franz .
while that may be more information than most people need to know , others feel as though heidi has n't gone far enough . as two of the more obvious assets of a world famous lingerie model , hans and franz should be more or less used to the eyes of the world being trained on them .
however , despite one unexpected public appearance on the jay leno show in the us when they broke free of an 5.9 million-euro -lrb- $ 8 million -rrb- diamond-encrusted bra , heidi klum 's breasts are usually kept under wraps .
but after the german supermodel revealed her mammary monikers on thursday , worldwide attention has been more concentrated on the 35-inch bust than usual .
hans and franz have been stars of the victoria 's secrets lingerie catwalk shows and adverts for the past ten years but until heidi officially out-ed them as having names this week , they were more appreciated as just being part of the overall , highly aesthetic package .
now they are famous in the own right , people are clambering to know more and more about them .
and just like any new stars being embraced by the cult of celebrity , speculation about them is already rife on the international gossip pages .
no strangers to the limelight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans , franz and victoria 's secrets heidi herself is unique among supermodels for her openness , down-to-earth quality and sense of humor .
but , as with so many of her kind in the fashion world , she obviously believes that less is more .
while anyone who has seen her parading down a runway in the smallest of smalls will attest , this will come as no surprise .
however , in this case , the dearth is not of cloth covering her modesty but the information she is offering on hans and franz .
for one , which is which ?
does hans sit at her right hand or the left ?
also , from whom did the names originate ?
are they named after ex-partners , family relatives or friends ?
what are their likes and dislikes ?
-lrb- this last one will surely turn up in forthcoming interviews with heidi 's husband , the singer seal . -rrb-
all the 33-year-old from bergisch gladbach near cologne will say is that she gave her famous assets the stereotypically german names in homage to her homeland .
" they 've been an ongoing joke for , like , 12 years .
it started because i was from germany , and people always make fun of ze germans , yah ?
so when i began modeling i used to say , ' these are german breasts , one is called hans and one is called franz . " '
inspired by bodybuilder sketch ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did heidi name her breasts after a us comedy routine ?
from the fringe is just one of the many columns that believes there may be more to it that that .
one theory could be that the breasts are named after the characters of a sketch on us comedy show saturday night live .
comedians kevin nealon and dana carvey starred as hans and franz , two bodybuilders in the mould of arnold schwarzenegger who would appear to urge lesser men to get ' pumped ' .
the sketches would begin : " i am hans ... and i am franz ... and we are here to pump you up . "
if there is any truth in this tenuous link to heidi 's chest , it might explain why the klum version of hans and franz muscled their way out of a million-dollar bra live on american television .
however , the nealon and carvey versions were from austria which would render further investigation of this silly lead redundant .
more likely is that heidi named her breasts after famous germans , of which there have been many bearing the first names hans and franz .
being a well-known soccer fan , heidi could have paid homage to a couple of her country 's greats .
a homage to a solid pair ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz -lrb- beckenbauer , that is -rrb- is the one on the right born a year before the 1974 world cup triumph on home soil , maybe ms. klum dedicated her own solid pairing to the central defensive stalwarts of the winning team hans-georg schwarzenbeck and franz beckenbauer .
again , this is pure speculation on from the fringe 's part .
other than the origins of their names and the positioning of each , other questions arising from hans and franz 's introduction to the world include those pertaining to worth .
while casual observers may conclude that they are indeed priceless , as a model whose earnings were estimated by forbes magazine last year at 4.7 million euros , heidi will surely be looking to put a price on her now even-more-famous breasts .
she did after all insure her legs for 3.18 million euros .
what price for hans and franz , one wonders ?
and will they both be worth the same ?
a small scar on one of heidi 's legs means that one is more expensive than the other .
what imperfections , if any , could reduce the worth of either hans or franz ?
come on heidi , enquiring minds need to know ! dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de heidi klum accused of promoting anorexia in germany german media has attacked supermodel heidi klum for a new fashion reality tv show that they charged promotes eating disorders among young women .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 25.05.2007 opinion : reputation of competitive sports is on the line großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more professional cyclists are admitting to illegal doping .
if the sport is to change and become clean then the three-martini business lunch has to go , according to dw sports editor wolfgang von kann . this week , germany 's tabloid bild zeitung asked , " mr. ullrich , you really did n't know about this ? " but the affair has long gone beyond jan ullrich or any of the other big names .
sure , if yet another cyclist from ullrich & co. were to come out of the doping closet , it would help illuminate the situation further - but it would be essentially meaningless . that 's because today , much more is on the line than the careers of a few cyclists .
anyone who has been following recent developments in athletics , swimming , triathlon or cross-country skiing - to say nothing of weightlifting - will hardly claim that the morass of doping scandals is confined to the cycling arena . we are now talking about competitive sports in general .
this is about breaking up structures with unmistakably mafiaesque semblances .
ultimately , the reputation of all competitive sports is on the line . our unsung heroes but even that is a generalization that scratches at the surface but skirts the core of the issue .
indeed , the central question has yet to be asked : to what extent are we - consumers , viewers , fans and also the media - to blame for all of this ?
what kind of society are we living in , anyway ? it is time to examine the demands we place on our athletes .
barely 20 years old , they are expected to act as role models - a part only few come by voluntarily .
in their twenties , they are supposed to be the shining heroes who make no mistakes and scoop up all the medals at the olympic games .
and over 30 , they are meant to do everything they can to prove that age does n't matter . craving new records where do the fans of cycling races stand ?
at the top of the hill , where the riders hurt the most .
what do people want to see at track-and-field events ?
they are waiting for the world record .
and what do they want at weightlifting competitions ?
they want to see more weight loaded on the bar . the limits of athletic achievement are constantly being pushed .
at the same time , the athlete is expected to be a clean-cut do-gooder , ready to cast aside all signs of exertion and bedazzle the cameras with an eloquent post-match interview . of course , the athlete will achieve all of this on bread and water alone . how one person is supposed to be all that , nobody wants to know . people who live in glass houses ... this rigmarole is not without hypocrisy .
for what is it that we non-athletes do ?
we send our kids to school with sedatives .
we indulge in a little booze during lunch time , or even before we arrive at the office .
we can barely survive without nicotine and alcohol .
and we drink liter after liter of coffee , so that we can do it all . we are a drug nation : at the first sign of a mild cold , we immediately pour a bottle of cough medicine - which , by the way , is prohibited for athletes - down our throats , or just stay in bed griping . ultimately , competitive sports are a mirror image of our society , and is therefore no better or worse than us .

the security situation could further complicate turkey 's bid to join the european union . six turkish soldiers were killed by a roadside bomb thursday in southeast turkey near the border with iraq .
the attack on the military vehicle came two days after a suicide bomber killed a half dozen people in downtown ankara .
turkish political leaders have blamed kurdish rebels affiliated with the separatist kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk . -rrb-
twenty-six people , most of them students , have been arrested for alleged involvement in the attacks , according to media reports on friday .
the pkk is considered a terrorist organization by turkey , the eu and the united states .
the pkk has denied any involvement in the recent attacks , but turkish officials said the method of the bomb attack and the type of explosives were similar to past pkk attacks .
mending ties to eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy says turkey does n't belong in the eu the violence comes at a bad time for turkey .
the new french president nicolas sarkozy has made it clear he continues to oppose turkey 's bid to join the eu .
instead , he has proposed a mediterranean union between turkey and its neighbors .
" i do n't see how you can be a candidate with one opinion and a president with another , " he said during a press conference in brussels this week .
" i do n't think that turkey has a place in the union . " france has said it would consider vetoing turkey 's entry into the eu .
turkey began negotiations in 2005 .
turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan reportedly phoned sarkozy on thursday , in an apparent conciliatory gesture , according to reuters .
in his first call to sarkozy since his election , sources in erdogan 's office quoted the prime minister as congratulating the french president on his victory in the polls and told him that the two needed to work directly with each other , according to reuters .
" we must not communicate via media statements , " erdogan was quoted as telling sarkozy .
" -lrb- we must -rrb- work together with direct talks . "
sarkozy reportedly offered his condolences for a bomb attack in ankara on tuesday and said he wanted to work together to overcome their common problems , according to reuters .
erdogan also noted france and turkey cooperate on economic , political and military issues and that turkey is already a nato member . too soon to say if turkey belongs in eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : talks continue about turkey 's place in the eu eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn said the european commission plans to continue accession negotiations with turkey and said it was too soon to judge whether turkey belonged in the 27-member bloc .
" we have a sound negotiating mandate with turkey and the commission 's view is that we will continue the accession negotiations with turkey because it is in the interests of both the european union and turkey , " he said at a news briefing .
" if we succeed , if turkey succeeds , turkey can become an even more important bridge of civilizations than it is today , " rehn said .
" and the time to judge whether turkey has been able to meet the conditions of eu accession is in the latter stages of the accession process . "
turkey has general elections scheduled for july 22 to decide a political conflict between the islamic-leaning government and the military-backed secular establishment .
military needs to show restraint bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish special forces fire tear gas at kurdish demonstrators the recent bombings further complicate turkey 's domestic and foreign politics .
the pkk is thought to have launched the attacks from hideouts in northern iraq .
turkish army chief yasar buyukanit last month called for a military operation into iraq to quash pkk guerrillas . the united states and iraqi kurdish leaders oppose the idea .
a kurdish iraqi official recently warned that talk of such a move would signal a " dangerous escalation " of the situation .
the us has also urged turkey to show restraint , fearing a cross-border operation could disrupt efforts to stabilize war-torn iraq .
attacks blamed on rebels continued friday when a bomb derailed seven cars of a freight train in southeast turkey .
no injuries were reported .
police arrested 26 people , most of them university students belonging to the separatist kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , media reported on friday .
eight of the arrested are women who were preparing attacks , local authorities were quoted by the anatolia news agency as saying .

finance minister peer steinbrück said the move will improve germany 's standing on the global market . the german parliament on friday paved the way for the country ’ s biggest corporate tax reform in post-world war ii history , which would put its rates on par with the rest of europe .
as of jan .
1 , 2008 , corporate tax will be lowered to 30 percent from the current rate of 39 percent - the highest in the european union .
" this corporate tax reform will make germany a more attractive place for investment , " said steinbrück .
he added in an interview broadcast on public radio friday that all citizens would benefit from the reform because tax revenues would actually increase , at least in the mid-term , though critics have warned of an initial loss of around 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.7 billion -rrb- . the bill , which is expected to be approved by germany 's upper parliamentary house before the summer recess , would also prevent companies from getting tax benefits in germany by taking loans via subsidiaries abroad .
a " blessing of billions " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister steinbrueck said the reform will make germany attractive to investors criticism of the reform has come mainly from the leftist fraction , the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the greens .
chairman of the left party 's parliamentary group , oskar lafontaine , called the corporate tax bill a " blessing of billions for big business , " adding that it would be better to adjust income tax rates for small companies .
jan paul bach , the owner of a 15-employee company near berlin that produces high-tech ceramic elements , said the changes were necessary for germany to keep up in the global marketplace .
" i think the tax reform is necessary to compete with new economies like china or india , which have lower ages and a better position in the global economy , " bach told deutsche welle .
he added , however that he did n't think it was fair that " big companies pay lower taxes while the employees have to pay higher taxes . " to make up for the cuts , germany is abolishing tax holidays , which have mainly benefited multinationals .
an inheritance tax reform is also in the works , on the initiative of the social democratic party , which is part of a series of tax adjustments meant to offset the corporate tax reform . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german family-owned businesses often upstage the big guys a new study has shown that family-owned businesses in germany from 2003 to 2005 performed better than dax firms in both job creation and sales growth .

finance minister peer steinbrück said the move will improve germany 's standing on the global market . the german parliament on friday paved the way for the country ’ s biggest corporate tax reform in post-world war ii history , which would put its rates on par with the rest of europe .
as of jan .
1 , 2008 , corporate tax will be lowered to 30 percent from the current rate of 39 percent - the highest in the european union .
" this corporate tax reform will make germany a more attractive place for investment , " said steinbrück .
he added in an interview broadcast on public radio friday that all citizens would benefit from the reform because tax revenues would actually increase , at least in the mid-term , though critics have warned of an initial loss of around 5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.7 billion -rrb- . the bill , which is expected to be approved by germany 's upper parliamentary house before the summer recess , would also prevent companies from getting tax benefits in germany by taking loans via subsidiaries abroad .

jan paul bach , the owner of a 15-employee company near berlin that produces high-tech ceramic elements , said the changes were necessary for germany to keep up in the global marketplace .
" i think the tax reform is necessary to compete with new economies like china or india , which have lower ages and a better position in the global economy , " bach told deutsche welle .
he added , however that he did n't think it was fair that " big companies pay lower taxes while the employees have to pay higher taxes . " to make up for the cuts , germany is abolishing tax holidays , which have mainly benefited multinationals .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 25.05.2007 ladies and gentlemen , heidi klum presents hans and franz großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heidi klum quite aptly takes hans and franz to the golden globes awards german supermodel heidi klum has revealed that she calls her breasts hans and franz .
while that may be more information than most people need to know , others feel as though heidi has n't gone far enough . as two of the more obvious assets of a world famous lingerie model , hans and franz should be more or less used to the eyes of the world being trained on them .
however , despite one unexpected public appearance on the jay leno show in the us when they broke free of an 5.9 million-euro -lrb- $ 8 million -rrb- diamond-encrusted bra , heidi klum 's breasts are usually kept under wraps .
but after the german supermodel revealed her mammary monikers on thursday , worldwide attention has been more concentrated on the 35-inch bust than usual .
hans and franz have been stars of the victoria 's secrets lingerie catwalk shows and adverts for the past ten years but until heidi officially out-ed them as having names this week , they were more appreciated as just being part of the overall , highly aesthetic package .
now they are famous in the own right , people are clambering to know more and more about them .
and just like any new stars being embraced by the cult of celebrity , speculation about them is already rife on the international gossip pages .
no strangers to the limelight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans , franz and victoria 's secrets heidi herself is unique among supermodels for her openness , down-to-earth quality and sense of humor .
but , as with so many of her kind in the fashion world , she obviously believes that less is more .
while anyone who has seen her parading down a runway in the smallest of smalls will attest , this will come as no surprise .
however , in this case , the dearth is not of cloth covering her modesty but the information she is offering on hans and franz .
for one , which is which ?
does hans sit at her right hand or the left ?
also , from whom did the names originate ?
are they named after ex-partners , family relatives or friends ?
what are their likes and dislikes ?
-lrb- this last one will surely turn up in forthcoming interviews with heidi 's husband , the singer seal . -rrb-
all the 33-year-old from bergisch gladbach near cologne will say is that she gave her famous assets the stereotypically german names in homage to her homeland .
" they 've been an ongoing joke for , like , 12 years .
it started because i was from germany , and people always make fun of ze germans , yah ?
so when i began modeling i used to say , ' these are german breasts , one is called hans and one is called franz . " '
inspired by bodybuilder sketch ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did heidi name her breasts after a us comedy routine ?
from the fringe is just one of the many columns that believes there may be more to it that that .
one theory could be that the breasts are named after the characters of a sketch on us comedy show saturday night live .
comedians kevin nealon and dana carvey starred as hans and franz , two bodybuilders in the mould of arnold schwarzenegger who would appear to urge lesser men to get ' pumped ' .
the sketches would begin : " i am hans ... and i am franz ... and we are here to pump you up . "
if there is any truth in this tenuous link to heidi 's chest , it might explain why the klum version of hans and franz muscled their way out of a million-dollar bra live on american television .
however , the nealon and carvey versions were from austria which would render further investigation of this silly lead redundant .
more likely is that heidi named her breasts after famous germans , of which there have been many bearing the first names hans and franz .
being a well-known soccer fan , heidi could have paid homage to a couple of her country 's greats .
a homage to a solid pair ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz -lrb- beckenbauer , that is -rrb- is the one on the right born a year before the 1974 world cup triumph on home soil , maybe ms. klum dedicated her own solid pairing to the central defensive stalwarts of the winning team hans-georg schwarzenbeck and franz beckenbauer .
again , this is pure speculation on from the fringe 's part .
other than the origins of their names and the positioning of each , other questions arising from hans and franz 's introduction to the world include those pertaining to worth .
while casual observers may conclude that they are indeed priceless , as a model whose earnings were estimated by forbes magazine last year at 4.7 million euros , heidi will surely be looking to put a price on her now even-more-famous breasts .
she did after all insure her legs for 3.18 million euros .
what price for hans and franz , one wonders ?
and will they both be worth the same ?
a small scar on one of heidi 's legs means that one is more expensive than the other .
what imperfections , if any , could reduce the worth of either hans or franz ?
come on heidi , enquiring minds need to know ! dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de heidi klum accused of promoting anorexia in germany german media has attacked supermodel heidi klum for a new fashion reality tv show that they charged promotes eating disorders among young women .

-lrb- 10.03.2005 -rrb- heidi 's almost perfect legs germany 's most expensive legs probably belong to heidi klum : the supermodel revealed on friday that her limbs have been insured for millions , adding that one of them is more valuable than the other .

they can laugh or be laughable at times , and you can chuckle right along .

a new museum exhibit on german jews who fled their homeland between 1933 and 1941 examines the life-changing - and ultimately life-saving - experiences of those who managed to escape the nazi threat . the multimedia exhibit " homeland and exile : emigration of german jews after 1933 " represents the most comprehensive look ever taken at jews who fled germany for over a hundred countries around the world .
the exhibit touches on the larger political issues of the era , but mostly it focuses on the people who were forced to turn their back on their " heimat " - a german word that encompasses both the concept of homeland and the feeling of emotional attachment to it - and their individual and collective journeys to a new life .
why did they go , where did they find refuge , and under what conditions ?
how did they build new lives for themselves , and how did they feel about their " home countries " both new and old ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young emigrants aboard the ship " martha washington , " en route to palestine the exhibit tackles these questions with commentated displays that briefly describe the widespread anti-semitism and curtailment of civil liberties that led some 280,000 of the 500,000 jews living in germany to emigrate , starting in 1933 .
-lrb- one artefact from that time on display : a children 's board game called jews out ! that involved driving out jew-shaped playing pieces from a town full of shops with names like " salomon 's money lenders . " -rrb-
from there , the story turns to the ways and means of leaving , with the show dividing thematically into rooms devoted to the stories of those who shipped off for destinations across europe , the americas , africa and asia .
on on a 3-d interactive map , museum-goers can pinpoint the 100 countries that eventually allowed jewish refugees entry .
farming in the dominican republic the curators make clear that some destinations were seen as more desirable than others .
the most sought after visa , limited in number and only available to those with an affidavit of support , was for the us .
less preferred was shanghai , which nonetheless became the last chance for escape for some 18,000 to 20,000 jews , thanks to its policy of allowing entry without a visa up to 1941 .
one of the odder histories in this section involves a plan hatched by the then-dictator of the dominican republic , rafael trujillo , to imported jewish " agricultural experts " in an effort to " whiten " his population , and give the country a needed injection of economic energy .
most of the artefacts on display are from the permanent collections of the jewish museum in berlin , where the show ran from sept . , 2006 to april , 2007 , and from other historical collections , explained cilly kugelmann , progam director of the berlin jewish museum .
" there are people who kept everything , every paper , every letter .
that generation is dying out , and they know their children wo n't take care of their things , so they donate it to historical collections , " she explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil liberties for jews were curtailed under the nazis kugelmann said her own favorite artefact is a coin purse kept by a man whose arduous journey out of germany involved going through numerous countries ; he eventually settled in portugal , but kept change in the purse from each stop along the way .
reconstructing lives from ephemera ephemera from the era -lrb- photographs , poems , diaries , ticket stubs , letters -rrb- is interspersed with objects. suitcases , clothing , coffee pots , dolls ; anything either left behind , taken along , or taken up as part of a new life in a new land .
possibly most compelling are the interactive kiosks that allow viewers to hear the emigres ' personal stories .
videotaped interviews are broken down into short , accessible segments under different categories , and english subtitles are available .
overall , kugelmann said , the exhibit tells a story of a people who did a " remarkably successful " job of adjusting to a difficult situation - even if some of the people faced depression , unhappiness , and even committed suicide .
their success as immigrants was one of the main reasons to create the exhibit , explained kugelmann .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a child 's view of its new world " many of the people who left embarked on their new lives with a certain distinctive , ironic pragmatism , " she said .
" we wondered , ' why were they relatively so successful ?
their children went on to be successful .
how did they do it ? "
a more positive view of the nazi era ?
kugelmann also implied that , more than half a century after the fact , it may be time for germany to start looking at the story of the holocaust from a new angle .
" over the past 60 years , german society has developed a relationship to the nazi period in which the mass murder has become the sole paradigm , " she said .
" the survival of almost two-thirds of german jews was simply ignored . "
and jürgen reiche , exhibitions director at the museum of contemporary history , also said he hoped the exhibit will incite young people to take a new look at germany , past and present .
" we sometimes forget that german-jewish history is also german history , " he said .
' they were robbed of a homeland " but hebrew university historian moshe zimmermann , who consulted on the exhibit , warned of the tendency to concentrate on the well-known successes among the refugees from the nazis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the exhibition focuses on the exiled children " the idea is often that the emigration didn ’ t destroy many lives .
people think of thomas mann , billy wilder , henry kissinger .
and they say , ' they left germany , it was n't so tragic , " he said .
" people say , ' they could find a home elsewhere because jews are like that . ' … but if you start thinking that way , you 're starting with the wrong idea . "
as the word " heimat " in the title of the exhibit makes clear , " the émigrés were , despite everything , german , " zimmermann said .
" they were germans who were jews .
and they were robbed of their homeland . "
" there is no plural for the word heimat .

the security situation could further complicate turkey 's bid to join the european union . six turkish soldiers were killed by a roadside bomb thursday in southeast turkey near the border with iraq .
the attack on the military vehicle came two days after a suicide bomber killed a half dozen people in downtown ankara .
turkish political leaders have blamed kurdish rebels affiliated with the separatist kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk . -rrb-
twenty-six people , most of them students , have been arrested for alleged involvement in the attacks , according to media reports on friday .
the pkk is considered a terrorist organization by turkey , the eu and the united states .
the pkk has denied any involvement in the recent attacks , but turkish officials said the method of the bomb attack and the type of explosives were similar to past pkk attacks .
mending ties to eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy says turkey does n't belong in the eu the violence comes at a bad time for turkey .
the new french president nicolas sarkozy has made it clear he continues to oppose turkey 's bid to join the eu .
instead , he has proposed a mediterranean union between turkey and its neighbors .
" i do n't see how you can be a candidate with one opinion and a president with another , " he said during a press conference in brussels this week .
" i do n't think that turkey has a place in the union . " france has said it would consider vetoing turkey 's entry into the eu .
turkey began negotiations in 2005 .
turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan reportedly phoned sarkozy on thursday , in an apparent conciliatory gesture , according to reuters .
in his first call to sarkozy since his election , sources in erdogan 's office quoted the prime minister as congratulating the french president on his victory in the polls and told him that the two needed to work directly with each other , according to reuters .
" we must not communicate via media statements , " erdogan was quoted as telling sarkozy .
" -lrb- we must -rrb- work together with direct talks . "
sarkozy reportedly offered his condolences for a bomb attack in ankara on tuesday and said he wanted to work together to overcome their common problems , according to reuters .
erdogan also noted france and turkey cooperate on economic , political and military issues and that turkey is already a nato member . too soon to say if turkey belongs in eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : talks continue about turkey 's place in the eu eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn said the european commission plans to continue accession negotiations with turkey and said it was too soon to judge whether turkey belonged in the 27-member bloc .
" we have a sound negotiating mandate with turkey and the commission 's view is that we will continue the accession negotiations with turkey because it is in the interests of both the european union and turkey , " he said at a news briefing .
" if we succeed , if turkey succeeds , turkey can become an even more important bridge of civilizations than it is today , " rehn said .
" and the time to judge whether turkey has been able to meet the conditions of eu accession is in the latter stages of the accession process . "
turkey has general elections scheduled for july 22 to decide a political conflict between the islamic-leaning government and the military-backed secular establishment .

the security situation could further complicate turkey 's bid to join the european union . six turkish soldiers were killed by a roadside bomb thursday in southeast turkey near the border with iraq .
the attack on the military vehicle came two days after a suicide bomber killed a half dozen people in downtown ankara .
turkish political leaders have blamed kurdish rebels affiliated with the separatist kurdistan workers party -lrb- pkk . -rrb-
twenty-six people , most of them students , have been arrested for alleged involvement in the attacks , according to media reports on friday .
the pkk is considered a terrorist organization by turkey , the eu and the united states .
the pkk has denied any involvement in the recent attacks , but turkish officials said the method of the bomb attack and the type of explosives were similar to past pkk attacks .
mending ties to eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy says turkey does n't belong in the eu the violence comes at a bad time for turkey .
the new french president nicolas sarkozy has made it clear he continues to oppose turkey 's bid to join the eu .
instead , he has proposed a mediterranean union between turkey and its neighbors .
" i do n't see how you can be a candidate with one opinion and a president with another , " he said during a press conference in brussels this week .
" i do n't think that turkey has a place in the union . " france has said it would consider vetoing turkey 's entry into the eu .
turkey began negotiations in 2005 .
turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan reportedly phoned sarkozy on thursday , in an apparent conciliatory gesture , according to reuters .
in his first call to sarkozy since his election , sources in erdogan 's office quoted the prime minister as congratulating the french president on his victory in the polls and told him that the two needed to work directly with each other , according to reuters .
" we must not communicate via media statements , " erdogan was quoted as telling sarkozy .
" -lrb- we must -rrb- work together with direct talks . "
sarkozy reportedly offered his condolences for a bomb attack in ankara on tuesday and said he wanted to work together to overcome their common problems , according to reuters .
erdogan also noted france and turkey cooperate on economic , political and military issues and that turkey is already a nato member . too soon to say if turkey belongs in eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : talks continue about turkey 's place in the eu eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn said the european commission plans to continue accession negotiations with turkey and said it was too soon to judge whether turkey belonged in the 27-member bloc .
" we have a sound negotiating mandate with turkey and the commission 's view is that we will continue the accession negotiations with turkey because it is in the interests of both the european union and turkey , " he said at a news briefing .
" if we succeed , if turkey succeeds , turkey can become an even more important bridge of civilizations than it is today , " rehn said .
" and the time to judge whether turkey has been able to meet the conditions of eu accession is in the latter stages of the accession process . "
turkey has general elections scheduled for july 22 to decide a political conflict between the islamic-leaning government and the military-backed secular establishment .

on may 19 , the tally rose further after a suicide bomb killed three soldiers in kunduz , afghanistan .
the deaths of the soldiers , which brought the german fatality toll since the bundeswehr deployed to afghanistan in 2002 to a total of 21 , has not only generated hefty debate in parliament over the security of the troops in afghanistan , but on how to memorialize those who die while serving their country .
while there are little reservations about building a memorial to honor soldiers killed on duty in the country 's post-war armed forces , discussion has centered on the planned location for such a monument . bildunterschrift : a memorial service was held for the fallen soldiers on wednesday german defense minister franz josef jung , who has long harbored plans to honor the fallen soldiers , said the memorial would be erected within the ministry 's premises in berlin .
thomas raabe , spokesman for the defense ministry , said on thursday that the memorial would be located within the bendlerblock compound , the seat of germany 's defense ministry in berlin .
" there will be no changes to that , " he added .
a public memorial ?
but not everyone agrees with locating the memorial within a high-security tract not easily accessible to the general public .
the representative for the armed forces in the german parliament , reinhold robbe , said the majority of soldiers would prefer to see the monument built on a prominent site in berlin .
speaking on the television station rtl , robbe said the monument and its location needed to make clear to all who see it that the bundeswehr is a " parliament 's army . "
the recent fatalities in afghanistan have shown " just how dangerous the job of a soldier is , " and that the soldiers serve " in the name of germany , " robbe added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 3,000 german troops are stationed in afghanistan the head of the cross-party parliamentary committee for cultural affairs , hans-joachim otto , told deutsche welle it was " highly unfortunate that the defense ministry treats the matter of the memorial as its private business . "
" the bundeswehr is a conscription-based army and hence an army of the people .
bundeswehr missions are decided upon in parliament and not in the defense ministry , " he said , adding that as such a more public location would be more in keeping with the nature of germany 's armed forces .
more than a wreath depository peter steinbach , the head of berlin 's german resistance memorial site , also argued against placing the monument behind a closed-off gate at the defense ministry .
such a memorial belongs within view of the public , he said on german public radio .
otherwise , it risks becoming simply a " depository for wreaths . "
with a view to similar memorials in other countries , steinbach said , " no one would ever have suggested that the vietnam memorial in the united sites be built within the pentagon 's courtyard . "
chancellor angela merkel , who in february had suggested a more public location closer to the reichstag as a reminder to the role of parliament in deploying the armed forces , endorsed the ministry 's proposal for erecting the memorial within the bendlerblock compound .
her spokesman ulrich wilhelm said thursday she sees eye-to-eye with the defense minister and that details will be presented within due time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 25.05.2007 ladies and gentlemen , heidi klum presents hans and franz großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heidi klum quite aptly takes hans and franz to the golden globes awards german supermodel heidi klum has revealed that she calls her breasts hans and franz .
while that may be more information than most people need to know , others feel as though heidi has n't gone far enough . as two of the more obvious assets of a world famous lingerie model , hans and franz should be more or less used to the eyes of the world being trained on them .
however , despite one unexpected public appearance on the jay leno show in the us when they broke free of an 5.9 million-euro -lrb- $ 8 million -rrb- diamond-encrusted bra , heidi klum 's breasts are usually kept under wraps .
but after the german supermodel revealed her mammary monikers on thursday , worldwide attention has been more concentrated on the 35-inch bust than usual .
hans and franz have been stars of the victoria 's secrets lingerie catwalk shows and adverts for the past ten years but until heidi officially out-ed them as having names this week , they were more appreciated as just being part of the overall , highly aesthetic package .
now they are famous in the own right , people are clambering to know more and more about them .
and just like any new stars being embraced by the cult of celebrity , speculation about them is already rife on the international gossip pages .
no strangers to the limelight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans , franz and victoria 's secrets heidi herself is unique among supermodels for her openness , down-to-earth quality and sense of humor .
but , as with so many of her kind in the fashion world , she obviously believes that less is more .
while anyone who has seen her parading down a runway in the smallest of smalls will attest , this will come as no surprise .
however , in this case , the dearth is not of cloth covering her modesty but the information she is offering on hans and franz .
for one , which is which ?
does hans sit at her right hand or the left ?
also , from whom did the names originate ?
are they named after ex-partners , family relatives or friends ?
what are their likes and dislikes ?
-lrb- this last one will surely turn up in forthcoming interviews with heidi 's husband , the singer seal . -rrb-
all the 33-year-old from bergisch gladbach near cologne will say is that she gave her famous assets the stereotypically german names in homage to her homeland .
" they 've been an ongoing joke for , like , 12 years .
it started because i was from germany , and people always make fun of ze germans , yah ?
so when i began modeling i used to say , ' these are german breasts , one is called hans and one is called franz . " '
inspired by bodybuilder sketch ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did heidi name her breasts after a us comedy routine ?
from the fringe is just one of the many columns that believes there may be more to it that that .
one theory could be that the breasts are named after the characters of a sketch on us comedy show saturday night live .
comedians kevin nealon and dana carvey starred as hans and franz , two bodybuilders in the mould of arnold schwarzenegger who would appear to urge lesser men to get ' pumped ' .
the sketches would begin : " i am hans ... and i am franz ... and we are here to pump you up . "
if there is any truth in this tenuous link to heidi 's chest , it might explain why the klum version of hans and franz muscled their way out of a million-dollar bra live on american television .
however , the nealon and carvey versions were from austria which would render further investigation of this silly lead redundant .
more likely is that heidi named her breasts after famous germans , of which there have been many bearing the first names hans and franz .
being a well-known soccer fan , heidi could have paid homage to a couple of her country 's greats .
a homage to a solid pair ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz -lrb- beckenbauer , that is -rrb- is the one on the right born a year before the 1974 world cup triumph on home soil , maybe ms. klum dedicated her own solid pairing to the central defensive stalwarts of the winning team hans-georg schwarzenbeck and franz beckenbauer .
again , this is pure speculation on from the fringe 's part .
other than the origins of their names and the positioning of each , other questions arising from hans and franz 's introduction to the world include those pertaining to worth .
while casual observers may conclude that they are indeed priceless , as a model whose earnings were estimated by forbes magazine last year at 4.7 million euros , heidi will surely be looking to put a price on her now even-more-famous breasts .
she did after all insure her legs for 3.18 million euros .
what price for hans and franz , one wonders ?
and will they both be worth the same ?
a small scar on one of heidi 's legs means that one is more expensive than the other .
what imperfections , if any , could reduce the worth of either hans or franz ?
come on heidi , enquiring minds need to know ! dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de heidi klum accused of promoting anorexia in germany german media has attacked supermodel heidi klum for a new fashion reality tv show that they charged promotes eating disorders among young women .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 25.05.2007 ladies and gentlemen , heidi klum presents hans and franz großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heidi klum quite aptly takes hans and franz to the golden globes awards german supermodel heidi klum has revealed that she calls her breasts hans and franz .
while that may be more information than most people need to know , others feel as though heidi has n't gone far enough . as two of the more obvious assets of a world famous lingerie model , hans and franz should be more or less used to the eyes of the world being trained on them .
however , despite one unexpected public appearance on the jay leno show in the us when they broke free of an 5.9 million-euro -lrb- $ 8 million -rrb- diamond-encrusted bra , heidi klum 's breasts are usually kept under wraps .
but after the german supermodel revealed her mammary monikers on thursday , worldwide attention has been more concentrated on the 35-inch bust than usual .
hans and franz have been stars of the victoria 's secrets lingerie catwalk shows and adverts for the past ten years but until heidi officially out-ed them as having names this week , they were more appreciated as just being part of the overall , highly aesthetic package .
now they are famous in the own right , people are clambering to know more and more about them .
and just like any new stars being embraced by the cult of celebrity , speculation about them is already rife on the international gossip pages .
no strangers to the limelight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans , franz and victoria 's secrets heidi herself is unique among supermodels for her openness , down-to-earth quality and sense of humor .
but , as with so many of her kind in the fashion world , she obviously believes that less is more .
while anyone who has seen her parading down a runway in the smallest of smalls will attest , this will come as no surprise .
however , in this case , the dearth is not of cloth covering her modesty but the information she is offering on hans and franz .
for one , which is which ?
does hans sit at her right hand or the left ?
also , from whom did the names originate ?
are they named after ex-partners , family relatives or friends ?
what are their likes and dislikes ?
-lrb- this last one will surely turn up in forthcoming interviews with heidi 's husband , the singer seal . -rrb-
all the 33-year-old from bergisch gladbach near cologne will say is that she gave her famous assets the stereotypically german names in homage to her homeland .
" they 've been an ongoing joke for , like , 12 years .
it started because i was from germany , and people always make fun of ze germans , yah ?
so when i began modeling i used to say , ' these are german breasts , one is called hans and one is called franz . " '
inspired by bodybuilder sketch ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did heidi name her breasts after a us comedy routine ?
from the fringe is just one of the many columns that believes there may be more to it that that .
one theory could be that the breasts are named after the characters of a sketch on us comedy show saturday night live .
comedians kevin nealon and dana carvey starred as hans and franz , two bodybuilders in the mould of arnold schwarzenegger who would appear to urge lesser men to get ' pumped ' .
the sketches would begin : " i am hans ... and i am franz ... and we are here to pump you up . "
if there is any truth in this tenuous link to heidi 's chest , it might explain why the klum version of hans and franz muscled their way out of a million-dollar bra live on american television .
however , the nealon and carvey versions were from austria which would render further investigation of this silly lead redundant .
more likely is that heidi named her breasts after famous germans , of which there have been many bearing the first names hans and franz .
being a well-known soccer fan , heidi could have paid homage to a couple of her country 's greats .
a homage to a solid pair ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz -lrb- beckenbauer , that is -rrb- is the one on the right born a year before the 1974 world cup triumph on home soil , maybe ms. klum dedicated her own solid pairing to the central defensive stalwarts of the winning team hans-georg schwarzenbeck and franz beckenbauer .
again , this is pure speculation on from the fringe 's part .
other than the origins of their names and the positioning of each , other questions arising from hans and franz 's introduction to the world include those pertaining to worth .
while casual observers may conclude that they are indeed priceless , as a model whose earnings were estimated by forbes magazine last year at 4.7 million euros , heidi will surely be looking to put a price on her now even-more-famous breasts .
she did after all insure her legs for 3.18 million euros .
what price for hans and franz , one wonders ?
and will they both be worth the same ?
a small scar on one of heidi 's legs means that one is more expensive than the other .
what imperfections , if any , could reduce the worth of either hans or franz ?
come on heidi , enquiring minds need to know ! dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de heidi klum accused of promoting anorexia in germany german media has attacked supermodel heidi klum for a new fashion reality tv show that they charged promotes eating disorders among young women .
-lrb- 01.02.2006 -rrb- heidi 's guide to happiness german model heidi klum is a proper industry : in addition to modelling , designing sandals , advertising for mcdonald 's and hosting her own tv show , klum has added author to her credits with a book on finding happiness .
-lrb- 10.03.2005 -rrb- heidi 's almost perfect legs germany 's most expensive legs probably belong to heidi klum : the supermodel revealed on friday that her limbs have been insured for millions , adding that one of them is more valuable than the other .
-lrb- 01.10.2004 -rrb- the best of " from the fringe " germans might have a reputation of being a little grim and glum , but they 're not all sourpusses .
they can laugh or be laughable at times , and you can chuckle right along .

he did n't forcefully condemn china 's human rights record , saying he would leave specific criticisms to the german government . köhler was almost euphoric as he recounted his " very good talks " with china 's leadership in beijing .
köhler managed to circumvent the minefield in which the issue of human rights had threatened to overshadow his visit , so that at the end , he was back in his element - advocating expanded cooperation with the world 's most populous country in the field of environmental and resource protection .
and , he reported , in this aspect he had found " open doors " in beijing .
köhler showed how impressed he was with china 's new generation of leaders : " they are aware of the problems and challenges of this society and its giant population number of 1.3 billion such as i have experienced from no other leadership , " said the man who had often visited china in the past in other functions .
" they are facing the problems and want to solve them , " he added .
leaving out details bildunterschrift : protestors bring attention to human rights abuses in china the chinese brought up the subject of human rights themselves , köhler said .
they admitted to " mistakes and problems " that they are working on .
but they did not speak about any specific cases .
köhler said that responsibility for talking about specifics rests with the german government .
" it was right for me to present the principles , but detailed human rights issues and cases are something that the german government has to talk about -lrb- with china -rrb- , " he said .
köhler was following a precedent set by former chancellors helmut kohl and gerhard schröder , an editorial in the friday edition of the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
he spoke in abstractions and " philosophized about human rights , but lacked the words to talk about the chinese problems . "
" it was important for me to bring forward the fundamentals , " köhler said .
the tensions in the run up to his meeting amog other things because of the resolution of the german parliament that criticized the " re-education through labor camps " in china , were not further talked about .
the resolution was rejected as " intervention " by beijing .

state and party leader hu jintao was eager to tap into köhler 's experience in dealing with issues facing china , such as adequate employment for hundreds of millions of rural residents , or how to overcome the gap between the poor western regions and the wealthier coastal population .
they had talked at length , köhler said , about the rapid ageing of china 's population and the effects of this on the pensions and insurance sectors .
china 's leaders were " almost desperate " in asking how such problems might be resolved , he said .
" it was noticeable how he -lrb- hu -rrb- wanted to discuss with me in depth those problems he is itching to deal with , " köhler said .

china also hopes to see " more action " from germany in areas such as regular bilateral dialogues , and technology transfer related to environmental protection and energy efficiency , köhler said .
koehler said he was impressed with the openness of chinese leaders on environmental protection and their apparent willingness to take more action on climate change .
" it 's the first time that the chinese understand it -lrb- climate change -rrb- as an important issue in itself , " koehler said at the conclusion of his talks in the zhongnanhai compound used by leaders of china 's ruling communist party .
china seemed committed to achieving its targets for reducing carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency , but it lacked capacity and expertise , he said .
köhler said he was optimistic that china would play a " constructive role " in global efforts against climate change .
" china is aware that it is part of the problem , " he said .

on may 19 , the tally rose further after a suicide bomb killed three soldiers in kunduz , afghanistan .
the deaths of the soldiers , which brought the german fatality toll since the bundeswehr deployed to afghanistan in 2002 to a total of 21 , has not only generated hefty debate in parliament over the security of the troops in afghanistan , but on how to memorialize those who die while serving their country .
while there are little reservations about building a memorial to honor soldiers killed on duty in the country 's post-war armed forces , discussion has centered on the planned location for such a monument . bildunterschrift : a memorial service was held for the fallen soldiers on wednesday german defense minister franz josef jung , who has long harbored plans to honor the fallen soldiers , said the memorial would be erected within the ministry 's premises in berlin .
thomas raabe , spokesman for the defense ministry , said on thursday that the memorial would be located within the bendlerblock compound , the seat of germany 's defense ministry in berlin .
" there will be no changes to that , " he added .
a public memorial ?
but not everyone agrees with locating the memorial within a high-security tract not easily accessible to the general public .
the representative for the armed forces in the german parliament , reinhold robbe , said the majority of soldiers would prefer to see the monument built on a prominent site in berlin .
speaking on the television station rtl , robbe said the monument and its location needed to make clear to all who see it that the bundeswehr is a " parliament 's army . "
the recent fatalities in afghanistan have shown " just how dangerous the job of a soldier is , " and that the soldiers serve " in the name of germany , " robbe added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 3,000 german troops are stationed in afghanistan the head of the cross-party parliamentary committee for cultural affairs , hans-joachim otto , told deutsche welle it was " highly unfortunate that the defense ministry treats the matter of the memorial as its private business . "
" the bundeswehr is a conscription-based army and hence an army of the people .
bundeswehr missions are decided upon in parliament and not in the defense ministry , " he said , adding that as such a more public location would be more in keeping with the nature of germany 's armed forces .
more than a wreath depository peter steinbach , the head of berlin 's german resistance memorial site , also argued against placing the monument behind a closed-off gate at the defense ministry .
such a memorial belongs within view of the public , he said on german public radio .
otherwise , it risks becoming simply a " depository for wreaths . "
with a view to similar memorials in other countries , steinbach said , " no one would ever have suggested that the vietnam memorial in the united sites be built within the pentagon 's courtyard . "
chancellor angela merkel , who in february had suggested a more public location closer to the reichstag as a reminder to the role of parliament in deploying the armed forces , endorsed the ministry 's proposal for erecting the memorial within the bendlerblock compound .
her spokesman ulrich wilhelm said thursday she sees eye-to-eye with the defense minister and that details will be presented within due time .

" because no child should be victimized in this horrific way , today we pledge to re-double our efforts to enforce the international fight against child pornography , " the ministers said in a joint declaration . internet poses challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : internet service providers seen as partners in stopping child pornography german justice minister brigitte zypries said countries had been slow to adapt to the challenges produced by the rapid development of the internet which had facilitated the distribution of child pornography .
" we have all adopted specific legislation to fight this phenomenon , but we still have to make progress in transferring international agreements in this area into our domestic laws , " zypries said .
the ministers also discussed the necessity of getting help from internet providers since the internet makes it easy for pedophiles to share child pornography .
" we need to put in place rules in every country to ensure that internet providers inform the authorities if they find images of pedophilia , " said french justice minister rachida dati .
the g8 ministers also want to encourage information technology professionals , banks , the media , parents and educators to " consider what role they could play in the fight , " according to a statement .
germany recently uncovered a child pornography ring by using credit card information . exploitation crosses borders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fight against child pornography needs to be as high tech as the perpetrators zypries used the recent case of a 4-year-old british girl who disappeared earlier this month in portugal , as an example of the need for international cooperation .
" we simply have to assume that this was done by a gang that passes on these children to be exploited , and russia as well mentioned the danger ... that such children may be abducted for adoption later on , " she said to reporters .
the g8 works with interpol to combat child pornography and helped establish the international child sexual exploitation image database , which helps police identify and rescue victims of such abuse .
the head of interpol briefed the ministers on its activities .
interpol secretary-general ronald k. noble said in an interview with reuters that the database now contains more than half a million images of children being sexually exploited and has helped secure the rescue of over 500 children worldwide .
noble showed reuters a number of database photos , which showed caucasian adult males engaged in sex acts with asian boys , activities that would be clearly illegal .
this reflects the majority of cases in which us or european males travel to countries like thailand or cambodia where they sexually exploit children , noble said in the reuters interview .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 25.05.2007 opinion : reputation of competitive sports is on the line großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more professional cyclists are admitting to illegal doping .
if the sport is to change and become clean then the three-martini business lunch has to go , according to dw sports editor wolfgang von kann . this week , germany 's tabloid bild zeitung asked , " mr. ullrich , you really did n't know about this ? " but the affair has long gone beyond jan ullrich or any of the other big names .
sure , if yet another cyclist from ullrich & co. were to come out of the doping closet , it would help illuminate the situation further - but it would be essentially meaningless . that 's because today , much more is on the line than the careers of a few cyclists .
anyone who has been following recent developments in athletics , swimming , triathlon or cross-country skiing - to say nothing of weightlifting - will hardly claim that the morass of doping scandals is confined to the cycling arena . we are now talking about competitive sports in general .
this is about breaking up structures with unmistakably mafiaesque semblances .
ultimately , the reputation of all competitive sports is on the line . our unsung heroes but even that is a generalization that scratches at the surface but skirts the core of the issue .
indeed , the central question has yet to be asked : to what extent are we - consumers , viewers , fans and also the media - to blame for all of this ?
what kind of society are we living in , anyway ? it is time to examine the demands we place on our athletes .
barely 20 years old , they are expected to act as role models - a part only few come by voluntarily .
in their twenties , they are supposed to be the shining heroes who make no mistakes and scoop up all the medals at the olympic games .
and over 30 , they are meant to do everything they can to prove that age does n't matter . craving new records where do the fans of cycling races stand ?
at the top of the hill , where the riders hurt the most .
what do people want to see at track-and-field events ?
they are waiting for the world record .
and what do they want at weightlifting competitions ?
they want to see more weight loaded on the bar . the limits of athletic achievement are constantly being pushed .
at the same time , the athlete is expected to be a clean-cut do-gooder , ready to cast aside all signs of exertion and bedazzle the cameras with an eloquent post-match interview . of course , the athlete will achieve all of this on bread and water alone . how one person is supposed to be all that , nobody wants to know . people who live in glass houses ... this rigmarole is not without hypocrisy .
for what is it that we non-athletes do ?
we send our kids to school with sedatives .
we indulge in a little booze during lunch time , or even before we arrive at the office .
we can barely survive without nicotine and alcohol .
and we drink liter after liter of coffee , so that we can do it all . we are a drug nation : at the first sign of a mild cold , we immediately pour a bottle of cough medicine - which , by the way , is prohibited for athletes - down our throats , or just stay in bed griping . ultimately , competitive sports are a mirror image of our society , and is therefore no better or worse than us .
if the sport is to change and become clean , then society has to change .
we have to change . wolfgang von kann is deutsche welle 's sports editor . wolfgang von kann -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " mass doping is now the order of the day " peter danckert , chairman of the parliamentary committee on sports , spoke with dw-world.de about the recent slough of doping confessions , germany 's new anti-doping law and what the sport world can do better .

protesters will be able to march through several country lanes but will not be allowed into the resort or closer than 200 meters -lrb- about 650 feet -rrb- to the barbed-wire-topped fence when leaders of eight main nations meet june 6-8 .
police search mail boxes anti-globalization groups have described a widening police probe into a spate of anti-g8 petrol bombings in hamburg and berlin as excessive .
the postal company , deutsche post , confirmed officers looked through mail from tuesday to thursday at a hamburg sorting center .
police also accompanied a postman who was clearing city letter-boxes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the green party set up paper version of g8 leaders this week to protest the summit " these were interceptions with judicial permission after letters claiming responsibility turned up , " said branch director detlef kreutzer .
there have been more than a dozen night-time attacks on cars and homes with petrol bombs in recent months in hamburg , but no arrests .
no one has been injured .
on may 9 , riots broke out in hamburg after police raids on a leftist center in the city .
the arson attacks have continued to damage property .
claims of responsibility sent to media have criticized both the g8 and german industry .
criticism for crack-down german police have faced criticism from the media for not catching any of the radicals , as well as criticism from anti-globalization activists that the hunt for a few has led to treating the whole movement as suspects .
mainstream aid and environmentalist groups said this week that the main rally in the nearby city of rostock before the summit would be peaceful .
monty schädel , a coordinator in rostock of the protests , welcomed the schwerin court ruling , saying it was a rebuke to police .

while that may be more information than most people need to know , others feel as though heidi has n't gone far enough . as two of the more obvious assets of a world famous lingerie model , hans and franz should be more or less used to the eyes of the world being trained on them .
however , despite one unexpected public appearance on the jay leno show in the us when they broke free of an 5.9 million-euro -lrb- $ 8 million -rrb- diamond-encrusted bra , heidi klum 's breasts are usually kept under wraps .
but after the german supermodel revealed her mammary monikers on thursday , worldwide attention has been more concentrated on the 35-inch bust than usual .
hans and franz have been stars of the victoria 's secrets lingerie catwalk shows and adverts for the past ten years but until heidi officially out-ed them as having names this week , they were more appreciated as just being part of the overall , highly aesthetic package .
now they are famous in the own right , people are clambering to know more and more about them .
and just like any new stars being embraced by the cult of celebrity , speculation about them is already rife on the international gossip pages .
no strangers to the limelight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans , franz and victoria 's secrets heidi herself is unique among supermodels for her openness , down-to-earth quality and sense of humor .
but , as with so many of her kind in the fashion world , she obviously believes that less is more .
while anyone who has seen her parading down a runway in the smallest of smalls will attest , this will come as no surprise .
however , in this case , the dearth is not of cloth covering her modesty but the information she is offering on hans and franz .
for one , which is which ?
does hans sit at her right hand or the left ?
also , from whom did the names originate ?
are they named after ex-partners , family relatives or friends ?
what are their likes and dislikes ?
-lrb- this last one will surely turn up in forthcoming interviews with heidi 's husband , the singer seal . -rrb-
all the 33-year-old from bergisch gladbach near cologne will say is that she gave her famous assets the stereotypically german names in homage to her homeland .
" they 've been an ongoing joke for , like , 12 years .
it started because i was from germany , and people always make fun of ze germans , yah ?
so when i began modeling i used to say , ' these are german breasts , one is called hans and one is called franz . " '
inspired by bodybuilder sketch ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did heidi name her breasts after a us comedy routine ?
from the fringe is just one of the many columns that believes there may be more to it that that .
one theory could be that the breasts are named after the characters of a sketch on us comedy show saturday night live .
comedians kevin nealon and dana carvey starred as hans and franz , two bodybuilders in the mould of arnold schwarzenegger who would appear to urge lesser men to get ' pumped ' .
the sketches would begin : " i am hans ... and i am franz ... and we are here to pump you up . "
if there is any truth in this tenuous link to heidi 's chest , it might explain why the klum version of hans and franz muscled their way out of a million-dollar bra live on american television .
however , the nealon and carvey versions were from austria which would render further investigation of this silly lead redundant .
more likely is that heidi named her breasts after famous germans , of which there have been many bearing the first names hans and franz .
being a well-known soccer fan , heidi could have paid homage to a couple of her country 's greats .
a homage to a solid pair ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz -lrb- beckenbauer , that is -rrb- is the one on the right born a year before the 1974 world cup triumph on home soil , maybe ms. klum dedicated her own solid pairing to the central defensive stalwarts of the winning team hans-georg schwarzenbeck and franz beckenbauer .
again , this is pure speculation on from the fringe 's part .
other than the origins of their names and the positioning of each , other questions arising from hans and franz 's introduction to the world include those pertaining to worth .
while casual observers may conclude that they are indeed priceless , as a model whose earnings were estimated by forbes magazine last year at 4.7 million euros , heidi will surely be looking to put a price on her now even-more-famous breasts .
she did after all insure her legs for 3.18 million euros .
what price for hans and franz , one wonders ?
and will they both be worth the same ?
a small scar on one of heidi 's legs means that one is more expensive than the other .
what imperfections , if any , could reduce the worth of either hans or franz ?

fifty-two artists - roughly half of them german born and the other living and working here - will be showing their work at the show which being jointly organized by the kunstverein hannover , the kestnergesellschaft and the sprengel museum .
martin engler , curator at the hanover kunstverein , stressed that most of the 80 works do not relate to the theme of germany , but show a rich diversity .

" of course , in the art world there is always a degree of competition for funding and attention , but documenta exhibits artists from around the world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de third reich -pipe- 25.05.2007 exhibit examines divergent fates of german-jewish exiles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new york was the dream destination of many german-jewish emigres .
a new museum exhibit on german jews who fled their homeland between 1933 and 1941 examines the life-changing - and ultimately life-saving - experiences of those who managed to escape the nazi threat . the multimedia exhibit " homeland and exile : emigration of german jews after 1933 " represents the most comprehensive look ever taken at jews who fled germany for over a hundred countries around the world .
the exhibit touches on the larger political issues of the era , but mostly it focuses on the people who were forced to turn their back on their " heimat " - a german word that encompasses both the concept of homeland and the feeling of emotional attachment to it - and their individual and collective journeys to a new life .
why did they go , where did they find refuge , and under what conditions ?
how did they build new lives for themselves , and how did they feel about their " home countries " both new and old ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young emigrants aboard the ship " martha washington , " en route to palestine the exhibit tackles these questions with commentated displays that briefly describe the widespread anti-semitism and curtailment of civil liberties that led some 280,000 of the 500,000 jews living in germany to emigrate , starting in 1933 .
-lrb- one artefact from that time on display : a children 's board game called jews out ! that involved driving out jew-shaped playing pieces from a town full of shops with names like " salomon 's money lenders . " -rrb-
from there , the story turns to the ways and means of leaving , with the show dividing thematically into rooms devoted to the stories of those who shipped off for destinations across europe , the americas , africa and asia .
on on a 3-d interactive map , museum-goers can pinpoint the 100 countries that eventually allowed jewish refugees entry .
farming in the dominican republic the curators make clear that some destinations were seen as more desirable than others .
the most sought after visa , limited in number and only available to those with an affidavit of support , was for the us .
less preferred was shanghai , which nonetheless became the last chance for escape for some 18,000 to 20,000 jews , thanks to its policy of allowing entry without a visa up to 1941 .
one of the odder histories in this section involves a plan hatched by the then-dictator of the dominican republic , rafael trujillo , to imported jewish " agricultural experts " in an effort to " whiten " his population , and give the country a needed injection of economic energy .
most of the artefacts on display are from the permanent collections of the jewish museum in berlin , where the show ran from sept . , 2006 to april , 2007 , and from other historical collections , explained cilly kugelmann , progam director of the berlin jewish museum .
" there are people who kept everything , every paper , every letter .
that generation is dying out , and they know their children wo n't take care of their things , so they donate it to historical collections , " she explained .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : civil liberties for jews were curtailed under the nazis kugelmann said her own favorite artefact is a coin purse kept by a man whose arduous journey out of germany involved going through numerous countries ; he eventually settled in portugal , but kept change in the purse from each stop along the way .
reconstructing lives from ephemera ephemera from the era -lrb- photographs , poems , diaries , ticket stubs , letters -rrb- is interspersed with objects. suitcases , clothing , coffee pots , dolls ; anything either left behind , taken along , or taken up as part of a new life in a new land .
possibly most compelling are the interactive kiosks that allow viewers to hear the emigres ' personal stories .
videotaped interviews are broken down into short , accessible segments under different categories , and english subtitles are available .
overall , kugelmann said , the exhibit tells a story of a people who did a " remarkably successful " job of adjusting to a difficult situation - even if some of the people faced depression , unhappiness , and even committed suicide .
their success as immigrants was one of the main reasons to create the exhibit , explained kugelmann .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a child 's view of its new world " many of the people who left embarked on their new lives with a certain distinctive , ironic pragmatism , " she said .
" we wondered , ' why were they relatively so successful ?
their children went on to be successful .
how did they do it ? "
a more positive view of the nazi era ?
kugelmann also implied that , more than half a century after the fact , it may be time for germany to start looking at the story of the holocaust from a new angle .
" over the past 60 years , german society has developed a relationship to the nazi period in which the mass murder has become the sole paradigm , " she said .
" the survival of almost two-thirds of german jews was simply ignored . "
and jürgen reiche , exhibitions director at the museum of contemporary history , also said he hoped the exhibit will incite young people to take a new look at germany , past and present .
" we sometimes forget that german-jewish history is also german history , " he said .
' they were robbed of a homeland " but hebrew university historian moshe zimmermann , who consulted on the exhibit , warned of the tendency to concentrate on the well-known successes among the refugees from the nazis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much of the exhibition focuses on the exiled children " the idea is often that the emigration didn ’ t destroy many lives .
people think of thomas mann , billy wilder , henry kissinger .
and they say , ' they left germany , it was n't so tragic , " he said .
" people say , ' they could find a home elsewhere because jews are like that . ' … but if you start thinking that way , you 're starting with the wrong idea . "
as the word " heimat " in the title of the exhibit makes clear , " the émigrés were , despite everything , german , " zimmermann said .
" they were germans who were jews .

fifty-two artists - roughly half of them german born and the other living and working here - will be showing their work at the show which being jointly organized by the kunstverein hannover , the kestnergesellschaft and the sprengel museum .
martin engler , curator at the hanover kunstverein , stressed that most of the 80 works do not relate to the theme of germany , but show a rich diversity .

" of course , in the art world there is always a degree of competition for funding and attention , but documenta exhibits artists from around the world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 25.05.2007 ladies and gentlemen , heidi klum presents hans and franz großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heidi klum quite aptly takes hans and franz to the golden globes awards german supermodel heidi klum has revealed that she calls her breasts hans and franz .
while that may be more information than most people need to know , others feel as though heidi has n't gone far enough . as two of the more obvious assets of a world famous lingerie model , hans and franz should be more or less used to the eyes of the world being trained on them .
however , despite one unexpected public appearance on the jay leno show in the us when they broke free of an 5.9 million-euro -lrb- $ 8 million -rrb- diamond-encrusted bra , heidi klum 's breasts are usually kept under wraps .
but after the german supermodel revealed her mammary monikers on thursday , worldwide attention has been more concentrated on the 35-inch bust than usual .
hans and franz have been stars of the victoria 's secrets lingerie catwalk shows and adverts for the past ten years but until heidi officially out-ed them as having names this week , they were more appreciated as just being part of the overall , highly aesthetic package .
now they are famous in the own right , people are clambering to know more and more about them .
and just like any new stars being embraced by the cult of celebrity , speculation about them is already rife on the international gossip pages .
no strangers to the limelight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans , franz and victoria 's secrets heidi herself is unique among supermodels for her openness , down-to-earth quality and sense of humor .
but , as with so many of her kind in the fashion world , she obviously believes that less is more .
while anyone who has seen her parading down a runway in the smallest of smalls will attest , this will come as no surprise .
however , in this case , the dearth is not of cloth covering her modesty but the information she is offering on hans and franz .
for one , which is which ?
does hans sit at her right hand or the left ?
also , from whom did the names originate ?
are they named after ex-partners , family relatives or friends ?
what are their likes and dislikes ?
-lrb- this last one will surely turn up in forthcoming interviews with heidi 's husband , the singer seal . -rrb-
all the 33-year-old from bergisch gladbach near cologne will say is that she gave her famous assets the stereotypically german names in homage to her homeland .
" they 've been an ongoing joke for , like , 12 years .
it started because i was from germany , and people always make fun of ze germans , yah ?
so when i began modeling i used to say , ' these are german breasts , one is called hans and one is called franz . " '
inspired by bodybuilder sketch ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did heidi name her breasts after a us comedy routine ?
from the fringe is just one of the many columns that believes there may be more to it that that .
one theory could be that the breasts are named after the characters of a sketch on us comedy show saturday night live .
comedians kevin nealon and dana carvey starred as hans and franz , two bodybuilders in the mould of arnold schwarzenegger who would appear to urge lesser men to get ' pumped ' .
the sketches would begin : " i am hans ... and i am franz ... and we are here to pump you up . "
if there is any truth in this tenuous link to heidi 's chest , it might explain why the klum version of hans and franz muscled their way out of a million-dollar bra live on american television .
however , the nealon and carvey versions were from austria which would render further investigation of this silly lead redundant .
more likely is that heidi named her breasts after famous germans , of which there have been many bearing the first names hans and franz .
being a well-known soccer fan , heidi could have paid homage to a couple of her country 's greats .
a homage to a solid pair ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz -lrb- beckenbauer , that is -rrb- is the one on the right born a year before the 1974 world cup triumph on home soil , maybe ms. klum dedicated her own solid pairing to the central defensive stalwarts of the winning team hans-georg schwarzenbeck and franz beckenbauer .
again , this is pure speculation on from the fringe 's part .
other than the origins of their names and the positioning of each , other questions arising from hans and franz 's introduction to the world include those pertaining to worth .
while casual observers may conclude that they are indeed priceless , as a model whose earnings were estimated by forbes magazine last year at 4.7 million euros , heidi will surely be looking to put a price on her now even-more-famous breasts .
she did after all insure her legs for 3.18 million euros .
what price for hans and franz , one wonders ?
and will they both be worth the same ?
a small scar on one of heidi 's legs means that one is more expensive than the other .
what imperfections , if any , could reduce the worth of either hans or franz ?
come on heidi , enquiring minds need to know ! dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : heidi klum accused of promoting anorexia in germany german media has attacked supermodel heidi klum for a new fashion reality tv show that they charged promotes eating disorders among young women .

they can laugh or be laughable at times , and you can chuckle right along .

over the past few months , amateur naturalists have logged more than 24,000 first sightings of six key species of plants and animals .
some , such as the peacock butterfly and frogspawn , have been spotted earlier than expected .
the woodland trust said it was worried " because the changes are so rapid " .
springwatch , now in its third year , is run by the woodland trust and the bbc .
the survey data is being compiled to build up a picture of the season as it unfolds across the uk so that it can be compared to previous years .
as the survey has been running for a limited time , the results can not be interpreted as definitive guide to how a changing climate is affecting wildlife , but researchers are already examining the data for trends .
recent weather in the uk has been extremely mild , and records show it has been the warmest spring since the springwatch survey began in 2005 .
read the findings most computers will open this document automatically , but you may need adobe reader nick collinson , head of conservation policy at the woodland trust , believes the warm conditions may be responsible for some earlier-than-expected sightings .
he said : " this has been our earliest springwatch year , well ahead of the normal time we would have expected to see these events 30 years ago . "
members of the public were asked to record the dates they have first seen red-tailed bumblebees , frogspawn , flowering hawthorns , seven-spot ladybirds , peacock butterflies and swifts .
some of the preliminary findings of this year 's survey include : frogspawn spotted on average two weeks earlier than in 2006 and three weeks earlier than the " phenological norm " -lrb- an average first-sighting date based on data gathered over the last 30 years -rrb- .
peacock butterflies sighted on average one month earlier than 2006 , two weeks earlier than 2005 , and one month earlier than the norm .
for swifts , the data is still returning , but initial results suggest the date has stayed much the same as 2006 , 2007 and the phenological norm .
mr collinson was worried about the possible impact of increasingly warm springs .
he said : " we are concerned because the change seems to be so rapid .
" and we know there is a mismatch of timing , so , for example , when insects would pollinate flowers , the flowers are coming out earlier than the insects are available , and we know this is happening .
" it is very difficult to tell what that means , but certainly we know that wildlife is under pressure . "

for total entertainment , one can do no better than recommend star wars which , for those who approach it in the right mood , is two hours of sheer bliss - the ultimate in space-age fairy tales .
for the younger viewers , i suspect the heroes of the picture will be the two robots r2-d2 , played occasionally by a model but often by kenny baker , and c-3po , played entirely by anthony daniels .
well , i do n't really think there is anything i can tell you about star wars that you have n't heard already - it 's quite simply all the saturday morning matinees rolled into one .
it has a princess , played by carrie fisher , fleeing with the vital plans of the evil galactic empire 's ultimate weapon .
it has an idealistic hero , played by mark hamill , coming to her rescue after she has been kidnapped by nasty peter cushing and the even nastier david prowse , as lord darth vader .
it is in fact an amalgamation of every cinema convention there has ever been : a mixture of the arabian nights , the knights of the round table , the western , a science-fiction epic and a touch of the wizard of oz thrown in , in the shape of c-3po who 's like a pompous version of the tin man .
i wo n't attempt to tell you what the plot is about as half the fun is working it out for yourselves .
but as mark hamill and harrison ford set out to save the princess and the galaxy as we know it , watch out for peter mayhew as the hirsute chewbacca , a sort of huge and short-tempered muppet .
and observe too how everyone takes the extravagant and convincingly used-looking machinery of this far-fetched space age for granted .
star wars is that rare commodity - an utterly delightful romp and you 'll be sorry if you miss it .
and it has a happy ending in more ways than one .
in the first place , alec guinness - as a sort of arthurian knight - was given such a percentage that he no longer needs to worry , if he ever did , about his old-age pension .
and in the second place , the final scene leaves all the options open for a spectacular sequel .
as to that , gary kurtz the producer has assured me the sequel will not be made unless he and the director george lucas are quite sure it can be as good as the original .

bbc news -pipe- entertainment -pipe- barry norman 's star wars verdict bbc news / entertainment graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- uk election -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- entertainment contents : arts & culture friday , 25 may 2007 , 07:36 gmt 08:36 uk barry norman 's star wars verdict as star wars celebrates its 30th anniversary , here is how barry norman - the presenter of the bbc 's film 77 - reviewed the " utterly delightful romp " star wars when it burst on to british cinema screens in december 1977 . "
for total entertainment , one can do no better than recommend star wars which , for those who approach it in the right mood , is two hours of sheer bliss - the ultimate in space-age fairy tales .
for the younger viewers , i suspect the heroes of the picture will be the two robots r2-d2 , played occasionally by a model but often by kenny baker , and c-3po , played entirely by anthony daniels .
well , i do n't really think there is anything i can tell you about star wars that you have n't heard already - it 's quite simply all the saturday morning matinees rolled into one .
it has a princess , played by carrie fisher , fleeing with the vital plans of the evil galactic empire 's ultimate weapon .
it has an idealistic hero , played by mark hamill , coming to her rescue after she has been kidnapped by nasty peter cushing and the even nastier david prowse , as lord darth vader .
it is in fact an amalgamation of every cinema convention there has ever been : a mixture of the arabian nights , the knights of the round table , the western , a science-fiction epic and a touch of the wizard of oz thrown in , in the shape of c-3po who 's like a pompous version of the tin man .
i wo n't attempt to tell you what the plot is about as half the fun is working it out for yourselves .
but as mark hamill and harrison ford set out to save the princess and the galaxy as we know it , watch out for peter mayhew as the hirsute chewbacca , a sort of huge and short-tempered muppet .
and observe too how everyone takes the extravagant and convincingly used-looking machinery of this far-fetched space age for granted .
star wars is that rare commodity - an utterly delightful romp and you 'll be sorry if you miss it .
and it has a happy ending in more ways than one .
in the first place , alec guinness - as a sort of arthurian knight - was given such a percentage that he no longer needs to worry , if he ever did , about his old-age pension .
and in the second place , the final scene leaves all the options open for a spectacular sequel .
as to that , gary kurtz the producer has assured me the sequel will not be made unless he and the director george lucas are quite sure it can be as good as the original .
i only hope financial blandishments wo n't persuade them to change their minds and cut corners in search of the easy dollar . "

bbc news -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- thai king warns over court ruling bbc news / asia-pacific graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- friday , 25 may 2007 , 07:45 gmt 08:45 uk thai king warns over court ruling thai king bhumibol adulyadej has expressed concern about next week 's court ruling on whether the country 's two main parties should be disbanded .
" you have the responsibility to prevent the country from collapsing , " he warned constitutional court judges in a rare televised address late on thursday .
he said that whatever the verdict , the judges would face criticism .
king bhumibol , who has been on the throne for more than 60 years , is highly revered by his people .
while he has no formal political power , his interventions are taken very seriously by the country 's political leaders .
' highly important ' the constitutional court is due to decide on 30 may if the former ruling thai rak thai -lrb- thais love thais -rrb- party and its main opposition democrat party violated election law during last year 's political crisis .
a series of street protests led to thai rak thai calling a snap election , which the democrat party boycotted .
in the aftermath of the poll , both parties were accused of trying to manipulate results , violating election laws .
the election was later annulled , and after weeks of turmoil the military staged a bloodless coup .
if the constitutional court judges find the two parties guilty , both face being disbanded .
their top leadership , including former prime minister thaksin shinawatra who is currently in exile abroad , could be banned from politics for five years .
king bhumibol told the court 's judges : " i urge you to prepare yourself to be ready to criticise or be criticised in the capacity of learned men , to prevent the country from falling into a crisis . "
the ruling is " highly important " , he added .
" whatever the verdict is , it will bring damage to the country . "
analysts say the king seems to be implying that either supporters of mr thaksin or supporters of the generals who ousted the former prime minister in september 's coup are bound to be annoyed by the verdict .
there are fears that a ruling against thai rak thai might prompt street demonstrations , with a former thai rak thai deputy threatening to mobilise thousands of protesters if the court rules against it .
the authorities have already warned they will impose an emergency decree if the situation gets violent .
but if thai rak thai is not disbanded , analysts fear that the justification for the military coup that ousted thai rak thai would be undermined .
rare appearance traditionally the king rarely makes public addresses such as the one on thursday evening .
but this was his second in just over a year - a fact some analysts say is indicative of the nation 's ongoing political turmoil .
king bhumibol has seen 24 prime ministers , 18 coups and 17 constitutions during his 60-year reign .
the military-appointed government which came to power after the september takeover has promised that new elections will be held by the end of this year , after a fresh constitution has been drafted and submitted to a referendum .

" you have the responsibility to prevent the country from collapsing , " he warned constitutional court judges in a rare televised address late on thursday .
he said that whatever the verdict , the judges would face criticism .
king bhumibol , who has been on the throne for more than 60 years , is highly revered by his people .
while he has no formal political power , his interventions are taken very seriously by the country 's political leaders .
' highly important ' the constitutional court is due to decide on 30 may if the former ruling thai rak thai -lrb- thais love thais -rrb- party and its main opposition democrat party violated election law during last year 's political crisis .
a series of street protests led to thai rak thai calling a snap election , which the democrat party boycotted .
in the aftermath of the poll , both parties were accused of trying to manipulate results , violating election laws .
the election was later annulled , and after weeks of turmoil the military staged a bloodless coup .
if the constitutional court judges find the two parties guilty , both face being disbanded .
their top leadership , including former prime minister thaksin shinawatra who is currently in exile abroad , could be banned from politics for five years .
mr thaksin 's thai rak thai party could be disbanded king bhumibol told the court 's judges : " i urge you to prepare yourself to be ready to criticise or be criticised in the capacity of learned men , to prevent the country from falling into a crisis . "
the ruling is " highly important " , he added .
" whatever the verdict is , it will bring damage to the country . "
analysts say the king seems to be implying that either supporters of mr thaksin or supporters of the generals who ousted the former prime minister in september 's coup are bound to be annoyed by the verdict .
there are fears that a ruling against thai rak thai might prompt street demonstrations , with a former thai rak thai deputy threatening to mobilise thousands of protesters if the court rules against it .
the authorities have already warned they will impose an emergency decree if the situation gets violent .
but if thai rak thai is not disbanded , analysts fear that the justification for the military coup that ousted thai rak thai would be undermined .
rare appearance traditionally the king rarely makes public addresses such as the one on thursday evening .
but this was his second in just over a year - a fact some analysts say is indicative of the nation 's ongoing political turmoil .
king bhumibol has seen 24 prime ministers , 18 coups and 17 constitutions during his 60-year reign .
the military-appointed government which came to power after the september takeover has promised that new elections will be held by the end of this year , after a fresh constitution has been drafted and submitted to a referendum .

joined by pitt 's partner , angelina jolie , they signed autographs and posed for pictures on the red carpet .
the third film in the lucrative series , ocean 's thirteen adds hollywood legend al pacino to the all-star cast .
" he seemed to take notes well from each of us , " pitt told reporters ahead of the premiere .
" he has a bright future . "
the first film - ocean 's eleven - took $ 450m -lrb- £ 226m -rrb- at the box office .
ocean 's twelve went on to make a further $ 363m -lrb- £ 182m -rrb- .
pitt and damon have starred in the previous ocean 's films franchise regulars andy garcia and don cheadle return for the third film , which was directed by steven soderbergh .
all but pacino turned up for the most packed media conference of the festival so far , which was as light-hearted and laid-back as the ocean 's films themselves .
asked about whether there would be an ocean 's fourteen , clooney joked : " i want to do musicals .
that 's where my heart lies . "
the cast lined up for a photocall on the french riviera the cast gave tongue-in-cheek responses to dispel any impression that ocean 's thirteen aspired to the art-house cinema that was cannes 's trademark .
" this script , for instance , i think may go down in the history books as one of the great screenplays of all time , " clooney said .
" this film is basically a cry for peace . "
soderbergh won the prestigious cannes palme d 'or prize in 1989 with sex , lies and videotape .

the amount of money spent by consumers shopping online increased by 33.4 % to £ 10.9bn last year , retail analysts verdict research said .
verdict also sees online sales almost tripling over the next five years .
the research group said that faster and cheaper internet access was driving the growth at a time when many high street retailers were seeing demand wane .
of 3,000 customers surveyed , two thirds had broadband internet connections and shopped online more often because of it , verdict said .
the company 's research covered online spending on goods , and did not include sales of flights , tickets and insurance .
verdict predicts that in 2011 , online retailing will be worth about £ 28.1bn , or about 8.9 % of the uk 's total retail sales .
however , verdict warned that most of the growth in sales probably would come from existing online shoppers buying more items rather than more people shopping over the internet .
staying offline while many uk retailers have scaled up their online operations , including ikea and waterstones , verdict identified three types of retailers that were proving reluctant to increase their online presence .
verdict said that food retailers that were not already providing an online service were staying off because the cost of launching a web operation was too high .
value retailers such as primark and matalan have tended not to launch online operations because their business models depend on driving sales in their stores , it added .
and small , specialist retailers have been avoiding online sales because their small scale made it difficult to pay for the necessary infrastructure .
despite these pockets of resistance , the outlook remained bright with other industries moving quickly into cyberspace , the analysts said .
" even with some retailers staying out of the market , online sales in the uk are set to triple in value , " verdict explained .
" by 2011 , the typical spend of an online shopper will grow to £ 1,056 per year with the clothing and footwear , diy and gardening , and food and grocery sectors achieving the fastest growth , " it predicted .

by rory cellan-jones technology correspondent , bbc news from lily allen to david attenborough , they are all doing it .
social networking , that is .
from myspace , to facebook to bebo , sites which allow users to conduct their social lives online are booming - and attracting feverish interest from investors and advertisers .
but is this just a flash-in-the-pan , an internet fad that will soon go the way of cb radio in the 70s ?
and is it just for the under-25s ?
as a 40-something technology correspondent , determined to keep up with my younger colleagues , i felt duty bound to find out .
so i got myself a profile on myspace , bebo and facebook .
i also signed up to the hottest new social networking service , twitter .
this has an added twist - you can send short updates to everyone in your network via text message , providing a running commentary of your life .
after a few days i ca n't help noticing one thing about my virtual social life - i do n't seem to have many friends .
i have tried to find anyone i know on these sites - but nobody seems to be there .
my school and university both have active networks on facebook and bebo - but none of my contemporaries are there .
i get to grips with the language of facebook and , with some trepidation , " poke " a few of the young people in my office .
' pity ' friends ?
graciously , they agree to be friends , but i ca n't help feeling they are doing it out of pity .
then , a moment of excitement - i 've suddenly got a friend on myspace .
he 's called tom .
my 16-year-old son - a veteran of social networking - puts me right .
" dad , tom is the guy who runs myspace - he 's everybody 's friend " .
time to seek help .
i 've found a group on facebook called : " i cant get out of bed without the today programme " . "
i now have a tiny bebo network consisting of me and the founders . "
i contact its founder benna schellhorn , and she comes over to look at my facebook profile and give me some advice .
" oh dear rory , you really do n't have many friends , " she says , in a reproving tone .
social events she explains that facebook has helped her keep in touch with old university friends , organise social events - and rediscover someone she last saw when she was 12 .
" you can use it to organise nights out clubbing , " she suggests , brightly .
hmmm - i 'm not sure she understands the nature of my middle-aged social life .
but i follow her advice to put a little more work into my profile - and try again to persuade old friends to join me .
by now i am having a bit of luck with twitter - but i 'm beginning to wonder why i signed up .
my circle of twitterers - all of them in my age bracket - include my oldest friend , a cardiff doctor using the soubriquet topdoc , and two friends from the murky world of public relations , suburbman and theclackster .
soon my phone is twittering with every detail of their mundane lives .
" not much happening right now .
about to take a shower , " says suburbman " up at dawn , back hurting. read the guardian online , " is the thrilling news from topdoc .
slightly pretentious " about to cook for mrs clackster , duck stir fry thing .
drinking excellent bouzeron -lrb- burgundy -rrb- , " is the slightly pretentious missive from theclackster .
in a final attempt to prove that i can network , i head for a meeting of some of the dotcom world 's biggest movers and shakers .
sitting at the back of another seminar on the future of technology i am awed and humbled to spot a top french blogger , loic lemeur , sending live twitters from his laptop .
but i 'm a little reluctant to ask him or anyone else to network with me .
then i spot the two founders of bebo , michael and xochi birch .
they try to convince me that the social networking phenomenon is now attracting more mature adherents - some even older than me .
so i feel emboldened to ask the couple " will you be my friends ? "
well , what could they do ?
i now have a tiny bebo network consisting of me and the founders .
but despite my hard-won social success - and the constant twittering of my phone - i think i 've had enough .
i have decided i am too old to twitter and too mature for myspace .
some things are best left to the young .

by rory cellan-jones technology correspondent , bbc news am i too old for this ?
from lily allen to david attenborough , they are all doing it .
social networking , that is .
from myspace , to facebook to bebo , sites which allow users to conduct their social lives online are booming - and attracting feverish interest from investors and advertisers .
but is this just a flash-in-the-pan , an internet fad that will soon go the way of cb radio in the 70s ?
and is it just for the under-25s ?
as a 40-something technology correspondent , determined to keep up with my younger colleagues , i felt duty bound to find out .
so i got myself a profile on myspace , bebo and facebook .
i also signed up to the hottest new social networking service , twitter .
this has an added twist - you can send short updates to everyone in your network via text message , providing a running commentary of your life .
after a few days i ca n't help noticing one thing about my virtual social life - i do n't seem to have many friends .
i have tried to find anyone i know on these sites - but nobody seems to be there .
my school and university both have active networks on facebook and bebo - but none of my contemporaries are there .
i get to grips with the language of facebook and , with some trepidation , " poke " a few of the young people in my office .
' pity ' friends ?
graciously , they agree to be friends , but i ca n't help feeling they are doing it out of pity .
then , a moment of excitement - i 've suddenly got a friend on myspace .
my twitter updates proved less than riveting reading ...
he 's called tom .
my 16-year-old son - a veteran of social networking - puts me right .
" dad , tom is the guy who runs myspace - he 's everybody 's friend " .
time to seek help .
i 've found a group on facebook called : " i cant get out of bed without the today programme " .
i now have a tiny bebo network consisting of me and the founders .
i contact its founder benna schellhorn , and she comes over to look at my facebook profile and give me some advice .
" oh dear rory , you really do n't have many friends , " she says , in a reproving tone .
social events she explains that facebook has helped her keep in touch with old university friends , organise social events - and rediscover someone she last saw when she was 12 .
" you can use it to organise nights out clubbing , " she suggests , brightly .
hmmm - i 'm not sure she understands the nature of my middle-aged social life .
but i follow her advice to put a little more work into my profile - and try again to persuade old friends to join me .
my social network - the founders of bebo become my friends by now i am having a bit of luck with twitter - but i 'm beginning to wonder why i signed up .
my circle of twitterers - all of them in my age bracket - include my oldest friend , a cardiff doctor using the soubriquet topdoc , and two friends from the murky world of public relations , suburbman and theclackster .
soon my phone is twittering with every detail of their mundane lives .
" not much happening right now .
about to take a shower , " says suburbman " up at dawn , back hurting. read the guardian online , " is the thrilling news from topdoc .
slightly pretentious " about to cook for mrs clackster , duck stir fry thing .
drinking excellent bouzeron -lrb- burgundy -rrb- , " is the slightly pretentious missive from theclackster .
in a final attempt to prove that i can network , i head for a meeting of some of the dotcom world 's biggest movers and shakers .
sitting at the back of another seminar on the future of technology i am awed and humbled to spot a top french blogger , loic lemeur , sending live twitters from his laptop .
but i 'm a little reluctant to ask him or anyone else to network with me .
then i spot the two founders of bebo , michael and xochi birch .
they try to convince me that the social networking phenomenon is now attracting more mature adherents - some even older than me .
so i feel emboldened to ask the couple " will you be my friends ? "
well , what could they do ?
i now have a tiny bebo network consisting of me and the founders .

by rory cellan-jones technology correspondent , bbc news am i too old for this ?
from lily allen to david attenborough , they are all doing it .
social networking , that is .
from myspace , to facebook to bebo , sites which allow users to conduct their social lives online are booming - and attracting feverish interest from investors and advertisers .
but is this just a flash-in-the-pan , an internet fad that will soon go the way of cb radio in the 70s ?
and is it just for the under-25s ?
as a 40-something technology correspondent , determined to keep up with my younger colleagues , i felt duty bound to find out .
so i got myself a profile on myspace , bebo and facebook .
i also signed up to the hottest new social networking service , twitter .
this has an added twist - you can send short updates to everyone in your network via text message , providing a running commentary of your life .
after a few days i ca n't help noticing one thing about my virtual social life - i do n't seem to have many friends .
i have tried to find anyone i know on these sites - but nobody seems to be there .
my school and university both have active networks on facebook and bebo - but none of my contemporaries are there .
i get to grips with the language of facebook and , with some trepidation , " poke " a few of the young people in my office .
' pity ' friends ?
graciously , they agree to be friends , but i ca n't help feeling they are doing it out of pity .
then , a moment of excitement - i 've suddenly got a friend on myspace .
my twitter updates proved less than riveting reading ...
he 's called tom .
my 16-year-old son - a veteran of social networking - puts me right .
" dad , tom is the guy who runs myspace - he 's everybody 's friend " .
time to seek help .
i 've found a group on facebook called : " i cant get out of bed without the today programme " .
i now have a tiny bebo network consisting of me and the founders .
i contact its founder benna schellhorn , and she comes over to look at my facebook profile and give me some advice .
" oh dear rory , you really do n't have many friends , " she says , in a reproving tone .
social events she explains that facebook has helped her keep in touch with old university friends , organise social events - and rediscover someone she last saw when she was 12 .
" you can use it to organise nights out clubbing , " she suggests , brightly .
hmmm - i 'm not sure she understands the nature of my middle-aged social life .
but i follow her advice to put a little more work into my profile - and try again to persuade old friends to join me .
my social network - the founders of bebo become my friends by now i am having a bit of luck with twitter - but i 'm beginning to wonder why i signed up .
my circle of twitterers - all of them in my age bracket - include my oldest friend , a cardiff doctor using the soubriquet topdoc , and two friends from the murky world of public relations , suburbman and theclackster .
soon my phone is twittering with every detail of their mundane lives .
" not much happening right now .
about to take a shower , " says suburbman " up at dawn , back hurting. read the guardian online , " is the thrilling news from topdoc .
slightly pretentious " about to cook for mrs clackster , duck stir fry thing .
drinking excellent bouzeron -lrb- burgundy -rrb- , " is the slightly pretentious missive from theclackster .
in a final attempt to prove that i can network , i head for a meeting of some of the dotcom world 's biggest movers and shakers .
sitting at the back of another seminar on the future of technology i am awed and humbled to spot a top french blogger , loic lemeur , sending live twitters from his laptop .
but i 'm a little reluctant to ask him or anyone else to network with me .
then i spot the two founders of bebo , michael and xochi birch .
they try to convince me that the social networking phenomenon is now attracting more mature adherents - some even older than me .
so i feel emboldened to ask the couple " will you be my friends ? "
well , what could they do ?
i now have a tiny bebo network consisting of me and the founders .
but despite my hard-won social success - and the constant twittering of my phone - i think i 've had enough .

visitors to the site will be able to experience the sights , sounds and smells of a bygone age , according to the owners .
managers said the six-week delay was caused by a problem with materials supplied for interactive shows .
the attraction 's centrepiece is a boat ride which takes visitors on a journey through dickensian england , from the depths of london 's sewers to a flight over the rooftops .
the theme park has recreated newgate prison , ebenezer scrooge 's haunted house and a victorian classroom from dotheboys hall .
a family affair also adding to the atmosphere are staff dressed as dickensian characters such as rat catchers , pick-pockets , card-sharks and flower sellers .
dickens world has been built on derelict dockland close to where the writer lived as a child .
