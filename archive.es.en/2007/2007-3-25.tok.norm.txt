that hope has been fulfilled . european unification has made peace and prosperity possible .
it has brought about a sense of community and overcome differences .
each member state has helped to unite europe and to strengthen democracy and the rule of law . thanks to the yearning for freedom of the peoples of central and eastern europe the unnatural division of europe is now consigned to the past .
european integration shows that we have learnt the painful lessons of a history marked by bloody conflict . today we live together as was never possible before .
we , the citizens of the european union , have united for the better . i. in the european union , we are turning our common ideals into reality : for us , the individual is paramount .
his dignity is inviolable .
his rights are inalienable .
women and men enjoy equal rights . we are striving for peace and freedom , for democracy and the rule of law , for mutual respect and shared responsibility , for prosperity and security , for tolerance and participation , for justice and solidarity . we have a unique way of living and working together in the european union .
this is expressed through the democratic interaction of the member states and the european institutions . the european union is founded on equal rights and mutually supportive cooperation .
this enables us to strike a fair balance between member states ' interests . we preserve in the european union the identities and diverse traditions of its member states .
we are enriched by open borders and a lively variety of languages , cultures and regions . there are many goals which we can not achieve on our own , but only in concert .
tasks are shared between the european union , the member states and their regions and local authorities . ii .
we are facing major challenges which do not stop at national borders .
the european union is our response to these challenges . only together can we continue to preserve our ideal of european society in future for the good of all european union citizens .
this european model combines economic success and social responsibility . the common market and the euro make us strong .
we can thus shape the increasing interdependence of the global economy and ever-growing competition on international markets according to our values . europe 's wealth lies in the knowledge and ability of its people ; that is the key to growth , employment and social cohesion .
we will fight terrorism , organized crime and illegal immigration together . we stand up for liberties and civil rights also in the struggle against those who oppose them .
racism and xenophobia must never again be given any rein . we are committed to the peaceful resolution of conflicts in the world and to ensuring that people do not become victims of war , terrorism and violence . the european union wants to promote freedom and development in the world .
we want to drive back poverty , hunger and disease .
we want to continue to take a leading role in that fight . we intend jointly to lead the way in energy policy and climate protection and make our contribution to averting the global threat of climate change . iii . the european union will continue to thrive both on openness and on the will of its member states to consolidate the union 's internal development . the european union will continue to promote democracy , stability and prosperity beyond its borders .
with european unification a dream of earlier generations has become a reality . our history reminds us that we must protect this for the good of future generations .
for that reason we must always renew the political shape of europe in keeping with the times . that is why today , 50 years after the signing of the treaties of rome , we are united in our aim of placing the european union on a renewed common basis before the european parliament elections in 2009 .
for we know , europe is our common future . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback send us an e-mail .

that hope has been fulfilled . european unification has made peace and prosperity possible .
it has brought about a sense of community and overcome differences .
each member state has helped to unite europe and to strengthen democracy and the rule of law . thanks to the yearning for freedom of the peoples of central and eastern europe the unnatural division of europe is now consigned to the past .
european integration shows that we have learnt the painful lessons of a history marked by bloody conflict . today we live together as was never possible before .
we , the citizens of the european union , have united for the better . i. in the european union , we are turning our common ideals into reality : for us , the individual is paramount .
his dignity is inviolable .
his rights are inalienable .
women and men enjoy equal rights . we are striving for peace and freedom , for democracy and the rule of law , for mutual respect and shared responsibility , for prosperity and security , for tolerance and participation , for justice and solidarity . we have a unique way of living and working together in the european union .
this is expressed through the democratic interaction of the member states and the european institutions . the european union is founded on equal rights and mutually supportive cooperation .
this enables us to strike a fair balance between member states ' interests . we preserve in the european union the identities and diverse traditions of its member states .
we are enriched by open borders and a lively variety of languages , cultures and regions . there are many goals which we can not achieve on our own , but only in concert .
tasks are shared between the european union , the member states and their regions and local authorities . ii .
we are facing major challenges which do not stop at national borders .
the european union is our response to these challenges . only together can we continue to preserve our ideal of european society in future for the good of all european union citizens .
this european model combines economic success and social responsibility . the common market and the euro make us strong .
we can thus shape the increasing interdependence of the global economy and ever-growing competition on international markets according to our values . europe 's wealth lies in the knowledge and ability of its people ; that is the key to growth , employment and social cohesion .
we will fight terrorism , organized crime and illegal immigration together . we stand up for liberties and civil rights also in the struggle against those who oppose them .
racism and xenophobia must never again be given any rein . we are committed to the peaceful resolution of conflicts in the world and to ensuring that people do not become victims of war , terrorism and violence . the european union wants to promote freedom and development in the world .
we want to drive back poverty , hunger and disease .
we want to continue to take a leading role in that fight . we intend jointly to lead the way in energy policy and climate protection and make our contribution to averting the global threat of climate change . iii . the european union will continue to thrive both on openness and on the will of its member states to consolidate the union 's internal development . the european union will continue to promote democracy , stability and prosperity beyond its borders .
with european unification a dream of earlier generations has become a reality . our history reminds us that we must protect this for the good of future generations .
for that reason we must always renew the political shape of europe in keeping with the times . that is why today , 50 years after the signing of the treaties of rome , we are united in our aim of placing the european union on a renewed common basis before the european parliament elections in 2009 .

" the unanimous adoption of this resolution reflects the international community 's profound concern over iran 's nuclear program , " said britain 's un ambassador emyr jones parry , one of the sponsors . the vote came amid an escalating diplomatic row between iran and britain over the fate of 15 british marines and sailors , who were seized in the shatt al-arab waterway between iran and iraq on friday as they conducted " routine " anti-smuggling operations . permanent five plus germany want negotiations bildunterschrift : foreign ministers of veto-wielding council members china , france , russia , britain and the united states plus non-member germany also issued a statement proposing " further talks with the islamic republic of iran to see if a mutually acceptable way can be found to open negotiations . " the six reaffirmed their commitment " to a negotiated solution that would address the international community 's concerns . " but speaking at the united nations after the vote , iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki swiftly dismissed the un sanctions as " unlawful " and " unjustifiable actions " orchestrated by a few of its members . he did not respond to the six powers ' offer of new talks . as expected , the sanctions resolution was strongly supported by israel , an arch-foe of iran , which has repeatedly stated that a nuclear-armed iran was unacceptable .
" the international community should continue in this way to influence iran and persuade the country to end its attempts to produce nuclear arms , " israeli government spokeswoman miri eisin told reporters . the resolution , agreed after days of behind-the-scenes bargaining , blocks all iranian arms exports and freezes the overseas assets of 28 additional officials and institutions linked to iran 's nuclear and ballistic missile programs . it also restricts financial aid or loans to tehran , and sets a fresh 60-day deadline for iran to comply with un demands or face " further appropriate measures . " mottaki replaced in new york iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who late friday canceled his plans to address the council , as tehran blamed washington for delaying his visa , a charge denied by us officials . the minister reaffirmed iran 's right to conduct uranium enrichment as enshrined by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty which tehran signed . washington for its part welcomed the new sanctions , warning tehran that it would face growing international isolation if it failed to comply with its obligations .
" we are obviously very pleased by the strength of this resolution .
it is a significant international rebuke to iran and is a significant tightening of the international pressure on iran , " us undersecretary of state nicholas burns told reporters . he however said european union envoys would now try to prod iran into reconsidering its decision to continue with sensitive nuclear activities . eu 's solana attempts to reopen discussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union foreign policy chief javier solana eu foreign policy chief javier solana and other eu diplomats " would be in touch with the iranian government in the days and weeks ahead to see if they might reconsider their obstinate refusal to renegotiate , " he added . " i have been asked by the countries that have been dealing most closely with iran to make contact with dr ali larijani in order to see whether we can find a route to negotiations , " solana said late saturday . " the door to negotiations is open ; i hope we can together find a way to go through it , " said the eu 's top diplomat , who is taking part in european union celebrations in berlin marking the 50th anniversary of its founding treaty . " we continue to be gravely concerned about iran 's program .
the suspicion surrounding it affects negatively the stability in the middle east , " solana added .
" our objective is to change all this .
we want to see a successful iran fully integrated into the international community .
in particular , the european union wants a better , closer relationship with iran , " said solana . " this is a country of huge potential and we are natural partners . " talks between iran , three european nations - germany , britain and france - solana , and the international atomic energy agency collapsed last year over tehran 's refusal to suspend uranium enrichment . meanwhile , russia urged iran to consider the implications of the sanctions and act accordingly .
" we hope they -lrb- iranians -rrb- will thoroughly study the statement of the foreign ministers which is very positive and invites iran to engage in talks to find a mutually acceptable formula for negotiation , " russian ambassador vitaly churkin said after the vote . new sanctions pile on existing pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west fear iran is covertly building a weapons program iran has repeatedly denied allegations that it is trying to develop nuclear weapons , saying its uranium enrichment is purely to help meet the country 's energy needs .
enriched uranium is the basic material for both military and civilian nuclear programs . the draft resolution was worked out last week by the five veto-wielding permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - and germany . it builds on the december sanctions which included a ban on the sale of nuclear and ballistic missile-related materials to iran , foreign travel restrictions on iranians involved in sensitive atomic and ballistic missile work and a freeze on their overseas assets . an annex to the new resolution details the diplomatic , economic and security incentives which the six powers presented to iran last june to coax it into giving up uranium enrichment . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu demands release of british troops ; marines allegedly confess germany , in its role as eu president , called on iran to immediately release 15 british troops seized in disputed waters near iraq on friday .

" the international community should continue in this way to influence iran and persuade the country to end its attempts to produce nuclear arms , " israeli government spokeswoman miri eisin told reporters . the resolution , agreed after days of behind-the-scenes bargaining , blocks all iranian arms exports and freezes the overseas assets of 28 additional officials and institutions linked to iran 's nuclear and ballistic missile programs . it also restricts financial aid or loans to tehran , and sets a fresh 60-day deadline for iran to comply with un demands or face " further appropriate measures .

podolski hit the crossbar moments later . the hosts pushed hard for an equalizer after the interval and the best chance fell to tomas rosicky , who hit his volley with some force into the waiting arms of arsenal team-mate lehmann on 55 minutes . but kuranyi made sure of the win for germany when he slipped his marker and met schneider 's cross to claim his second goal of the game just after the hour mark . baros gave the czechs some hope when he deflected jan polak 's long-range shot past lehmann on 76 minutes as the home side piled on the pressure in the closing stages , but it was not enough to threaten the result . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de attack-minded germans look to bounce czechs in euro qualifier germany 's stars and coaching staff issued a warning ahead of the euro 2008 qualifier clash against the czech republic in prague saturday .

the european union is our response to these challenges . only together can we continue to preserve our ideal of european society in future for the good of all european union citizens .
this european model combines economic success and social responsibility . the common market and the euro make us strong .

we will fight terrorism , organized crime and illegal immigration together . we stand up for liberties and civil rights also in the struggle against those who oppose them .
racism and xenophobia must never again be given any rein . we are committed to the peaceful resolution of conflicts in the world and to ensuring that people do not become victims of war , terrorism and violence . the european union wants to promote freedom and development in the world .
we want to drive back poverty , hunger and disease .
we want to continue to take a leading role in that fight . we intend jointly to lead the way in energy policy and climate protection and make our contribution to averting the global threat of climate change . iii . the european union will continue to thrive both on openness and on the will of its member states to consolidate the union 's internal development . the european union will continue to promote democracy , stability and prosperity beyond its borders .
with european unification a dream of earlier generations has become a reality . our history reminds us that we must protect this for the good of future generations .
for that reason we must always renew the political shape of europe in keeping with the times . that is why today , 50 years after the signing of the treaties of rome , we are united in our aim of placing the european union on a renewed common basis before the european parliament elections in 2009 .

" written in the name of " we , the citizens of the european union ... , " the text praises achievements such as peace and stability in europe and sets major challenges as fighting terrorism and racism , as well as combating global warming . it also outlines successes like the introduction of the euro and border-free travel . eu ideals must not be taken for granted , says merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor , her husband and the blairs in berlin merkel said in a speech before the signing that europe could take none of its cherished ideals - peace and freedom , democracy and the rule of law - for granted , and urged the bloc to get to grips with its institutional crisis . " it must ensure that even with 27 or more member states its institutions function efficiently , democratically and in a way which citizens understand .
much is at stake , " the chancellor said . she said her experience growing up in communist east germany had shaped her idea of freedom and justice in europe . " i never thought that i would be able to freely travel to the rest -lrb- of the continent -rrb- before i became a pensioner , " said merkel .
" but my own experience shows that nothing has to remain the way it is . " barroso warns against further constitution failure bildunterschrift : the eu leaders gathered in berlin to mark the anniversary barroso urged the leaders to tackle the constitution issue soon and warned that europe risked falling behind the rest of the world if it did not . " a europe of results demands efficient , democratic and coherent institutions .
we must equip the european union for globalization , " barroso said . the declaration was the highpoint of a weekend of celebrations to mark 50 years since the signing on march 25 , 1957 , of the treaty of rome , which founded the forerunner of the eu , the european economic community . after the signing , the heads of state and government were to pose for a photograph under warm spring sunshine at the brandenburg gate in a symbol of unity near where the berlin wall once divided europe . the leaders will then hold a working lunch focused on the themes of europe and the future , and europe in the world , while street festivals people throughout the german capital . not all work and plenty of play bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : events were held all over europe as the leaders got down to the serious business of the weekend , many younger europeans who had come to the german capital were still recovering from a night of concerts , exhibitions or clubbing . " i 've lived in berlin for 15 years and i feel at home here , " said nicolas , a 39-year-old frenchman at one of the 35 nightclubs open overnight .

" the unanimous adoption of this resolution reflects the international community 's profound concern over iran 's nuclear program , " said britain 's un ambassador emyr jones parry , one of the sponsors . the vote came amid an escalating diplomatic row between iran and britain over the fate of 15 british marines and sailors , who were seized in the shatt al-arab waterway between iran and iraq on friday as they conducted " routine " anti-smuggling operations . permanent five plus germany want negotiations bildunterschrift : foreign ministers of veto-wielding council members china , france , russia , britain and the united states plus non-member germany also issued a statement proposing " further talks with the islamic republic of iran to see if a mutually acceptable way can be found to open negotiations .

" but speaking at the united nations after the vote , iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki swiftly dismissed the un sanctions as " unlawful " and " unjustifiable actions " orchestrated by a few of its members . he did not respond to the six powers ' offer of new talks . as expected , the sanctions resolution was strongly supported by israel , an arch-foe of iran , which has repeatedly stated that a nuclear-armed iran was unacceptable .
" the international community should continue in this way to influence iran and persuade the country to end its attempts to produce nuclear arms , " israeli government spokeswoman miri eisin told reporters . the resolution , agreed after days of behind-the-scenes bargaining , blocks all iranian arms exports and freezes the overseas assets of 28 additional officials and institutions linked to iran 's nuclear and ballistic missile programs . it also restricts financial aid or loans to tehran , and sets a fresh 60-day deadline for iran to comply with un demands or face " further appropriate measures .

" we deserved the win , " said kuranyi .
" we kept them under a lot of pressure and the team played well as a unit . " germany captain and chelsea midfielder michael ballack was pleased with the win as his side face denmark at home on wednesday night in a friendly . " it was a good performance , " he said .
" we controlled the game in the first half and although it became quite tight after they pulled back a goal , we still deserved the win . " unbeaten jogi delighted with win bildunterschrift : unbeaten with seven wins from eight games under his stewardship since taking over from jürgen klinsmann after last year 's world cup , germany coach joachim löw was delighted with the three valuable points away from home . " this was an important and deserved win , " he said .
" the team played very well and showed plenty of intelligence in their build-up .
the defense was rock solid and we barely gave the opposition any chances , so we have to be very happy .
it was very important to go 2-0 up to give us a cushion , kevin -lrb- kuranyi -rrb- was highly motivated and had a superb game . " germany created the best chances throughout with ballack linking well with midfield partner bastian schweinsteiger which tested the home side 's defense in the early stages . german midfield key to victory ballack created the best chance in the opening 20 minutes when his free-kick was charged down , but he managed to chip over the defense and schweinsteiger failed to connect with the ball . and bayern munich 's lukas podolski , voted best young player of last year 's world cup , forced cech into a good diving save after he connected with a powerful shot on 25 minutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi gets his second and puts the game beyond doubt the threatened breakthrough finally came in the 42nd minute when kuranyi rose above his marker and headed the ball just inside the post .
podolski hit the crossbar moments later . the hosts pushed hard for an equalizer after the interval and the best chance fell to tomas rosicky , who hit his volley with some force into the waiting arms of arsenal team-mate lehmann on 55 minutes . but kuranyi made sure of the win for germany when he slipped his marker and met schneider 's cross to claim his second goal of the game just after the hour mark . baros gave the czechs some hope when he deflected jan polak 's long-range shot past lehmann on 76 minutes as the home side piled on the pressure in the closing stages , but it was not enough to threaten the result . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de attack-minded germans look to bounce czechs in euro qualifier germany 's stars and coaching staff issued a warning ahead of the euro 2008 qualifier clash against the czech republic in prague saturday .

-lrb- 24.03.2007 -rrb- " young players are good for us " national coach joachim löw has called up four newcomers for germany 's euro 2008 qualifier in prague on saturday .

that hope has been fulfilled . european unification has made peace and prosperity possible .
it has brought about a sense of community and overcome differences .
each member state has helped to unite europe and to strengthen democracy and the rule of law . thanks to the yearning for freedom of the peoples of central and eastern europe the unnatural division of europe is now consigned to the past .
european integration shows that we have learnt the painful lessons of a history marked by bloody conflict . today we live together as was never possible before .
we , the citizens of the european union , have united for the better . i. in the european union , we are turning our common ideals into reality : for us , the individual is paramount .
his dignity is inviolable .
his rights are inalienable .
women and men enjoy equal rights . we are striving for peace and freedom , for democracy and the rule of law , for mutual respect and shared responsibility , for prosperity and security , for tolerance and participation , for justice and solidarity . we have a unique way of living and working together in the european union .
this is expressed through the democratic interaction of the member states and the european institutions . the european union is founded on equal rights and mutually supportive cooperation .
this enables us to strike a fair balance between member states ' interests . we preserve in the european union the identities and diverse traditions of its member states .
we are enriched by open borders and a lively variety of languages , cultures and regions . there are many goals which we can not achieve on our own , but only in concert .
tasks are shared between the european union , the member states and their regions and local authorities . ii .
we are facing major challenges which do not stop at national borders .
the european union is our response to these challenges . only together can we continue to preserve our ideal of european society in future for the good of all european union citizens .
this european model combines economic success and social responsibility . the common market and the euro make us strong .
we can thus shape the increasing interdependence of the global economy and ever-growing competition on international markets according to our values . europe 's wealth lies in the knowledge and ability of its people ; that is the key to growth , employment and social cohesion .
we will fight terrorism , organized crime and illegal immigration together . we stand up for liberties and civil rights also in the struggle against those who oppose them .
racism and xenophobia must never again be given any rein . we are committed to the peaceful resolution of conflicts in the world and to ensuring that people do not become victims of war , terrorism and violence . the european union wants to promote freedom and development in the world .
we want to drive back poverty , hunger and disease .
we want to continue to take a leading role in that fight . we intend jointly to lead the way in energy policy and climate protection and make our contribution to averting the global threat of climate change . iii . the european union will continue to thrive both on openness and on the will of its member states to consolidate the union 's internal development . the european union will continue to promote democracy , stability and prosperity beyond its borders .
with european unification a dream of earlier generations has become a reality . our history reminds us that we must protect this for the good of future generations .
for that reason we must always renew the political shape of europe in keeping with the times . that is why today , 50 years after the signing of the treaties of rome , we are united in our aim of placing the european union on a renewed common basis before the european parliament elections in 2009 .

" the international community should continue in this way to influence iran and persuade the country to end its attempts to produce nuclear arms , " israeli government spokeswoman miri eisin told reporters . the resolution , agreed after days of behind-the-scenes bargaining , blocks all iranian arms exports and freezes the overseas assets of 28 additional officials and institutions linked to iran 's nuclear and ballistic missile programs . it also restricts financial aid or loans to tehran , and sets a fresh 60-day deadline for iran to comply with un demands or face " further appropriate measures . " mottaki replaced in new york iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who late friday canceled his plans to address the council , as tehran blamed washington for delaying his visa , a charge denied by us officials . the minister reaffirmed iran 's right to conduct uranium enrichment as enshrined by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty which tehran signed . washington for its part welcomed the new sanctions , warning tehran that it would face growing international isolation if it failed to comply with its obligations .
" we are obviously very pleased by the strength of this resolution .
it is a significant international rebuke to iran and is a significant tightening of the international pressure on iran , " us undersecretary of state nicholas burns told reporters . he however said european union envoys would now try to prod iran into reconsidering its decision to continue with sensitive nuclear activities . eu 's solana attempts to reopen discussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union foreign policy chief javier solana eu foreign policy chief javier solana and other eu diplomats " would be in touch with the iranian government in the days and weeks ahead to see if they might reconsider their obstinate refusal to renegotiate , " he added . " i have been asked by the countries that have been dealing most closely with iran to make contact with dr ali larijani in order to see whether we can find a route to negotiations , " solana said late saturday . " the door to negotiations is open ; i hope we can together find a way to go through it , " said the eu 's top diplomat , who is taking part in european union celebrations in berlin marking the 50th anniversary of its founding treaty . " we continue to be gravely concerned about iran 's program .
the suspicion surrounding it affects negatively the stability in the middle east , " solana added .
" our objective is to change all this .
we want to see a successful iran fully integrated into the international community .
in particular , the european union wants a better , closer relationship with iran , " said solana . " this is a country of huge potential and we are natural partners . " talks between iran , three european nations - germany , britain and france - solana , and the international atomic energy agency collapsed last year over tehran 's refusal to suspend uranium enrichment . meanwhile , russia urged iran to consider the implications of the sanctions and act accordingly .
" we hope they -lrb- iranians -rrb- will thoroughly study the statement of the foreign ministers which is very positive and invites iran to engage in talks to find a mutually acceptable formula for negotiation , " russian ambassador vitaly churkin said after the vote . new sanctions pile on existing pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west fear iran is covertly building a weapons program iran has repeatedly denied allegations that it is trying to develop nuclear weapons , saying its uranium enrichment is purely to help meet the country 's energy needs .
enriched uranium is the basic material for both military and civilian nuclear programs . the draft resolution was worked out last week by the five veto-wielding permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - and germany . it builds on the december sanctions which included a ban on the sale of nuclear and ballistic missile-related materials to iran , foreign travel restrictions on iranians involved in sensitive atomic and ballistic missile work and a freeze on their overseas assets . an annex to the new resolution details the diplomatic , economic and security incentives which the six powers presented to iran last june to coax it into giving up uranium enrichment . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu demands release of british troops ; marines allegedly confess germany , in its role as eu president , called on iran to immediately release 15 british troops seized in disputed waters near iraq on friday .

" written in the name of " we , the citizens of the european union ... , " the text praises achievements such as peace and stability in europe and sets major challenges as fighting terrorism and racism , as well as combating global warming . it also outlines successes like the introduction of the euro and border-free travel . eu ideals must not be taken for granted , says merkel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor , her husband and the blairs in berlin merkel said in a speech before the signing that europe could take none of its cherished ideals - peace and freedom , democracy and the rule of law - for granted , and urged the bloc to get to grips with its institutional crisis . " it must ensure that even with 27 or more member states its institutions function efficiently , democratically and in a way which citizens understand .
much is at stake , " the chancellor said . she said her experience growing up in communist east germany had shaped her idea of freedom and justice in europe . " i never thought that i would be able to freely travel to the rest -lrb- of the continent -rrb- before i became a pensioner , " said merkel .
" but my own experience shows that nothing has to remain the way it is . " barroso warns against further constitution failure bildunterschrift : the eu leaders gathered in berlin to mark the anniversary barroso urged the leaders to tackle the constitution issue soon and warned that europe risked falling behind the rest of the world if it did not . " a europe of results demands efficient , democratic and coherent institutions .
we must equip the european union for globalization , " barroso said . the declaration was the highpoint of a weekend of celebrations to mark 50 years since the signing on march 25 , 1957 , of the treaty of rome , which founded the forerunner of the eu , the european economic community . after the signing , the heads of state and government were to pose for a photograph under warm spring sunshine at the brandenburg gate in a symbol of unity near where the berlin wall once divided europe . the leaders will then hold a working lunch focused on the themes of europe and the future , and europe in the world , while street festivals people throughout the german capital . not all work and plenty of play bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : events were held all over europe as the leaders got down to the serious business of the weekend , many younger europeans who had come to the german capital were still recovering from a night of concerts , exhibitions or clubbing . " i 've lived in berlin for 15 years and i feel at home here , " said nicolas , a 39-year-old frenchman at one of the 35 nightclubs open overnight .

that hope has been fulfilled . european unification has made peace and prosperity possible .
it has brought about a sense of community and overcome differences .
each member state has helped to unite europe and to strengthen democracy and the rule of law . thanks to the yearning for freedom of the peoples of central and eastern europe the unnatural division of europe is now consigned to the past .
european integration shows that we have learnt the painful lessons of a history marked by bloody conflict . today we live together as was never possible before .
we , the citizens of the european union , have united for the better . i. in the european union , we are turning our common ideals into reality : for us , the individual is paramount .
his dignity is inviolable .
his rights are inalienable .
women and men enjoy equal rights . we are striving for peace and freedom , for democracy and the rule of law , for mutual respect and shared responsibility , for prosperity and security , for tolerance and participation , for justice and solidarity . we have a unique way of living and working together in the european union .
this is expressed through the democratic interaction of the member states and the european institutions . the european union is founded on equal rights and mutually supportive cooperation .
this enables us to strike a fair balance between member states ' interests . we preserve in the european union the identities and diverse traditions of its member states .
we are enriched by open borders and a lively variety of languages , cultures and regions . there are many goals which we can not achieve on our own , but only in concert .
tasks are shared between the european union , the member states and their regions and local authorities . ii .
we are facing major challenges which do not stop at national borders .

" we deserved the win , " said kuranyi .
" we kept them under a lot of pressure and the team played well as a unit . " germany captain and chelsea midfielder michael ballack was pleased with the win as his side face denmark at home on wednesday night in a friendly . " it was a good performance , " he said .
" we controlled the game in the first half and although it became quite tight after they pulled back a goal , we still deserved the win . " unbeaten jogi delighted with win bildunterschrift : unbeaten with seven wins from eight games under his stewardship since taking over from jürgen klinsmann after last year 's world cup , germany coach joachim löw was delighted with the three valuable points away from home . " this was an important and deserved win , " he said .
" the team played very well and showed plenty of intelligence in their build-up .
the defense was rock solid and we barely gave the opposition any chances , so we have to be very happy .
it was very important to go 2-0 up to give us a cushion , kevin -lrb- kuranyi -rrb- was highly motivated and had a superb game . " germany created the best chances throughout with ballack linking well with midfield partner bastian schweinsteiger which tested the home side 's defense in the early stages . german midfield key to victory ballack created the best chance in the opening 20 minutes when his free-kick was charged down , but he managed to chip over the defense and schweinsteiger failed to connect with the ball . and bayern munich 's lukas podolski , voted best young player of last year 's world cup , forced cech into a good diving save after he connected with a powerful shot on 25 minutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi gets his second and puts the game beyond doubt the threatened breakthrough finally came in the 42nd minute when kuranyi rose above his marker and headed the ball just inside the post .
podolski hit the crossbar moments later . the hosts pushed hard for an equalizer after the interval and the best chance fell to tomas rosicky , who hit his volley with some force into the waiting arms of arsenal team-mate lehmann on 55 minutes . but kuranyi made sure of the win for germany when he slipped his marker and met schneider 's cross to claim his second goal of the game just after the hour mark . baros gave the czechs some hope when he deflected jan polak 's long-range shot past lehmann on 76 minutes as the home side piled on the pressure in the closing stages , but it was not enough to threaten the result . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de attack-minded germans look to bounce czechs in euro qualifier germany 's stars and coaching staff issued a warning ahead of the euro 2008 qualifier clash against the czech republic in prague saturday .
instead of protecting their group d lead , the germans will go all out for the win .
-lrb- 24.03.2007 -rrb- " young players are good for us " national coach joachim löw has called up four newcomers for germany 's euro 2008 qualifier in prague on saturday .
that 's due to injuries , but it also reflects the plethora of young talent he has at his disposal .

britain says they were conducting " routine " anti-smuggling operations .
iran said saturday that the group has admitted illegally entering iranian waters . " we do n't know where they are .
we wish we did .
we are asking whether they are being moved around inside iran , " lord david triesman , a foreign office junior minister , said in an interview with sky news television . the british ambassador to tehran , geoffrey adams , met senior officials at the iranian foreign ministry on sunday to seek the freedom of the group , a foreign office spokesman in london told reporters . adams " pressed again for the release of our personnel , asked where they are being held and for consular access " , he added . iran 's foreign ministry provided no immediate response and further meetings were a possibility , he added . britain reiterates denials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain denies the marines crossed into iranian waters triesman again denied that the group from hms cornwall had deliberately entered iranian territory .
" we 've been very clear throughout that the british sailors do n't intentionally enter into iranian waters , " he said .
" there 's no reason for them to do so .
we do n't intend to do so. and i think people should accept that there 's good faith in that assertion . " on saturday , the germany presidency of the european union called for their " immediate release " and said germany 's ambassador to tehran had also spoken with the iranian government about the matter . iran 's ambassador to london has twice been summoned to the foreign office .
on friday he met a senior civil servant and triesman on saturday .
triesman said britain wanted the iranians to reassure the group 's families that they were in good health and unharmed . the group 's seizure comes three years after eight british royal navy personnel training their iraqi counterparts on the same stretch of waterway were detained for three days by iran . they were blindfolded , paraded on iranian television and apologized for their actions - although britain denied illegal encroachment - before being released . triesman said that while negotiations were " very difficult and delicate " , he was confident that there would be a " good outcome " to the latest incident . troops ' captivity comes at time of heightened tensions bildunterschrift : the un security council voted unanimously to expand sanctions against iran saturday but it comes amid a much different political situation , with britain and western governments at loggerheads with iran over its disputed nuclear program . the united nations security council on saturday unanimously voted to impose new sanctions on iran over its refusal to abandon uranium enrichment . british newspapers have expressed fears the sailors might be used as a bargaining chip in the mounting war of words over the nuclear crisis .
one speculated that the sailors ' detention looked like a " hostage crisis " . " the source of a dispute matters less than the leverage tehran thinks it can extract from it , " the guardian said . iran has accused the british military of seeking to " create a climate of tension at a moment when a resolution on iran is to be put to the vote , despite the fact that iran seeks calm and stability in the region " . " the questioning of the british sailors is continuing to try to establish their real intentions , " he added . triesman was asked sunday about any possible links between the two events but played down the suggestion .
" we have been assured that 's not the case .
our own view is that these things are n't linked , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran faces isolation as security council agrees further sanctions the un security council has slapped new sanctions on iran over its suspect nuclear program as western powers warned tehran it faced becoming even more internationally isolated .

" frau mohnhaupt has been freed , " he told reporters , adding that the woman was collected at the prison by friends . a german court last month granted her parole because she has served her minimum sentence and is no longer considered a threat .
but the families of the victims of the raf , also known as the baader-meinhof gang , have bitterly opposed the release , partly because mohnhaupt has never expressed remorse for the murders . she was part of the second generation of raf leaders who took over after ulrike meinhof , andreas baader , jan-carl raspe and gudrun ennslin were caught and committed suicide in jail . raf no less bloody under mohnhaupt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schleyer 's widow is appalled at the mohnhaupt 's release the raf 's campaign reached a bloody crescendo in the so-called german autumn in 1977 when they kidnapped and killed leading industrialist and former nazi hanns-martin schleyer and hijacked a lufthansa passenger plane with the help of palestinian militants . schleyer 's widow was among those who opposed mohnhaupt 's release , saying she was " appalled " at the move . the raf is believed to have killed 34 people .
its other victims include the head of dresdner bank , jürgen ponto , who was shot dead on his doorstep . the group also launched attacks against us military personnel stationed in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen ponto was murdered outside his home in 1981 , mohnhaupt helped to launch a rocket attack on an american general , frederick kroesen .
he barely survived . the former philosophy student was finally arrested at an raf arms cache in a forest near frankfurt in 1982 . her release had initially been scheduled for tuesday .
mohnhaupt has given no indication of what she wants to do outside prison . priest convinced mohnhaupt is rehabilitated a priest who has regularly visited her in prison in bavaria in southern germany over the past 15 years , said she was a " very nice " person who would lead a peaceful life , like other former raf activists who had completed their prison sentences . " the raf has renounced violence and brigitte mohnhaupt did so along with them , " priest siegfried fleiner told reporters . " she is an independent and intelligent woman , " he added . fleiner said he believed mohnhaupt will find it difficult to re-adjust to life outside prison but added : " lately she has been reading several newspapers a day .
she is very well-informed about world events . " the raf disbanded in 1998 , but the hardliners and their class war still fascinates germans . in recent days newspapers have recalled the violence-filled german autumn in detail . raf comrade klar remains in jail bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar remains behind bars some 20 former militants of the group have been freed after serving lengthy sentences .
only three still remain behind bars , including christian klar who led the group along with mohnhaupt . klar was last month refused prison day releases after calling for " the total defeat of the capitalists ' aims " in a speech read out on his behalf at a marxist meeting in berlin . mohnhaupt 's release comes as italy is again confronted with the memory of the red brigades , who conducted a similar anti-capitalist struggle in the 1970s , with the arrest of fugitive cesare battisti who was long sheltered in france . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german president deliberates over raf terrorist release in response to a letter written to him by a victim of germany 's red army faction terror group , president horst köhler has said that any decision on ex-raf terrorist christian klar 's release will not be made imminently .

" frau mohnhaupt has been freed , " he told reporters , adding that the woman was collected at the prison by friends . a german court last month granted her parole because she has served her minimum sentence and is no longer considered a threat .
but the families of the victims of the raf , also known as the baader-meinhof gang , have bitterly opposed the release , partly because mohnhaupt has never expressed remorse for the murders . she was part of the second generation of raf leaders who took over after ulrike meinhof , andreas baader , jan-carl raspe and gudrun ennslin were caught and committed suicide in jail . raf no less bloody under mohnhaupt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schleyer 's widow is appalled at the mohnhaupt 's release the raf 's campaign reached a bloody crescendo in the so-called german autumn in 1977 when they kidnapped and killed leading industrialist and former nazi hanns-martin schleyer and hijacked a lufthansa passenger plane with the help of palestinian militants . schleyer 's widow was among those who opposed mohnhaupt 's release , saying she was " appalled " at the move . the raf is believed to have killed 34 people .

but the families of the victims of the raf , also known as the baader-meinhof gang , have bitterly opposed the release , partly because mohnhaupt has never expressed remorse for the murders . she was part of the second generation of raf leaders who took over after ulrike meinhof , andreas baader , jan-carl raspe and gudrun ennslin were caught and committed suicide in jail . raf no less bloody under mohnhaupt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schleyer 's widow is appalled at the mohnhaupt 's release the raf 's campaign reached a bloody crescendo in the so-called german autumn in 1977 when they kidnapped and killed leading industrialist and former nazi hanns-martin schleyer and hijacked a lufthansa passenger plane with the help of palestinian militants . schleyer 's widow was among those who opposed mohnhaupt 's release , saying she was " appalled " at the move . the raf is believed to have killed 34 people .
its other victims include the head of dresdner bank , jürgen ponto , who was shot dead on his doorstep . the group also launched attacks against us military personnel stationed in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen ponto was murdered outside his home in 1981 , mohnhaupt helped to launch a rocket attack on an american general , frederick kroesen .
he barely survived . the former philosophy student was finally arrested at an raf arms cache in a forest near frankfurt in 1982 . her release had initially been scheduled for tuesday .
mohnhaupt has given no indication of what she wants to do outside prison . priest convinced mohnhaupt is rehabilitated a priest who has regularly visited her in prison in bavaria in southern germany over the past 15 years , said she was a " very nice " person who would lead a peaceful life , like other former raf activists who had completed their prison sentences . " the raf has renounced violence and brigitte mohnhaupt did so along with them , " priest siegfried fleiner told reporters . " she is an independent and intelligent woman , " he added . fleiner said he believed mohnhaupt will find it difficult to re-adjust to life outside prison but added : " lately she has been reading several newspapers a day .
she is very well-informed about world events . " the raf disbanded in 1998 , but the hardliners and their class war still fascinates germans . in recent days newspapers have recalled the violence-filled german autumn in detail . raf comrade klar remains in jail bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar remains behind bars some 20 former militants of the group have been freed after serving lengthy sentences .
only three still remain behind bars , including christian klar who led the group along with mohnhaupt . klar was last month refused prison day releases after calling for " the total defeat of the capitalists ' aims " in a speech read out on his behalf at a marxist meeting in berlin . mohnhaupt 's release comes as italy is again confronted with the memory of the red brigades , who conducted a similar anti-capitalist struggle in the 1970s , with the arrest of fugitive cesare battisti who was long sheltered in france . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german president deliberates over raf terrorist release in response to a letter written to him by a victim of germany 's red army faction terror group , president horst köhler has said that any decision on ex-raf terrorist christian klar 's release will not be made imminently .

that hope has been fulfilled . european unification has made peace and prosperity possible .
it has brought about a sense of community and overcome differences .
each member state has helped to unite europe and to strengthen democracy and the rule of law . thanks to the yearning for freedom of the peoples of central and eastern europe the unnatural division of europe is now consigned to the past .
european integration shows that we have learnt the painful lessons of a history marked by bloody conflict . today we live together as was never possible before .
we , the citizens of the european union , have united for the better . i. in the european union , we are turning our common ideals into reality : for us , the individual is paramount .
his dignity is inviolable .
his rights are inalienable .
women and men enjoy equal rights . we are striving for peace and freedom , for democracy and the rule of law , for mutual respect and shared responsibility , for prosperity and security , for tolerance and participation , for justice and solidarity . we have a unique way of living and working together in the european union .
this is expressed through the democratic interaction of the member states and the european institutions . the european union is founded on equal rights and mutually supportive cooperation .
this enables us to strike a fair balance between member states ' interests . we preserve in the european union the identities and diverse traditions of its member states .
we are enriched by open borders and a lively variety of languages , cultures and regions . there are many goals which we can not achieve on our own , but only in concert .
tasks are shared between the european union , the member states and their regions and local authorities . ii .
we are facing major challenges which do not stop at national borders .
the european union is our response to these challenges . only together can we continue to preserve our ideal of european society in future for the good of all european union citizens .
this european model combines economic success and social responsibility . the common market and the euro make us strong .
we can thus shape the increasing interdependence of the global economy and ever-growing competition on international markets according to our values . europe 's wealth lies in the knowledge and ability of its people ; that is the key to growth , employment and social cohesion .
we will fight terrorism , organized crime and illegal immigration together . we stand up for liberties and civil rights also in the struggle against those who oppose them .
racism and xenophobia must never again be given any rein . we are committed to the peaceful resolution of conflicts in the world and to ensuring that people do not become victims of war , terrorism and violence . the european union wants to promote freedom and development in the world .
we want to drive back poverty , hunger and disease .
we want to continue to take a leading role in that fight . we intend jointly to lead the way in energy policy and climate protection and make our contribution to averting the global threat of climate change . iii . the european union will continue to thrive both on openness and on the will of its member states to consolidate the union 's internal development . the european union will continue to promote democracy , stability and prosperity beyond its borders .
with european unification a dream of earlier generations has become a reality . our history reminds us that we must protect this for the good of future generations .
for that reason we must always renew the political shape of europe in keeping with the times . that is why today , 50 years after the signing of the treaties of rome , we are united in our aim of placing the european union on a renewed common basis before the european parliament elections in 2009 .
for we know , europe is our common future . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback send us an e-mail .

" we deserved the win , " said kuranyi .
" we kept them under a lot of pressure and the team played well as a unit . " germany captain and chelsea midfielder michael ballack was pleased with the win as his side face denmark at home on wednesday night in a friendly . " it was a good performance , " he said .
" we controlled the game in the first half and although it became quite tight after they pulled back a goal , we still deserved the win . " unbeaten jogi delighted with win bildunterschrift : unbeaten with seven wins from eight games under his stewardship since taking over from jürgen klinsmann after last year 's world cup , germany coach joachim löw was delighted with the three valuable points away from home . " this was an important and deserved win , " he said .
" the team played very well and showed plenty of intelligence in their build-up .
the defense was rock solid and we barely gave the opposition any chances , so we have to be very happy .
it was very important to go 2-0 up to give us a cushion , kevin -lrb- kuranyi -rrb- was highly motivated and had a superb game . " germany created the best chances throughout with ballack linking well with midfield partner bastian schweinsteiger which tested the home side 's defense in the early stages . german midfield key to victory ballack created the best chance in the opening 20 minutes when his free-kick was charged down , but he managed to chip over the defense and schweinsteiger failed to connect with the ball . and bayern munich 's lukas podolski , voted best young player of last year 's world cup , forced cech into a good diving save after he connected with a powerful shot on 25 minutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi gets his second and puts the game beyond doubt the threatened breakthrough finally came in the 42nd minute when kuranyi rose above his marker and headed the ball just inside the post .
podolski hit the crossbar moments later . the hosts pushed hard for an equalizer after the interval and the best chance fell to tomas rosicky , who hit his volley with some force into the waiting arms of arsenal team-mate lehmann on 55 minutes . but kuranyi made sure of the win for germany when he slipped his marker and met schneider 's cross to claim his second goal of the game just after the hour mark . baros gave the czechs some hope when he deflected jan polak 's long-range shot past lehmann on 76 minutes as the home side piled on the pressure in the closing stages , but it was not enough to threaten the result . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de attack-minded germans look to bounce czechs in euro qualifier germany 's stars and coaching staff issued a warning ahead of the euro 2008 qualifier clash against the czech republic in prague saturday .

" we deserved the win , " said kuranyi .
" we kept them under a lot of pressure and the team played well as a unit . " germany captain and chelsea midfielder michael ballack was pleased with the win as his side face denmark at home on wednesday night in a friendly . " it was a good performance , " he said .
" we controlled the game in the first half and although it became quite tight after they pulled back a goal , we still deserved the win . " unbeaten jogi delighted with win bildunterschrift : unbeaten with seven wins from eight games under his stewardship since taking over from jürgen klinsmann after last year 's world cup , germany coach joachim löw was delighted with the three valuable points away from home . " this was an important and deserved win , " he said .
" the team played very well and showed plenty of intelligence in their build-up .
the defense was rock solid and we barely gave the opposition any chances , so we have to be very happy .
it was very important to go 2-0 up to give us a cushion , kevin -lrb- kuranyi -rrb- was highly motivated and had a superb game . " germany created the best chances throughout with ballack linking well with midfield partner bastian schweinsteiger which tested the home side 's defense in the early stages . german midfield key to victory ballack created the best chance in the opening 20 minutes when his free-kick was charged down , but he managed to chip over the defense and schweinsteiger failed to connect with the ball . and bayern munich 's lukas podolski , voted best young player of last year 's world cup , forced cech into a good diving save after he connected with a powerful shot on 25 minutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi gets his second and puts the game beyond doubt the threatened breakthrough finally came in the 42nd minute when kuranyi rose above his marker and headed the ball just inside the post .
podolski hit the crossbar moments later . the hosts pushed hard for an equalizer after the interval and the best chance fell to tomas rosicky , who hit his volley with some force into the waiting arms of arsenal team-mate lehmann on 55 minutes . but kuranyi made sure of the win for germany when he slipped his marker and met schneider 's cross to claim his second goal of the game just after the hour mark . baros gave the czechs some hope when he deflected jan polak 's long-range shot past lehmann on 76 minutes as the home side piled on the pressure in the closing stages , but it was not enough to threaten the result . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de attack-minded germans look to bounce czechs in euro qualifier germany 's stars and coaching staff issued a warning ahead of the euro 2008 qualifier clash against the czech republic in prague saturday .

" we deserved the win , " said kuranyi .
" we kept them under a lot of pressure and the team played well as a unit . " germany captain and chelsea midfielder michael ballack was pleased with the win as his side face denmark at home on wednesday night in a friendly . " it was a good performance , " he said .
" we controlled the game in the first half and although it became quite tight after they pulled back a goal , we still deserved the win . " unbeaten jogi delighted with win bildunterschrift : unbeaten with seven wins from eight games under his stewardship since taking over from jürgen klinsmann after last year 's world cup , germany coach joachim löw was delighted with the three valuable points away from home . " this was an important and deserved win , " he said .
" the team played very well and showed plenty of intelligence in their build-up .
the defense was rock solid and we barely gave the opposition any chances , so we have to be very happy .
it was very important to go 2-0 up to give us a cushion , kevin -lrb- kuranyi -rrb- was highly motivated and had a superb game . " germany created the best chances throughout with ballack linking well with midfield partner bastian schweinsteiger which tested the home side 's defense in the early stages . german midfield key to victory ballack created the best chance in the opening 20 minutes when his free-kick was charged down , but he managed to chip over the defense and schweinsteiger failed to connect with the ball . and bayern munich 's lukas podolski , voted best young player of last year 's world cup , forced cech into a good diving save after he connected with a powerful shot on 25 minutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi gets his second and puts the game beyond doubt the threatened breakthrough finally came in the 42nd minute when kuranyi rose above his marker and headed the ball just inside the post .
podolski hit the crossbar moments later . the hosts pushed hard for an equalizer after the interval and the best chance fell to tomas rosicky , who hit his volley with some force into the waiting arms of arsenal team-mate lehmann on 55 minutes . but kuranyi made sure of the win for germany when he slipped his marker and met schneider 's cross to claim his second goal of the game just after the hour mark . baros gave the czechs some hope when he deflected jan polak 's long-range shot past lehmann on 76 minutes as the home side piled on the pressure in the closing stages , but it was not enough to threaten the result . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de attack-minded germans look to bounce czechs in euro qualifier germany 's stars and coaching staff issued a warning ahead of the euro 2008 qualifier clash against the czech republic in prague saturday .

-lrb- 24.03.2007 -rrb- " young players are good for us " national coach joachim löw has called up four newcomers for germany 's euro 2008 qualifier in prague on saturday .
that 's due to injuries , but it also reflects the plethora of young talent he has at his disposal .

britain says they were conducting " routine " anti-smuggling operations .
iran said saturday that the group has admitted illegally entering iranian waters . " we do n't know where they are .
we wish we did .
we are asking whether they are being moved around inside iran , " lord david triesman , a foreign office junior minister , said in an interview with sky news television . the british ambassador to tehran , geoffrey adams , met senior officials at the iranian foreign ministry on sunday to seek the freedom of the group , a foreign office spokesman in london told reporters . adams " pressed again for the release of our personnel , asked where they are being held and for consular access " , he added . iran 's foreign ministry provided no immediate response and further meetings were a possibility , he added . britain reiterates denials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain denies the marines crossed into iranian waters triesman again denied that the group from hms cornwall had deliberately entered iranian territory .
" we 've been very clear throughout that the british sailors do n't intentionally enter into iranian waters , " he said .
" there 's no reason for them to do so .
we do n't intend to do so. and i think people should accept that there 's good faith in that assertion . " on saturday , the germany presidency of the european union called for their " immediate release " and said germany 's ambassador to tehran had also spoken with the iranian government about the matter . iran 's ambassador to london has twice been summoned to the foreign office .
on friday he met a senior civil servant and triesman on saturday .
triesman said britain wanted the iranians to reassure the group 's families that they were in good health and unharmed . the group 's seizure comes three years after eight british royal navy personnel training their iraqi counterparts on the same stretch of waterway were detained for three days by iran . they were blindfolded , paraded on iranian television and apologized for their actions - although britain denied illegal encroachment - before being released . triesman said that while negotiations were " very difficult and delicate " , he was confident that there would be a " good outcome " to the latest incident . troops ' captivity comes at time of heightened tensions bildunterschrift : the un security council voted unanimously to expand sanctions against iran saturday but it comes amid a much different political situation , with britain and western governments at loggerheads with iran over its disputed nuclear program . the united nations security council on saturday unanimously voted to impose new sanctions on iran over its refusal to abandon uranium enrichment . british newspapers have expressed fears the sailors might be used as a bargaining chip in the mounting war of words over the nuclear crisis .
one speculated that the sailors ' detention looked like a " hostage crisis " . " the source of a dispute matters less than the leverage tehran thinks it can extract from it , " the guardian said . iran has accused the british military of seeking to " create a climate of tension at a moment when a resolution on iran is to be put to the vote , despite the fact that iran seeks calm and stability in the region " . " the questioning of the british sailors is continuing to try to establish their real intentions , " he added . triesman was asked sunday about any possible links between the two events but played down the suggestion .
" we have been assured that 's not the case .
our own view is that these things are n't linked , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran faces isolation as security council agrees further sanctions the un security council has slapped new sanctions on iran over its suspect nuclear program as western powers warned tehran it faced becoming even more internationally isolated .

" frau mohnhaupt has been freed , " he told reporters , adding that the woman was collected at the prison by friends . a german court last month granted her parole because she has served her minimum sentence and is no longer considered a threat .
but the families of the victims of the raf , also known as the baader-meinhof gang , have bitterly opposed the release , partly because mohnhaupt has never expressed remorse for the murders . she was part of the second generation of raf leaders who took over after ulrike meinhof , andreas baader , jan-carl raspe and gudrun ennslin were caught and committed suicide in jail . raf no less bloody under mohnhaupt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schleyer 's widow is appalled at the mohnhaupt 's release the raf 's campaign reached a bloody crescendo in the so-called german autumn in 1977 when they kidnapped and killed leading industrialist and former nazi hanns-martin schleyer and hijacked a lufthansa passenger plane with the help of palestinian militants . schleyer 's widow was among those who opposed mohnhaupt 's release , saying she was " appalled " at the move . the raf is believed to have killed 34 people .
its other victims include the head of dresdner bank , jürgen ponto , who was shot dead on his doorstep . the group also launched attacks against us military personnel stationed in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen ponto was murdered outside his home in 1981 , mohnhaupt helped to launch a rocket attack on an american general , frederick kroesen .

" the raf has renounced violence and brigitte mohnhaupt did so along with them , " priest siegfried fleiner told reporters . " she is an independent and intelligent woman , " he added . fleiner said he believed mohnhaupt will find it difficult to re-adjust to life outside prison but added : " lately she has been reading several newspapers a day .
she is very well-informed about world events .

" we deserved the win , " said kuranyi .
" we kept them under a lot of pressure and the team played well as a unit . " germany captain and chelsea midfielder michael ballack was pleased with the win as his side face denmark at home on wednesday night in a friendly . " it was a good performance , " he said .
" we controlled the game in the first half and although it became quite tight after they pulled back a goal , we still deserved the win . " unbeaten jogi delighted with win bildunterschrift : unbeaten with seven wins from eight games under his stewardship since taking over from jürgen klinsmann after last year 's world cup , germany coach joachim löw was delighted with the three valuable points away from home . " this was an important and deserved win , " he said .
" the team played very well and showed plenty of intelligence in their build-up .
the defense was rock solid and we barely gave the opposition any chances , so we have to be very happy .
it was very important to go 2-0 up to give us a cushion , kevin -lrb- kuranyi -rrb- was highly motivated and had a superb game . " germany created the best chances throughout with ballack linking well with midfield partner bastian schweinsteiger which tested the home side 's defense in the early stages . german midfield key to victory ballack created the best chance in the opening 20 minutes when his free-kick was charged down , but he managed to chip over the defense and schweinsteiger failed to connect with the ball . and bayern munich 's lukas podolski , voted best young player of last year 's world cup , forced cech into a good diving save after he connected with a powerful shot on 25 minutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi gets his second and puts the game beyond doubt the threatened breakthrough finally came in the 42nd minute when kuranyi rose above his marker and headed the ball just inside the post .
podolski hit the crossbar moments later . the hosts pushed hard for an equalizer after the interval and the best chance fell to tomas rosicky , who hit his volley with some force into the waiting arms of arsenal team-mate lehmann on 55 minutes . but kuranyi made sure of the win for germany when he slipped his marker and met schneider 's cross to claim his second goal of the game just after the hour mark . baros gave the czechs some hope when he deflected jan polak 's long-range shot past lehmann on 76 minutes as the home side piled on the pressure in the closing stages , but it was not enough to threaten the result . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de attack-minded germans look to bounce czechs in euro qualifier germany 's stars and coaching staff issued a warning ahead of the euro 2008 qualifier clash against the czech republic in prague saturday .

but the families of the victims of the raf , also known as the baader-meinhof gang , have bitterly opposed the release , partly because mohnhaupt has never expressed remorse for the murders . she was part of the second generation of raf leaders who took over after ulrike meinhof , andreas baader , jan-carl raspe and gudrun ennslin were caught and committed suicide in jail . raf no less bloody under mohnhaupt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schleyer 's widow is appalled at the mohnhaupt 's release the raf 's campaign reached a bloody crescendo in the so-called german autumn in 1977 when they kidnapped and killed leading industrialist and former nazi hanns-martin schleyer and hijacked a lufthansa passenger plane with the help of palestinian militants . schleyer 's widow was among those who opposed mohnhaupt 's release , saying she was " appalled " at the move . the raf is believed to have killed 34 people .

" the unanimous adoption of this resolution reflects the international community 's profound concern over iran 's nuclear program , " said britain 's un ambassador emyr jones parry , one of the sponsors . the vote came amid an escalating diplomatic row between iran and britain over the fate of 15 british marines and sailors , who were seized in the shatt al-arab waterway between iran and iraq on friday as they conducted " routine " anti-smuggling operations . permanent five plus germany want negotiations bildunterschrift : foreign ministers of veto-wielding council members china , france , russia , britain and the united states plus non-member germany also issued a statement proposing " further talks with the islamic republic of iran to see if a mutually acceptable way can be found to open negotiations . " the six reaffirmed their commitment " to a negotiated solution that would address the international community 's concerns . " but speaking at the united nations after the vote , iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki swiftly dismissed the un sanctions as " unlawful " and " unjustifiable actions " orchestrated by a few of its members . he did not respond to the six powers ' offer of new talks . as expected , the sanctions resolution was strongly supported by israel , an arch-foe of iran , which has repeatedly stated that a nuclear-armed iran was unacceptable .
" the international community should continue in this way to influence iran and persuade the country to end its attempts to produce nuclear arms , " israeli government spokeswoman miri eisin told reporters . the resolution , agreed after days of behind-the-scenes bargaining , blocks all iranian arms exports and freezes the overseas assets of 28 additional officials and institutions linked to iran 's nuclear and ballistic missile programs . it also restricts financial aid or loans to tehran , and sets a fresh 60-day deadline for iran to comply with un demands or face " further appropriate measures . " mottaki replaced in new york iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who late friday canceled his plans to address the council , as tehran blamed washington for delaying his visa , a charge denied by us officials . the minister reaffirmed iran 's right to conduct uranium enrichment as enshrined by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty which tehran signed . washington for its part welcomed the new sanctions , warning tehran that it would face growing international isolation if it failed to comply with its obligations .
" we are obviously very pleased by the strength of this resolution .

" the unanimous adoption of this resolution reflects the international community 's profound concern over iran 's nuclear program , " said britain 's un ambassador emyr jones parry , one of the sponsors . the vote came amid an escalating diplomatic row between iran and britain over the fate of 15 british marines and sailors , who were seized in the shatt al-arab waterway between iran and iraq on friday as they conducted " routine " anti-smuggling operations . permanent five plus germany want negotiations bildunterschrift : foreign ministers of veto-wielding council members china , france , russia , britain and the united states plus non-member germany also issued a statement proposing " further talks with the islamic republic of iran to see if a mutually acceptable way can be found to open negotiations . " the six reaffirmed their commitment " to a negotiated solution that would address the international community 's concerns . " but speaking at the united nations after the vote , iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki swiftly dismissed the un sanctions as " unlawful " and " unjustifiable actions " orchestrated by a few of its members . he did not respond to the six powers ' offer of new talks . as expected , the sanctions resolution was strongly supported by israel , an arch-foe of iran , which has repeatedly stated that a nuclear-armed iran was unacceptable .
" the international community should continue in this way to influence iran and persuade the country to end its attempts to produce nuclear arms , " israeli government spokeswoman miri eisin told reporters . the resolution , agreed after days of behind-the-scenes bargaining , blocks all iranian arms exports and freezes the overseas assets of 28 additional officials and institutions linked to iran 's nuclear and ballistic missile programs . it also restricts financial aid or loans to tehran , and sets a fresh 60-day deadline for iran to comply with un demands or face " further appropriate measures . " mottaki replaced in new york iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who late friday canceled his plans to address the council , as tehran blamed washington for delaying his visa , a charge denied by us officials . the minister reaffirmed iran 's right to conduct uranium enrichment as enshrined by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty which tehran signed . washington for its part welcomed the new sanctions , warning tehran that it would face growing international isolation if it failed to comply with its obligations .
" we are obviously very pleased by the strength of this resolution .
it is a significant international rebuke to iran and is a significant tightening of the international pressure on iran , " us undersecretary of state nicholas burns told reporters . he however said european union envoys would now try to prod iran into reconsidering its decision to continue with sensitive nuclear activities . eu 's solana attempts to reopen discussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union foreign policy chief javier solana eu foreign policy chief javier solana and other eu diplomats " would be in touch with the iranian government in the days and weeks ahead to see if they might reconsider their obstinate refusal to renegotiate , " he added . " i have been asked by the countries that have been dealing most closely with iran to make contact with dr ali larijani in order to see whether we can find a route to negotiations , " solana said late saturday . " the door to negotiations is open ; i hope we can together find a way to go through it , " said the eu 's top diplomat , who is taking part in european union celebrations in berlin marking the 50th anniversary of its founding treaty . " we continue to be gravely concerned about iran 's program .
the suspicion surrounding it affects negatively the stability in the middle east , " solana added .
" our objective is to change all this .
we want to see a successful iran fully integrated into the international community .
in particular , the european union wants a better , closer relationship with iran , " said solana . " this is a country of huge potential and we are natural partners . " talks between iran , three european nations - germany , britain and france - solana , and the international atomic energy agency collapsed last year over tehran 's refusal to suspend uranium enrichment . meanwhile , russia urged iran to consider the implications of the sanctions and act accordingly .
" we hope they -lrb- iranians -rrb- will thoroughly study the statement of the foreign ministers which is very positive and invites iran to engage in talks to find a mutually acceptable formula for negotiation , " russian ambassador vitaly churkin said after the vote . new sanctions pile on existing pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west fear iran is covertly building a weapons program iran has repeatedly denied allegations that it is trying to develop nuclear weapons , saying its uranium enrichment is purely to help meet the country 's energy needs .
enriched uranium is the basic material for both military and civilian nuclear programs . the draft resolution was worked out last week by the five veto-wielding permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - and germany . it builds on the december sanctions which included a ban on the sale of nuclear and ballistic missile-related materials to iran , foreign travel restrictions on iranians involved in sensitive atomic and ballistic missile work and a freeze on their overseas assets . an annex to the new resolution details the diplomatic , economic and security incentives which the six powers presented to iran last june to coax it into giving up uranium enrichment . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu demands release of british troops ; marines allegedly confess germany , in its role as eu president , called on iran to immediately release 15 british troops seized in disputed waters near iraq on friday .

britain says they were conducting " routine " anti-smuggling operations .
iran said saturday that the group has admitted illegally entering iranian waters . " we do n't know where they are .
we wish we did .
we are asking whether they are being moved around inside iran , " lord david triesman , a foreign office junior minister , said in an interview with sky news television . the british ambassador to tehran , geoffrey adams , met senior officials at the iranian foreign ministry on sunday to seek the freedom of the group , a foreign office spokesman in london told reporters . adams " pressed again for the release of our personnel , asked where they are being held and for consular access " , he added . iran 's foreign ministry provided no immediate response and further meetings were a possibility , he added . britain reiterates denials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain denies the marines crossed into iranian waters triesman again denied that the group from hms cornwall had deliberately entered iranian territory .
" we 've been very clear throughout that the british sailors do n't intentionally enter into iranian waters , " he said .
" there 's no reason for them to do so .
we do n't intend to do so. and i think people should accept that there 's good faith in that assertion . " on saturday , the germany presidency of the european union called for their " immediate release " and said germany 's ambassador to tehran had also spoken with the iranian government about the matter . iran 's ambassador to london has twice been summoned to the foreign office .
on friday he met a senior civil servant and triesman on saturday .
triesman said britain wanted the iranians to reassure the group 's families that they were in good health and unharmed . the group 's seizure comes three years after eight british royal navy personnel training their iraqi counterparts on the same stretch of waterway were detained for three days by iran . they were blindfolded , paraded on iranian television and apologized for their actions - although britain denied illegal encroachment - before being released . triesman said that while negotiations were " very difficult and delicate " , he was confident that there would be a " good outcome " to the latest incident . troops ' captivity comes at time of heightened tensions bildunterschrift : the un security council voted unanimously to expand sanctions against iran saturday but it comes amid a much different political situation , with britain and western governments at loggerheads with iran over its disputed nuclear program . the united nations security council on saturday unanimously voted to impose new sanctions on iran over its refusal to abandon uranium enrichment . british newspapers have expressed fears the sailors might be used as a bargaining chip in the mounting war of words over the nuclear crisis .
one speculated that the sailors ' detention looked like a " hostage crisis " . " the source of a dispute matters less than the leverage tehran thinks it can extract from it , " the guardian said . iran has accused the british military of seeking to " create a climate of tension at a moment when a resolution on iran is to be put to the vote , despite the fact that iran seeks calm and stability in the region " . " the questioning of the british sailors is continuing to try to establish their real intentions , " he added . triesman was asked sunday about any possible links between the two events but played down the suggestion .

that hope has been fulfilled . european unification has made peace and prosperity possible .
it has brought about a sense of community and overcome differences .
each member state has helped to unite europe and to strengthen democracy and the rule of law . thanks to the yearning for freedom of the peoples of central and eastern europe the unnatural division of europe is now consigned to the past .
european integration shows that we have learnt the painful lessons of a history marked by bloody conflict . today we live together as was never possible before .
we , the citizens of the european union , have united for the better . i. in the european union , we are turning our common ideals into reality : for us , the individual is paramount .
his dignity is inviolable .
his rights are inalienable .
women and men enjoy equal rights . we are striving for peace and freedom , for democracy and the rule of law , for mutual respect and shared responsibility , for prosperity and security , for tolerance and participation , for justice and solidarity . we have a unique way of living and working together in the european union .
this is expressed through the democratic interaction of the member states and the european institutions . the european union is founded on equal rights and mutually supportive cooperation .
this enables us to strike a fair balance between member states ' interests . we preserve in the european union the identities and diverse traditions of its member states .
we are enriched by open borders and a lively variety of languages , cultures and regions . there are many goals which we can not achieve on our own , but only in concert .
tasks are shared between the european union , the member states and their regions and local authorities . ii .
we are facing major challenges which do not stop at national borders .
the european union is our response to these challenges . only together can we continue to preserve our ideal of european society in future for the good of all european union citizens .
this european model combines economic success and social responsibility . the common market and the euro make us strong .
we can thus shape the increasing interdependence of the global economy and ever-growing competition on international markets according to our values . europe 's wealth lies in the knowledge and ability of its people ; that is the key to growth , employment and social cohesion .
we will fight terrorism , organized crime and illegal immigration together . we stand up for liberties and civil rights also in the struggle against those who oppose them .
racism and xenophobia must never again be given any rein . we are committed to the peaceful resolution of conflicts in the world and to ensuring that people do not become victims of war , terrorism and violence . the european union wants to promote freedom and development in the world .
we want to drive back poverty , hunger and disease .
we want to continue to take a leading role in that fight . we intend jointly to lead the way in energy policy and climate protection and make our contribution to averting the global threat of climate change . iii . the european union will continue to thrive both on openness and on the will of its member states to consolidate the union 's internal development . the european union will continue to promote democracy , stability and prosperity beyond its borders .
with european unification a dream of earlier generations has become a reality . our history reminds us that we must protect this for the good of future generations .
for that reason we must always renew the political shape of europe in keeping with the times . that is why today , 50 years after the signing of the treaties of rome , we are united in our aim of placing the european union on a renewed common basis before the european parliament elections in 2009 .

much is at stake , " the chancellor said . she said her experience growing up in communist east germany had shaped her idea of freedom and justice in europe . " i never thought that i would be able to freely travel to the rest -lrb- of the continent -rrb- before i became a pensioner , " said merkel .
" but my own experience shows that nothing has to remain the way it is . " barroso warns against further constitution failure bildunterschrift : the eu leaders gathered in berlin to mark the anniversary barroso urged the leaders to tackle the constitution issue soon and warned that europe risked falling behind the rest of the world if it did not . " a europe of results demands efficient , democratic and coherent institutions .
we must equip the european union for globalization , " barroso said . the declaration was the highpoint of a weekend of celebrations to mark 50 years since the signing on march 25 , 1957 , of the treaty of rome , which founded the forerunner of the eu , the european economic community . after the signing , the heads of state and government were to pose for a photograph under warm spring sunshine at the brandenburg gate in a symbol of unity near where the berlin wall once divided europe . the leaders will then hold a working lunch focused on the themes of europe and the future , and europe in the world , while street festivals people throughout the german capital . not all work and plenty of play bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : events were held all over europe as the leaders got down to the serious business of the weekend , many younger europeans who had come to the german capital were still recovering from a night of concerts , exhibitions or clubbing .

" frau mohnhaupt has been freed , " he told reporters , adding that the woman was collected at the prison by friends . a german court last month granted her parole because she has served her minimum sentence and is no longer considered a threat .
but the families of the victims of the raf , also known as the baader-meinhof gang , have bitterly opposed the release , partly because mohnhaupt has never expressed remorse for the murders . she was part of the second generation of raf leaders who took over after ulrike meinhof , andreas baader , jan-carl raspe and gudrun ennslin were caught and committed suicide in jail . raf no less bloody under mohnhaupt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schleyer 's widow is appalled at the mohnhaupt 's release the raf 's campaign reached a bloody crescendo in the so-called german autumn in 1977 when they kidnapped and killed leading industrialist and former nazi hanns-martin schleyer and hijacked a lufthansa passenger plane with the help of palestinian militants . schleyer 's widow was among those who opposed mohnhaupt 's release , saying she was " appalled " at the move . the raf is believed to have killed 34 people .
its other victims include the head of dresdner bank , jürgen ponto , who was shot dead on his doorstep . the group also launched attacks against us military personnel stationed in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen ponto was murdered outside his home in 1981 , mohnhaupt helped to launch a rocket attack on an american general , frederick kroesen .
he barely survived . the former philosophy student was finally arrested at an raf arms cache in a forest near frankfurt in 1982 . her release had initially been scheduled for tuesday .
mohnhaupt has given no indication of what she wants to do outside prison . priest convinced mohnhaupt is rehabilitated a priest who has regularly visited her in prison in bavaria in southern germany over the past 15 years , said she was a " very nice " person who would lead a peaceful life , like other former raf activists who had completed their prison sentences . " the raf has renounced violence and brigitte mohnhaupt did so along with them , " priest siegfried fleiner told reporters . " she is an independent and intelligent woman , " he added . fleiner said he believed mohnhaupt will find it difficult to re-adjust to life outside prison but added : " lately she has been reading several newspapers a day .
she is very well-informed about world events . " the raf disbanded in 1998 , but the hardliners and their class war still fascinates germans . in recent days newspapers have recalled the violence-filled german autumn in detail . raf comrade klar remains in jail bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar remains behind bars some 20 former militants of the group have been freed after serving lengthy sentences .
only three still remain behind bars , including christian klar who led the group along with mohnhaupt . klar was last month refused prison day releases after calling for " the total defeat of the capitalists ' aims " in a speech read out on his behalf at a marxist meeting in berlin . mohnhaupt 's release comes as italy is again confronted with the memory of the red brigades , who conducted a similar anti-capitalist struggle in the 1970s , with the arrest of fugitive cesare battisti who was long sheltered in france . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german president deliberates over raf terrorist release in response to a letter written to him by a victim of germany 's red army faction terror group , president horst köhler has said that any decision on ex-raf terrorist christian klar 's release will not be made imminently .

that hope has been fulfilled . european unification has made peace and prosperity possible .
it has brought about a sense of community and overcome differences .
each member state has helped to unite europe and to strengthen democracy and the rule of law . thanks to the yearning for freedom of the peoples of central and eastern europe the unnatural division of europe is now consigned to the past .
european integration shows that we have learnt the painful lessons of a history marked by bloody conflict . today we live together as was never possible before .
we , the citizens of the european union , have united for the better . i. in the european union , we are turning our common ideals into reality : for us , the individual is paramount .
his dignity is inviolable .
his rights are inalienable .
women and men enjoy equal rights . we are striving for peace and freedom , for democracy and the rule of law , for mutual respect and shared responsibility , for prosperity and security , for tolerance and participation , for justice and solidarity . we have a unique way of living and working together in the european union .
this is expressed through the democratic interaction of the member states and the european institutions . the european union is founded on equal rights and mutually supportive cooperation .
this enables us to strike a fair balance between member states ' interests . we preserve in the european union the identities and diverse traditions of its member states .
we are enriched by open borders and a lively variety of languages , cultures and regions . there are many goals which we can not achieve on our own , but only in concert .
tasks are shared between the european union , the member states and their regions and local authorities . ii .
we are facing major challenges which do not stop at national borders .
the european union is our response to these challenges . only together can we continue to preserve our ideal of european society in future for the good of all european union citizens .
this european model combines economic success and social responsibility . the common market and the euro make us strong .
we can thus shape the increasing interdependence of the global economy and ever-growing competition on international markets according to our values . europe 's wealth lies in the knowledge and ability of its people ; that is the key to growth , employment and social cohesion .
we will fight terrorism , organized crime and illegal immigration together . we stand up for liberties and civil rights also in the struggle against those who oppose them .
racism and xenophobia must never again be given any rein . we are committed to the peaceful resolution of conflicts in the world and to ensuring that people do not become victims of war , terrorism and violence . the european union wants to promote freedom and development in the world .
we want to drive back poverty , hunger and disease .
we want to continue to take a leading role in that fight . we intend jointly to lead the way in energy policy and climate protection and make our contribution to averting the global threat of climate change . iii . the european union will continue to thrive both on openness and on the will of its member states to consolidate the union 's internal development . the european union will continue to promote democracy , stability and prosperity beyond its borders .
with european unification a dream of earlier generations has become a reality . our history reminds us that we must protect this for the good of future generations .
for that reason we must always renew the political shape of europe in keeping with the times . that is why today , 50 years after the signing of the treaties of rome , we are united in our aim of placing the european union on a renewed common basis before the european parliament elections in 2009 .

" the unanimous adoption of this resolution reflects the international community 's profound concern over iran 's nuclear program , " said britain 's un ambassador emyr jones parry , one of the sponsors . the vote came amid an escalating diplomatic row between iran and britain over the fate of 15 british marines and sailors , who were seized in the shatt al-arab waterway between iran and iraq on friday as they conducted " routine " anti-smuggling operations . permanent five plus germany want negotiations bildunterschrift : foreign ministers of veto-wielding council members china , france , russia , britain and the united states plus non-member germany also issued a statement proposing " further talks with the islamic republic of iran to see if a mutually acceptable way can be found to open negotiations .

" the international community should continue in this way to influence iran and persuade the country to end its attempts to produce nuclear arms , " israeli government spokeswoman miri eisin told reporters . the resolution , agreed after days of behind-the-scenes bargaining , blocks all iranian arms exports and freezes the overseas assets of 28 additional officials and institutions linked to iran 's nuclear and ballistic missile programs . it also restricts financial aid or loans to tehran , and sets a fresh 60-day deadline for iran to comply with un demands or face " further appropriate measures . " mottaki replaced in new york iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who late friday canceled his plans to address the council , as tehran blamed washington for delaying his visa , a charge denied by us officials . the minister reaffirmed iran 's right to conduct uranium enrichment as enshrined by the nuclear non-proliferation treaty which tehran signed . washington for its part welcomed the new sanctions , warning tehran that it would face growing international isolation if it failed to comply with its obligations .

" we deserved the win , " said kuranyi .
" we kept them under a lot of pressure and the team played well as a unit . " germany captain and chelsea midfielder michael ballack was pleased with the win as his side face denmark at home on wednesday night in a friendly . " it was a good performance , " he said .
" we controlled the game in the first half and although it became quite tight after they pulled back a goal , we still deserved the win . " unbeaten jogi delighted with win bildunterschrift : unbeaten with seven wins from eight games under his stewardship since taking over from jürgen klinsmann after last year 's world cup , germany coach joachim löw was delighted with the three valuable points away from home . " this was an important and deserved win , " he said .
" the team played very well and showed plenty of intelligence in their build-up .
the defense was rock solid and we barely gave the opposition any chances , so we have to be very happy .
it was very important to go 2-0 up to give us a cushion , kevin -lrb- kuranyi -rrb- was highly motivated and had a superb game . " germany created the best chances throughout with ballack linking well with midfield partner bastian schweinsteiger which tested the home side 's defense in the early stages . german midfield key to victory ballack created the best chance in the opening 20 minutes when his free-kick was charged down , but he managed to chip over the defense and schweinsteiger failed to connect with the ball . and bayern munich 's lukas podolski , voted best young player of last year 's world cup , forced cech into a good diving save after he connected with a powerful shot on 25 minutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi gets his second and puts the game beyond doubt the threatened breakthrough finally came in the 42nd minute when kuranyi rose above his marker and headed the ball just inside the post .
podolski hit the crossbar moments later . the hosts pushed hard for an equalizer after the interval and the best chance fell to tomas rosicky , who hit his volley with some force into the waiting arms of arsenal team-mate lehmann on 55 minutes . but kuranyi made sure of the win for germany when he slipped his marker and met schneider 's cross to claim his second goal of the game just after the hour mark . baros gave the czechs some hope when he deflected jan polak 's long-range shot past lehmann on 76 minutes as the home side piled on the pressure in the closing stages , but it was not enough to threaten the result . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de attack-minded germans look to bounce czechs in euro qualifier germany 's stars and coaching staff issued a warning ahead of the euro 2008 qualifier clash against the czech republic in prague saturday .
instead of protecting their group d lead , the germans will go all out for the win .
-lrb- 24.03.2007 -rrb- " young players are good for us " national coach joachim löw has called up four newcomers for germany 's euro 2008 qualifier in prague on saturday .
that 's due to injuries , but it also reflects the plethora of young talent he has at his disposal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 25.03.2007 turning globalization on its head großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : globalization is not just about the outsourcing of call centres to asia globalization is not just about outsourcing jobs in the west to asia : indian companies are now creating jobs in europe . india enjoys an unparalleled reputation as an outsourcing destination for the high-tech sector and the diaspora of homegrown computer programmers has long been transforming the global economy . but some european entrepreneurs are turning the globalization equation on its head , recognizing india as a bold , hungry market that is likely to assert itself in new ways and eclipse much of the west in the coming years . employees of the german unit of outsourcing giant hexaware are now spend months at a time living in india , taking a pay cut as they draw an indian salary and live in average indian apartments to get a taste of real life in the country . " our staff has to understand the culture and system in india .
you ca n't do that over the phone or a brief induction training course , " gerrith hermes , the ceo of hexaware 's german unit said this week at hanover 's high-tech fair cebit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anglo-dutch steel giant corus was bought out by the indian tata group earlier this year " you need three or four months living and working in india to begin to understand how people react there and why some approaches work better than others . " hexaware is an indian company that employs some 150 people in germany - a reversal of the standard globalization set-up in which western companies cut costs by sending jobs to low-salary , low-cost markets such as india . changing economy hermes says hexaware 's practice of sending its german staff to india to watch and learn is less a quirk than a preview of rapidly changing dynamics in the 21st century economy . " i could well imagine that in the next few years german students wo n't necessarily do internships at german companies but rather go to india , " he said . " if i 'm right and india remains an unbelievably important country for the it sector , in two or three years we are going to be desperately seeking it specialists with experience in india or with indian companies .
the ones who are successful will say , ' i know how to work with an indian firm , i understand the problems that surface , i can understand the language barrier , i know , culturally , why some things work better than others . " ' the indian government aims to achieve a " sustainable growth trajectory " of around 10 percent annually by 2012 while its 1.1 billion population is one of the largest potential consumer markets in the world . germany risks slipping behind hermes said germany in particular had been slow to realize that it is no longer at the heart of the global economy and risks slipping much further behind in the coming years unless it adapts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large number of asian companies exhibited at the recent cebit high-tech fair " the fact is that the vast majority of germans or central europeans have not completely walked away from colonialist-type thinking , " he said .
" we 've never learned to do that .
when -lrb- indian steel magnate -rrb- lakshmi mittal buys the most expensive house in london , it is in fact just one symbol among many . " frank woitag said he , too , had recently developed a new appreciation for the importance of india . woitag is the founder and managing director of stratos , a firm specializing in travel planning software that is based in germany 's economically depressed former communist east .
the mid-sized company was having financing problems until 2004 when it sought a technology partner in extentia information technology , a software developer and consulting company based in the western indian city of pune . steep learning curve " there was a steep learning curve for all of us but in the end the best partner for us was 5,000 or 6,000 kilometers -lrb- 3,100 or 3,700 miles -rrb- away , " he said in the broad accent of his native saxony .
" we really had to adapt .
none of us wanted to switch our working language to english - there was a lot of resistance and mistrust in the beginning because it was such a colossal difference .
but now we are working with an indian partner on an additional project . " anand rahul , the head of the european business unit at extentia , said he believed his colleagues in germany had also learned the limits of what a foreign partner can offer . " in germany they think they can outsource a problem but that does not work .
this idea that they could send a defective program to us and we would fix it - it was destined to fail .
everyone had to do their homework , " he said in flawless german . " we sent a software architect to germany and worked together to develop a solution . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian workers service overseas clients in bangalore woitag said that his company had long turned away business because it did not have enough qualified personnel .

don muang airport - decommissioned six months ago - is expected to handle about 140 daily domestic flights .
bangkok 's $ 4bn -lrb- £ 2bn -rrb- suvarnabhumi airport was designed to showcase thailand as a regional hub .
however , it has been plagued with problems since it opened in september , including cracks in the runways .
the acting president of airports of thailand , which runs both facilities , said don muang would handle about 140 flights daily .
thai airways will operate 30 daily domestic flights out of the old airport , including some flights to the northern city of chiang mai .
eleven thai airways routes to popular tourist destinations such as phuket and krabi will be kept at suvarnabhumi to make it easier for passengers connecting to international flights , the airline said in a statement .
nok air and one-two-go will transfer all of their flights back to the don muang , where aviation operations have been going on since 1914 , when it opened as a military airfield .
series of problems suvarnabhumi airport opened in september to huge publicity .
the thai authorities hoped that suvaranabhumi , which means golden land , would rival the airports in hong kong and singapore and cement thailand 's reputation as a regional hub .
suvarnabhumi boasts the largest passenger terminal in the world but since development started more than 40 years ago , the project has been mired by a series of problems .
politicians from mr thaksin 's administration were accused of buying up land in advance of construction , to sell on again at huge profits , and the purchase of the airport 's high-tech x-ray scanners was also tainted by allegations of corruption .
the project also suffered many delays and accidents , including a fire that swept through a catering hall , killing a member of staff .
even supernatural forces seem to have been against suvarnabhumi , and dozens of people reported seeing ghosts during the construction process .
in february , officials admitted that there were cracks in the runways and taxiways , and said that while they were not a safety threat , they needed repairing .
the old international airport at don muang is being reopened on a temporary basis following approval by the cabinet .
correspondents say the move will complicate travel for many international visitors , who travel to bangkok and transfer to different airlines for flights to thailand 's famed beach resorts .

don muang airport - decommissioned six months ago - is expected to handle about 140 daily domestic flights .
bangkok 's $ 4bn -lrb- £ 2bn -rrb- suvarnabhumi airport was designed to showcase thailand as a regional hub .
however , it has been plagued with problems since it opened in september , including cracks in the runways .
the acting president of airports of thailand , which runs both facilities , said don muang would handle about 140 flights daily .
thai airways will operate 30 daily domestic flights out of the old airport , including some flights to the northern city of chiang mai .
eleven thai airways routes to popular tourist destinations such as phuket and krabi will be kept at suvarnabhumi to make it easier for passengers connecting to international flights , the airline said in a statement .
nok air and one-two-go will transfer all of their flights back to the don muang , where aviation operations have been going on since 1914 , when it opened as a military airfield .
series of problems suvarnabhumi airport opened in september to huge publicity .
the thai authorities hoped that suvaranabhumi , which means golden land , would rival the airports in hong kong and singapore and cement thailand 's reputation as a regional hub .
suvarnabhumi boasts the largest passenger terminal in the world but since development started more than 40 years ago , the project has been mired by a series of problems .
politicians from mr thaksin 's administration were accused of buying up land in advance of construction , to sell on again at huge profits , and the purchase of the airport 's high-tech x-ray scanners was also tainted by allegations of corruption .
the project also suffered many delays and accidents , including a fire that swept through a catering hall , killing a member of staff .
even supernatural forces seem to have been against suvarnabhumi , and dozens of people reported seeing ghosts during the construction process .
in february , officials admitted that there were cracks in the runways and taxiways , and said that while they were not a safety threat , they needed repairing .
the old international airport at don muang is being reopened on a temporary basis following approval by the cabinet .
correspondents say the move will complicate travel for many international visitors , who travel to bangkok and transfer to different airlines for flights to thailand 's famed beach resorts .

this overstated its status , as it was only a military airfield at that time .

the swansea and mumbles railway began life as a horse-drawn carriage which ran along a line built to transport limestone from mumbles to swansea .
over the years it saw the introduction of steam and later electric-powered trains until its final journey in 1960 .
the publisher of a book documenting its history said the railway was a " remarkable achievement " .

but by 1830 the service was withdrawn because of competition from horse-drawn buses and was out of action until the 1860s , when horse-drawn and steam trains began running alongside each other .
the service enjoyed its heyday in the years leading up to the great war when the line was used by thousands of holidaymakers and day-trippers .
a restored swansea tram representative of the 1934/4 trams in 1929 electricity superseded steam when a fleet of red trains were introduced which operated throughout the war .

the swansea and mumbles railway began life as a horse-drawn carriage which ran along a line built to transport limestone from mumbles to swansea .
over the years it saw the introduction of steam and later electric-powered trains until its final journey in 1960 .
the publisher of a book documenting its history said the railway was a " remarkable achievement " .
entrepreneur benjamin french launched the service for passengers who wished to explore the romantic scenery of the mumbles area .
the original route ran from the brewery bank by the swansea canal around swansea bay to castle hill - today known as clements quarry - in the village of oystermouth .
the people of swansea and mumbles retain wonderfully fond memories of this railway in its various guises publisher david roberts the first , four-wheel carriage was built mainly of iron and was pulled by one horse .
in 1813 a booklet describing the area put the fare at the relatively considerable amount of two shillings , but by 1823 the fair had been cut in half .
but by 1830 the service was withdrawn because of competition from horse-drawn buses and was out of action until the 1860s , when horse-drawn and steam trains began running alongside each other .
the service enjoyed its heyday in the years leading up to the great war when the line was used by thousands of holidaymakers and day-trippers .
a restored swansea tram representative of the 1934/4 trams in 1929 electricity superseded steam when a fleet of red trains were introduced which operated throughout the war .
although famous for its rock and roll motion , the electric train service was reliable and it was said the people of swansea would set their watches by the train times .
to celebrate the anniversary , railway and tramway enthusiast david beynon has produced an illustrated book documenting its colourful history .
publisher david roberts said : " the people of swansea and mumbles retain wonderfully fond memories of this railway in its various guises .
" it was a remarkable achievement for the swansea area in particular and wales in general to have such a global first - the efforts of those incredible early pioneers should never be forgotten . "
the celebration is being held at swansea museum , and is being attended by members of the mumbles railway society .

q : britain seems to get all the blame for the slave trade .
many other european american and african countries were involved and black africans and arabs got rich as well .
why is this fact of history almost always ignored ?
michael , lincoln a : that issue has never been ignored .
this is always the first question that is raised to defend an indefensible position and to transfer guilt to african countries , tribes and black people in britain .
britain did not start the slave trade , this was the portuguese and the spanish , but britain was at the heart of its management , control and legalisation and reaped financial reward .
not to mention the rape , molestation , murder and torture of men , women and children over a 400-year period .
it is a pity that this nation can not show some respect , recognition and humility to black people of the past and today and be honest about its involvement .
q : do you feel there should be an equal concentration , especially in our schools , upon the east african slave trade , which was conducted for centuries by arab traders ?
ed , canvey island , essex a : the arab slave trade also requires further examination and consideration , not only in schools but also in those countries involved .
the middle east needs to take equal responsibility and to have an open debate , like the one that is happening now in the uk .
q : maybe if slavery still existed , the rwandan genocide would not have occurred .
money , for slaves , would be too tempting for the corrupt black africans .
when will black tribes apologise for their treatment of their own neighbours ?
anon , uk a : slavery was an act of genocide and dehumanisation affecting over 20 million africans over a 400 year period .
the rwandan genocide is linked to the aftermath of slavery ; namely colonisation and how europe has successfully played off different tribes and ethnic groups .
you are right , blood is on everyone 's hands , but the reality is that those tribes and individuals involved in the trade had a minor role compared to britain and other european powers .
those tribes need to , and some have , recognised their role and have apologised at different events and programmes in africa over the last three decades .
the question is when will the british government , individual companies and wealthy families who profited come to terms and accept their own individual responsibility in this matter .
q : was sam sharpe more important to abolition than william wilberforce ?
dean franklin , darlington , uk a : we can not ignore the role of william wilberforce in the abolition movement which ended the slave trade in 1807 .
however , sam sharpe played a crucial role in lobbying and organising a rebellion against slavery in jamaica in1831 .
his subsequent hanging by the plantation-supported militia was an act of defiance and bravery that influenced parliament and the 1833 act which emancipated african slaves in the british caribbean .
in 1975 , sam sharpe was made a national hero in jamaica to reflect his contribution in challenging and fighting for the freedom of black people .
q : do n't you think that making so much of a slave trade is going to cause more problems ?
are n't the majority of people disgusted that politicians like ken livingstone are jumping on this bandwagon ?
rick , scunthorpe a : ken livingstone has apologised because he knows that this country is in denial of its past and thus we are not honest in our relationship with the black community .
the only people i see jumping on the bandwagon are apologists who defend and actually have the audacity to transfer their guilt to black people about the african involvement in the slave trade .
q : history is long and complex .
many events and actions from centuries ago affect our prosperity and lifestyle today .
how are we to decide who should apologise for what ?
phil gale , oxford , uk a : historically there has been a long record of apologies , reparations or compensation to the aborigines , native americans and to jewish people , for example .
with regards to the transatlantic slave trade , france is the only country in europe that has apologised .
in the uk , the church of england and the city of liverpool have also apologised .
the apology should have come in 1807 when the slave plantation owners were given £ 20m in compensation .
but an apology is still worth doing if this country is prepared to come to terms with its past and can be honest enough to recognise that a mutual healing process needs to take place .
q : does mr vernon think that this anniversary is being used by some black people as a vehicle for their own prejudice ?
paul lewis , london a : remember that the major focus of this commemoration is about the role of abolitionists , particularly william wilberforce , and the passing of the slave trade act in 1807 .
although wilberforce should be recognised for his deeds , these fell short of abolishing the entire system of slavery which continued up to 1833 .
of course there will be some manipulation of the truth , but the bicentenary year does not reflect the underlying and historical issues which create an unequal power relationship between black and white people in britain today .
q : how is it that the slave trade has a current effect on individuals ' culture , lifestyle , health , educational achievements , family , and gender relationships ?
do you not think black people are able to shake off this legacy like other societies which have been able to transform themselves over time ?
karl , bridgwater a : black people are generally proud of their heritage and the achievements that they and their ancestors have made , but the legacy of the slave trade is present in britain today .
there are differentials in education , health , housing , and opportunity , reinforced by our class system .
unlike other ethnic groups or societies we are still influenced by the trauma of the most heinous exploitation of mind , body , culture , soul and natural resources .
but we have survived and are here to warn humanity to learn from its mistake .

many other european american and african countries were involved and black africans and arabs got rich as well .
why is this fact of history almost always ignored ?
michael , lincoln a : that issue has never been ignored .
this is always the first question that is raised to defend an indefensible position and to transfer guilt to african countries , tribes and black people in britain .
britain did not start the slave trade , this was the portuguese and the spanish , but britain was at the heart of its management , control and legalisation and reaped financial reward .
not to mention the rape , molestation , murder and torture of men , women and children over a 400-year period .
it is a pity that this nation can not show some respect , recognition and humility to black people of the past and today and be honest about its involvement .
q : do you feel there should be an equal concentration , especially in our schools , upon the east african slave trade , which was conducted for centuries by arab traders ?
ed , canvey island , essex a : the arab slave trade also requires further examination and consideration , not only in schools but also in those countries involved .
the middle east needs to take equal responsibility and to have an open debate , like the one that is happening now in the uk .
q : maybe if slavery still existed , the rwandan genocide would not have occurred .
money , for slaves , would be too tempting for the corrupt black africans .
when will black tribes apologise for their treatment of their own neighbours ?
anon , uk a : slavery was an act of genocide and dehumanisation affecting over 20 million africans over a 400 year period .
the rwandan genocide is linked to the aftermath of slavery ; namely colonisation and how europe has successfully played off different tribes and ethnic groups .
you are right , blood is on everyone 's hands , but the reality is that those tribes and individuals involved in the trade had a minor role compared to britain and other european powers .
those tribes need to , and some have , recognised their role and have apologised at different events and programmes in africa over the last three decades .
the question is when will the british government , individual companies and wealthy families who profited come to terms and accept their own individual responsibility in this matter .
q : was sam sharpe more important to abolition than william wilberforce ?
dean franklin , darlington , uk a : we can not ignore the role of william wilberforce in the abolition movement which ended the slave trade in 1807 .
however , sam sharpe played a crucial role in lobbying and organising a rebellion against slavery in jamaica in1831 .
his subsequent hanging by the plantation-supported militia was an act of defiance and bravery that influenced parliament and the 1833 act which emancipated african slaves in the british caribbean .
in 1975 , sam sharpe was made a national hero in jamaica to reflect his contribution in challenging and fighting for the freedom of black people .
q : do n't you think that making so much of a slave trade is going to cause more problems ?
are n't the majority of people disgusted that politicians like ken livingstone are jumping on this bandwagon ?
rick , scunthorpe a : ken livingstone has apologised because he knows that this country is in denial of its past and thus we are not honest in our relationship with the black community .
the only people i see jumping on the bandwagon are apologists who defend and actually have the audacity to transfer their guilt to black people about the african involvement in the slave trade .
q : history is long and complex .
many events and actions from centuries ago affect our prosperity and lifestyle today .
how are we to decide who should apologise for what ?
phil gale , oxford , uk a : historically there has been a long record of apologies , reparations or compensation to the aborigines , native americans and to jewish people , for example .
with regards to the transatlantic slave trade , france is the only country in europe that has apologised .
in the uk , the church of england and the city of liverpool have also apologised .
the apology should have come in 1807 when the slave plantation owners were given £ 20m in compensation .
but an apology is still worth doing if this country is prepared to come to terms with its past and can be honest enough to recognise that a mutual healing process needs to take place .
q : does mr vernon think that this anniversary is being used by some black people as a vehicle for their own prejudice ?
paul lewis , london a : remember that the major focus of this commemoration is about the role of abolitionists , particularly william wilberforce , and the passing of the slave trade act in 1807 .
although wilberforce should be recognised for his deeds , these fell short of abolishing the entire system of slavery which continued up to 1833 .
of course there will be some manipulation of the truth , but the bicentenary year does not reflect the underlying and historical issues which create an unequal power relationship between black and white people in britain today .
q : how is it that the slave trade has a current effect on individuals ' culture , lifestyle , health , educational achievements , family , and gender relationships ?
do you not think black people are able to shake off this legacy like other societies which have been able to transform themselves over time ?
karl , bridgwater a : black people are generally proud of their heritage and the achievements that they and their ancestors have made , but the legacy of the slave trade is present in britain today .
there are differentials in education , health , housing , and opportunity , reinforced by our class system .
unlike other ethnic groups or societies we are still influenced by the trauma of the most heinous exploitation of mind , body , culture , soul and natural resources .
but we have survived and are here to warn humanity to learn from its mistake .

it is a pity that this nation can not show some respect , recognition and humility to black people of the past and today and be honest about its involvement .
q : do you feel there should be an equal concentration , especially in our schools , upon the east african slave trade , which was conducted for centuries by arab traders ?
ed , canvey island , essex a : the arab slave trade also requires further examination and consideration , not only in schools but also in those countries involved .
the middle east needs to take equal responsibility and to have an open debate , like the one that is happening now in the uk .
q : maybe if slavery still existed , the rwandan genocide would not have occurred .
money , for slaves , would be too tempting for the corrupt black africans .
when will black tribes apologise for their treatment of their own neighbours ?
anon , uk a : slavery was an act of genocide and dehumanisation affecting over 20 million africans over a 400 year period .
the rwandan genocide is linked to the aftermath of slavery ; namely colonisation and how europe has successfully played off different tribes and ethnic groups .
you are right , blood is on everyone 's hands , but the reality is that those tribes and individuals involved in the trade had a minor role compared to britain and other european powers .
those tribes need to , and some have , recognised their role and have apologised at different events and programmes in africa over the last three decades .
the question is when will the british government , individual companies and wealthy families who profited come to terms and accept their own individual responsibility in this matter .
q : was sam sharpe more important to abolition than william wilberforce ?
dean franklin , darlington , uk a : we can not ignore the role of william wilberforce in the abolition movement which ended the slave trade in 1807 .
however , sam sharpe played a crucial role in lobbying and organising a rebellion against slavery in jamaica in1831 .
his subsequent hanging by the plantation-supported militia was an act of defiance and bravery that influenced parliament and the 1833 act which emancipated african slaves in the british caribbean .
in 1975 , sam sharpe was made a national hero in jamaica to reflect his contribution in challenging and fighting for the freedom of black people .
q : do n't you think that making so much of a slave trade is going to cause more problems ?
are n't the majority of people disgusted that politicians like ken livingstone are jumping on this bandwagon ?
rick , scunthorpe a : ken livingstone has apologised because he knows that this country is in denial of its past and thus we are not honest in our relationship with the black community .
the only people i see jumping on the bandwagon are apologists who defend and actually have the audacity to transfer their guilt to black people about the african involvement in the slave trade .
q : history is long and complex .
many events and actions from centuries ago affect our prosperity and lifestyle today .
how are we to decide who should apologise for what ?
phil gale , oxford , uk a : historically there has been a long record of apologies , reparations or compensation to the aborigines , native americans and to jewish people , for example .
with regards to the transatlantic slave trade , france is the only country in europe that has apologised .
in the uk , the church of england and the city of liverpool have also apologised .
the apology should have come in 1807 when the slave plantation owners were given £ 20m in compensation .
but an apology is still worth doing if this country is prepared to come to terms with its past and can be honest enough to recognise that a mutual healing process needs to take place .
q : does mr vernon think that this anniversary is being used by some black people as a vehicle for their own prejudice ?
paul lewis , london a : remember that the major focus of this commemoration is about the role of abolitionists , particularly william wilberforce , and the passing of the slave trade act in 1807 .
although wilberforce should be recognised for his deeds , these fell short of abolishing the entire system of slavery which continued up to 1833 .
of course there will be some manipulation of the truth , but the bicentenary year does not reflect the underlying and historical issues which create an unequal power relationship between black and white people in britain today .
q : how is it that the slave trade has a current effect on individuals ' culture , lifestyle , health , educational achievements , family , and gender relationships ?
do you not think black people are able to shake off this legacy like other societies which have been able to transform themselves over time ?
karl , bridgwater a : black people are generally proud of their heritage and the achievements that they and their ancestors have made , but the legacy of the slave trade is present in britain today .
there are differentials in education , health , housing , and opportunity , reinforced by our class system .
unlike other ethnic groups or societies we are still influenced by the trauma of the most heinous exploitation of mind , body , culture , soul and natural resources .
but we have survived and are here to warn humanity to learn from its mistake .

q : you say we are all cooperatively responsible for the slave trade .
how can this be for people , like me , whose ancestors were either immigrants or working class people who benefited in no way from the slave trade , or the british empire in general ?
edward , barking , essex a : all of us are living in a country much of whose wealth is directly or indirectly derived from trade with what became the british empire : sugar from the west indies , cotton from india , opium from china and so on .
so i do think it is fair to say that we are all in some way or another affected by the fruits of the slave trade or from opium addiction , or whatever .
responsibility is , however , a different thing .
my personal opinion is that we are in the end only responsible for our own actions , but that we are totally responsible for them and that is what we should be judged on .
q : did economic factors contribute to the abolition of the slave trade , eg falling sugar prices ?
dean franklin , darlington , uk a : it is easy , and in my view wrong , to see the campaign for abolition as simply a moral crusade .
of course there were significant economic and political factors at work as well and it seems public opinion followed these , or at least gave the committed reformers more fertile ground to work on .
an historian such as james walvin would be better placed to comment on this .
there 's an interesting parallel with the huge changes in public opinion on conservation issues , global warming and so on .
up until even a few years ago the messengers of environmental disaster were seen as crazed voices in the wilderness .
now there is awareness in businesses and governments about the economic impact of what we 're doing to our environment , public opinion has moved in the same direction too .
q : since your ancestors profited from the human sale of my ancestors why should africans not be granted some form of compensation from that profit , which you are still enjoying the benefits of ?
kaid diriye , winnipeg , canada a : the issue of reparations is a complex issue that has been debated by many people far better qualified than me - government leaders , human rights lawyers - without coming to any definitive conclusions .
harewood house has been run as an educational charitable trust for the public benefit for the last 20 years .
under its charitable constitution , the lascelles family can not benefit from its activities .
q : do you think that black people in the uk today are still affected by the legacy of slavery ?
are we best trying to forget about what happened and moving on ?
salem , london a : i think it is very important that we are informed about and acknowledge the facts of the slave trade and how wide reaching its legacy is .
i welcome its inclusion in the national curriculum .
however , many of the black people i have had discussions with are angry at how crudely their history has been represented in the past : first savages in africa , then slaves in the caribbean , now descendants of slaves in the uk .
the diasporian stories research group in leeds , headed by dr carl hylton , is attempting to re-visit this history .
their aim is " to research and develop resources related to the history , presence , influence and international connections of people of african and south asian descent in leeds and locally " .
acknowledging the past , working positively in the present , trying to affect the future must be the way forward for us all .
q : your family have obviously profited a great deal from the human tragedy that was the slave trade .
do you feel that you have a personal debt to pay and if so , what have you done to give back to those affected by the slave trade ?
sabrina price , leytonstone a : i think we can both acknowledge and acquire knowledge about the past , and that is very important .
but we can only have an effect on the present , individually or together .
there is nothing any of us can do about a period of history that - however appalling - can never , ever be changed .
that said , it was important that harewood should build on its outreach and education programmes -lrb- the house and grounds have been run as an educational charity for the past 20 years -rrb- and do something significant for 2007 .
q : should we really be marking the 200th anniversary of the abolition of the slave trade ?
would it not be better to mark the day that the last african slave in the empire was freed ?
sumir panji , india a : you are right of course .
there were still slaves on plantations in the west indies for nearly 30 years after 1807 .
i 'm not a historian so i do n't know when the last slave was freed in the empire - much later than that i suspect .
and there are , of course , still slaves all over the world today .
roger plant is far better placed to talk about that than me .
anniversary celebrations can be double-edged : good for bringing issues to people 's attention , but with the potential for being a substitute for real action .
they should be a beginning , not an end .
q : were there any good things that came from slavery ?
maya kirton , germany a : from slavery - unequivocally no !
but one of the legacies it has left us with in britain is the possibility of a genuinely multi-cultural society .
that 's not a matter of debate any more , it 's a fact .
what we do with that possibility is up to each of us , within our own capacities and capabilities .
q : what is the harewood trust doing to mark the bicentenary ?
marcus sayer , london a : we are making the lascelles family 's original papers from the west indies - only recently discovered - available free on the web through the borthwick institute in york university .
we have invited chapeltown community church to conduct their sunday service at harewood church this sunday , abolition day .
admission to the house and grounds will be free for everybody on that day .
we have published a free leaflet explaining what the particular significance of 1807 is in harewood 's history .
our contemporary art programme features imaginative response to the slave trade and its legacy from artists like nigerian sculptor sokari douglas camp and barbadian film maker sonia boyce .
i am working with trinidadian director dr geraldine connor to produce " carnival messiah " at harewood in the autumn .
the show - handel 's messiah done caribbean carnival style - is an exuberant and inclusive stage production with a multi-ethnic cast from the uk and the caribbean and a chorus drawn from the local community .
and carnival grows out of slavery and resistance to it .

q : you say we are all cooperatively responsible for the slave trade .
how can this be for people , like me , whose ancestors were either immigrants or working class people who benefited in no way from the slave trade , or the british empire in general ?
edward , barking , essex a : all of us are living in a country much of whose wealth is directly or indirectly derived from trade with what became the british empire : sugar from the west indies , cotton from india , opium from china and so on .
so i do think it is fair to say that we are all in some way or another affected by the fruits of the slave trade or from opium addiction , or whatever .
responsibility is , however , a different thing .
my personal opinion is that we are in the end only responsible for our own actions , but that we are totally responsible for them and that is what we should be judged on .
q : did economic factors contribute to the abolition of the slave trade , eg falling sugar prices ?
dean franklin , darlington , uk a : it is easy , and in my view wrong , to see the campaign for abolition as simply a moral crusade .
of course there were significant economic and political factors at work as well and it seems public opinion followed these , or at least gave the committed reformers more fertile ground to work on .
an historian such as james walvin would be better placed to comment on this .
there 's an interesting parallel with the huge changes in public opinion on conservation issues , global warming and so on .
up until even a few years ago the messengers of environmental disaster were seen as crazed voices in the wilderness .
now there is awareness in businesses and governments about the economic impact of what we 're doing to our environment , public opinion has moved in the same direction too .
q : since your ancestors profited from the human sale of my ancestors why should africans not be granted some form of compensation from that profit , which you are still enjoying the benefits of ?
kaid diriye , winnipeg , canada a : the issue of reparations is a complex issue that has been debated by many people far better qualified than me - government leaders , human rights lawyers - without coming to any definitive conclusions .
harewood house has been run as an educational charitable trust for the public benefit for the last 20 years .
under its charitable constitution , the lascelles family can not benefit from its activities .
q : do you think that black people in the uk today are still affected by the legacy of slavery ?
are we best trying to forget about what happened and moving on ?
salem , london a : i think it is very important that we are informed about and acknowledge the facts of the slave trade and how wide reaching its legacy is .

their aim is " to research and develop resources related to the history , presence , influence and international connections of people of african and south asian descent in leeds and locally " .
acknowledging the past , working positively in the present , trying to affect the future must be the way forward for us all .
q : your family have obviously profited a great deal from the human tragedy that was the slave trade .
do you feel that you have a personal debt to pay and if so , what have you done to give back to those affected by the slave trade ?
sabrina price , leytonstone a : i think we can both acknowledge and acquire knowledge about the past , and that is very important .
but we can only have an effect on the present , individually or together .
there is nothing any of us can do about a period of history that - however appalling - can never , ever be changed .
that said , it was important that harewood should build on its outreach and education programmes -lrb- the house and grounds have been run as an educational charity for the past 20 years -rrb- and do something significant for 2007 .
q : should we really be marking the 200th anniversary of the abolition of the slave trade ?
would it not be better to mark the day that the last african slave in the empire was freed ?
sumir panji , india a : you are right of course .
there were still slaves on plantations in the west indies for nearly 30 years after 1807 .
i 'm not a historian so i do n't know when the last slave was freed in the empire - much later than that i suspect .
and there are , of course , still slaves all over the world today .
roger plant is far better placed to talk about that than me .
anniversary celebrations can be double-edged : good for bringing issues to people 's attention , but with the potential for being a substitute for real action .
they should be a beginning , not an end .
q : were there any good things that came from slavery ?
maya kirton , germany a : from slavery - unequivocally no !
but one of the legacies it has left us with in britain is the possibility of a genuinely multi-cultural society .
that 's not a matter of debate any more , it 's a fact .
what we do with that possibility is up to each of us , within our own capacities and capabilities .
q : what is the harewood trust doing to mark the bicentenary ?
marcus sayer , london a : we are making the lascelles family 's original papers from the west indies - only recently discovered - available free on the web through the borthwick institute in york university .
we have invited chapeltown community church to conduct their sunday service at harewood church this sunday , abolition day .
admission to the house and grounds will be free for everybody on that day .
we have published a free leaflet explaining what the particular significance of 1807 is in harewood 's history .
our contemporary art programme features imaginative response to the slave trade and its legacy from artists like nigerian sculptor sokari douglas camp and barbadian film maker sonia boyce .
i am working with trinidadian director dr geraldine connor to produce " carnival messiah " at harewood in the autumn .
the show - handel 's messiah done caribbean carnival style - is an exuberant and inclusive stage production with a multi-ethnic cast from the uk and the caribbean and a chorus drawn from the local community .

q : you say we are all cooperatively responsible for the slave trade .
how can this be for people , like me , whose ancestors were either immigrants or working class people who benefited in no way from the slave trade , or the british empire in general ?
edward , barking , essex a : all of us are living in a country much of whose wealth is directly or indirectly derived from trade with what became the british empire : sugar from the west indies , cotton from india , opium from china and so on .
so i do think it is fair to say that we are all in some way or another affected by the fruits of the slave trade or from opium addiction , or whatever .
responsibility is , however , a different thing .
my personal opinion is that we are in the end only responsible for our own actions , but that we are totally responsible for them and that is what we should be judged on .
q : did economic factors contribute to the abolition of the slave trade , eg falling sugar prices ?
dean franklin , darlington , uk a : it is easy , and in my view wrong , to see the campaign for abolition as simply a moral crusade .
of course there were significant economic and political factors at work as well and it seems public opinion followed these , or at least gave the committed reformers more fertile ground to work on .
an historian such as james walvin would be better placed to comment on this .
there 's an interesting parallel with the huge changes in public opinion on conservation issues , global warming and so on .
up until even a few years ago the messengers of environmental disaster were seen as crazed voices in the wilderness .
now there is awareness in businesses and governments about the economic impact of what we 're doing to our environment , public opinion has moved in the same direction too .
q : since your ancestors profited from the human sale of my ancestors why should africans not be granted some form of compensation from that profit , which you are still enjoying the benefits of ?
kaid diriye , winnipeg , canada a : the issue of reparations is a complex issue that has been debated by many people far better qualified than me - government leaders , human rights lawyers - without coming to any definitive conclusions .
harewood house has been run as an educational charitable trust for the public benefit for the last 20 years .
under its charitable constitution , the lascelles family can not benefit from its activities .
q : do you think that black people in the uk today are still affected by the legacy of slavery ?
are we best trying to forget about what happened and moving on ?
salem , london a : i think it is very important that we are informed about and acknowledge the facts of the slave trade and how wide reaching its legacy is .

q : you say we are all cooperatively responsible for the slave trade .
how can this be for people , like me , whose ancestors were either immigrants or working class people who benefited in no way from the slave trade , or the british empire in general ?
edward , barking , essex a : all of us are living in a country much of whose wealth is directly or indirectly derived from trade with what became the british empire : sugar from the west indies , cotton from india , opium from china and so on .
so i do think it is fair to say that we are all in some way or another affected by the fruits of the slave trade or from opium addiction , or whatever .
responsibility is , however , a different thing .
my personal opinion is that we are in the end only responsible for our own actions , but that we are totally responsible for them and that is what we should be judged on .
q : did economic factors contribute to the abolition of the slave trade , eg falling sugar prices ?
dean franklin , darlington , uk a : it is easy , and in my view wrong , to see the campaign for abolition as simply a moral crusade .
of course there were significant economic and political factors at work as well and it seems public opinion followed these , or at least gave the committed reformers more fertile ground to work on .

hasit , leamington spa a : most of the worst forms of abuse associated with slavery-like practices can be covered by other criminal law , such as violence , blackmail etc .
but abolishing a social evil by law does not necessarily get rid of it .
and with modern forms of slavery the main problem is law enforcement rather than the letter of the law itself .
poverty can not explain forced labour and modern slavery , but they certainly thrive in a climate of poverty .
q : are there different types of slavery today ?
what is the most common type ?
richard pearce , bradford a : slavery is one form of forced labour , involving absolute control by one person or group over another .
in its global report on forced labour in 2005 , the ilo distinguished between three main types of forced labour : that imposed directly by the state .
governments can be directly responsible for imposing forced labour , for either political or economic purposes or a mixture of both .
that which is linked to a longstanding pattern of poverty and discrimination against caste or indigenous minorities .
that which is associated with modern day trafficking for labour and sexual exploitation or otherwise involves coercion against migrant workers .
about 80 per cent of forced labour today is privately imposed and a common feature -lrb- whether affecting indigenous peoples , young women trafficked for sexual exploitation , or abusive forms of contract labour -rrb- is that some form of debt bondage or debt slavery is involved .
q : what are the main differences between modern day slavery and the transatlantic slave trade ?
mantej , amsterdam a : the transatlantic slave trade was accepted by the slave societies until its abolition , and the slave masters had total control .
what happens today is manifestly illegal , and there are usually criminal laws to punish it .
almost every member state has ratified the ilo 's conventions on forced labour under which the practise is a serious criminal offence that should be severely punished .
today ruthless persons are either flouting the law , or operating on the margins of the law , to make the greatest possible profit from exploiting the vulnerable .
in the case of much sex trafficking and the most serious labour exploitation , organised crime is involved .
q : surely people can resist being sold into slavery ?
why do they not seek the protection of their police or governments ?
sarah , solihull a : if only it was so easy .
much forced labour occurs in developing countries where the police and labour inspectors have limited power to move against traditional elites .
and when migrants endure forced labour in the industrialised world they can be terrified to report their plight to the police for fear of deportation .
this is why many anti-trafficking laws and policies are now seeking more protection for the victims who do denounce their conditions .
a common feature of forced labour is that some form of debt bondage or debt slavery is involved .
debt-bondage involves an exploiter inducing the vulnerable into debts , which may take years or even generations to work off .
q : are current day slave traders being hunted down with the same sense of purpose as drug traffickers and terrorists ?
or are societies turning a blind eye ?
janice , uk a : most slavery-like practices are hidden in the underground economy or remote areas , and sometimes the forms of coercion are subtle and difficult to detect .
so law enforcement agencies and prosecutors will need to be proactive , providing clear guidance and allocating resources , if they are to come to grips with the range of forced labour practices in the modern economy .
our concern is the very low rate of prosecutions anywhere in the world for the crimes of forced labour and trafficking .
but the awareness is gradually growing , and this is being translated slowly but surely into stronger legislation for trafficking offences , and high penalties .
q : what practical measures are being taken by the international community to eradicate forced labour ?
stewart peel , texas , us a : the international community , including the ilo and un partner agencies , is active on many front .
international laws , like the trafficking protocol to the un convention against transnational organized crime , or the ilo 's conventions on forced labour and the worst forms of child labour , are necessary for providing definitions and broad policy approaches .
research and data gathering are all essential , as is detailed guidance for police , prosecutors , labour inspectors , judges and others on to how to identify complex forced labour situations in practice .
the ilo 's special action programme to combat forced labour is doing all of this , and continually seeking new partners for a global alliance against forced labour .
it is also working with financial institutions and development agencies , getting them to understand that eradicating the bonded labour systems that lock poor communities in continued poverty can be a very effective way of poverty reduction and empowerment .
q : are the governments of the countries most affected by forced labour taking enough responsibility for its eradication ?
francis , paris a : forced labour is a truly global problem with almost no country altogether immune .
it 's encouraging that several countries in asia and latin america have quite recently faced up the problems , sponsoring research , creating broad-based commissions on forced labour , training civil servants and judges .
brazil has created a special mobile police unit to investigate cases of forced labour and release the victims .
but too many other countries are still in denial , fearing that documented recognition of the nature or extent of forced labour practices could sully its international image .
a country which does face rigorously up to its forced labour problems and take remedial action should be commended for doing so rather than risk an adverse impact on , for example , its trade relations .
where trafficking or abuse of contract labour systems are concerned , there is a common responsibility of governments in the sender and destination countries .

much forced labour occurs in developing countries where the police and labour inspectors have limited power to move against traditional elites .
and when migrants endure forced labour in the industrialised world they can be terrified to report their plight to the police for fear of deportation .
this is why many anti-trafficking laws and policies are now seeking more protection for the victims who do denounce their conditions .
a common feature of forced labour is that some form of debt bondage or debt slavery is involved .
debt-bondage involves an exploiter inducing the vulnerable into debts , which may take years or even generations to work off .
q : are current day slave traders being hunted down with the same sense of purpose as drug traffickers and terrorists ?
or are societies turning a blind eye ?
janice , uk a : most slavery-like practices are hidden in the underground economy or remote areas , and sometimes the forms of coercion are subtle and difficult to detect .
so law enforcement agencies and prosecutors will need to be proactive , providing clear guidance and allocating resources , if they are to come to grips with the range of forced labour practices in the modern economy .
our concern is the very low rate of prosecutions anywhere in the world for the crimes of forced labour and trafficking .
but the awareness is gradually growing , and this is being translated slowly but surely into stronger legislation for trafficking offences , and high penalties .
q : what practical measures are being taken by the international community to eradicate forced labour ?
stewart peel , texas , us a : the international community , including the ilo and un partner agencies , is active on many front .
international laws , like the trafficking protocol to the un convention against transnational organized crime , or the ilo 's conventions on forced labour and the worst forms of child labour , are necessary for providing definitions and broad policy approaches .
research and data gathering are all essential , as is detailed guidance for police , prosecutors , labour inspectors , judges and others on to how to identify complex forced labour situations in practice .
the ilo 's special action programme to combat forced labour is doing all of this , and continually seeking new partners for a global alliance against forced labour .
it is also working with financial institutions and development agencies , getting them to understand that eradicating the bonded labour systems that lock poor communities in continued poverty can be a very effective way of poverty reduction and empowerment .
q : are the governments of the countries most affected by forced labour taking enough responsibility for its eradication ?
francis , paris a : forced labour is a truly global problem with almost no country altogether immune .
it 's encouraging that several countries in asia and latin america have quite recently faced up the problems , sponsoring research , creating broad-based commissions on forced labour , training civil servants and judges .
brazil has created a special mobile police unit to investigate cases of forced labour and release the victims .
but too many other countries are still in denial , fearing that documented recognition of the nature or extent of forced labour practices could sully its international image .
a country which does face rigorously up to its forced labour problems and take remedial action should be commended for doing so rather than risk an adverse impact on , for example , its trade relations .
where trafficking or abuse of contract labour systems are concerned , there is a common responsibility of governments in the sender and destination countries .

hasit , leamington spa a : most of the worst forms of abuse associated with slavery-like practices can be covered by other criminal law , such as violence , blackmail etc .
but abolishing a social evil by law does not necessarily get rid of it .
and with modern forms of slavery the main problem is law enforcement rather than the letter of the law itself .
poverty can not explain forced labour and modern slavery , but they certainly thrive in a climate of poverty .
q : are there different types of slavery today ?
what is the most common type ?
richard pearce , bradford a : slavery is one form of forced labour , involving absolute control by one person or group over another .
in its global report on forced labour in 2005 , the ilo distinguished between three main types of forced labour : that imposed directly by the state .
governments can be directly responsible for imposing forced labour , for either political or economic purposes or a mixture of both .
that which is linked to a longstanding pattern of poverty and discrimination against caste or indigenous minorities .
that which is associated with modern day trafficking for labour and sexual exploitation or otherwise involves coercion against migrant workers .
about 80 per cent of forced labour today is privately imposed and a common feature -lrb- whether affecting indigenous peoples , young women trafficked for sexual exploitation , or abusive forms of contract labour -rrb- is that some form of debt bondage or debt slavery is involved .
q : what are the main differences between modern day slavery and the transatlantic slave trade ?
mantej , amsterdam a : the transatlantic slave trade was accepted by the slave societies until its abolition , and the slave masters had total control .
what happens today is manifestly illegal , and there are usually criminal laws to punish it .
almost every member state has ratified the ilo 's conventions on forced labour under which the practise is a serious criminal offence that should be severely punished .
today ruthless persons are either flouting the law , or operating on the margins of the law , to make the greatest possible profit from exploiting the vulnerable .
in the case of much sex trafficking and the most serious labour exploitation , organised crime is involved .
q : surely people can resist being sold into slavery ?
why do they not seek the protection of their police or governments ?
sarah , solihull a : if only it was so easy .
