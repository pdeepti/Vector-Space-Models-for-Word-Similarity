the date for new election still needs to be approved by the entire parliament . ´ bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secularists suspect gul , left , and erdogan of having a hidden islamist agenda the current turkish political crisis erupted over widespread opposition to the prospect of an akp president because of concerns that the party is not truly committed to turkey 's fiercely guarded secular system and is eroding the separation of state and religion . tensions reached a climax late friday when the influential military accused the government of failing to prevent rising islamist activity and threatened to intervene .
the unusually harsh statement came hours after a parliament ballot - boycotted by the opposition - in which gul fell 10 votes short of the required two-thirds majority to make him turkey 's next president .
secular turks demonstrate more than one million pro-secular turks demonstrated in istanbul at the weekend against an akp president , after a similar mass rally two weeks earlier in ankara .
bildunterschrift : pro-secular demonstrators wave turkish flags during a rally in istanbul on sunday erdogan , who has led turkey since march 2003 , insisted wednesday that his party was committed to secularism . he also urged respect for differences - an apparent reference to objections raised over gul 's wife wearing the islamic headscarf , seen by secularists as a symbol of political islam . " the essential problem is to manage to stay united , preserving our differences , " he said .
" rights and freedoms are necessary for everybody . " pointing to the most popular slogan at the anti-akp protests , he said : " they say ' turkey is secular , it will remain secular ' .
we do not say anything different - yes , turkey is secular , it will remain secular . "
eu warns army the european union warned the army that it could harm turkey 's membership prospects if it interferes in politics . it urged all parties to respect the court 's decision " regardless of the unfortunate events leading to the ruling " and said the elections should be " carried out democratically without any undue interference . " the akp 's proposal must be voted into law by parliament for elections to be brought forward from their current november 4 date . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secularists remain wary of erdogan 's mildly islamist akp party the constitutional court said the presidential election process should begin anew because a quorum was lacking in friday 's first round .
presidential poll re-run on sunday parliament fixed a new timetable , setting the first round re-run the presidential election for sunday .
gul said he would not press ahead with his candidacy if he fails again . throwing down the gauntlet to the opposition , erdogan said the akp would also push for comprehensive constitutional amendments , including the election of the president by popular vote rather than by a parliamentary ballot . the financial markets welcomed the prospect of early elections , with the national index of the istanbul stock exchange rising by 1.67 percent and the turkish lira gaining ground against the dollar . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish high court annuls presidential vote turkey 's constitutional court on tuesday annulled the first round of a parliamentary vote for a new president in a move likely to pave the way for early general elections .
-lrb- 01.05.2007 -rrb- council of europe urges turkish army to stay out of elections the council of europe joined the growing chorus of disapproval over the statements made by the turkish army that effectively warned that it would defend turkey 's secular state if a new president threatened it .
-lrb- 30.04.2007 -rrb- over a million demonstrate in turkey for secularism , democracy more than one million people took part in a mass rally in istanbul sunday in support of secularism and democracy amid a tense stand-off between the islamist-rooted government and the army over presidential elections .

" both of them are official representatives of parties and policies that for the past 30 years have brought france to the brink of a political , economic , social , cultural and moral abyss , " le pen told cheering supporters in paris .
the national front leader , who stunned france in 2002 when he made it to the run-off presidential ballot against current president jacques chirac , urged his voters to " save their votes " for parliamentary elections in june .
" i call on voters who have shown their confidence in me to cast their vote neither for madame royal nor for mr. sarkozy , " le pen said in a speech in front of the ornate paris opera house after his party 's traditional may 1 parade .

the date for new election still needs to be approved by the entire parliament . ´ bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secularists suspect gul , left , and erdogan of having a hidden islamist agenda the current turkish political crisis erupted over widespread opposition to the prospect of an akp president because of concerns that the party is not truly committed to turkey 's fiercely guarded secular system and is eroding the separation of state and religion . tensions reached a climax late friday when the influential military accused the government of failing to prevent rising islamist activity and threatened to intervene .
the unusually harsh statement came hours after a parliament ballot - boycotted by the opposition - in which gul fell 10 votes short of the required two-thirds majority to make him turkey 's next president .
secular turks demonstrate more than one million pro-secular turks demonstrated in istanbul at the weekend against an akp president , after a similar mass rally two weeks earlier in ankara .
bildunterschrift : pro-secular demonstrators wave turkish flags during a rally in istanbul on sunday erdogan , who has led turkey since march 2003 , insisted wednesday that his party was committed to secularism . he also urged respect for differences - an apparent reference to objections raised over gul 's wife wearing the islamic headscarf , seen by secularists as a symbol of political islam . " the essential problem is to manage to stay united , preserving our differences , " he said .
" rights and freedoms are necessary for everybody . " pointing to the most popular slogan at the anti-akp protests , he said : " they say ' turkey is secular , it will remain secular ' .
we do not say anything different - yes , turkey is secular , it will remain secular . "
eu warns army the european union warned the army that it could harm turkey 's membership prospects if it interferes in politics . it urged all parties to respect the court 's decision " regardless of the unfortunate events leading to the ruling " and said the elections should be " carried out democratically without any undue interference . " the akp 's proposal must be voted into law by parliament for elections to be brought forward from their current november 4 date . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secularists remain wary of erdogan 's mildly islamist akp party the constitutional court said the presidential election process should begin anew because a quorum was lacking in friday 's first round .
presidential poll re-run on sunday parliament fixed a new timetable , setting the first round re-run the presidential election for sunday .
gul said he would not press ahead with his candidacy if he fails again . throwing down the gauntlet to the opposition , erdogan said the akp would also push for comprehensive constitutional amendments , including the election of the president by popular vote rather than by a parliamentary ballot . the financial markets welcomed the prospect of early elections , with the national index of the istanbul stock exchange rising by 1.67 percent and the turkish lira gaining ground against the dollar . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish high court annuls presidential vote turkey 's constitutional court on tuesday annulled the first round of a parliamentary vote for a new president in a move likely to pave the way for early general elections .

the move sparked protests , which rapidly spilled over into the worst rioting estonia has seen since the russian revolution . estonians see the monument as a symbol of their country 's illegal occupation by the soviet union , but most ethnic russians see it as a tribute to russians ' sacrifice in the victory over nazism . tensions increase kaljurand said her bodyguards were forced to use gas after members of the kremlin-backed nashi group broke into the newspaper offices where she was holding the press conference .

the question of who actually shot siegfried buback in april 1977 remains unresolved .
federal prosecutor monika harms re-opened the case this month after former raf member peter-jürgen boock indicated that christian klar , who had been sentenced to jail for numerous murders carried out by the extreme left-wing terrorists , was not the killer .
michael buback wrote that one witness , who said he had been sitting in his parked car next that of siegfried buback , heard the shots and saw two masked figures on a motorcycle .
the passenger had been holding a gun and could have been a woman , the man said in a newspaper article from the time .
buback wrote that another person had seen the motorcycle on the day before the assassination and had given testimony that the passenger sitting behind the driver was " small and delicate . "
buback said he had been irritated that only knut folkerts , christian klar and günter sonnenberg were mentioned as the perpetrators , although none of the men was shorter than 1.80 meters -lrb- 5 feet 9 inches -rrb- .

haniyeh used the meeting to call on " the international community to work with the national unity government in an official and direct manner as it represents the will of the palestinian people , " according to a statement from his office .
he also made another appealed for a direct aid embargo on his cabinet to be lifted .

" the eu has classified hamas as a terrorist organization and the eu leadership has boycotted hamas , " he told afp .

" giving legitimacy and recognition to an organization that refuses to support peace and refuses to renounce terrorism can not but strengthen that organization 's extremist agenda , " regev said .

but even the best forward , on the other hand , wo n't be popping in many goals , if he never gets the ball in the box . gladbach 's new argentine playmaker federico insua never seemed comfortable at borussia park .
nor did his potential back-ups michael delura and belgian bernd thijs .
together with countryman wesley sonck , thijs even succeeded in getting himself thrown off the squad . the result was that gladbach was unable to move the ball up the field with any control or coherence .

they 'll probably have to sell off their best young player , marcel jansen , and the heart and soul of the team , german international striker oliver neuville , is 34 years old and prone to injury . it may take a while for gladbach , previously a german soccer powerhouse , to recover from a dismal season of mistakes in management and midfield . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen blow gilt-edged chance to take bundesliga summit werder bremen coach thomas schaaf rued his side 's missed golden opportunity to go top of the bundesliga on sunday as they crashed to a shock 3-2 defeat at relegation-threatened arminia bielefeld .

shortly before documenta 12 opens its doors , the curators have introduced their architectonic concept . the white cube , an exhibition space painted entirely white , is history - at least at documenta 12 .
color is the order of the day .
" it 's good for painting and with photography .
we are indeed used to the white , but black-and-white photography simply comes across much better on colored walls , " said curator ruth noack .
noack admitted that not all artists were enthusiastic about the idea of showing their work on a salmon pink or olive green background .
but colorful surroundings for showing art are common in some countries .
thus , the thai artist who will show at documenta 12 - and whose name has n't yet been released - was very pleased with the pink room in which his buddha sculptures will be displayed , noack said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noack and buergel western european and american artists in particular are accustomed to the white cube , which always casts their work in a regular , controllable light .
there is , however , an older european tradition of hanging artworks on colorful walls .
creating a mood the documenta plans to use color to put contemporary art in the right perspective as well as to create a special atmosphere for visitors , said artistic director roger m. buergel .
" architecture is a medium that either makes you float or weighs you down .
and the moment that you start to establish relationships , it becomes something very light and happy , and for that you have to create an atmosphere - that 's why -lrb- we decided on -rrb- colors , " buergel said .
the artists ' desires also played a role , he said , requiring different architectural approaches .
" some want to be hidden , others want to be discovered , others want to be accentuated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fridericianum art hall is the heart of the show buergel was mainly referring to the exhibition 's interior architecture , seeing as almost all the buildings used for the documenta are decades - if not centuries - old .
architect tim hupe reconstructed some of the original interior architecture , such as rebuilding a flight of stairs that had been removed from one building in the 1980s .
hupe 's team also reopened walled-in windows to let natural light into the rooms .
some artists are especially keen to show their work in the intimate cabinet rooms of the classicist buildings .
greenhouses for art documenta 12 erected a temporary building for art that needs air and space : the crystal palace .
the wide halls built on a vast field look like greenhouses and give the impression of transparency .
but that was n't the aim .
" art needs to be protected from light and weather , and this building supplies that , " hupe said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crystal palace was erected only for this year 's documenta there are no permanent walls in the crystal palace so that the curators are free to install the art according to how they think it should be shown and put in partitions as they see fit .
" of course , you can only do something like this for a one-time thing like the documenta , " said hupe .
" there , one time , in one place , an art work will be shown . "

" we share the concerns about the increasing violence around the estonian embassy in moscow , " said an eu external relations spokeswoman , calling on russia to respect its international obligations on embassies and their staff .
on wednesday evening the german ambassador to moscow presented a diplomatic demarche to the russian government in the name of the whole eu , setting out the eu 's misgivings over the row , the german foreign ministry confirmed . earlier chancellor angela merkel had phoned estonian prime minister andrus ansip to assure him that germany was doing all it could to ease the row with russia , estonian officials said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the pro-kremlin youth group nashi block a newspaper building entrance in moscow also on wednesday , estonia closed its consulate within the embassy compound after pro-kremlin youth activists blocked diplomats and scuffled with the ambassador 's bodyguards in protest at the relocation of a soviet war memorial in the baltic state 's capital tallinn .
" the consulate 's business is stopped and we will not give visas until the situation is normalized around the embassy , " ambassador marina kaljurand told journalists shortly after the nashi -lrb- ours -rrb- youth group tried to disrupt her press conference .
consulates in pskov and saint petersburg will remain open for the time being , she said .
russia defiant the russian foreign ministry sounded a defiant note on wednesday as it responded to criticism of its handling of a row with estonia by laying the blame at tallinn 's door . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonian ambassador unpopular among protestors " the flame of passions and civil society 's reaction in russia were provoked by the actions of the estonian side , " foreign ministry spokesman mikhail kamynin said in remarks run by interfax . last thursday the estonian government ordered that a red army monument in central tallinn be relocated to a nearby war cemetery .
the move sparked protests , which rapidly spilled over into the worst rioting estonia has seen since the russian revolution . estonians see the monument as a symbol of their country 's illegal occupation by the soviet union , but most ethnic russians see it as a tribute to russians ' sacrifice in the victory over nazism . tensions increase kaljurand said her bodyguards were forced to use gas after members of the kremlin-backed nashi group broke into the newspaper offices where she was holding the press conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonian ambassador kaljurand speaks to the media after youth activists tried to attack her " there was an attack aimed at me , but no one got to me , " she said .
" there was a fight between my guards and activists from the nashi organization and the guards had to use gas . "
the estonian foreign ministry denounced the attack and called for a swift international response .
" physical attacks on the estonian republic 's diplomatic representative are unprecedented and absolutely unjustifiable .
these attacks call for immediate actions from the international community , " the foreign ministry in tallinn said in a statement .
call for european help tallinn has called for help from the european union and claims that the russian authorities are fomenting unrest in the former soviet republic .
" we hope that the whole issue behind this will be solved between the russian government and the estonian government through dialogue and negotiation , " the european commission spokeswoman said . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu pledges help in estonia-russia row the european union has promised to help end a virtual siege of the estonian embassy in moscow sparked by the removal of a soviet-era war memorial in tallinn , estonia 's foreign minister urmas paet said tuesday .

shortly before documenta 12 opens its doors , the curators have introduced their architectonic concept . the white cube , an exhibition space painted entirely white , is history - at least at documenta 12 .
color is the order of the day .
" it 's good for painting and with photography .
we are indeed used to the white , but black-and-white photography simply comes across much better on colored walls , " said curator ruth noack .
noack admitted that not all artists were enthusiastic about the idea of showing their work on a salmon pink or olive green background .
but colorful surroundings for showing art are common in some countries .
thus , the thai artist who will show at documenta 12 - and whose name has n't yet been released - was very pleased with the pink room in which his buddha sculptures will be displayed , noack said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noack and buergel western european and american artists in particular are accustomed to the white cube , which always casts their work in a regular , controllable light .
there is , however , an older european tradition of hanging artworks on colorful walls .
creating a mood the documenta plans to use color to put contemporary art in the right perspective as well as to create a special atmosphere for visitors , said artistic director roger m. buergel .
" architecture is a medium that either makes you float or weighs you down .
and the moment that you start to establish relationships , it becomes something very light and happy , and for that you have to create an atmosphere - that 's why -lrb- we decided on -rrb- colors , " buergel said .
the artists ' desires also played a role , he said , requiring different architectural approaches .
" some want to be hidden , others want to be discovered , others want to be accentuated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fridericianum art hall is the heart of the show buergel was mainly referring to the exhibition 's interior architecture , seeing as almost all the buildings used for the documenta are decades - if not centuries - old .
architect tim hupe reconstructed some of the original interior architecture , such as rebuilding a flight of stairs that had been removed from one building in the 1980s .
hupe 's team also reopened walled-in windows to let natural light into the rooms .
some artists are especially keen to show their work in the intimate cabinet rooms of the classicist buildings .
greenhouses for art documenta 12 erected a temporary building for art that needs air and space : the crystal palace .
the wide halls built on a vast field look like greenhouses and give the impression of transparency .
but that was n't the aim .
" art needs to be protected from light and weather , and this building supplies that , " hupe said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crystal palace was erected only for this year 's documenta there are no permanent walls in the crystal palace so that the curators are free to install the art according to how they think it should be shown and put in partitions as they see fit .
" of course , you can only do something like this for a one-time thing like the documenta , " said hupe .
" there , one time , in one place , an art work will be shown . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 02.05.2007 midfield , management outweigh money on soccer pitch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karlsruhe celebrated promotion in typical german fashion mönchengladbach invested millions only to get relegated .
karlsruhe kept the purse strings tight and have secured promotion with four matches left .
their stories are an object lesson in what clubs should and should n't do . second-division karlsruhe 's 1-0 win over unterhaching last weekend wo n't go down as one of history 's great matches .
but it was enough to ensure that the traditional southern german club returns to the first division for the first time in the new millennium . karlsruhe did everything right this season .
they won their first match 4-0 and were never worse than second in the table . karlsruhe 's march to the top shows that you do n't necessarily need masses of cash to be successful .
their budget for player salaries is only 13 million euros -lrb- $ 16 million -rrb- .
the team 's management did n't splash out for big names - most of the players on the squad are unfamiliar to anyone but hardcore fans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karlsruhe have n't been this good since ollie kahn played for the team karlsruhe 's strength is their midfield , built around german-italian playmaker giovanni federico .
once dismissed as an eternal prospect who never blossomed , federico has racked up 16 goals and 13 assists while karlsruhe dominated the second division like no team ever before . a lot of top-flight clubs could learn a lesson from karlsruhe 's success .
you can afford to be mediocre at the front or the back .
but it 's impossible to win without power in midfield , which is where , of course , most of soccer matches are played . gladbach disaster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : big spending gladbach are off to the second division borussia mönchengladbach 's 1-0 loss to stuttgart last weekend was n't the worst match they 'd played this season .
but it , combined with the other results , meant that gladbach will be relegated - after staying in first division since 2001 - regardless of the results in the last three games . gladbach 's demise is also edifying .
the team began the season by allowing a star coach , former champions league winner jupp heynckes , to spend almost as much as karlsruhe 's entire player budget to acquire new talent . defensively , gladbach were okay .
they 've only conceded 38 goals thus far - seventh best in the league .
it 's their offense , with a mere 22 goals to its name , that 's been atrocious . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playmaker insua was the most expensive transfer in gladbach history the poor performance up front comes down to a shoddy midfield .
given enough good chances , even the world 's worst striker will score .
but even the best forward , on the other hand , wo n't be popping in many goals , if he never gets the ball in the box . gladbach 's new argentine playmaker federico insua never seemed comfortable at borussia park .
nor did his potential back-ups michael delura and belgian bernd thijs .
together with countryman wesley sonck , thijs even succeeded in getting himself thrown off the squad . the result was that gladbach was unable to move the ball up the field with any control or coherence .
heynckes stepped down in february , but his successor jos luhukay could n't turn things around .
on paper he had the talent at his disposal , but on the pitch , that talent was too ill-matched to generate any consistent offensive pressure .
hello , second division . where they go from here bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karlsruhe will be playing bayern and bremen next year getting promoted is a huge challenge for any small side , while big clubs who get relegated are expected to regroup and rise again .
but do n't expect karlsruhe and gladbach 's fortunes necessarily to be reversed this time next season . karlsruhe will have to replace federico , who 's off to dortmund .
but even with their tiny budget , the german first division is mediocre enough that if karlsruhe invest wisely , they should be able to compete with all but the top teams . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youngster jansen is likely headed elsewhere meanwhile , gladbach are slashing their budget in half - from 60 million euros to 30 million euros -lrb- $ 78 to $ 39 million -rrb- .
they 'll probably have to sell off their best young player , marcel jansen , and the heart and soul of the team , german international striker oliver neuville , is 34 years old and prone to injury . it may take a while for gladbach , previously a german soccer powerhouse , to recover from a dismal season of mistakes in management and midfield . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen blow gilt-edged chance to take bundesliga summit werder bremen coach thomas schaaf rued his side 's missed golden opportunity to go top of the bundesliga on sunday as they crashed to a shock 3-2 defeat at relegation-threatened arminia bielefeld .

shortly before documenta 12 opens its doors , the curators have introduced their architectonic concept . the white cube , an exhibition space painted entirely white , is history - at least at documenta 12 .
color is the order of the day .
" it 's good for painting and with photography .
we are indeed used to the white , but black-and-white photography simply comes across much better on colored walls , " said curator ruth noack .
noack admitted that not all artists were enthusiastic about the idea of showing their work on a salmon pink or olive green background .
but colorful surroundings for showing art are common in some countries .
thus , the thai artist who will show at documenta 12 - and whose name has n't yet been released - was very pleased with the pink room in which his buddha sculptures will be displayed , noack said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noack and buergel western european and american artists in particular are accustomed to the white cube , which always casts their work in a regular , controllable light .
there is , however , an older european tradition of hanging artworks on colorful walls .
creating a mood the documenta plans to use color to put contemporary art in the right perspective as well as to create a special atmosphere for visitors , said artistic director roger m. buergel .
" architecture is a medium that either makes you float or weighs you down .
and the moment that you start to establish relationships , it becomes something very light and happy , and for that you have to create an atmosphere - that 's why -lrb- we decided on -rrb- colors , " buergel said .
the artists ' desires also played a role , he said , requiring different architectural approaches .
" some want to be hidden , others want to be discovered , others want to be accentuated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fridericianum art hall is the heart of the show buergel was mainly referring to the exhibition 's interior architecture , seeing as almost all the buildings used for the documenta are decades - if not centuries - old .
architect tim hupe reconstructed some of the original interior architecture , such as rebuilding a flight of stairs that had been removed from one building in the 1980s .
hupe 's team also reopened walled-in windows to let natural light into the rooms .
some artists are especially keen to show their work in the intimate cabinet rooms of the classicist buildings .
greenhouses for art documenta 12 erected a temporary building for art that needs air and space : the crystal palace .
the wide halls built on a vast field look like greenhouses and give the impression of transparency .
but that was n't the aim .
" art needs to be protected from light and weather , and this building supplies that , " hupe said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crystal palace was erected only for this year 's documenta there are no permanent walls in the crystal palace so that the curators are free to install the art according to how they think it should be shown and put in partitions as they see fit .
" of course , you can only do something like this for a one-time thing like the documenta , " said hupe .
" there , one time , in one place , an art work will be shown . "

" we share the concerns about the increasing violence around the estonian embassy in moscow , " said an eu external relations spokeswoman , calling on russia to respect its international obligations on embassies and their staff .
on wednesday evening the german ambassador to moscow presented a diplomatic demarche to the russian government in the name of the whole eu , setting out the eu 's misgivings over the row , the german foreign ministry confirmed . earlier chancellor angela merkel had phoned estonian prime minister andrus ansip to assure him that germany was doing all it could to ease the row with russia , estonian officials said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the pro-kremlin youth group nashi block a newspaper building entrance in moscow also on wednesday , estonia closed its consulate within the embassy compound after pro-kremlin youth activists blocked diplomats and scuffled with the ambassador 's bodyguards in protest at the relocation of a soviet war memorial in the baltic state 's capital tallinn .
" the consulate 's business is stopped and we will not give visas until the situation is normalized around the embassy , " ambassador marina kaljurand told journalists shortly after the nashi -lrb- ours -rrb- youth group tried to disrupt her press conference .
consulates in pskov and saint petersburg will remain open for the time being , she said .
russia defiant the russian foreign ministry sounded a defiant note on wednesday as it responded to criticism of its handling of a row with estonia by laying the blame at tallinn 's door . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonian ambassador unpopular among protestors " the flame of passions and civil society 's reaction in russia were provoked by the actions of the estonian side , " foreign ministry spokesman mikhail kamynin said in remarks run by interfax . last thursday the estonian government ordered that a red army monument in central tallinn be relocated to a nearby war cemetery .
the move sparked protests , which rapidly spilled over into the worst rioting estonia has seen since the russian revolution . estonians see the monument as a symbol of their country 's illegal occupation by the soviet union , but most ethnic russians see it as a tribute to russians ' sacrifice in the victory over nazism . tensions increase kaljurand said her bodyguards were forced to use gas after members of the kremlin-backed nashi group broke into the newspaper offices where she was holding the press conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonian ambassador kaljurand speaks to the media after youth activists tried to attack her " there was an attack aimed at me , but no one got to me , " she said .
" there was a fight between my guards and activists from the nashi organization and the guards had to use gas . "
the estonian foreign ministry denounced the attack and called for a swift international response .
" physical attacks on the estonian republic 's diplomatic representative are unprecedented and absolutely unjustifiable .
these attacks call for immediate actions from the international community , " the foreign ministry in tallinn said in a statement .
call for european help tallinn has called for help from the european union and claims that the russian authorities are fomenting unrest in the former soviet republic .
" we hope that the whole issue behind this will be solved between the russian government and the estonian government through dialogue and negotiation , " the european commission spokeswoman said . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu pledges help in estonia-russia row the european union has promised to help end a virtual siege of the estonian embassy in moscow sparked by the removal of a soviet-era war memorial in tallinn , estonia 's foreign minister urmas paet said tuesday .

schäuble , a conservative , insisted that progress had been made " on many points " and said open and frank discussions were the only way forward to ease the integration of muslims in german society .
" we all agreed that this process is the right one and that it has made progress .
it was a step in the right direction , " schäuble told journalists after the meeting .
but the head of the central council of muslims , ayyub axel köhler , said : " we can not go on like this , debating without any aim . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sitting at the same table at least " there must be an evaluation of this whole process , " he said .
" we need to set concrete goals and we need to lay out a roadmap . " the meeting with schäuble was a review of the first seven months of negotiations in working parties on plans for islam classes for muslims in german public schools and mosque demands for legal rights similar to churches .
no agreements have been reached yet .
who represents whom much of the debate ahead of the meeting focused on the role of the recently formed muslim coordination council , a move which interior minister schäuble has welcomed .
the council is an umbrella group comprising the central council of muslims and three other organizations : the turkish islamic union for religious affairs , the islamic council and the association of islamic cultural centers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nearly three and a half million muslims live in germany the groups have said they would try to find a joint stance on issues such as immigration , integration and extremism , while remaining independent . but since it only represents the 300,000 people who belong to islamic organizations , schäuble says its ability to speak for the 3.4 million muslims living in germany is limited .
of germany 's muslims , about 2.4 million are turks or people of turkish descent , many of them children and grandchildren of guest workers invited to germany in the 1960s and 1970s .
another 200,000 muslims in germany come from north africa .

schäuble , a conservative , insisted that progress had been made " on many points " and said open and frank discussions were the only way forward to ease the integration of muslims in german society .
" we all agreed that this process is the right one and that it has made progress .
it was a step in the right direction , " schäuble told journalists after the meeting .
but the head of the central council of muslims , ayyub axel köhler , said : " we can not go on like this , debating without any aim . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sitting at the same table at least " there must be an evaluation of this whole process , " he said .
" we need to set concrete goals and we need to lay out a roadmap . " the meeting with schäuble was a review of the first seven months of negotiations in working parties on plans for islam classes for muslims in german public schools and mosque demands for legal rights similar to churches .

of germany 's muslims , about 2.4 million are turks or people of turkish descent , many of them children and grandchildren of guest workers invited to germany in the 1960s and 1970s .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nearly three and a half million muslims live in germany the groups have said they would try to find a joint stance on issues such as immigration , integration and extremism , while remaining independent . but since it only represents the 300,000 people who belong to islamic organizations , schäuble says its ability to speak for the 3.4 million muslims living in germany is limited .
of germany 's muslims , about 2.4 million are turks or people of turkish descent , many of them children and grandchildren of guest workers invited to germany in the 1960s and 1970s .
another 200,000 muslims in germany come from north africa .
there are also about 55,000 afghans in the community , 60,000 iranians and 160,000 bosnian muslims , according to official estimates . germany 's muslim community is overwhelmingly sunni .
divisions among muslims there were some divisions between religious and secular muslims which came to light during the meeting , in particular when it came to women 's dress and the mixing of the sexes . the government and secularists have rejected complaints by conservative muslim families about girls wearing swimsuits in the presence of boys while being taught swimming at german schools . schäuble said it was the " rule " in germany that girls and boys were educated in school together .
he said he had heard the objections to mixed sports , adding : " we will continue to be talking about this . "
the first meeting of the groups with the government last september was overshadowed by a row over the staging in berlin of a mozart opera , " idomeneo , " which featured the severed head of the prophet mohammed in one scene .
the opera was pulled from the schedule over fears of violent protests by islamic radicals , but was staged later amid tight security . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new umbrella organization to represent muslims in germany islamic associations in germany have announced they have founded an umbrella organization .

on wednesday evening the german ambassador to moscow presented a diplomatic demarche to the russian government in the name of the whole eu , setting out the eu 's misgivings over the row , the german foreign ministry confirmed . earlier chancellor angela merkel had phoned estonian prime minister andrus ansip to assure him that germany was doing all it could to ease the row with russia , estonian officials said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the pro-kremlin youth group nashi block a newspaper building entrance in moscow also on wednesday , estonia closed its consulate within the embassy compound after pro-kremlin youth activists blocked diplomats and scuffled with the ambassador 's bodyguards in protest at the relocation of a soviet war memorial in the baltic state 's capital tallinn .

the move sparked protests , which rapidly spilled over into the worst rioting estonia has seen since the russian revolution . estonians see the monument as a symbol of their country 's illegal occupation by the soviet union , but most ethnic russians see it as a tribute to russians ' sacrifice in the victory over nazism . tensions increase kaljurand said her bodyguards were forced to use gas after members of the kremlin-backed nashi group broke into the newspaper offices where she was holding the press conference .

shortly before documenta 12 opens its doors , the curators have introduced their architectonic concept . the white cube , an exhibition space painted entirely white , is history - at least at documenta 12 .
color is the order of the day .
" it 's good for painting and with photography .
we are indeed used to the white , but black-and-white photography simply comes across much better on colored walls , " said curator ruth noack .
noack admitted that not all artists were enthusiastic about the idea of showing their work on a salmon pink or olive green background .
but colorful surroundings for showing art are common in some countries .
thus , the thai artist who will show at documenta 12 - and whose name has n't yet been released - was very pleased with the pink room in which his buddha sculptures will be displayed , noack said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noack and buergel western european and american artists in particular are accustomed to the white cube , which always casts their work in a regular , controllable light .
there is , however , an older european tradition of hanging artworks on colorful walls .
creating a mood the documenta plans to use color to put contemporary art in the right perspective as well as to create a special atmosphere for visitors , said artistic director roger m. buergel .
" architecture is a medium that either makes you float or weighs you down .
and the moment that you start to establish relationships , it becomes something very light and happy , and for that you have to create an atmosphere - that 's why -lrb- we decided on -rrb- colors , " buergel said .
the artists ' desires also played a role , he said , requiring different architectural approaches .
" some want to be hidden , others want to be discovered , others want to be accentuated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fridericianum art hall is the heart of the show buergel was mainly referring to the exhibition 's interior architecture , seeing as almost all the buildings used for the documenta are decades - if not centuries - old .
architect tim hupe reconstructed some of the original interior architecture , such as rebuilding a flight of stairs that had been removed from one building in the 1980s .
hupe 's team also reopened walled-in windows to let natural light into the rooms .
some artists are especially keen to show their work in the intimate cabinet rooms of the classicist buildings .
greenhouses for art documenta 12 erected a temporary building for art that needs air and space : the crystal palace .
the wide halls built on a vast field look like greenhouses and give the impression of transparency .
but that was n't the aim .
" art needs to be protected from light and weather , and this building supplies that , " hupe said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crystal palace was erected only for this year 's documenta there are no permanent walls in the crystal palace so that the curators are free to install the art according to how they think it should be shown and put in partitions as they see fit .
" of course , you can only do something like this for a one-time thing like the documenta , " said hupe .
" there , one time , in one place , an art work will be shown . "

shortly before documenta 12 opens its doors , the curators have introduced their architectonic concept . the white cube , an exhibition space painted entirely white , is history - at least at documenta 12 .
color is the order of the day .
" it 's good for painting and with photography .
we are indeed used to the white , but black-and-white photography simply comes across much better on colored walls , " said curator ruth noack .
noack admitted that not all artists were enthusiastic about the idea of showing their work on a salmon pink or olive green background .
but colorful surroundings for showing art are common in some countries .
thus , the thai artist who will show at documenta 12 - and whose name has n't yet been released - was very pleased with the pink room in which his buddha sculptures will be displayed , noack said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noack and buergel western european and american artists in particular are accustomed to the white cube , which always casts their work in a regular , controllable light .
there is , however , an older european tradition of hanging artworks on colorful walls .
creating a mood the documenta plans to use color to put contemporary art in the right perspective as well as to create a special atmosphere for visitors , said artistic director roger m. buergel .
" architecture is a medium that either makes you float or weighs you down .
and the moment that you start to establish relationships , it becomes something very light and happy , and for that you have to create an atmosphere - that 's why -lrb- we decided on -rrb- colors , " buergel said .
the artists ' desires also played a role , he said , requiring different architectural approaches .
" some want to be hidden , others want to be discovered , others want to be accentuated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fridericianum art hall is the heart of the show buergel was mainly referring to the exhibition 's interior architecture , seeing as almost all the buildings used for the documenta are decades - if not centuries - old .
architect tim hupe reconstructed some of the original interior architecture , such as rebuilding a flight of stairs that had been removed from one building in the 1980s .
hupe 's team also reopened walled-in windows to let natural light into the rooms .
some artists are especially keen to show their work in the intimate cabinet rooms of the classicist buildings .
greenhouses for art documenta 12 erected a temporary building for art that needs air and space : the crystal palace .
the wide halls built on a vast field look like greenhouses and give the impression of transparency .
but that was n't the aim .
" art needs to be protected from light and weather , and this building supplies that , " hupe said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crystal palace was erected only for this year 's documenta there are no permanent walls in the crystal palace so that the curators are free to install the art according to how they think it should be shown and put in partitions as they see fit .
" of course , you can only do something like this for a one-time thing like the documenta , " said hupe .
" there , one time , in one place , an art work will be shown . "

karlsruhe kept the purse strings tight and have secured promotion with four matches left .
their stories are an object lesson in what clubs should and should n't do . second-division karlsruhe 's 1-0 win over unterhaching last weekend wo n't go down as one of history 's great matches .
but it was enough to ensure that the traditional southern german club returns to the first division for the first time in the new millennium . karlsruhe did everything right this season .
they won their first match 4-0 and were never worse than second in the table . karlsruhe 's march to the top shows that you do n't necessarily need masses of cash to be successful .
their budget for player salaries is only 13 million euros -lrb- $ 16 million -rrb- .
the team 's management did n't splash out for big names - most of the players on the squad are unfamiliar to anyone but hardcore fans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karlsruhe have n't been this good since ollie kahn played for the team karlsruhe 's strength is their midfield , built around german-italian playmaker giovanni federico .
once dismissed as an eternal prospect who never blossomed , federico has racked up 16 goals and 13 assists while karlsruhe dominated the second division like no team ever before . a lot of top-flight clubs could learn a lesson from karlsruhe 's success .
you can afford to be mediocre at the front or the back .
but it 's impossible to win without power in midfield , which is where , of course , most of soccer matches are played . gladbach disaster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : big spending gladbach are off to the second division borussia mönchengladbach 's 1-0 loss to stuttgart last weekend was n't the worst match they 'd played this season .
but it , combined with the other results , meant that gladbach will be relegated - after staying in first division since 2001 - regardless of the results in the last three games . gladbach 's demise is also edifying .
the team began the season by allowing a star coach , former champions league winner jupp heynckes , to spend almost as much as karlsruhe 's entire player budget to acquire new talent . defensively , gladbach were okay .
they 've only conceded 38 goals thus far - seventh best in the league .
it 's their offense , with a mere 22 goals to its name , that 's been atrocious . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playmaker insua was the most expensive transfer in gladbach history the poor performance up front comes down to a shoddy midfield .
given enough good chances , even the world 's worst striker will score .
but even the best forward , on the other hand , wo n't be popping in many goals , if he never gets the ball in the box . gladbach 's new argentine playmaker federico insua never seemed comfortable at borussia park .
nor did his potential back-ups michael delura and belgian bernd thijs .
together with countryman wesley sonck , thijs even succeeded in getting himself thrown off the squad . the result was that gladbach was unable to move the ball up the field with any control or coherence .
heynckes stepped down in february , but his successor jos luhukay could n't turn things around .
on paper he had the talent at his disposal , but on the pitch , that talent was too ill-matched to generate any consistent offensive pressure .
hello , second division . where they go from here bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karlsruhe will be playing bayern and bremen next year getting promoted is a huge challenge for any small side , while big clubs who get relegated are expected to regroup and rise again .
but do n't expect karlsruhe and gladbach 's fortunes necessarily to be reversed this time next season . karlsruhe will have to replace federico , who 's off to dortmund .
but even with their tiny budget , the german first division is mediocre enough that if karlsruhe invest wisely , they should be able to compete with all but the top teams . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youngster jansen is likely headed elsewhere meanwhile , gladbach are slashing their budget in half - from 60 million euros to 30 million euros -lrb- $ 78 to $ 39 million -rrb- .
they 'll probably have to sell off their best young player , marcel jansen , and the heart and soul of the team , german international striker oliver neuville , is 34 years old and prone to injury . it may take a while for gladbach , previously a german soccer powerhouse , to recover from a dismal season of mistakes in management and midfield . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen blow gilt-edged chance to take bundesliga summit werder bremen coach thomas schaaf rued his side 's missed golden opportunity to go top of the bundesliga on sunday as they crashed to a shock 3-2 defeat at relegation-threatened arminia bielefeld .

but it , combined with the other results , meant that gladbach will be relegated - after staying in first division since 2001 - regardless of the results in the last three games . gladbach 's demise is also edifying .
the team began the season by allowing a star coach , former champions league winner jupp heynckes , to spend almost as much as karlsruhe 's entire player budget to acquire new talent . defensively , gladbach were okay .
they 've only conceded 38 goals thus far - seventh best in the league .
it 's their offense , with a mere 22 goals to its name , that 's been atrocious . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playmaker insua was the most expensive transfer in gladbach history the poor performance up front comes down to a shoddy midfield .
given enough good chances , even the world 's worst striker will score .
but even the best forward , on the other hand , wo n't be popping in many goals , if he never gets the ball in the box . gladbach 's new argentine playmaker federico insua never seemed comfortable at borussia park .
nor did his potential back-ups michael delura and belgian bernd thijs .
together with countryman wesley sonck , thijs even succeeded in getting himself thrown off the squad . the result was that gladbach was unable to move the ball up the field with any control or coherence .
heynckes stepped down in february , but his successor jos luhukay could n't turn things around .
on paper he had the talent at his disposal , but on the pitch , that talent was too ill-matched to generate any consistent offensive pressure .
hello , second division . where they go from here bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karlsruhe will be playing bayern and bremen next year getting promoted is a huge challenge for any small side , while big clubs who get relegated are expected to regroup and rise again .
but do n't expect karlsruhe and gladbach 's fortunes necessarily to be reversed this time next season . karlsruhe will have to replace federico , who 's off to dortmund .
but even with their tiny budget , the german first division is mediocre enough that if karlsruhe invest wisely , they should be able to compete with all but the top teams . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youngster jansen is likely headed elsewhere meanwhile , gladbach are slashing their budget in half - from 60 million euros to 30 million euros -lrb- $ 78 to $ 39 million -rrb- .
they 'll probably have to sell off their best young player , marcel jansen , and the heart and soul of the team , german international striker oliver neuville , is 34 years old and prone to injury . it may take a while for gladbach , previously a german soccer powerhouse , to recover from a dismal season of mistakes in management and midfield . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen blow gilt-edged chance to take bundesliga summit werder bremen coach thomas schaaf rued his side 's missed golden opportunity to go top of the bundesliga on sunday as they crashed to a shock 3-2 defeat at relegation-threatened arminia bielefeld .

liverpool now hope to repeat their 2005 title . it was a tactical match on tuesday at anfield between two teams whose coaches have developed an intense - and mutual - dislike for each other .
once again rafael benitez and liverpool came out tops in a game that was long on drama , if short on highlights . liverpool needed to make up for their 1-0 loss in the first leg at stamford bridge last week , and in the 22nd minute , steven gerrard wrong-footed chelsea with a free kick crossed not into but outside of the box . danish defender daniel agger booted the ball into the net through three of his opponents to draw liverpool level on aggregate .
it was agger 's first-ever champions league goal . chelsea pay for passivity bildunterschrift : agger 's first champions league goal could n't have been more timely with the result on a knife edge , neither team was willing to risk much .
chelsea , playing without injured stars andriy shevchenko and michael ballack , created a few chances for super-striker didier drogba , but mostly he was left stranded . liverpool , meanwhile , pounded the ball in the air to striker peter crouch , but 90 minutes were n't enough for the side to deliver the knock-out punch . liverpool did find the back of the net in extra time , after dirk kuyt pounced on a rebound from chelsea keeper petr cech .
but that goal was disallowed after the dutch striker was ruled offside in a call that is sure to have led to loud debates in pubs across england . dutchmen hold nerves in shoot-out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liverpool keeper pepe reina was the man of the match liverpool 's boudewijn zenden was first to step up to the spot in the penalty shoot-out , and he made no mistake .
pepe reina then held against arjen robben , and after liverpool converted their next two , the pressure was on substitute njitap geremi . geremi was no match for reina , and a decisive blast by kuyt sent liverpool into the champions league final . morinho 's future is in doubt after yet another bitter champions league exit .
liverpool will get a chance to claim their sixth european club championship on may 23 in athens . manchester united play ac milan in italy on wednesday to determine the other finalist .
man u won the first leg 3-2 . liverpool probably hope milan prevail since that would put history on their side .
in 2005 , the reds won the champions league final , coming back from 3-0 down to beat the italians in the final .

" i call on voters who have shown their confidence in me to cast their vote neither for madame royal nor for mr. sarkozy , " le pen said in a speech in front of the ornate paris opera house after his party 's traditional may 1 parade .

haniyeh used the meeting to call on " the international community to work with the national unity government in an official and direct manner as it represents the will of the palestinian people , " according to a statement from his office .
he also made another appealed for a direct aid embargo on his cabinet to be lifted .
triantaphyllides told the afp news agency the delegation had come to gaza " to see exactly what the situation is because we are for helping and finding a solution to the problem . "
" we consider this government as an opportunity to facilitate the peace process , " he said .
israel denounces eu-hamas meeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gaza remains a volatile place the eu , along with israel and the united states , considers hamas a terrorist organization , and froze direct aid and diplomatic contacts with the palestinian government after the islamist movement first formed a cabinet last year .
many palestinians thought aid payments would be reinstated when hamas on march 17 formed a unity cabinet with president mahmud abbas ' secular fatah faction and western-backed independents , but the west has so far refused to lift the freeze .
the eu and us are demanding that the government explicitly recognize israel , renounce violence and agree to abide by past peace deals for the aid to resume .
israeli foreign ministry spokesman mark regev criticized tuesday 's meeting .
" the eu has classified hamas as a terrorist organization and the eu leadership has boycotted hamas , " he told afp .
" thankfully this delegation does not speak for the eu .
" giving legitimacy and recognition to an organization that refuses to support peace and refuses to renounce terrorism can not but strengthen that organization 's extremist agenda , " regev said .
olmert under mounting pressure to resign separately , israeli prime minister ehud olmert 's political future appeared increasingly uncertain on wednesday as pressure mounted on him to resign for his handling of the lebanon war last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert is under mounting pressure to resign an official report into the war has sharply criticized what it called olmert 's " serious failures . "
the winograd commission said the cabinet rubber-stamped the decision to go to war but olmert bore " supreme responsibility " for launching the air , sea and land assaults without a proper plan after hezbollah seized two israeli soldiers on july 12 .
during the 34-day campaign in which hezbollah rained 4,000 rockets on israel and israeli warplanes pounded southern beirut , more than 1,000 people were killed in lebanon , including about 900 civilians , while 117 israeli troops died along with 41 civilians caught in the rocket strikes in northern israel .

schäuble , a conservative , insisted that progress had been made " on many points " and said open and frank discussions were the only way forward to ease the integration of muslims in german society .
" we all agreed that this process is the right one and that it has made progress .
it was a step in the right direction , " schäuble told journalists after the meeting .
but the head of the central council of muslims , ayyub axel köhler , said : " we can not go on like this , debating without any aim . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sitting at the same table at least " there must be an evaluation of this whole process , " he said .
" we need to set concrete goals and we need to lay out a roadmap . " the meeting with schäuble was a review of the first seven months of negotiations in working parties on plans for islam classes for muslims in german public schools and mosque demands for legal rights similar to churches .
no agreements have been reached yet .
who represents whom much of the debate ahead of the meeting focused on the role of the recently formed muslim coordination council , a move which interior minister schäuble has welcomed .
the council is an umbrella group comprising the central council of muslims and three other organizations : the turkish islamic union for religious affairs , the islamic council and the association of islamic cultural centers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nearly three and a half million muslims live in germany the groups have said they would try to find a joint stance on issues such as immigration , integration and extremism , while remaining independent . but since it only represents the 300,000 people who belong to islamic organizations , schäuble says its ability to speak for the 3.4 million muslims living in germany is limited .
of germany 's muslims , about 2.4 million are turks or people of turkish descent , many of them children and grandchildren of guest workers invited to germany in the 1960s and 1970s .
another 200,000 muslims in germany come from north africa .
there are also about 55,000 afghans in the community , 60,000 iranians and 160,000 bosnian muslims , according to official estimates . germany 's muslim community is overwhelmingly sunni .
divisions among muslims there were some divisions between religious and secular muslims which came to light during the meeting , in particular when it came to women 's dress and the mixing of the sexes . the government and secularists have rejected complaints by conservative muslim families about girls wearing swimsuits in the presence of boys while being taught swimming at german schools . schäuble said it was the " rule " in germany that girls and boys were educated in school together .
he said he had heard the objections to mixed sports , adding : " we will continue to be talking about this . "
the first meeting of the groups with the government last september was overshadowed by a row over the staging in berlin of a mozart opera , " idomeneo , " which featured the severed head of the prophet mohammed in one scene .
the opera was pulled from the schedule over fears of violent protests by islamic radicals , but was staged later amid tight security . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new umbrella organization to represent muslims in germany islamic associations in germany have announced they have founded an umbrella organization .

" we share the concerns about the increasing violence around the estonian embassy in moscow , " said an eu external relations spokeswoman , calling on russia to respect its international obligations on embassies and their staff .
on wednesday evening the german ambassador to moscow presented a diplomatic demarche to the russian government in the name of the whole eu , setting out the eu 's misgivings over the row , the german foreign ministry confirmed . earlier chancellor angela merkel had phoned estonian prime minister andrus ansip to assure him that germany was doing all it could to ease the row with russia , estonian officials said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the pro-kremlin youth group nashi block a newspaper building entrance in moscow also on wednesday , estonia closed its consulate within the embassy compound after pro-kremlin youth activists blocked diplomats and scuffled with the ambassador 's bodyguards in protest at the relocation of a soviet war memorial in the baltic state 's capital tallinn .
" the consulate 's business is stopped and we will not give visas until the situation is normalized around the embassy , " ambassador marina kaljurand told journalists shortly after the nashi -lrb- ours -rrb- youth group tried to disrupt her press conference .
consulates in pskov and saint petersburg will remain open for the time being , she said .
russia defiant the russian foreign ministry sounded a defiant note on wednesday as it responded to criticism of its handling of a row with estonia by laying the blame at tallinn 's door . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonian ambassador unpopular among protestors " the flame of passions and civil society 's reaction in russia were provoked by the actions of the estonian side , " foreign ministry spokesman mikhail kamynin said in remarks run by interfax . last thursday the estonian government ordered that a red army monument in central tallinn be relocated to a nearby war cemetery .
the move sparked protests , which rapidly spilled over into the worst rioting estonia has seen since the russian revolution . estonians see the monument as a symbol of their country 's illegal occupation by the soviet union , but most ethnic russians see it as a tribute to russians ' sacrifice in the victory over nazism . tensions increase kaljurand said her bodyguards were forced to use gas after members of the kremlin-backed nashi group broke into the newspaper offices where she was holding the press conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonian ambassador kaljurand speaks to the media after youth activists tried to attack her " there was an attack aimed at me , but no one got to me , " she said .
" there was a fight between my guards and activists from the nashi organization and the guards had to use gas . "
the estonian foreign ministry denounced the attack and called for a swift international response .
" physical attacks on the estonian republic 's diplomatic representative are unprecedented and absolutely unjustifiable .

the move sparked protests , which rapidly spilled over into the worst rioting estonia has seen since the russian revolution . estonians see the monument as a symbol of their country 's illegal occupation by the soviet union , but most ethnic russians see it as a tribute to russians ' sacrifice in the victory over nazism . tensions increase kaljurand said her bodyguards were forced to use gas after members of the kremlin-backed nashi group broke into the newspaper offices where she was holding the press conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonian ambassador kaljurand speaks to the media after youth activists tried to attack her " there was an attack aimed at me , but no one got to me , " she said .
" there was a fight between my guards and activists from the nashi organization and the guards had to use gas . "
the estonian foreign ministry denounced the attack and called for a swift international response .
" physical attacks on the estonian republic 's diplomatic representative are unprecedented and absolutely unjustifiable .
these attacks call for immediate actions from the international community , " the foreign ministry in tallinn said in a statement .
call for european help tallinn has called for help from the european union and claims that the russian authorities are fomenting unrest in the former soviet republic .
" we hope that the whole issue behind this will be solved between the russian government and the estonian government through dialogue and negotiation , " the european commission spokeswoman said . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu pledges help in estonia-russia row the european union has promised to help end a virtual siege of the estonian embassy in moscow sparked by the removal of a soviet-era war memorial in tallinn , estonia 's foreign minister urmas paet said tuesday .

shortly before documenta 12 opens its doors , the curators have introduced their architectonic concept . the white cube , an exhibition space painted entirely white , is history - at least at documenta 12 .
color is the order of the day .
" it 's good for painting and with photography .
we are indeed used to the white , but black-and-white photography simply comes across much better on colored walls , " said curator ruth noack .
noack admitted that not all artists were enthusiastic about the idea of showing their work on a salmon pink or olive green background .
but colorful surroundings for showing art are common in some countries .
thus , the thai artist who will show at documenta 12 - and whose name has n't yet been released - was very pleased with the pink room in which his buddha sculptures will be displayed , noack said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noack and buergel western european and american artists in particular are accustomed to the white cube , which always casts their work in a regular , controllable light .
there is , however , an older european tradition of hanging artworks on colorful walls .
creating a mood the documenta plans to use color to put contemporary art in the right perspective as well as to create a special atmosphere for visitors , said artistic director roger m. buergel .
" architecture is a medium that either makes you float or weighs you down .
and the moment that you start to establish relationships , it becomes something very light and happy , and for that you have to create an atmosphere - that 's why -lrb- we decided on -rrb- colors , " buergel said .
the artists ' desires also played a role , he said , requiring different architectural approaches .
" some want to be hidden , others want to be discovered , others want to be accentuated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fridericianum art hall is the heart of the show buergel was mainly referring to the exhibition 's interior architecture , seeing as almost all the buildings used for the documenta are decades - if not centuries - old .
architect tim hupe reconstructed some of the original interior architecture , such as rebuilding a flight of stairs that had been removed from one building in the 1980s .
hupe 's team also reopened walled-in windows to let natural light into the rooms .
some artists are especially keen to show their work in the intimate cabinet rooms of the classicist buildings .
greenhouses for art documenta 12 erected a temporary building for art that needs air and space : the crystal palace .
the wide halls built on a vast field look like greenhouses and give the impression of transparency .
but that was n't the aim .
" art needs to be protected from light and weather , and this building supplies that , " hupe said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crystal palace was erected only for this year 's documenta there are no permanent walls in the crystal palace so that the curators are free to install the art according to how they think it should be shown and put in partitions as they see fit .
" of course , you can only do something like this for a one-time thing like the documenta , " said hupe .
" there , one time , in one place , an art work will be shown . "

shortly before documenta 12 opens its doors , the curators have introduced their architectonic concept . the white cube , an exhibition space painted entirely white , is history - at least at documenta 12 .
color is the order of the day .
" it 's good for painting and with photography .
we are indeed used to the white , but black-and-white photography simply comes across much better on colored walls , " said curator ruth noack .
noack admitted that not all artists were enthusiastic about the idea of showing their work on a salmon pink or olive green background .
but colorful surroundings for showing art are common in some countries .
thus , the thai artist who will show at documenta 12 - and whose name has n't yet been released - was very pleased with the pink room in which his buddha sculptures will be displayed , noack said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noack and buergel western european and american artists in particular are accustomed to the white cube , which always casts their work in a regular , controllable light .
there is , however , an older european tradition of hanging artworks on colorful walls .
creating a mood the documenta plans to use color to put contemporary art in the right perspective as well as to create a special atmosphere for visitors , said artistic director roger m. buergel .
" architecture is a medium that either makes you float or weighs you down .
and the moment that you start to establish relationships , it becomes something very light and happy , and for that you have to create an atmosphere - that 's why -lrb- we decided on -rrb- colors , " buergel said .
the artists ' desires also played a role , he said , requiring different architectural approaches .
" some want to be hidden , others want to be discovered , others want to be accentuated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fridericianum art hall is the heart of the show buergel was mainly referring to the exhibition 's interior architecture , seeing as almost all the buildings used for the documenta are decades - if not centuries - old .
architect tim hupe reconstructed some of the original interior architecture , such as rebuilding a flight of stairs that had been removed from one building in the 1980s .
hupe 's team also reopened walled-in windows to let natural light into the rooms .
some artists are especially keen to show their work in the intimate cabinet rooms of the classicist buildings .
greenhouses for art documenta 12 erected a temporary building for art that needs air and space : the crystal palace .
the wide halls built on a vast field look like greenhouses and give the impression of transparency .
but that was n't the aim .
" art needs to be protected from light and weather , and this building supplies that , " hupe said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crystal palace was erected only for this year 's documenta there are no permanent walls in the crystal palace so that the curators are free to install the art according to how they think it should be shown and put in partitions as they see fit .
" of course , you can only do something like this for a one-time thing like the documenta , " said hupe .
" there , one time , in one place , an art work will be shown . "
documenta 12 opens to the public on june 16 and runs until sept .

he 's to be the subject of a new book aimed at educating people about climate change . knut the baby polar bear has been basking in international adoration since his debut at the berlin zoo .
now he 's about to do his part in saving the world from environmental catastrophe . the american publisher scholastic , which also publishes the harry potter books , is to distribute a children 's book about the little bear aimed at educating people about global warming .
the book , entitled " knut : how one little polar bear captivated the world , " is being penned by best-selling author craig hatkoff and his daughters juliana and isabella and will relate the bear 's story - first in german this summer , then in english in the fall - along with plenty of pictures .

unsuspecting environmental activist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is all the fame turning knut into a little narcissus ?
the five-month old bear has been hand-raised by a berlin zookeeper after being rejected by his mother .
he has become a symbol for the plight of polar bears and their habitat , which is under threat by rising global temperatures .
" we are hoping that a little polar bear can help the world de-polarize the complex issues … and raise awareness of the issues in the global climate debate , " hatkoff told reuters .
the berlin zoo has already launched its own campaign called " respect habitats.knut , " complete with a knut logo that is to serve as a seal of approval for measures taken to address climate change and other environmental issues .
gerald uhlich , chief executive of berlin zoo , told reuters that part of the book sale proceeds will be contributed to this goal .
" surely , knut will win the hearts of millions of readers and raise their awareness to environmental issues across the world , " he said in a statement . knut is likely unaware of his potential impact on the globe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 02.05.2007 turkish parliament sets new presidential vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the row over the presidency has exposed deep divisions in turkey a turkish parliamentary committee set july 22 as the date for snap general elections after prime minister recep tayyip erdogan called for polls to end a simmering crisis over a disputed presidential vote . erdogan 's ruling islamist-rooted justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- formally proposed bringing parliamentary elections forward to june 24 as a way out of a crisis that has resulted in a dangerous standoff between the government and the staunchly secularist armed forces . the move came a day after the constitutional court annulled friday 's first-round parliamentary vote for a new president , in which erdogan 's closest aide , foreign minister abdullah gul , was the sole candidate . the ruling " almost made it impossible " to elect a president in parliament and was " a bullet fired at democracy , " erdogan said in an impassioned speech to party deputies . the turkish parliament 's constitutional committee said general elections should be held on july 22 instead of in june , as erdogan had requested .
the date for new election still needs to be approved by the entire parliament . ´ bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secularists suspect gul , left , and erdogan of having a hidden islamist agenda the current turkish political crisis erupted over widespread opposition to the prospect of an akp president because of concerns that the party is not truly committed to turkey 's fiercely guarded secular system and is eroding the separation of state and religion . tensions reached a climax late friday when the influential military accused the government of failing to prevent rising islamist activity and threatened to intervene .
the unusually harsh statement came hours after a parliament ballot - boycotted by the opposition - in which gul fell 10 votes short of the required two-thirds majority to make him turkey 's next president .
secular turks demonstrate more than one million pro-secular turks demonstrated in istanbul at the weekend against an akp president , after a similar mass rally two weeks earlier in ankara .
bildunterschrift : pro-secular demonstrators wave turkish flags during a rally in istanbul on sunday erdogan , who has led turkey since march 2003 , insisted wednesday that his party was committed to secularism . he also urged respect for differences - an apparent reference to objections raised over gul 's wife wearing the islamic headscarf , seen by secularists as a symbol of political islam . " the essential problem is to manage to stay united , preserving our differences , " he said .
" rights and freedoms are necessary for everybody . " pointing to the most popular slogan at the anti-akp protests , he said : " they say ' turkey is secular , it will remain secular ' .
we do not say anything different - yes , turkey is secular , it will remain secular . "
eu warns army the european union warned the army that it could harm turkey 's membership prospects if it interferes in politics . it urged all parties to respect the court 's decision " regardless of the unfortunate events leading to the ruling " and said the elections should be " carried out democratically without any undue interference . " the akp 's proposal must be voted into law by parliament for elections to be brought forward from their current november 4 date . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secularists remain wary of erdogan 's mildly islamist akp party the constitutional court said the presidential election process should begin anew because a quorum was lacking in friday 's first round .
presidential poll re-run on sunday parliament fixed a new timetable , setting the first round re-run the presidential election for sunday .
gul said he would not press ahead with his candidacy if he fails again . throwing down the gauntlet to the opposition , erdogan said the akp would also push for comprehensive constitutional amendments , including the election of the president by popular vote rather than by a parliamentary ballot . the financial markets welcomed the prospect of early elections , with the national index of the istanbul stock exchange rising by 1.67 percent and the turkish lira gaining ground against the dollar . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish high court annuls presidential vote turkey 's constitutional court on tuesday annulled the first round of a parliamentary vote for a new president in a move likely to pave the way for early general elections .

the date for new election still needs to be approved by the entire parliament . ´ bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secularists suspect gul , left , and erdogan of having a hidden islamist agenda the current turkish political crisis erupted over widespread opposition to the prospect of an akp president because of concerns that the party is not truly committed to turkey 's fiercely guarded secular system and is eroding the separation of state and religion . tensions reached a climax late friday when the influential military accused the government of failing to prevent rising islamist activity and threatened to intervene .
the unusually harsh statement came hours after a parliament ballot - boycotted by the opposition - in which gul fell 10 votes short of the required two-thirds majority to make him turkey 's next president .
secular turks demonstrate more than one million pro-secular turks demonstrated in istanbul at the weekend against an akp president , after a similar mass rally two weeks earlier in ankara .
bildunterschrift : pro-secular demonstrators wave turkish flags during a rally in istanbul on sunday erdogan , who has led turkey since march 2003 , insisted wednesday that his party was committed to secularism . he also urged respect for differences - an apparent reference to objections raised over gul 's wife wearing the islamic headscarf , seen by secularists as a symbol of political islam . " the essential problem is to manage to stay united , preserving our differences , " he said .
" rights and freedoms are necessary for everybody . " pointing to the most popular slogan at the anti-akp protests , he said : " they say ' turkey is secular , it will remain secular ' .
we do not say anything different - yes , turkey is secular , it will remain secular . "
eu warns army the european union warned the army that it could harm turkey 's membership prospects if it interferes in politics . it urged all parties to respect the court 's decision " regardless of the unfortunate events leading to the ruling " and said the elections should be " carried out democratically without any undue interference . " the akp 's proposal must be voted into law by parliament for elections to be brought forward from their current november 4 date . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secularists remain wary of erdogan 's mildly islamist akp party the constitutional court said the presidential election process should begin anew because a quorum was lacking in friday 's first round .
presidential poll re-run on sunday parliament fixed a new timetable , setting the first round re-run the presidential election for sunday .
gul said he would not press ahead with his candidacy if he fails again . throwing down the gauntlet to the opposition , erdogan said the akp would also push for comprehensive constitutional amendments , including the election of the president by popular vote rather than by a parliamentary ballot . the financial markets welcomed the prospect of early elections , with the national index of the istanbul stock exchange rising by 1.67 percent and the turkish lira gaining ground against the dollar . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish high court annuls presidential vote turkey 's constitutional court on tuesday annulled the first round of a parliamentary vote for a new president in a move likely to pave the way for early general elections .
-lrb- 01.05.2007 -rrb- council of europe urges turkish army to stay out of elections the council of europe joined the growing chorus of disapproval over the statements made by the turkish army that effectively warned that it would defend turkey 's secular state if a new president threatened it .

the date for new election still needs to be approved by the entire parliament . ´ bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secularists suspect gul , left , and erdogan of having a hidden islamist agenda the current turkish political crisis erupted over widespread opposition to the prospect of an akp president because of concerns that the party is not truly committed to turkey 's fiercely guarded secular system and is eroding the separation of state and religion . tensions reached a climax late friday when the influential military accused the government of failing to prevent rising islamist activity and threatened to intervene .
the unusually harsh statement came hours after a parliament ballot - boycotted by the opposition - in which gul fell 10 votes short of the required two-thirds majority to make him turkey 's next president .
secular turks demonstrate more than one million pro-secular turks demonstrated in istanbul at the weekend against an akp president , after a similar mass rally two weeks earlier in ankara .
bildunterschrift : pro-secular demonstrators wave turkish flags during a rally in istanbul on sunday erdogan , who has led turkey since march 2003 , insisted wednesday that his party was committed to secularism . he also urged respect for differences - an apparent reference to objections raised over gul 's wife wearing the islamic headscarf , seen by secularists as a symbol of political islam . " the essential problem is to manage to stay united , preserving our differences , " he said .
" rights and freedoms are necessary for everybody . " pointing to the most popular slogan at the anti-akp protests , he said : " they say ' turkey is secular , it will remain secular ' .
we do not say anything different - yes , turkey is secular , it will remain secular . "
eu warns army the european union warned the army that it could harm turkey 's membership prospects if it interferes in politics . it urged all parties to respect the court 's decision " regardless of the unfortunate events leading to the ruling " and said the elections should be " carried out democratically without any undue interference . " the akp 's proposal must be voted into law by parliament for elections to be brought forward from their current november 4 date . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secularists remain wary of erdogan 's mildly islamist akp party the constitutional court said the presidential election process should begin anew because a quorum was lacking in friday 's first round .
presidential poll re-run on sunday parliament fixed a new timetable , setting the first round re-run the presidential election for sunday .
gul said he would not press ahead with his candidacy if he fails again . throwing down the gauntlet to the opposition , erdogan said the akp would also push for comprehensive constitutional amendments , including the election of the president by popular vote rather than by a parliamentary ballot . the financial markets welcomed the prospect of early elections , with the national index of the istanbul stock exchange rising by 1.67 percent and the turkish lira gaining ground against the dollar . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish high court annuls presidential vote turkey 's constitutional court on tuesday annulled the first round of a parliamentary vote for a new president in a move likely to pave the way for early general elections .

liverpool now hope to repeat their 2005 title . it was a tactical match on tuesday at anfield between two teams whose coaches have developed an intense - and mutual - dislike for each other .
once again rafael benitez and liverpool came out tops in a game that was long on drama , if short on highlights . liverpool needed to make up for their 1-0 loss in the first leg at stamford bridge last week , and in the 22nd minute , steven gerrard wrong-footed chelsea with a free kick crossed not into but outside of the box . danish defender daniel agger booted the ball into the net through three of his opponents to draw liverpool level on aggregate .
it was agger 's first-ever champions league goal . chelsea pay for passivity bildunterschrift : agger 's first champions league goal could n't have been more timely with the result on a knife edge , neither team was willing to risk much .
chelsea , playing without injured stars andriy shevchenko and michael ballack , created a few chances for super-striker didier drogba , but mostly he was left stranded . liverpool , meanwhile , pounded the ball in the air to striker peter crouch , but 90 minutes were n't enough for the side to deliver the knock-out punch . liverpool did find the back of the net in extra time , after dirk kuyt pounced on a rebound from chelsea keeper petr cech .
but that goal was disallowed after the dutch striker was ruled offside in a call that is sure to have led to loud debates in pubs across england . dutchmen hold nerves in shoot-out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liverpool keeper pepe reina was the man of the match liverpool 's boudewijn zenden was first to step up to the spot in the penalty shoot-out , and he made no mistake .
pepe reina then held against arjen robben , and after liverpool converted their next two , the pressure was on substitute njitap geremi . geremi was no match for reina , and a decisive blast by kuyt sent liverpool into the champions league final . morinho 's future is in doubt after yet another bitter champions league exit .

" both of them are official representatives of parties and policies that for the past 30 years have brought france to the brink of a political , economic , social , cultural and moral abyss , " le pen told cheering supporters in paris .
the national front leader , who stunned france in 2002 when he made it to the run-off presidential ballot against current president jacques chirac , urged his voters to " save their votes " for parliamentary elections in june .

the national front leader , who stunned france in 2002 when he made it to the run-off presidential ballot against current president jacques chirac , urged his voters to " save their votes " for parliamentary elections in june .

schäuble , a conservative , insisted that progress had been made " on many points " and said open and frank discussions were the only way forward to ease the integration of muslims in german society .
" we all agreed that this process is the right one and that it has made progress .
it was a step in the right direction , " schäuble told journalists after the meeting .
but the head of the central council of muslims , ayyub axel köhler , said : " we can not go on like this , debating without any aim . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sitting at the same table at least " there must be an evaluation of this whole process , " he said .
" we need to set concrete goals and we need to lay out a roadmap . " the meeting with schäuble was a review of the first seven months of negotiations in working parties on plans for islam classes for muslims in german public schools and mosque demands for legal rights similar to churches .
no agreements have been reached yet .
who represents whom much of the debate ahead of the meeting focused on the role of the recently formed muslim coordination council , a move which interior minister schäuble has welcomed .
the council is an umbrella group comprising the central council of muslims and three other organizations : the turkish islamic union for religious affairs , the islamic council and the association of islamic cultural centers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nearly three and a half million muslims live in germany the groups have said they would try to find a joint stance on issues such as immigration , integration and extremism , while remaining independent . but since it only represents the 300,000 people who belong to islamic organizations , schäuble says its ability to speak for the 3.4 million muslims living in germany is limited .
of germany 's muslims , about 2.4 million are turks or people of turkish descent , many of them children and grandchildren of guest workers invited to germany in the 1960s and 1970s .
another 200,000 muslims in germany come from north africa .
there are also about 55,000 afghans in the community , 60,000 iranians and 160,000 bosnian muslims , according to official estimates . germany 's muslim community is overwhelmingly sunni .
divisions among muslims there were some divisions between religious and secular muslims which came to light during the meeting , in particular when it came to women 's dress and the mixing of the sexes . the government and secularists have rejected complaints by conservative muslim families about girls wearing swimsuits in the presence of boys while being taught swimming at german schools . schäuble said it was the " rule " in germany that girls and boys were educated in school together .
he said he had heard the objections to mixed sports , adding : " we will continue to be talking about this . "
the first meeting of the groups with the government last september was overshadowed by a row over the staging in berlin of a mozart opera , " idomeneo , " which featured the severed head of the prophet mohammed in one scene .
the opera was pulled from the schedule over fears of violent protests by islamic radicals , but was staged later amid tight security . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new umbrella organization to represent muslims in germany islamic associations in germany have announced they have founded an umbrella organization .

the question of who actually shot siegfried buback in april 1977 remains unresolved .
federal prosecutor monika harms re-opened the case this month after former raf member peter-jürgen boock indicated that christian klar , who had been sentenced to jail for numerous murders carried out by the extreme left-wing terrorists , was not the killer .
michael buback wrote that one witness , who said he had been sitting in his parked car next that of siegfried buback , heard the shots and saw two masked figures on a motorcycle .
the passenger had been holding a gun and could have been a woman , the man said in a newspaper article from the time .
buback wrote that another person had seen the motorcycle on the day before the assassination and had given testimony that the passenger sitting behind the driver was " small and delicate . "
buback said he had been irritated that only knut folkerts , christian klar and günter sonnenberg were mentioned as the perpetrators , although none of the men was shorter than 1.80 meters -lrb- 5 feet 9 inches -rrb- .
fresh suspicions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verena becker in the 1970s some german press reports have suggested that former raf member verena becker fired the shots .
she had reportedly used the same machine gun that killed siegfried buback during her arrested in 1977 .
buback called on the federal prosecutor 's office to explain why the two witnesses had not been asked to identify the people they had seen in a police line-up .
the raf - also known as the baader-meinhof gang after its founders andreas baader and ulrike meinhof - mounted a violent campaign against what it considered was the oppressive capitalist state of west germany from 1977 to 1982 .
it targeted the german elite and the us military based in germany .

haniyeh used the meeting to call on " the international community to work with the national unity government in an official and direct manner as it represents the will of the palestinian people , " according to a statement from his office .
he also made another appealed for a direct aid embargo on his cabinet to be lifted .
triantaphyllides told the afp news agency the delegation had come to gaza " to see exactly what the situation is because we are for helping and finding a solution to the problem . "
" we consider this government as an opportunity to facilitate the peace process , " he said .
israel denounces eu-hamas meeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gaza remains a volatile place the eu , along with israel and the united states , considers hamas a terrorist organization , and froze direct aid and diplomatic contacts with the palestinian government after the islamist movement first formed a cabinet last year .
many palestinians thought aid payments would be reinstated when hamas on march 17 formed a unity cabinet with president mahmud abbas ' secular fatah faction and western-backed independents , but the west has so far refused to lift the freeze .
the eu and us are demanding that the government explicitly recognize israel , renounce violence and agree to abide by past peace deals for the aid to resume .
israeli foreign ministry spokesman mark regev criticized tuesday 's meeting .

karlsruhe kept the purse strings tight and have secured promotion with four matches left .
their stories are an object lesson in what clubs should and should n't do . second-division karlsruhe 's 1-0 win over unterhaching last weekend wo n't go down as one of history 's great matches .
but it was enough to ensure that the traditional southern german club returns to the first division for the first time in the new millennium . karlsruhe did everything right this season .
they won their first match 4-0 and were never worse than second in the table . karlsruhe 's march to the top shows that you do n't necessarily need masses of cash to be successful .
their budget for player salaries is only 13 million euros -lrb- $ 16 million -rrb- .
the team 's management did n't splash out for big names - most of the players on the squad are unfamiliar to anyone but hardcore fans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karlsruhe have n't been this good since ollie kahn played for the team karlsruhe 's strength is their midfield , built around german-italian playmaker giovanni federico .
once dismissed as an eternal prospect who never blossomed , federico has racked up 16 goals and 13 assists while karlsruhe dominated the second division like no team ever before . a lot of top-flight clubs could learn a lesson from karlsruhe 's success .
you can afford to be mediocre at the front or the back .
but it 's impossible to win without power in midfield , which is where , of course , most of soccer matches are played . gladbach disaster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : big spending gladbach are off to the second division borussia mönchengladbach 's 1-0 loss to stuttgart last weekend was n't the worst match they 'd played this season .
but it , combined with the other results , meant that gladbach will be relegated - after staying in first division since 2001 - regardless of the results in the last three games . gladbach 's demise is also edifying .
the team began the season by allowing a star coach , former champions league winner jupp heynckes , to spend almost as much as karlsruhe 's entire player budget to acquire new talent . defensively , gladbach were okay .
they 've only conceded 38 goals thus far - seventh best in the league .
it 's their offense , with a mere 22 goals to its name , that 's been atrocious . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playmaker insua was the most expensive transfer in gladbach history the poor performance up front comes down to a shoddy midfield .
given enough good chances , even the world 's worst striker will score .
but even the best forward , on the other hand , wo n't be popping in many goals , if he never gets the ball in the box . gladbach 's new argentine playmaker federico insua never seemed comfortable at borussia park .
nor did his potential back-ups michael delura and belgian bernd thijs .
together with countryman wesley sonck , thijs even succeeded in getting himself thrown off the squad . the result was that gladbach was unable to move the ball up the field with any control or coherence .
heynckes stepped down in february , but his successor jos luhukay could n't turn things around .
on paper he had the talent at his disposal , but on the pitch , that talent was too ill-matched to generate any consistent offensive pressure .
hello , second division . where they go from here bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karlsruhe will be playing bayern and bremen next year getting promoted is a huge challenge for any small side , while big clubs who get relegated are expected to regroup and rise again .
but do n't expect karlsruhe and gladbach 's fortunes necessarily to be reversed this time next season . karlsruhe will have to replace federico , who 's off to dortmund .
but even with their tiny budget , the german first division is mediocre enough that if karlsruhe invest wisely , they should be able to compete with all but the top teams . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youngster jansen is likely headed elsewhere meanwhile , gladbach are slashing their budget in half - from 60 million euros to 30 million euros -lrb- $ 78 to $ 39 million -rrb- .
they 'll probably have to sell off their best young player , marcel jansen , and the heart and soul of the team , german international striker oliver neuville , is 34 years old and prone to injury . it may take a while for gladbach , previously a german soccer powerhouse , to recover from a dismal season of mistakes in management and midfield . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen blow gilt-edged chance to take bundesliga summit werder bremen coach thomas schaaf rued his side 's missed golden opportunity to go top of the bundesliga on sunday as they crashed to a shock 3-2 defeat at relegation-threatened arminia bielefeld .

the move sparked protests , which rapidly spilled over into the worst rioting estonia has seen since the russian revolution . estonians see the monument as a symbol of their country 's illegal occupation by the soviet union , but most ethnic russians see it as a tribute to russians ' sacrifice in the victory over nazism . tensions increase kaljurand said her bodyguards were forced to use gas after members of the kremlin-backed nashi group broke into the newspaper offices where she was holding the press conference .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 02.05.2007 documenta art expo discovers color großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : documenta visitors will stroll through pink rooms every five years , kassel gears up to host art fans from all over the world at the summer-long documenta exhibition .
shortly before documenta 12 opens its doors , the curators have introduced their architectonic concept . the white cube , an exhibition space painted entirely white , is history - at least at documenta 12 .
color is the order of the day .
" it 's good for painting and with photography .
we are indeed used to the white , but black-and-white photography simply comes across much better on colored walls , " said curator ruth noack .
noack admitted that not all artists were enthusiastic about the idea of showing their work on a salmon pink or olive green background .
but colorful surroundings for showing art are common in some countries .
thus , the thai artist who will show at documenta 12 - and whose name has n't yet been released - was very pleased with the pink room in which his buddha sculptures will be displayed , noack said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noack and buergel western european and american artists in particular are accustomed to the white cube , which always casts their work in a regular , controllable light .
there is , however , an older european tradition of hanging artworks on colorful walls .
creating a mood the documenta plans to use color to put contemporary art in the right perspective as well as to create a special atmosphere for visitors , said artistic director roger m. buergel .
" architecture is a medium that either makes you float or weighs you down .
and the moment that you start to establish relationships , it becomes something very light and happy , and for that you have to create an atmosphere - that 's why -lrb- we decided on -rrb- colors , " buergel said .
the artists ' desires also played a role , he said , requiring different architectural approaches .
" some want to be hidden , others want to be discovered , others want to be accentuated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fridericianum art hall is the heart of the show buergel was mainly referring to the exhibition 's interior architecture , seeing as almost all the buildings used for the documenta are decades - if not centuries - old .
architect tim hupe reconstructed some of the original interior architecture , such as rebuilding a flight of stairs that had been removed from one building in the 1980s .
hupe 's team also reopened walled-in windows to let natural light into the rooms .
some artists are especially keen to show their work in the intimate cabinet rooms of the classicist buildings .
greenhouses for art documenta 12 erected a temporary building for art that needs air and space : the crystal palace .
the wide halls built on a vast field look like greenhouses and give the impression of transparency .
but that was n't the aim .
" art needs to be protected from light and weather , and this building supplies that , " hupe said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crystal palace was erected only for this year 's documenta there are no permanent walls in the crystal palace so that the curators are free to install the art according to how they think it should be shown and put in partitions as they see fit .
" of course , you can only do something like this for a one-time thing like the documenta , " said hupe .
" there , one time , in one place , an art work will be shown . "
documenta 12 opens to the public on june 16 and runs until sept .

shortly before documenta 12 opens its doors , the curators have introduced their architectonic concept . the white cube , an exhibition space painted entirely white , is history - at least at documenta 12 .
color is the order of the day .
" it 's good for painting and with photography .
we are indeed used to the white , but black-and-white photography simply comes across much better on colored walls , " said curator ruth noack .
noack admitted that not all artists were enthusiastic about the idea of showing their work on a salmon pink or olive green background .
but colorful surroundings for showing art are common in some countries .
thus , the thai artist who will show at documenta 12 - and whose name has n't yet been released - was very pleased with the pink room in which his buddha sculptures will be displayed , noack said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noack and buergel western european and american artists in particular are accustomed to the white cube , which always casts their work in a regular , controllable light .
there is , however , an older european tradition of hanging artworks on colorful walls .
creating a mood the documenta plans to use color to put contemporary art in the right perspective as well as to create a special atmosphere for visitors , said artistic director roger m. buergel .
" architecture is a medium that either makes you float or weighs you down .
and the moment that you start to establish relationships , it becomes something very light and happy , and for that you have to create an atmosphere - that 's why -lrb- we decided on -rrb- colors , " buergel said .
the artists ' desires also played a role , he said , requiring different architectural approaches .
" some want to be hidden , others want to be discovered , others want to be accentuated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fridericianum art hall is the heart of the show buergel was mainly referring to the exhibition 's interior architecture , seeing as almost all the buildings used for the documenta are decades - if not centuries - old .
architect tim hupe reconstructed some of the original interior architecture , such as rebuilding a flight of stairs that had been removed from one building in the 1980s .
hupe 's team also reopened walled-in windows to let natural light into the rooms .
some artists are especially keen to show their work in the intimate cabinet rooms of the classicist buildings .
greenhouses for art documenta 12 erected a temporary building for art that needs air and space : the crystal palace .
the wide halls built on a vast field look like greenhouses and give the impression of transparency .
but that was n't the aim .
" art needs to be protected from light and weather , and this building supplies that , " hupe said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crystal palace was erected only for this year 's documenta there are no permanent walls in the crystal palace so that the curators are free to install the art according to how they think it should be shown and put in partitions as they see fit .
" of course , you can only do something like this for a one-time thing like the documenta , " said hupe .
" there , one time , in one place , an art work will be shown . "

haniyeh used the meeting to call on " the international community to work with the national unity government in an official and direct manner as it represents the will of the palestinian people , " according to a statement from his office .
he also made another appealed for a direct aid embargo on his cabinet to be lifted .
triantaphyllides told the afp news agency the delegation had come to gaza " to see exactly what the situation is because we are for helping and finding a solution to the problem . "
" we consider this government as an opportunity to facilitate the peace process , " he said .
israel denounces eu-hamas meeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gaza remains a volatile place the eu , along with israel and the united states , considers hamas a terrorist organization , and froze direct aid and diplomatic contacts with the palestinian government after the islamist movement first formed a cabinet last year .
many palestinians thought aid payments would be reinstated when hamas on march 17 formed a unity cabinet with president mahmud abbas ' secular fatah faction and western-backed independents , but the west has so far refused to lift the freeze .
the eu and us are demanding that the government explicitly recognize israel , renounce violence and agree to abide by past peace deals for the aid to resume .
israeli foreign ministry spokesman mark regev criticized tuesday 's meeting .
" the eu has classified hamas as a terrorist organization and the eu leadership has boycotted hamas , " he told afp .
" thankfully this delegation does not speak for the eu .
" giving legitimacy and recognition to an organization that refuses to support peace and refuses to renounce terrorism can not but strengthen that organization 's extremist agenda , " regev said .
olmert under mounting pressure to resign separately , israeli prime minister ehud olmert 's political future appeared increasingly uncertain on wednesday as pressure mounted on him to resign for his handling of the lebanon war last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert is under mounting pressure to resign an official report into the war has sharply criticized what it called olmert 's " serious failures . "
the winograd commission said the cabinet rubber-stamped the decision to go to war but olmert bore " supreme responsibility " for launching the air , sea and land assaults without a proper plan after hezbollah seized two israeli soldiers on july 12 .
during the 34-day campaign in which hezbollah rained 4,000 rockets on israel and israeli warplanes pounded southern beirut , more than 1,000 people were killed in lebanon , including about 900 civilians , while 117 israeli troops died along with 41 civilians caught in the rocket strikes in northern israel .

the move sparked protests , which rapidly spilled over into the worst rioting estonia has seen since the russian revolution . estonians see the monument as a symbol of their country 's illegal occupation by the soviet union , but most ethnic russians see it as a tribute to russians ' sacrifice in the victory over nazism . tensions increase kaljurand said her bodyguards were forced to use gas after members of the kremlin-backed nashi group broke into the newspaper offices where she was holding the press conference .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 02.05.2007 documenta art expo discovers color großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : documenta visitors will stroll through pink rooms every five years , kassel gears up to host art fans from all over the world at the summer-long documenta exhibition .
shortly before documenta 12 opens its doors , the curators have introduced their architectonic concept . the white cube , an exhibition space painted entirely white , is history - at least at documenta 12 .
color is the order of the day .
" it 's good for painting and with photography .
we are indeed used to the white , but black-and-white photography simply comes across much better on colored walls , " said curator ruth noack .
noack admitted that not all artists were enthusiastic about the idea of showing their work on a salmon pink or olive green background .
but colorful surroundings for showing art are common in some countries .
thus , the thai artist who will show at documenta 12 - and whose name has n't yet been released - was very pleased with the pink room in which his buddha sculptures will be displayed , noack said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noack and buergel western european and american artists in particular are accustomed to the white cube , which always casts their work in a regular , controllable light .
there is , however , an older european tradition of hanging artworks on colorful walls .
creating a mood the documenta plans to use color to put contemporary art in the right perspective as well as to create a special atmosphere for visitors , said artistic director roger m. buergel .
" architecture is a medium that either makes you float or weighs you down .
and the moment that you start to establish relationships , it becomes something very light and happy , and for that you have to create an atmosphere - that 's why -lrb- we decided on -rrb- colors , " buergel said .
the artists ' desires also played a role , he said , requiring different architectural approaches .
" some want to be hidden , others want to be discovered , others want to be accentuated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fridericianum art hall is the heart of the show buergel was mainly referring to the exhibition 's interior architecture , seeing as almost all the buildings used for the documenta are decades - if not centuries - old .
architect tim hupe reconstructed some of the original interior architecture , such as rebuilding a flight of stairs that had been removed from one building in the 1980s .
hupe 's team also reopened walled-in windows to let natural light into the rooms .
some artists are especially keen to show their work in the intimate cabinet rooms of the classicist buildings .
greenhouses for art documenta 12 erected a temporary building for art that needs air and space : the crystal palace .
the wide halls built on a vast field look like greenhouses and give the impression of transparency .
but that was n't the aim .
" art needs to be protected from light and weather , and this building supplies that , " hupe said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crystal palace was erected only for this year 's documenta there are no permanent walls in the crystal palace so that the curators are free to install the art according to how they think it should be shown and put in partitions as they see fit .
" of course , you can only do something like this for a one-time thing like the documenta , " said hupe .
" there , one time , in one place , an art work will be shown . "
documenta 12 opens to the public on june 16 and runs until sept .

the date for new election still needs to be approved by the entire parliament . ´ bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secularists suspect gul , left , and erdogan of having a hidden islamist agenda the current turkish political crisis erupted over widespread opposition to the prospect of an akp president because of concerns that the party is not truly committed to turkey 's fiercely guarded secular system and is eroding the separation of state and religion . tensions reached a climax late friday when the influential military accused the government of failing to prevent rising islamist activity and threatened to intervene .
the unusually harsh statement came hours after a parliament ballot - boycotted by the opposition - in which gul fell 10 votes short of the required two-thirds majority to make him turkey 's next president .
secular turks demonstrate more than one million pro-secular turks demonstrated in istanbul at the weekend against an akp president , after a similar mass rally two weeks earlier in ankara .
bildunterschrift : pro-secular demonstrators wave turkish flags during a rally in istanbul on sunday erdogan , who has led turkey since march 2003 , insisted wednesday that his party was committed to secularism . he also urged respect for differences - an apparent reference to objections raised over gul 's wife wearing the islamic headscarf , seen by secularists as a symbol of political islam . " the essential problem is to manage to stay united , preserving our differences , " he said .
" rights and freedoms are necessary for everybody . " pointing to the most popular slogan at the anti-akp protests , he said : " they say ' turkey is secular , it will remain secular ' .
we do not say anything different - yes , turkey is secular , it will remain secular . "
eu warns army the european union warned the army that it could harm turkey 's membership prospects if it interferes in politics . it urged all parties to respect the court 's decision " regardless of the unfortunate events leading to the ruling " and said the elections should be " carried out democratically without any undue interference . " the akp 's proposal must be voted into law by parliament for elections to be brought forward from their current november 4 date . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secularists remain wary of erdogan 's mildly islamist akp party the constitutional court said the presidential election process should begin anew because a quorum was lacking in friday 's first round .
presidential poll re-run on sunday parliament fixed a new timetable , setting the first round re-run the presidential election for sunday .
gul said he would not press ahead with his candidacy if he fails again . throwing down the gauntlet to the opposition , erdogan said the akp would also push for comprehensive constitutional amendments , including the election of the president by popular vote rather than by a parliamentary ballot . the financial markets welcomed the prospect of early elections , with the national index of the istanbul stock exchange rising by 1.67 percent and the turkish lira gaining ground against the dollar . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish high court annuls presidential vote turkey 's constitutional court on tuesday annulled the first round of a parliamentary vote for a new president in a move likely to pave the way for early general elections .

liverpool now hope to repeat their 2005 title . it was a tactical match on tuesday at anfield between two teams whose coaches have developed an intense - and mutual - dislike for each other .
once again rafael benitez and liverpool came out tops in a game that was long on drama , if short on highlights . liverpool needed to make up for their 1-0 loss in the first leg at stamford bridge last week , and in the 22nd minute , steven gerrard wrong-footed chelsea with a free kick crossed not into but outside of the box . danish defender daniel agger booted the ball into the net through three of his opponents to draw liverpool level on aggregate .
it was agger 's first-ever champions league goal . chelsea pay for passivity bildunterschrift : agger 's first champions league goal could n't have been more timely with the result on a knife edge , neither team was willing to risk much .
chelsea , playing without injured stars andriy shevchenko and michael ballack , created a few chances for super-striker didier drogba , but mostly he was left stranded . liverpool , meanwhile , pounded the ball in the air to striker peter crouch , but 90 minutes were n't enough for the side to deliver the knock-out punch . liverpool did find the back of the net in extra time , after dirk kuyt pounced on a rebound from chelsea keeper petr cech .
but that goal was disallowed after the dutch striker was ruled offside in a call that is sure to have led to loud debates in pubs across england . dutchmen hold nerves in shoot-out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liverpool keeper pepe reina was the man of the match liverpool 's boudewijn zenden was first to step up to the spot in the penalty shoot-out , and he made no mistake .
pepe reina then held against arjen robben , and after liverpool converted their next two , the pressure was on substitute njitap geremi . geremi was no match for reina , and a decisive blast by kuyt sent liverpool into the champions league final . morinho 's future is in doubt after yet another bitter champions league exit .

now he 's about to do his part in saving the world from environmental catastrophe . the american publisher scholastic , which also publishes the harry potter books , is to distribute a children 's book about the little bear aimed at educating people about global warming .
the book , entitled " knut : how one little polar bear captivated the world , " is being penned by best-selling author craig hatkoff and his daughters juliana and isabella and will relate the bear 's story - first in german this summer , then in english in the fall - along with plenty of pictures .

the five-month old bear has been hand-raised by a berlin zookeeper after being rejected by his mother .
he has become a symbol for the plight of polar bears and their habitat , which is under threat by rising global temperatures .
" we are hoping that a little polar bear can help the world de-polarize the complex issues … and raise awareness of the issues in the global climate debate , " hatkoff told reuters .
the berlin zoo has already launched its own campaign called " respect habitats.knut , " complete with a knut logo that is to serve as a seal of approval for measures taken to address climate change and other environmental issues .
gerald uhlich , chief executive of berlin zoo , told reuters that part of the book sale proceeds will be contributed to this goal .
" surely , knut will win the hearts of millions of readers and raise their awareness to environmental issues across the world , " he said in a statement . knut is likely unaware of his potential impact on the globe .

the question of who actually shot siegfried buback in april 1977 remains unresolved .
federal prosecutor monika harms re-opened the case this month after former raf member peter-jürgen boock indicated that christian klar , who had been sentenced to jail for numerous murders carried out by the extreme left-wing terrorists , was not the killer .
michael buback wrote that one witness , who said he had been sitting in his parked car next that of siegfried buback , heard the shots and saw two masked figures on a motorcycle .
the passenger had been holding a gun and could have been a woman , the man said in a newspaper article from the time .
buback wrote that another person had seen the motorcycle on the day before the assassination and had given testimony that the passenger sitting behind the driver was " small and delicate . "
buback said he had been irritated that only knut folkerts , christian klar and günter sonnenberg were mentioned as the perpetrators , although none of the men was shorter than 1.80 meters -lrb- 5 feet 9 inches -rrb- .
fresh suspicions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verena becker in the 1970s some german press reports have suggested that former raf member verena becker fired the shots .

he 's to be the subject of a new book aimed at educating people about climate change . knut the baby polar bear has been basking in international adoration since his debut at the berlin zoo .
now he 's about to do his part in saving the world from environmental catastrophe . the american publisher scholastic , which also publishes the harry potter books , is to distribute a children 's book about the little bear aimed at educating people about global warming .
the book , entitled " knut : how one little polar bear captivated the world , " is being penned by best-selling author craig hatkoff and his daughters juliana and isabella and will relate the bear 's story - first in german this summer , then in english in the fall - along with plenty of pictures .
new york-based turtle pond publications and the berlin zoo told the german press agency that they had negotiated exclusive publishing rights for knut and plan a web site for him this summer along with a dvd .
unsuspecting environmental activist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is all the fame turning knut into a little narcissus ?
the five-month old bear has been hand-raised by a berlin zookeeper after being rejected by his mother .
he has become a symbol for the plight of polar bears and their habitat , which is under threat by rising global temperatures .
" we are hoping that a little polar bear can help the world de-polarize the complex issues … and raise awareness of the issues in the global climate debate , " hatkoff told reuters .
the berlin zoo has already launched its own campaign called " respect habitats.knut , " complete with a knut logo that is to serve as a seal of approval for measures taken to address climate change and other environmental issues .
gerald uhlich , chief executive of berlin zoo , told reuters that part of the book sale proceeds will be contributed to this goal .
" surely , knut will win the hearts of millions of readers and raise their awareness to environmental issues across the world , " he said in a statement . knut is likely unaware of his potential impact on the globe .

the question of who actually shot siegfried buback in april 1977 remains unresolved .
federal prosecutor monika harms re-opened the case this month after former raf member peter-jürgen boock indicated that christian klar , who had been sentenced to jail for numerous murders carried out by the extreme left-wing terrorists , was not the killer .
michael buback wrote that one witness , who said he had been sitting in his parked car next that of siegfried buback , heard the shots and saw two masked figures on a motorcycle .
the passenger had been holding a gun and could have been a woman , the man said in a newspaper article from the time .
buback wrote that another person had seen the motorcycle on the day before the assassination and had given testimony that the passenger sitting behind the driver was " small and delicate . "
buback said he had been irritated that only knut folkerts , christian klar and günter sonnenberg were mentioned as the perpetrators , although none of the men was shorter than 1.80 meters -lrb- 5 feet 9 inches -rrb- .
fresh suspicions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verena becker in the 1970s some german press reports have suggested that former raf member verena becker fired the shots .
she had reportedly used the same machine gun that killed siegfried buback during her arrested in 1977 .
buback called on the federal prosecutor 's office to explain why the two witnesses had not been asked to identify the people they had seen in a police line-up .
the raf - also known as the baader-meinhof gang after its founders andreas baader and ulrike meinhof - mounted a violent campaign against what it considered was the oppressive capitalist state of west germany from 1977 to 1982 .
it targeted the german elite and the us military based in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 02.05.2007 documenta art expo discovers color großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : documenta visitors will stroll through pink rooms every five years , kassel gears up to host art fans from all over the world at the summer-long documenta exhibition .
shortly before documenta 12 opens its doors , the curators have introduced their architectonic concept . the white cube , an exhibition space painted entirely white , is history - at least at documenta 12 .
color is the order of the day .
" it 's good for painting and with photography .
we are indeed used to the white , but black-and-white photography simply comes across much better on colored walls , " said curator ruth noack .
noack admitted that not all artists were enthusiastic about the idea of showing their work on a salmon pink or olive green background .
but colorful surroundings for showing art are common in some countries .
thus , the thai artist who will show at documenta 12 - and whose name has n't yet been released - was very pleased with the pink room in which his buddha sculptures will be displayed , noack said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noack and buergel western european and american artists in particular are accustomed to the white cube , which always casts their work in a regular , controllable light .
there is , however , an older european tradition of hanging artworks on colorful walls .
creating a mood the documenta plans to use color to put contemporary art in the right perspective as well as to create a special atmosphere for visitors , said artistic director roger m. buergel .
" architecture is a medium that either makes you float or weighs you down .
and the moment that you start to establish relationships , it becomes something very light and happy , and for that you have to create an atmosphere - that 's why -lrb- we decided on -rrb- colors , " buergel said .
the artists ' desires also played a role , he said , requiring different architectural approaches .
" some want to be hidden , others want to be discovered , others want to be accentuated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fridericianum art hall is the heart of the show buergel was mainly referring to the exhibition 's interior architecture , seeing as almost all the buildings used for the documenta are decades - if not centuries - old .
architect tim hupe reconstructed some of the original interior architecture , such as rebuilding a flight of stairs that had been removed from one building in the 1980s .
hupe 's team also reopened walled-in windows to let natural light into the rooms .
some artists are especially keen to show their work in the intimate cabinet rooms of the classicist buildings .
greenhouses for art documenta 12 erected a temporary building for art that needs air and space : the crystal palace .
the wide halls built on a vast field look like greenhouses and give the impression of transparency .
but that was n't the aim .
" art needs to be protected from light and weather , and this building supplies that , " hupe said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crystal palace was erected only for this year 's documenta there are no permanent walls in the crystal palace so that the curators are free to install the art according to how they think it should be shown and put in partitions as they see fit .
" of course , you can only do something like this for a one-time thing like the documenta , " said hupe .
" there , one time , in one place , an art work will be shown . "

schäuble , a conservative , insisted that progress had been made " on many points " and said open and frank discussions were the only way forward to ease the integration of muslims in german society .
" we all agreed that this process is the right one and that it has made progress .
it was a step in the right direction , " schäuble told journalists after the meeting .
but the head of the central council of muslims , ayyub axel köhler , said : " we can not go on like this , debating without any aim . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sitting at the same table at least " there must be an evaluation of this whole process , " he said .
" we need to set concrete goals and we need to lay out a roadmap . " the meeting with schäuble was a review of the first seven months of negotiations in working parties on plans for islam classes for muslims in german public schools and mosque demands for legal rights similar to churches .
no agreements have been reached yet .
who represents whom much of the debate ahead of the meeting focused on the role of the recently formed muslim coordination council , a move which interior minister schäuble has welcomed .
the council is an umbrella group comprising the central council of muslims and three other organizations : the turkish islamic union for religious affairs , the islamic council and the association of islamic cultural centers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nearly three and a half million muslims live in germany the groups have said they would try to find a joint stance on issues such as immigration , integration and extremism , while remaining independent . but since it only represents the 300,000 people who belong to islamic organizations , schäuble says its ability to speak for the 3.4 million muslims living in germany is limited .
of germany 's muslims , about 2.4 million are turks or people of turkish descent , many of them children and grandchildren of guest workers invited to germany in the 1960s and 1970s .
another 200,000 muslims in germany come from north africa .
there are also about 55,000 afghans in the community , 60,000 iranians and 160,000 bosnian muslims , according to official estimates . germany 's muslim community is overwhelmingly sunni .
divisions among muslims there were some divisions between religious and secular muslims which came to light during the meeting , in particular when it came to women 's dress and the mixing of the sexes . the government and secularists have rejected complaints by conservative muslim families about girls wearing swimsuits in the presence of boys while being taught swimming at german schools . schäuble said it was the " rule " in germany that girls and boys were educated in school together .
he said he had heard the objections to mixed sports , adding : " we will continue to be talking about this . "
the first meeting of the groups with the government last september was overshadowed by a row over the staging in berlin of a mozart opera , " idomeneo , " which featured the severed head of the prophet mohammed in one scene .
the opera was pulled from the schedule over fears of violent protests by islamic radicals , but was staged later amid tight security . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new umbrella organization to represent muslims in germany islamic associations in germany have announced they have founded an umbrella organization .

of germany 's muslims , about 2.4 million are turks or people of turkish descent , many of them children and grandchildren of guest workers invited to germany in the 1960s and 1970s .
another 200,000 muslims in germany come from north africa .
there are also about 55,000 afghans in the community , 60,000 iranians and 160,000 bosnian muslims , according to official estimates . germany 's muslim community is overwhelmingly sunni .
divisions among muslims there were some divisions between religious and secular muslims which came to light during the meeting , in particular when it came to women 's dress and the mixing of the sexes . the government and secularists have rejected complaints by conservative muslim families about girls wearing swimsuits in the presence of boys while being taught swimming at german schools . schäuble said it was the " rule " in germany that girls and boys were educated in school together .
he said he had heard the objections to mixed sports , adding : " we will continue to be talking about this . "
the first meeting of the groups with the government last september was overshadowed by a row over the staging in berlin of a mozart opera , " idomeneo , " which featured the severed head of the prophet mohammed in one scene .

who represents whom much of the debate ahead of the meeting focused on the role of the recently formed muslim coordination council , a move which interior minister schäuble has welcomed .
the council is an umbrella group comprising the central council of muslims and three other organizations : the turkish islamic union for religious affairs , the islamic council and the association of islamic cultural centers .

he said he had heard the objections to mixed sports , adding : " we will continue to be talking about this . "
the first meeting of the groups with the government last september was overshadowed by a row over the staging in berlin of a mozart opera , " idomeneo , " which featured the severed head of the prophet mohammed in one scene .

shortly before documenta 12 opens its doors , the curators have introduced their architectonic concept . the white cube , an exhibition space painted entirely white , is history - at least at documenta 12 .
color is the order of the day .
" it 's good for painting and with photography .
we are indeed used to the white , but black-and-white photography simply comes across much better on colored walls , " said curator ruth noack .
noack admitted that not all artists were enthusiastic about the idea of showing their work on a salmon pink or olive green background .
but colorful surroundings for showing art are common in some countries .
thus , the thai artist who will show at documenta 12 - and whose name has n't yet been released - was very pleased with the pink room in which his buddha sculptures will be displayed , noack said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noack and buergel western european and american artists in particular are accustomed to the white cube , which always casts their work in a regular , controllable light .
there is , however , an older european tradition of hanging artworks on colorful walls .
creating a mood the documenta plans to use color to put contemporary art in the right perspective as well as to create a special atmosphere for visitors , said artistic director roger m. buergel .
" architecture is a medium that either makes you float or weighs you down .
and the moment that you start to establish relationships , it becomes something very light and happy , and for that you have to create an atmosphere - that 's why -lrb- we decided on -rrb- colors , " buergel said .
the artists ' desires also played a role , he said , requiring different architectural approaches .
" some want to be hidden , others want to be discovered , others want to be accentuated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fridericianum art hall is the heart of the show buergel was mainly referring to the exhibition 's interior architecture , seeing as almost all the buildings used for the documenta are decades - if not centuries - old .
architect tim hupe reconstructed some of the original interior architecture , such as rebuilding a flight of stairs that had been removed from one building in the 1980s .
hupe 's team also reopened walled-in windows to let natural light into the rooms .
some artists are especially keen to show their work in the intimate cabinet rooms of the classicist buildings .
greenhouses for art documenta 12 erected a temporary building for art that needs air and space : the crystal palace .
the wide halls built on a vast field look like greenhouses and give the impression of transparency .
but that was n't the aim .
" art needs to be protected from light and weather , and this building supplies that , " hupe said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crystal palace was erected only for this year 's documenta there are no permanent walls in the crystal palace so that the curators are free to install the art according to how they think it should be shown and put in partitions as they see fit .
" of course , you can only do something like this for a one-time thing like the documenta , " said hupe .
" there , one time , in one place , an art work will be shown . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 02.05.2007 documenta art expo discovers color großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : documenta visitors will stroll through pink rooms every five years , kassel gears up to host art fans from all over the world at the summer-long documenta exhibition .
shortly before documenta 12 opens its doors , the curators have introduced their architectonic concept . the white cube , an exhibition space painted entirely white , is history - at least at documenta 12 .
color is the order of the day .
" it 's good for painting and with photography .
we are indeed used to the white , but black-and-white photography simply comes across much better on colored walls , " said curator ruth noack .
noack admitted that not all artists were enthusiastic about the idea of showing their work on a salmon pink or olive green background .
but colorful surroundings for showing art are common in some countries .
thus , the thai artist who will show at documenta 12 - and whose name has n't yet been released - was very pleased with the pink room in which his buddha sculptures will be displayed , noack said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noack and buergel western european and american artists in particular are accustomed to the white cube , which always casts their work in a regular , controllable light .
there is , however , an older european tradition of hanging artworks on colorful walls .
creating a mood the documenta plans to use color to put contemporary art in the right perspective as well as to create a special atmosphere for visitors , said artistic director roger m. buergel .
" architecture is a medium that either makes you float or weighs you down .
and the moment that you start to establish relationships , it becomes something very light and happy , and for that you have to create an atmosphere - that 's why -lrb- we decided on -rrb- colors , " buergel said .
the artists ' desires also played a role , he said , requiring different architectural approaches .
" some want to be hidden , others want to be discovered , others want to be accentuated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fridericianum art hall is the heart of the show buergel was mainly referring to the exhibition 's interior architecture , seeing as almost all the buildings used for the documenta are decades - if not centuries - old .
architect tim hupe reconstructed some of the original interior architecture , such as rebuilding a flight of stairs that had been removed from one building in the 1980s .
hupe 's team also reopened walled-in windows to let natural light into the rooms .
some artists are especially keen to show their work in the intimate cabinet rooms of the classicist buildings .
greenhouses for art documenta 12 erected a temporary building for art that needs air and space : the crystal palace .
the wide halls built on a vast field look like greenhouses and give the impression of transparency .
but that was n't the aim .
" art needs to be protected from light and weather , and this building supplies that , " hupe said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crystal palace was erected only for this year 's documenta there are no permanent walls in the crystal palace so that the curators are free to install the art according to how they think it should be shown and put in partitions as they see fit .
" of course , you can only do something like this for a one-time thing like the documenta , " said hupe .
" there , one time , in one place , an art work will be shown . "
documenta 12 opens to the public on june 16 and runs until sept .

schäuble , a conservative , insisted that progress had been made " on many points " and said open and frank discussions were the only way forward to ease the integration of muslims in german society .
" we all agreed that this process is the right one and that it has made progress .
it was a step in the right direction , " schäuble told journalists after the meeting .
but the head of the central council of muslims , ayyub axel köhler , said : " we can not go on like this , debating without any aim . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sitting at the same table at least " there must be an evaluation of this whole process , " he said .
" we need to set concrete goals and we need to lay out a roadmap . " the meeting with schäuble was a review of the first seven months of negotiations in working parties on plans for islam classes for muslims in german public schools and mosque demands for legal rights similar to churches .
no agreements have been reached yet .
who represents whom much of the debate ahead of the meeting focused on the role of the recently formed muslim coordination council , a move which interior minister schäuble has welcomed .
the council is an umbrella group comprising the central council of muslims and three other organizations : the turkish islamic union for religious affairs , the islamic council and the association of islamic cultural centers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nearly three and a half million muslims live in germany the groups have said they would try to find a joint stance on issues such as immigration , integration and extremism , while remaining independent . but since it only represents the 300,000 people who belong to islamic organizations , schäuble says its ability to speak for the 3.4 million muslims living in germany is limited .
of germany 's muslims , about 2.4 million are turks or people of turkish descent , many of them children and grandchildren of guest workers invited to germany in the 1960s and 1970s .
another 200,000 muslims in germany come from north africa .
there are also about 55,000 afghans in the community , 60,000 iranians and 160,000 bosnian muslims , according to official estimates . germany 's muslim community is overwhelmingly sunni .
divisions among muslims there were some divisions between religious and secular muslims which came to light during the meeting , in particular when it came to women 's dress and the mixing of the sexes . the government and secularists have rejected complaints by conservative muslim families about girls wearing swimsuits in the presence of boys while being taught swimming at german schools . schäuble said it was the " rule " in germany that girls and boys were educated in school together .
he said he had heard the objections to mixed sports , adding : " we will continue to be talking about this . "
the first meeting of the groups with the government last september was overshadowed by a row over the staging in berlin of a mozart opera , " idomeneo , " which featured the severed head of the prophet mohammed in one scene .
the opera was pulled from the schedule over fears of violent protests by islamic radicals , but was staged later amid tight security . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new umbrella organization to represent muslims in germany islamic associations in germany have announced they have founded an umbrella organization .

schäuble , a conservative , insisted that progress had been made " on many points " and said open and frank discussions were the only way forward to ease the integration of muslims in german society .
" we all agreed that this process is the right one and that it has made progress .
it was a step in the right direction , " schäuble told journalists after the meeting .
but the head of the central council of muslims , ayyub axel köhler , said : " we can not go on like this , debating without any aim . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sitting at the same table at least " there must be an evaluation of this whole process , " he said .
" we need to set concrete goals and we need to lay out a roadmap . " the meeting with schäuble was a review of the first seven months of negotiations in working parties on plans for islam classes for muslims in german public schools and mosque demands for legal rights similar to churches .
no agreements have been reached yet .

haniyeh used the meeting to call on " the international community to work with the national unity government in an official and direct manner as it represents the will of the palestinian people , " according to a statement from his office .
he also made another appealed for a direct aid embargo on his cabinet to be lifted .
triantaphyllides told the afp news agency the delegation had come to gaza " to see exactly what the situation is because we are for helping and finding a solution to the problem . "
" we consider this government as an opportunity to facilitate the peace process , " he said .
israel denounces eu-hamas meeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gaza remains a volatile place the eu , along with israel and the united states , considers hamas a terrorist organization , and froze direct aid and diplomatic contacts with the palestinian government after the islamist movement first formed a cabinet last year .
many palestinians thought aid payments would be reinstated when hamas on march 17 formed a unity cabinet with president mahmud abbas ' secular fatah faction and western-backed independents , but the west has so far refused to lift the freeze .
the eu and us are demanding that the government explicitly recognize israel , renounce violence and agree to abide by past peace deals for the aid to resume .
israeli foreign ministry spokesman mark regev criticized tuesday 's meeting .
" the eu has classified hamas as a terrorist organization and the eu leadership has boycotted hamas , " he told afp .
" thankfully this delegation does not speak for the eu .
" giving legitimacy and recognition to an organization that refuses to support peace and refuses to renounce terrorism can not but strengthen that organization 's extremist agenda , " regev said .
olmert under mounting pressure to resign separately , israeli prime minister ehud olmert 's political future appeared increasingly uncertain on wednesday as pressure mounted on him to resign for his handling of the lebanon war last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert is under mounting pressure to resign an official report into the war has sharply criticized what it called olmert 's " serious failures . "
the winograd commission said the cabinet rubber-stamped the decision to go to war but olmert bore " supreme responsibility " for launching the air , sea and land assaults without a proper plan after hezbollah seized two israeli soldiers on july 12 .
during the 34-day campaign in which hezbollah rained 4,000 rockets on israel and israeli warplanes pounded southern beirut , more than 1,000 people were killed in lebanon , including about 900 civilians , while 117 israeli troops died along with 41 civilians caught in the rocket strikes in northern israel .

the question of who actually shot siegfried buback in april 1977 remains unresolved .
federal prosecutor monika harms re-opened the case this month after former raf member peter-jürgen boock indicated that christian klar , who had been sentenced to jail for numerous murders carried out by the extreme left-wing terrorists , was not the killer .
michael buback wrote that one witness , who said he had been sitting in his parked car next that of siegfried buback , heard the shots and saw two masked figures on a motorcycle .
the passenger had been holding a gun and could have been a woman , the man said in a newspaper article from the time .
buback wrote that another person had seen the motorcycle on the day before the assassination and had given testimony that the passenger sitting behind the driver was " small and delicate . "
buback said he had been irritated that only knut folkerts , christian klar and günter sonnenberg were mentioned as the perpetrators , although none of the men was shorter than 1.80 meters -lrb- 5 feet 9 inches -rrb- .

liverpool now hope to repeat their 2005 title . it was a tactical match on tuesday at anfield between two teams whose coaches have developed an intense - and mutual - dislike for each other .
once again rafael benitez and liverpool came out tops in a game that was long on drama , if short on highlights . liverpool needed to make up for their 1-0 loss in the first leg at stamford bridge last week , and in the 22nd minute , steven gerrard wrong-footed chelsea with a free kick crossed not into but outside of the box . danish defender daniel agger booted the ball into the net through three of his opponents to draw liverpool level on aggregate .
it was agger 's first-ever champions league goal . chelsea pay for passivity bildunterschrift : agger 's first champions league goal could n't have been more timely with the result on a knife edge , neither team was willing to risk much .
chelsea , playing without injured stars andriy shevchenko and michael ballack , created a few chances for super-striker didier drogba , but mostly he was left stranded . liverpool , meanwhile , pounded the ball in the air to striker peter crouch , but 90 minutes were n't enough for the side to deliver the knock-out punch . liverpool did find the back of the net in extra time , after dirk kuyt pounced on a rebound from chelsea keeper petr cech .
but that goal was disallowed after the dutch striker was ruled offside in a call that is sure to have led to loud debates in pubs across england . dutchmen hold nerves in shoot-out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liverpool keeper pepe reina was the man of the match liverpool 's boudewijn zenden was first to step up to the spot in the penalty shoot-out , and he made no mistake .
pepe reina then held against arjen robben , and after liverpool converted their next two , the pressure was on substitute njitap geremi . geremi was no match for reina , and a decisive blast by kuyt sent liverpool into the champions league final . morinho 's future is in doubt after yet another bitter champions league exit .
liverpool will get a chance to claim their sixth european club championship on may 23 in athens . manchester united play ac milan in italy on wednesday to determine the other finalist .
man u won the first leg 3-2 . liverpool probably hope milan prevail since that would put history on their side .
in 2005 , the reds won the champions league final , coming back from 3-0 down to beat the italians in the final .

liverpool now hope to repeat their 2005 title . it was a tactical match on tuesday at anfield between two teams whose coaches have developed an intense - and mutual - dislike for each other .
once again rafael benitez and liverpool came out tops in a game that was long on drama , if short on highlights . liverpool needed to make up for their 1-0 loss in the first leg at stamford bridge last week , and in the 22nd minute , steven gerrard wrong-footed chelsea with a free kick crossed not into but outside of the box . danish defender daniel agger booted the ball into the net through three of his opponents to draw liverpool level on aggregate .
it was agger 's first-ever champions league goal . chelsea pay for passivity bildunterschrift : agger 's first champions league goal could n't have been more timely with the result on a knife edge , neither team was willing to risk much .
chelsea , playing without injured stars andriy shevchenko and michael ballack , created a few chances for super-striker didier drogba , but mostly he was left stranded . liverpool , meanwhile , pounded the ball in the air to striker peter crouch , but 90 minutes were n't enough for the side to deliver the knock-out punch . liverpool did find the back of the net in extra time , after dirk kuyt pounced on a rebound from chelsea keeper petr cech .
but that goal was disallowed after the dutch striker was ruled offside in a call that is sure to have led to loud debates in pubs across england . dutchmen hold nerves in shoot-out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liverpool keeper pepe reina was the man of the match liverpool 's boudewijn zenden was first to step up to the spot in the penalty shoot-out , and he made no mistake .
pepe reina then held against arjen robben , and after liverpool converted their next two , the pressure was on substitute njitap geremi . geremi was no match for reina , and a decisive blast by kuyt sent liverpool into the champions league final . morinho 's future is in doubt after yet another bitter champions league exit .
liverpool will get a chance to claim their sixth european club championship on may 23 in athens . manchester united play ac milan in italy on wednesday to determine the other finalist .
man u won the first leg 3-2 . liverpool probably hope milan prevail since that would put history on their side .

" both of them are official representatives of parties and policies that for the past 30 years have brought france to the brink of a political , economic , social , cultural and moral abyss , " le pen told cheering supporters in paris .
the national front leader , who stunned france in 2002 when he made it to the run-off presidential ballot against current president jacques chirac , urged his voters to " save their votes " for parliamentary elections in june .
" i call on voters who have shown their confidence in me to cast their vote neither for madame royal nor for mr. sarkozy , " le pen said in a speech in front of the ornate paris opera house after his party 's traditional may 1 parade .
more than 4,000 supporters took part in the parade , shouting " we want le pen , not segolene .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 02.05.2007 documenta art expo discovers color großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : documenta visitors will stroll through pink rooms every five years , kassel gears up to host art fans from all over the world at the summer-long documenta exhibition .
shortly before documenta 12 opens its doors , the curators have introduced their architectonic concept . the white cube , an exhibition space painted entirely white , is history - at least at documenta 12 .
color is the order of the day .
" it 's good for painting and with photography .
we are indeed used to the white , but black-and-white photography simply comes across much better on colored walls , " said curator ruth noack .
noack admitted that not all artists were enthusiastic about the idea of showing their work on a salmon pink or olive green background .
but colorful surroundings for showing art are common in some countries .
thus , the thai artist who will show at documenta 12 - and whose name has n't yet been released - was very pleased with the pink room in which his buddha sculptures will be displayed , noack said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noack and buergel western european and american artists in particular are accustomed to the white cube , which always casts their work in a regular , controllable light .
there is , however , an older european tradition of hanging artworks on colorful walls .
creating a mood the documenta plans to use color to put contemporary art in the right perspective as well as to create a special atmosphere for visitors , said artistic director roger m. buergel .
" architecture is a medium that either makes you float or weighs you down .
and the moment that you start to establish relationships , it becomes something very light and happy , and for that you have to create an atmosphere - that 's why -lrb- we decided on -rrb- colors , " buergel said .
the artists ' desires also played a role , he said , requiring different architectural approaches .
" some want to be hidden , others want to be discovered , others want to be accentuated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fridericianum art hall is the heart of the show buergel was mainly referring to the exhibition 's interior architecture , seeing as almost all the buildings used for the documenta are decades - if not centuries - old .
architect tim hupe reconstructed some of the original interior architecture , such as rebuilding a flight of stairs that had been removed from one building in the 1980s .
hupe 's team also reopened walled-in windows to let natural light into the rooms .
some artists are especially keen to show their work in the intimate cabinet rooms of the classicist buildings .
greenhouses for art documenta 12 erected a temporary building for art that needs air and space : the crystal palace .
the wide halls built on a vast field look like greenhouses and give the impression of transparency .
but that was n't the aim .
" art needs to be protected from light and weather , and this building supplies that , " hupe said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crystal palace was erected only for this year 's documenta there are no permanent walls in the crystal palace so that the curators are free to install the art according to how they think it should be shown and put in partitions as they see fit .
" of course , you can only do something like this for a one-time thing like the documenta , " said hupe .
" there , one time , in one place , an art work will be shown . "
documenta 12 opens to the public on june 16 and runs until sept .

schäuble , a conservative , insisted that progress had been made " on many points " and said open and frank discussions were the only way forward to ease the integration of muslims in german society .
" we all agreed that this process is the right one and that it has made progress .
it was a step in the right direction , " schäuble told journalists after the meeting .
but the head of the central council of muslims , ayyub axel köhler , said : " we can not go on like this , debating without any aim . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sitting at the same table at least " there must be an evaluation of this whole process , " he said .
" we need to set concrete goals and we need to lay out a roadmap . " the meeting with schäuble was a review of the first seven months of negotiations in working parties on plans for islam classes for muslims in german public schools and mosque demands for legal rights similar to churches .
no agreements have been reached yet .
who represents whom much of the debate ahead of the meeting focused on the role of the recently formed muslim coordination council , a move which interior minister schäuble has welcomed .
the council is an umbrella group comprising the central council of muslims and three other organizations : the turkish islamic union for religious affairs , the islamic council and the association of islamic cultural centers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nearly three and a half million muslims live in germany the groups have said they would try to find a joint stance on issues such as immigration , integration and extremism , while remaining independent . but since it only represents the 300,000 people who belong to islamic organizations , schäuble says its ability to speak for the 3.4 million muslims living in germany is limited .
of germany 's muslims , about 2.4 million are turks or people of turkish descent , many of them children and grandchildren of guest workers invited to germany in the 1960s and 1970s .
another 200,000 muslims in germany come from north africa .
there are also about 55,000 afghans in the community , 60,000 iranians and 160,000 bosnian muslims , according to official estimates . germany 's muslim community is overwhelmingly sunni .
divisions among muslims there were some divisions between religious and secular muslims which came to light during the meeting , in particular when it came to women 's dress and the mixing of the sexes . the government and secularists have rejected complaints by conservative muslim families about girls wearing swimsuits in the presence of boys while being taught swimming at german schools . schäuble said it was the " rule " in germany that girls and boys were educated in school together .
he said he had heard the objections to mixed sports , adding : " we will continue to be talking about this . "
the first meeting of the groups with the government last september was overshadowed by a row over the staging in berlin of a mozart opera , " idomeneo , " which featured the severed head of the prophet mohammed in one scene .
the opera was pulled from the schedule over fears of violent protests by islamic radicals , but was staged later amid tight security . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new umbrella organization to represent muslims in germany islamic associations in germany have announced they have founded an umbrella organization .

the question of who actually shot siegfried buback in april 1977 remains unresolved .
federal prosecutor monika harms re-opened the case this month after former raf member peter-jürgen boock indicated that christian klar , who had been sentenced to jail for numerous murders carried out by the extreme left-wing terrorists , was not the killer .
michael buback wrote that one witness , who said he had been sitting in his parked car next that of siegfried buback , heard the shots and saw two masked figures on a motorcycle .
the passenger had been holding a gun and could have been a woman , the man said in a newspaper article from the time .
buback wrote that another person had seen the motorcycle on the day before the assassination and had given testimony that the passenger sitting behind the driver was " small and delicate . "
buback said he had been irritated that only knut folkerts , christian klar and günter sonnenberg were mentioned as the perpetrators , although none of the men was shorter than 1.80 meters -lrb- 5 feet 9 inches -rrb- .
fresh suspicions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verena becker in the 1970s some german press reports have suggested that former raf member verena becker fired the shots .
she had reportedly used the same machine gun that killed siegfried buback during her arrested in 1977 .
buback called on the federal prosecutor 's office to explain why the two witnesses had not been asked to identify the people they had seen in a police line-up .
the raf - also known as the baader-meinhof gang after its founders andreas baader and ulrike meinhof - mounted a violent campaign against what it considered was the oppressive capitalist state of west germany from 1977 to 1982 .

but that goal was disallowed after the dutch striker was ruled offside in a call that is sure to have led to loud debates in pubs across england . dutchmen hold nerves in shoot-out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liverpool keeper pepe reina was the man of the match liverpool 's boudewijn zenden was first to step up to the spot in the penalty shoot-out , and he made no mistake .

haniyeh used the meeting to call on " the international community to work with the national unity government in an official and direct manner as it represents the will of the palestinian people , " according to a statement from his office .
he also made another appealed for a direct aid embargo on his cabinet to be lifted .
triantaphyllides told the afp news agency the delegation had come to gaza " to see exactly what the situation is because we are for helping and finding a solution to the problem . "
" we consider this government as an opportunity to facilitate the peace process , " he said .
israel denounces eu-hamas meeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gaza remains a volatile place the eu , along with israel and the united states , considers hamas a terrorist organization , and froze direct aid and diplomatic contacts with the palestinian government after the islamist movement first formed a cabinet last year .
many palestinians thought aid payments would be reinstated when hamas on march 17 formed a unity cabinet with president mahmud abbas ' secular fatah faction and western-backed independents , but the west has so far refused to lift the freeze .
the eu and us are demanding that the government explicitly recognize israel , renounce violence and agree to abide by past peace deals for the aid to resume .
israeli foreign ministry spokesman mark regev criticized tuesday 's meeting .
" the eu has classified hamas as a terrorist organization and the eu leadership has boycotted hamas , " he told afp .
" thankfully this delegation does not speak for the eu .
" giving legitimacy and recognition to an organization that refuses to support peace and refuses to renounce terrorism can not but strengthen that organization 's extremist agenda , " regev said .
olmert under mounting pressure to resign separately , israeli prime minister ehud olmert 's political future appeared increasingly uncertain on wednesday as pressure mounted on him to resign for his handling of the lebanon war last year .

the winograd commission said the cabinet rubber-stamped the decision to go to war but olmert bore " supreme responsibility " for launching the air , sea and land assaults without a proper plan after hezbollah seized two israeli soldiers on july 12 .
during the 34-day campaign in which hezbollah rained 4,000 rockets on israel and israeli warplanes pounded southern beirut , more than 1,000 people were killed in lebanon , including about 900 civilians , while 117 israeli troops died along with 41 civilians caught in the rocket strikes in northern israel .

" we share the concerns about the increasing violence around the estonian embassy in moscow , " said an eu external relations spokeswoman , calling on russia to respect its international obligations on embassies and their staff .
on wednesday evening the german ambassador to moscow presented a diplomatic demarche to the russian government in the name of the whole eu , setting out the eu 's misgivings over the row , the german foreign ministry confirmed . earlier chancellor angela merkel had phoned estonian prime minister andrus ansip to assure him that germany was doing all it could to ease the row with russia , estonian officials said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the pro-kremlin youth group nashi block a newspaper building entrance in moscow also on wednesday , estonia closed its consulate within the embassy compound after pro-kremlin youth activists blocked diplomats and scuffled with the ambassador 's bodyguards in protest at the relocation of a soviet war memorial in the baltic state 's capital tallinn .
" the consulate 's business is stopped and we will not give visas until the situation is normalized around the embassy , " ambassador marina kaljurand told journalists shortly after the nashi -lrb- ours -rrb- youth group tried to disrupt her press conference .
consulates in pskov and saint petersburg will remain open for the time being , she said .
russia defiant the russian foreign ministry sounded a defiant note on wednesday as it responded to criticism of its handling of a row with estonia by laying the blame at tallinn 's door . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonian ambassador unpopular among protestors " the flame of passions and civil society 's reaction in russia were provoked by the actions of the estonian side , " foreign ministry spokesman mikhail kamynin said in remarks run by interfax . last thursday the estonian government ordered that a red army monument in central tallinn be relocated to a nearby war cemetery .
the move sparked protests , which rapidly spilled over into the worst rioting estonia has seen since the russian revolution . estonians see the monument as a symbol of their country 's illegal occupation by the soviet union , but most ethnic russians see it as a tribute to russians ' sacrifice in the victory over nazism . tensions increase kaljurand said her bodyguards were forced to use gas after members of the kremlin-backed nashi group broke into the newspaper offices where she was holding the press conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonian ambassador kaljurand speaks to the media after youth activists tried to attack her " there was an attack aimed at me , but no one got to me , " she said .
" there was a fight between my guards and activists from the nashi organization and the guards had to use gas . "
the estonian foreign ministry denounced the attack and called for a swift international response .
" physical attacks on the estonian republic 's diplomatic representative are unprecedented and absolutely unjustifiable .
these attacks call for immediate actions from the international community , " the foreign ministry in tallinn said in a statement .
call for european help tallinn has called for help from the european union and claims that the russian authorities are fomenting unrest in the former soviet republic .
" we hope that the whole issue behind this will be solved between the russian government and the estonian government through dialogue and negotiation , " the european commission spokeswoman said . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu pledges help in estonia-russia row the european union has promised to help end a virtual siege of the estonian embassy in moscow sparked by the removal of a soviet-era war memorial in tallinn , estonia 's foreign minister urmas paet said tuesday .

schäuble , a conservative , insisted that progress had been made " on many points " and said open and frank discussions were the only way forward to ease the integration of muslims in german society .
" we all agreed that this process is the right one and that it has made progress .
it was a step in the right direction , " schäuble told journalists after the meeting .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sitting at the same table at least " there must be an evaluation of this whole process , " he said .
" we need to set concrete goals and we need to lay out a roadmap . " the meeting with schäuble was a review of the first seven months of negotiations in working parties on plans for islam classes for muslims in german public schools and mosque demands for legal rights similar to churches .
no agreements have been reached yet .
who represents whom much of the debate ahead of the meeting focused on the role of the recently formed muslim coordination council , a move which interior minister schäuble has welcomed .

there are also about 55,000 afghans in the community , 60,000 iranians and 160,000 bosnian muslims , according to official estimates . germany 's muslim community is overwhelmingly sunni .
divisions among muslims there were some divisions between religious and secular muslims which came to light during the meeting , in particular when it came to women 's dress and the mixing of the sexes . the government and secularists have rejected complaints by conservative muslim families about girls wearing swimsuits in the presence of boys while being taught swimming at german schools . schäuble said it was the " rule " in germany that girls and boys were educated in school together .
he said he had heard the objections to mixed sports , adding : " we will continue to be talking about this . "
the first meeting of the groups with the government last september was overshadowed by a row over the staging in berlin of a mozart opera , " idomeneo , " which featured the severed head of the prophet mohammed in one scene .

the question of who actually shot siegfried buback in april 1977 remains unresolved .
federal prosecutor monika harms re-opened the case this month after former raf member peter-jürgen boock indicated that christian klar , who had been sentenced to jail for numerous murders carried out by the extreme left-wing terrorists , was not the killer .
michael buback wrote that one witness , who said he had been sitting in his parked car next that of siegfried buback , heard the shots and saw two masked figures on a motorcycle .
the passenger had been holding a gun and could have been a woman , the man said in a newspaper article from the time .
buback wrote that another person had seen the motorcycle on the day before the assassination and had given testimony that the passenger sitting behind the driver was " small and delicate . "
buback said he had been irritated that only knut folkerts , christian klar and günter sonnenberg were mentioned as the perpetrators , although none of the men was shorter than 1.80 meters -lrb- 5 feet 9 inches -rrb- .
fresh suspicions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verena becker in the 1970s some german press reports have suggested that former raf member verena becker fired the shots .
she had reportedly used the same machine gun that killed siegfried buback during her arrested in 1977 .
buback called on the federal prosecutor 's office to explain why the two witnesses had not been asked to identify the people they had seen in a police line-up .
the raf - also known as the baader-meinhof gang after its founders andreas baader and ulrike meinhof - mounted a violent campaign against what it considered was the oppressive capitalist state of west germany from 1977 to 1982 .
it targeted the german elite and the us military based in germany .

karlsruhe kept the purse strings tight and have secured promotion with four matches left .
their stories are an object lesson in what clubs should and should n't do . second-division karlsruhe 's 1-0 win over unterhaching last weekend wo n't go down as one of history 's great matches .
but it was enough to ensure that the traditional southern german club returns to the first division for the first time in the new millennium . karlsruhe did everything right this season .
they won their first match 4-0 and were never worse than second in the table . karlsruhe 's march to the top shows that you do n't necessarily need masses of cash to be successful .
their budget for player salaries is only 13 million euros -lrb- $ 16 million -rrb- .
the team 's management did n't splash out for big names - most of the players on the squad are unfamiliar to anyone but hardcore fans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karlsruhe have n't been this good since ollie kahn played for the team karlsruhe 's strength is their midfield , built around german-italian playmaker giovanni federico .
once dismissed as an eternal prospect who never blossomed , federico has racked up 16 goals and 13 assists while karlsruhe dominated the second division like no team ever before . a lot of top-flight clubs could learn a lesson from karlsruhe 's success .
you can afford to be mediocre at the front or the back .
but it 's impossible to win without power in midfield , which is where , of course , most of soccer matches are played . gladbach disaster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : big spending gladbach are off to the second division borussia mönchengladbach 's 1-0 loss to stuttgart last weekend was n't the worst match they 'd played this season .
but it , combined with the other results , meant that gladbach will be relegated - after staying in first division since 2001 - regardless of the results in the last three games . gladbach 's demise is also edifying .
the team began the season by allowing a star coach , former champions league winner jupp heynckes , to spend almost as much as karlsruhe 's entire player budget to acquire new talent . defensively , gladbach were okay .
they 've only conceded 38 goals thus far - seventh best in the league .
it 's their offense , with a mere 22 goals to its name , that 's been atrocious . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playmaker insua was the most expensive transfer in gladbach history the poor performance up front comes down to a shoddy midfield .
given enough good chances , even the world 's worst striker will score .
but even the best forward , on the other hand , wo n't be popping in many goals , if he never gets the ball in the box . gladbach 's new argentine playmaker federico insua never seemed comfortable at borussia park .
nor did his potential back-ups michael delura and belgian bernd thijs .
together with countryman wesley sonck , thijs even succeeded in getting himself thrown off the squad . the result was that gladbach was unable to move the ball up the field with any control or coherence .
heynckes stepped down in february , but his successor jos luhukay could n't turn things around .
on paper he had the talent at his disposal , but on the pitch , that talent was too ill-matched to generate any consistent offensive pressure .
hello , second division . where they go from here bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karlsruhe will be playing bayern and bremen next year getting promoted is a huge challenge for any small side , while big clubs who get relegated are expected to regroup and rise again .
but do n't expect karlsruhe and gladbach 's fortunes necessarily to be reversed this time next season . karlsruhe will have to replace federico , who 's off to dortmund .
but even with their tiny budget , the german first division is mediocre enough that if karlsruhe invest wisely , they should be able to compete with all but the top teams . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youngster jansen is likely headed elsewhere meanwhile , gladbach are slashing their budget in half - from 60 million euros to 30 million euros -lrb- $ 78 to $ 39 million -rrb- .
they 'll probably have to sell off their best young player , marcel jansen , and the heart and soul of the team , german international striker oliver neuville , is 34 years old and prone to injury . it may take a while for gladbach , previously a german soccer powerhouse , to recover from a dismal season of mistakes in management and midfield . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen blow gilt-edged chance to take bundesliga summit werder bremen coach thomas schaaf rued his side 's missed golden opportunity to go top of the bundesliga on sunday as they crashed to a shock 3-2 defeat at relegation-threatened arminia bielefeld .

" we share the concerns about the increasing violence around the estonian embassy in moscow , " said an eu external relations spokeswoman , calling on russia to respect its international obligations on embassies and their staff .
on wednesday evening the german ambassador to moscow presented a diplomatic demarche to the russian government in the name of the whole eu , setting out the eu 's misgivings over the row , the german foreign ministry confirmed . earlier chancellor angela merkel had phoned estonian prime minister andrus ansip to assure him that germany was doing all it could to ease the row with russia , estonian officials said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the pro-kremlin youth group nashi block a newspaper building entrance in moscow also on wednesday , estonia closed its consulate within the embassy compound after pro-kremlin youth activists blocked diplomats and scuffled with the ambassador 's bodyguards in protest at the relocation of a soviet war memorial in the baltic state 's capital tallinn .
" the consulate 's business is stopped and we will not give visas until the situation is normalized around the embassy , " ambassador marina kaljurand told journalists shortly after the nashi -lrb- ours -rrb- youth group tried to disrupt her press conference .
consulates in pskov and saint petersburg will remain open for the time being , she said .
russia defiant the russian foreign ministry sounded a defiant note on wednesday as it responded to criticism of its handling of a row with estonia by laying the blame at tallinn 's door . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonian ambassador unpopular among protestors " the flame of passions and civil society 's reaction in russia were provoked by the actions of the estonian side , " foreign ministry spokesman mikhail kamynin said in remarks run by interfax . last thursday the estonian government ordered that a red army monument in central tallinn be relocated to a nearby war cemetery .
the move sparked protests , which rapidly spilled over into the worst rioting estonia has seen since the russian revolution . estonians see the monument as a symbol of their country 's illegal occupation by the soviet union , but most ethnic russians see it as a tribute to russians ' sacrifice in the victory over nazism . tensions increase kaljurand said her bodyguards were forced to use gas after members of the kremlin-backed nashi group broke into the newspaper offices where she was holding the press conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonian ambassador kaljurand speaks to the media after youth activists tried to attack her " there was an attack aimed at me , but no one got to me , " she said .
" there was a fight between my guards and activists from the nashi organization and the guards had to use gas . "
the estonian foreign ministry denounced the attack and called for a swift international response .
" physical attacks on the estonian republic 's diplomatic representative are unprecedented and absolutely unjustifiable .

" both of them are official representatives of parties and policies that for the past 30 years have brought france to the brink of a political , economic , social , cultural and moral abyss , " le pen told cheering supporters in paris .
the national front leader , who stunned france in 2002 when he made it to the run-off presidential ballot against current president jacques chirac , urged his voters to " save their votes " for parliamentary elections in june .
" i call on voters who have shown their confidence in me to cast their vote neither for madame royal nor for mr. sarkozy , " le pen said in a speech in front of the ornate paris opera house after his party 's traditional may 1 parade .
more than 4,000 supporters took part in the parade , shouting " we want le pen , not segolene .
we want jean-marie , not sarkozy . "
some 3.8 million people voted in the first round for the 78-year-old anti-immigrant leader , who took fourth place with 10.44 percent of the vote .
le pen lost many voters to sarkozy , the right-winger who has consistently led in the opinion polls since campaigning began .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of le pen 's votes would go to right-wing candidate sarkozy he has accused sarkozy during the campaign of encroaching on his territory with his tough stance on immigration and law and order , and sarkozy 's left-wing critics likewise accused him of pandering to the extreme right .
but le pen warned : " it would be illusory and dangerous to vote for the socialist candidate to get revenge for the hold-up carried out on our program by nicolas sarkozy . "
the majority of le pen voters - 61 percent according to a poll published tuesday - were seen as likely to cast ballots for sarkozy .
the ipsos / dell poll said 15 percent would pick royal .
battle for the center the presidential rivals were continuing their battle for support from the 6.8 million voters who chose the centrist francois bayrou in the april 22 first round .
bayrou has denounced sarkozy and has been making overtures to royal , a former environment minister .
an ipsos opinion poll released tuesday said 41 percent of voters who picked bayrou in the first round will choose royal on sunday , while 32 percent will go for sarkozy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : segolene royal is fighting hard to get the centrist vote the high point of the election campaign comes on wednesday , when sarkozy and royal , who wants to be france 's first woman president , face each other for a two-hour televised debate expected to attract 20 million viewers .
sarkozy , the son of a hungarian immigrant , has pushed a right-wing program based on the themes of work and national identity .
his tough talk has sparked fears he would divide rather than unite the nation .
royal , an army officer 's daughter , has presented herself as a nurturing mother figure and has proposed a leftist economic program that would keep france 's generous welfare system intact .
new generation both candidates come from a new generation of leaders born after world war ii , and both claim to represent a break from a discredited past .
the pair also agrees that france needs radical solutions to save it from a huge public debt , stubbornly high unemployment and seething discontent in the high-immigration suburbs .

schäuble , a conservative , insisted that progress had been made " on many points " and said open and frank discussions were the only way forward to ease the integration of muslims in german society .
" we all agreed that this process is the right one and that it has made progress .
it was a step in the right direction , " schäuble told journalists after the meeting .
but the head of the central council of muslims , ayyub axel köhler , said : " we can not go on like this , debating without any aim . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sitting at the same table at least " there must be an evaluation of this whole process , " he said .
" we need to set concrete goals and we need to lay out a roadmap . " the meeting with schäuble was a review of the first seven months of negotiations in working parties on plans for islam classes for muslims in german public schools and mosque demands for legal rights similar to churches .
no agreements have been reached yet .
who represents whom much of the debate ahead of the meeting focused on the role of the recently formed muslim coordination council , a move which interior minister schäuble has welcomed .
the council is an umbrella group comprising the central council of muslims and three other organizations : the turkish islamic union for religious affairs , the islamic council and the association of islamic cultural centers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nearly three and a half million muslims live in germany the groups have said they would try to find a joint stance on issues such as immigration , integration and extremism , while remaining independent . but since it only represents the 300,000 people who belong to islamic organizations , schäuble says its ability to speak for the 3.4 million muslims living in germany is limited .
of germany 's muslims , about 2.4 million are turks or people of turkish descent , many of them children and grandchildren of guest workers invited to germany in the 1960s and 1970s .
another 200,000 muslims in germany come from north africa .
there are also about 55,000 afghans in the community , 60,000 iranians and 160,000 bosnian muslims , according to official estimates . germany 's muslim community is overwhelmingly sunni .
divisions among muslims there were some divisions between religious and secular muslims which came to light during the meeting , in particular when it came to women 's dress and the mixing of the sexes . the government and secularists have rejected complaints by conservative muslim families about girls wearing swimsuits in the presence of boys while being taught swimming at german schools . schäuble said it was the " rule " in germany that girls and boys were educated in school together .
he said he had heard the objections to mixed sports , adding : " we will continue to be talking about this . "
the first meeting of the groups with the government last september was overshadowed by a row over the staging in berlin of a mozart opera , " idomeneo , " which featured the severed head of the prophet mohammed in one scene .
the opera was pulled from the schedule over fears of violent protests by islamic radicals , but was staged later amid tight security . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new umbrella organization to represent muslims in germany islamic associations in germany have announced they have founded an umbrella organization .

haniyeh used the meeting to call on " the international community to work with the national unity government in an official and direct manner as it represents the will of the palestinian people , " according to a statement from his office .
he also made another appealed for a direct aid embargo on his cabinet to be lifted .
triantaphyllides told the afp news agency the delegation had come to gaza " to see exactly what the situation is because we are for helping and finding a solution to the problem . "
" we consider this government as an opportunity to facilitate the peace process , " he said .
israel denounces eu-hamas meeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gaza remains a volatile place the eu , along with israel and the united states , considers hamas a terrorist organization , and froze direct aid and diplomatic contacts with the palestinian government after the islamist movement first formed a cabinet last year .
many palestinians thought aid payments would be reinstated when hamas on march 17 formed a unity cabinet with president mahmud abbas ' secular fatah faction and western-backed independents , but the west has so far refused to lift the freeze .
the eu and us are demanding that the government explicitly recognize israel , renounce violence and agree to abide by past peace deals for the aid to resume .
israeli foreign ministry spokesman mark regev criticized tuesday 's meeting .
" the eu has classified hamas as a terrorist organization and the eu leadership has boycotted hamas , " he told afp .
" thankfully this delegation does not speak for the eu .
" giving legitimacy and recognition to an organization that refuses to support peace and refuses to renounce terrorism can not but strengthen that organization 's extremist agenda , " regev said .
olmert under mounting pressure to resign separately , israeli prime minister ehud olmert 's political future appeared increasingly uncertain on wednesday as pressure mounted on him to resign for his handling of the lebanon war last year .

the winograd commission said the cabinet rubber-stamped the decision to go to war but olmert bore " supreme responsibility " for launching the air , sea and land assaults without a proper plan after hezbollah seized two israeli soldiers on july 12 .
during the 34-day campaign in which hezbollah rained 4,000 rockets on israel and israeli warplanes pounded southern beirut , more than 1,000 people were killed in lebanon , including about 900 civilians , while 117 israeli troops died along with 41 civilians caught in the rocket strikes in northern israel .

" we share the concerns about the increasing violence around the estonian embassy in moscow , " said an eu external relations spokeswoman , calling on russia to respect its international obligations on embassies and their staff .
on wednesday evening the german ambassador to moscow presented a diplomatic demarche to the russian government in the name of the whole eu , setting out the eu 's misgivings over the row , the german foreign ministry confirmed . earlier chancellor angela merkel had phoned estonian prime minister andrus ansip to assure him that germany was doing all it could to ease the row with russia , estonian officials said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the pro-kremlin youth group nashi block a newspaper building entrance in moscow also on wednesday , estonia closed its consulate within the embassy compound after pro-kremlin youth activists blocked diplomats and scuffled with the ambassador 's bodyguards in protest at the relocation of a soviet war memorial in the baltic state 's capital tallinn .
" the consulate 's business is stopped and we will not give visas until the situation is normalized around the embassy , " ambassador marina kaljurand told journalists shortly after the nashi -lrb- ours -rrb- youth group tried to disrupt her press conference .
consulates in pskov and saint petersburg will remain open for the time being , she said .
russia defiant the russian foreign ministry sounded a defiant note on wednesday as it responded to criticism of its handling of a row with estonia by laying the blame at tallinn 's door . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonian ambassador unpopular among protestors " the flame of passions and civil society 's reaction in russia were provoked by the actions of the estonian side , " foreign ministry spokesman mikhail kamynin said in remarks run by interfax . last thursday the estonian government ordered that a red army monument in central tallinn be relocated to a nearby war cemetery .
the move sparked protests , which rapidly spilled over into the worst rioting estonia has seen since the russian revolution . estonians see the monument as a symbol of their country 's illegal occupation by the soviet union , but most ethnic russians see it as a tribute to russians ' sacrifice in the victory over nazism . tensions increase kaljurand said her bodyguards were forced to use gas after members of the kremlin-backed nashi group broke into the newspaper offices where she was holding the press conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonian ambassador kaljurand speaks to the media after youth activists tried to attack her " there was an attack aimed at me , but no one got to me , " she said .
" there was a fight between my guards and activists from the nashi organization and the guards had to use gas . "
the estonian foreign ministry denounced the attack and called for a swift international response .
" physical attacks on the estonian republic 's diplomatic representative are unprecedented and absolutely unjustifiable .
these attacks call for immediate actions from the international community , " the foreign ministry in tallinn said in a statement .
call for european help tallinn has called for help from the european union and claims that the russian authorities are fomenting unrest in the former soviet republic .

but colorful surroundings for showing art are common in some countries .
thus , the thai artist who will show at documenta 12 - and whose name has n't yet been released - was very pleased with the pink room in which his buddha sculptures will be displayed , noack said .

the question of who actually shot siegfried buback in april 1977 remains unresolved .
federal prosecutor monika harms re-opened the case this month after former raf member peter-jürgen boock indicated that christian klar , who had been sentenced to jail for numerous murders carried out by the extreme left-wing terrorists , was not the killer .
michael buback wrote that one witness , who said he had been sitting in his parked car next that of siegfried buback , heard the shots and saw two masked figures on a motorcycle .
the passenger had been holding a gun and could have been a woman , the man said in a newspaper article from the time .
buback wrote that another person had seen the motorcycle on the day before the assassination and had given testimony that the passenger sitting behind the driver was " small and delicate . "
buback said he had been irritated that only knut folkerts , christian klar and günter sonnenberg were mentioned as the perpetrators , although none of the men was shorter than 1.80 meters -lrb- 5 feet 9 inches -rrb- .
fresh suspicions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verena becker in the 1970s some german press reports have suggested that former raf member verena becker fired the shots .
she had reportedly used the same machine gun that killed siegfried buback during her arrested in 1977 .
buback called on the federal prosecutor 's office to explain why the two witnesses had not been asked to identify the people they had seen in a police line-up .
the raf - also known as the baader-meinhof gang after its founders andreas baader and ulrike meinhof - mounted a violent campaign against what it considered was the oppressive capitalist state of west germany from 1977 to 1982 .
it targeted the german elite and the us military based in germany .

the question of who actually shot siegfried buback in april 1977 remains unresolved .
federal prosecutor monika harms re-opened the case this month after former raf member peter-jürgen boock indicated that christian klar , who had been sentenced to jail for numerous murders carried out by the extreme left-wing terrorists , was not the killer .
michael buback wrote that one witness , who said he had been sitting in his parked car next that of siegfried buback , heard the shots and saw two masked figures on a motorcycle .
the passenger had been holding a gun and could have been a woman , the man said in a newspaper article from the time .
buback wrote that another person had seen the motorcycle on the day before the assassination and had given testimony that the passenger sitting behind the driver was " small and delicate . "
buback said he had been irritated that only knut folkerts , christian klar and günter sonnenberg were mentioned as the perpetrators , although none of the men was shorter than 1.80 meters -lrb- 5 feet 9 inches -rrb- .
fresh suspicions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verena becker in the 1970s some german press reports have suggested that former raf member verena becker fired the shots .
she had reportedly used the same machine gun that killed siegfried buback during her arrested in 1977 .
buback called on the federal prosecutor 's office to explain why the two witnesses had not been asked to identify the people they had seen in a police line-up .
the raf - also known as the baader-meinhof gang after its founders andreas baader and ulrike meinhof - mounted a violent campaign against what it considered was the oppressive capitalist state of west germany from 1977 to 1982 .

" we share the concerns about the increasing violence around the estonian embassy in moscow , " said an eu external relations spokeswoman , calling on russia to respect its international obligations on embassies and their staff .
on wednesday evening the german ambassador to moscow presented a diplomatic demarche to the russian government in the name of the whole eu , setting out the eu 's misgivings over the row , the german foreign ministry confirmed . earlier chancellor angela merkel had phoned estonian prime minister andrus ansip to assure him that germany was doing all it could to ease the row with russia , estonian officials said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the pro-kremlin youth group nashi block a newspaper building entrance in moscow also on wednesday , estonia closed its consulate within the embassy compound after pro-kremlin youth activists blocked diplomats and scuffled with the ambassador 's bodyguards in protest at the relocation of a soviet war memorial in the baltic state 's capital tallinn .
" the consulate 's business is stopped and we will not give visas until the situation is normalized around the embassy , " ambassador marina kaljurand told journalists shortly after the nashi -lrb- ours -rrb- youth group tried to disrupt her press conference .
consulates in pskov and saint petersburg will remain open for the time being , she said .
russia defiant the russian foreign ministry sounded a defiant note on wednesday as it responded to criticism of its handling of a row with estonia by laying the blame at tallinn 's door . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonian ambassador unpopular among protestors " the flame of passions and civil society 's reaction in russia were provoked by the actions of the estonian side , " foreign ministry spokesman mikhail kamynin said in remarks run by interfax . last thursday the estonian government ordered that a red army monument in central tallinn be relocated to a nearby war cemetery .
the move sparked protests , which rapidly spilled over into the worst rioting estonia has seen since the russian revolution . estonians see the monument as a symbol of their country 's illegal occupation by the soviet union , but most ethnic russians see it as a tribute to russians ' sacrifice in the victory over nazism . tensions increase kaljurand said her bodyguards were forced to use gas after members of the kremlin-backed nashi group broke into the newspaper offices where she was holding the press conference .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonian ambassador kaljurand speaks to the media after youth activists tried to attack her " there was an attack aimed at me , but no one got to me , " she said .
" there was a fight between my guards and activists from the nashi organization and the guards had to use gas . "
the estonian foreign ministry denounced the attack and called for a swift international response .
" physical attacks on the estonian republic 's diplomatic representative are unprecedented and absolutely unjustifiable .
these attacks call for immediate actions from the international community , " the foreign ministry in tallinn said in a statement .
call for european help tallinn has called for help from the european union and claims that the russian authorities are fomenting unrest in the former soviet republic .
" we hope that the whole issue behind this will be solved between the russian government and the estonian government through dialogue and negotiation , " the european commission spokeswoman said . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu pledges help in estonia-russia row the european union has promised to help end a virtual siege of the estonian embassy in moscow sparked by the removal of a soviet-era war memorial in tallinn , estonia 's foreign minister urmas paet said tuesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 02.05.2007 documenta art expo discovers color großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : documenta visitors will stroll through pink rooms every five years , kassel gears up to host art fans from all over the world at the summer-long documenta exhibition .
shortly before documenta 12 opens its doors , the curators have introduced their architectonic concept . the white cube , an exhibition space painted entirely white , is history - at least at documenta 12 .
color is the order of the day .
" it 's good for painting and with photography .
we are indeed used to the white , but black-and-white photography simply comes across much better on colored walls , " said curator ruth noack .
noack admitted that not all artists were enthusiastic about the idea of showing their work on a salmon pink or olive green background .
but colorful surroundings for showing art are common in some countries .
thus , the thai artist who will show at documenta 12 - and whose name has n't yet been released - was very pleased with the pink room in which his buddha sculptures will be displayed , noack said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noack and buergel western european and american artists in particular are accustomed to the white cube , which always casts their work in a regular , controllable light .
there is , however , an older european tradition of hanging artworks on colorful walls .
creating a mood the documenta plans to use color to put contemporary art in the right perspective as well as to create a special atmosphere for visitors , said artistic director roger m. buergel .
" architecture is a medium that either makes you float or weighs you down .
and the moment that you start to establish relationships , it becomes something very light and happy , and for that you have to create an atmosphere - that 's why -lrb- we decided on -rrb- colors , " buergel said .
the artists ' desires also played a role , he said , requiring different architectural approaches .
" some want to be hidden , others want to be discovered , others want to be accentuated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fridericianum art hall is the heart of the show buergel was mainly referring to the exhibition 's interior architecture , seeing as almost all the buildings used for the documenta are decades - if not centuries - old .
architect tim hupe reconstructed some of the original interior architecture , such as rebuilding a flight of stairs that had been removed from one building in the 1980s .
hupe 's team also reopened walled-in windows to let natural light into the rooms .
some artists are especially keen to show their work in the intimate cabinet rooms of the classicist buildings .
greenhouses for art documenta 12 erected a temporary building for art that needs air and space : the crystal palace .
the wide halls built on a vast field look like greenhouses and give the impression of transparency .
but that was n't the aim .
" art needs to be protected from light and weather , and this building supplies that , " hupe said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crystal palace was erected only for this year 's documenta there are no permanent walls in the crystal palace so that the curators are free to install the art according to how they think it should be shown and put in partitions as they see fit .
" of course , you can only do something like this for a one-time thing like the documenta , " said hupe .
" there , one time , in one place , an art work will be shown . "
documenta 12 opens to the public on june 16 and runs until sept .

liverpool now hope to repeat their 2005 title . it was a tactical match on tuesday at anfield between two teams whose coaches have developed an intense - and mutual - dislike for each other .
once again rafael benitez and liverpool came out tops in a game that was long on drama , if short on highlights . liverpool needed to make up for their 1-0 loss in the first leg at stamford bridge last week , and in the 22nd minute , steven gerrard wrong-footed chelsea with a free kick crossed not into but outside of the box . danish defender daniel agger booted the ball into the net through three of his opponents to draw liverpool level on aggregate .
it was agger 's first-ever champions league goal . chelsea pay for passivity bildunterschrift : agger 's first champions league goal could n't have been more timely with the result on a knife edge , neither team was willing to risk much .
chelsea , playing without injured stars andriy shevchenko and michael ballack , created a few chances for super-striker didier drogba , but mostly he was left stranded . liverpool , meanwhile , pounded the ball in the air to striker peter crouch , but 90 minutes were n't enough for the side to deliver the knock-out punch . liverpool did find the back of the net in extra time , after dirk kuyt pounced on a rebound from chelsea keeper petr cech .
but that goal was disallowed after the dutch striker was ruled offside in a call that is sure to have led to loud debates in pubs across england . dutchmen hold nerves in shoot-out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liverpool keeper pepe reina was the man of the match liverpool 's boudewijn zenden was first to step up to the spot in the penalty shoot-out , and he made no mistake .
pepe reina then held against arjen robben , and after liverpool converted their next two , the pressure was on substitute njitap geremi . geremi was no match for reina , and a decisive blast by kuyt sent liverpool into the champions league final . morinho 's future is in doubt after yet another bitter champions league exit .

he 's to be the subject of a new book aimed at educating people about climate change . knut the baby polar bear has been basking in international adoration since his debut at the berlin zoo .
now he 's about to do his part in saving the world from environmental catastrophe . the american publisher scholastic , which also publishes the harry potter books , is to distribute a children 's book about the little bear aimed at educating people about global warming .
the book , entitled " knut : how one little polar bear captivated the world , " is being penned by best-selling author craig hatkoff and his daughters juliana and isabella and will relate the bear 's story - first in german this summer , then in english in the fall - along with plenty of pictures .
new york-based turtle pond publications and the berlin zoo told the german press agency that they had negotiated exclusive publishing rights for knut and plan a web site for him this summer along with a dvd .
unsuspecting environmental activist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is all the fame turning knut into a little narcissus ?
the five-month old bear has been hand-raised by a berlin zookeeper after being rejected by his mother .
he has become a symbol for the plight of polar bears and their habitat , which is under threat by rising global temperatures .
" we are hoping that a little polar bear can help the world de-polarize the complex issues … and raise awareness of the issues in the global climate debate , " hatkoff told reuters .
the berlin zoo has already launched its own campaign called " respect habitats.knut , " complete with a knut logo that is to serve as a seal of approval for measures taken to address climate change and other environmental issues .
gerald uhlich , chief executive of berlin zoo , told reuters that part of the book sale proceeds will be contributed to this goal .
" surely , knut will win the hearts of millions of readers and raise their awareness to environmental issues across the world , " he said in a statement . knut is likely unaware of his potential impact on the globe .

shortly before documenta 12 opens its doors , the curators have introduced their architectonic concept . the white cube , an exhibition space painted entirely white , is history - at least at documenta 12 .
color is the order of the day .
" it 's good for painting and with photography .
we are indeed used to the white , but black-and-white photography simply comes across much better on colored walls , " said curator ruth noack .
noack admitted that not all artists were enthusiastic about the idea of showing their work on a salmon pink or olive green background .
but colorful surroundings for showing art are common in some countries .
thus , the thai artist who will show at documenta 12 - and whose name has n't yet been released - was very pleased with the pink room in which his buddha sculptures will be displayed , noack said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noack and buergel western european and american artists in particular are accustomed to the white cube , which always casts their work in a regular , controllable light .
there is , however , an older european tradition of hanging artworks on colorful walls .
creating a mood the documenta plans to use color to put contemporary art in the right perspective as well as to create a special atmosphere for visitors , said artistic director roger m. buergel .
" architecture is a medium that either makes you float or weighs you down .
and the moment that you start to establish relationships , it becomes something very light and happy , and for that you have to create an atmosphere - that 's why -lrb- we decided on -rrb- colors , " buergel said .
the artists ' desires also played a role , he said , requiring different architectural approaches .
" some want to be hidden , others want to be discovered , others want to be accentuated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fridericianum art hall is the heart of the show buergel was mainly referring to the exhibition 's interior architecture , seeing as almost all the buildings used for the documenta are decades - if not centuries - old .
architect tim hupe reconstructed some of the original interior architecture , such as rebuilding a flight of stairs that had been removed from one building in the 1980s .
hupe 's team also reopened walled-in windows to let natural light into the rooms .
some artists are especially keen to show their work in the intimate cabinet rooms of the classicist buildings .
greenhouses for art documenta 12 erected a temporary building for art that needs air and space : the crystal palace .
the wide halls built on a vast field look like greenhouses and give the impression of transparency .
but that was n't the aim .
" art needs to be protected from light and weather , and this building supplies that , " hupe said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crystal palace was erected only for this year 's documenta there are no permanent walls in the crystal palace so that the curators are free to install the art according to how they think it should be shown and put in partitions as they see fit .

the question of who actually shot siegfried buback in april 1977 remains unresolved .
federal prosecutor monika harms re-opened the case this month after former raf member peter-jürgen boock indicated that christian klar , who had been sentenced to jail for numerous murders carried out by the extreme left-wing terrorists , was not the killer .
michael buback wrote that one witness , who said he had been sitting in his parked car next that of siegfried buback , heard the shots and saw two masked figures on a motorcycle .
the passenger had been holding a gun and could have been a woman , the man said in a newspaper article from the time .
buback wrote that another person had seen the motorcycle on the day before the assassination and had given testimony that the passenger sitting behind the driver was " small and delicate . "
buback said he had been irritated that only knut folkerts , christian klar and günter sonnenberg were mentioned as the perpetrators , although none of the men was shorter than 1.80 meters -lrb- 5 feet 9 inches -rrb- .
fresh suspicions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verena becker in the 1970s some german press reports have suggested that former raf member verena becker fired the shots .
she had reportedly used the same machine gun that killed siegfried buback during her arrested in 1977 .
buback called on the federal prosecutor 's office to explain why the two witnesses had not been asked to identify the people they had seen in a police line-up .
the raf - also known as the baader-meinhof gang after its founders andreas baader and ulrike meinhof - mounted a violent campaign against what it considered was the oppressive capitalist state of west germany from 1977 to 1982 .
it targeted the german elite and the us military based in germany .

karlsruhe kept the purse strings tight and have secured promotion with four matches left .
their stories are an object lesson in what clubs should and should n't do . second-division karlsruhe 's 1-0 win over unterhaching last weekend wo n't go down as one of history 's great matches .
but it was enough to ensure that the traditional southern german club returns to the first division for the first time in the new millennium . karlsruhe did everything right this season .
they won their first match 4-0 and were never worse than second in the table . karlsruhe 's march to the top shows that you do n't necessarily need masses of cash to be successful .
their budget for player salaries is only 13 million euros -lrb- $ 16 million -rrb- .
the team 's management did n't splash out for big names - most of the players on the squad are unfamiliar to anyone but hardcore fans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karlsruhe have n't been this good since ollie kahn played for the team karlsruhe 's strength is their midfield , built around german-italian playmaker giovanni federico .
once dismissed as an eternal prospect who never blossomed , federico has racked up 16 goals and 13 assists while karlsruhe dominated the second division like no team ever before . a lot of top-flight clubs could learn a lesson from karlsruhe 's success .
you can afford to be mediocre at the front or the back .
but it 's impossible to win without power in midfield , which is where , of course , most of soccer matches are played . gladbach disaster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : big spending gladbach are off to the second division borussia mönchengladbach 's 1-0 loss to stuttgart last weekend was n't the worst match they 'd played this season .
but it , combined with the other results , meant that gladbach will be relegated - after staying in first division since 2001 - regardless of the results in the last three games . gladbach 's demise is also edifying .
the team began the season by allowing a star coach , former champions league winner jupp heynckes , to spend almost as much as karlsruhe 's entire player budget to acquire new talent . defensively , gladbach were okay .
they 've only conceded 38 goals thus far - seventh best in the league .
it 's their offense , with a mere 22 goals to its name , that 's been atrocious . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playmaker insua was the most expensive transfer in gladbach history the poor performance up front comes down to a shoddy midfield .
given enough good chances , even the world 's worst striker will score .
but even the best forward , on the other hand , wo n't be popping in many goals , if he never gets the ball in the box . gladbach 's new argentine playmaker federico insua never seemed comfortable at borussia park .
nor did his potential back-ups michael delura and belgian bernd thijs .
together with countryman wesley sonck , thijs even succeeded in getting himself thrown off the squad . the result was that gladbach was unable to move the ball up the field with any control or coherence .
heynckes stepped down in february , but his successor jos luhukay could n't turn things around .
on paper he had the talent at his disposal , but on the pitch , that talent was too ill-matched to generate any consistent offensive pressure .
hello , second division . where they go from here bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karlsruhe will be playing bayern and bremen next year getting promoted is a huge challenge for any small side , while big clubs who get relegated are expected to regroup and rise again .
but do n't expect karlsruhe and gladbach 's fortunes necessarily to be reversed this time next season . karlsruhe will have to replace federico , who 's off to dortmund .
but even with their tiny budget , the german first division is mediocre enough that if karlsruhe invest wisely , they should be able to compete with all but the top teams . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youngster jansen is likely headed elsewhere meanwhile , gladbach are slashing their budget in half - from 60 million euros to 30 million euros -lrb- $ 78 to $ 39 million -rrb- .
they 'll probably have to sell off their best young player , marcel jansen , and the heart and soul of the team , german international striker oliver neuville , is 34 years old and prone to injury . it may take a while for gladbach , previously a german soccer powerhouse , to recover from a dismal season of mistakes in management and midfield . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : bremen blow gilt-edged chance to take bundesliga summit werder bremen coach thomas schaaf rued his side 's missed golden opportunity to go top of the bundesliga on sunday as they crashed to a shock 3-2 defeat at relegation-threatened arminia bielefeld .

many of the world 's biggest oil companies agreed to transfer operational control to the government .
bolivia 's president evo morales said his country 's takeover of gas fields one year ago had been " a blessing " .
mr chavez has also said he wants to pull venezuela out of the international monetary fund and the world bank . "
this is the true nationalisation of our natural resources " hugo chavez the president said he had ordered finance minister rodrigo cabezas to begin formal proceedings to withdraw from the two international bodies .
president chavez has spoken of his ambition to set up what he calls a bank of the south , backed by venezuelan oil revenues , which would finance projects in south america .
negotiations four projects taken over in the orinoco belt - which can refine about 600,000 barrels of crude oil a day - reverted to state control at midnight local time .
mr chavez told cheering workers that foreign oil companies had damaged venezuela 's national interests and that reclaiming them represented an historic victory .
" this is the true nationalisation of our natural resources , " the president said during a ceremony at the jose oil processing plant .
" today we are closing a perverse cycle . "
state oil company pdvsa will control at least 60 % of the projects , which have been ceded by conocophillips , chevron , exxon mobil , bp , statoil and total .
negotiations are continuing about continuing shareholdings and the possibility of compensation for the refineries .
venezuela has only considered agreements based on the book value of the projects rather than their much larger current net worth .
mr ramirez has said that there may not be compensation at all in some cases .
more surprises meanwhile , in bolivia , the state energy company ypfb said that it would take control of producing and marketing oil and natural gas in the country .
it comes a year after bolivian president evo morales , in his may day address , shocked international investors by seizing control of the energy industry .
in this year 's may day address , mr morales promised to take greater control of the economy from foreign companies .
" if we really want to live in a dignified bolivia then we must take the path of anti-imperialism , anti-liberalism and anti-colonialism my friends , " he said .
the government had hoped to finish nationalising the telecoms industry by may day , but talks with telecom italia - which owns half of the biggest telecoms company - are currently stalled .
telecom italia said last week that it was considering seeking international arbitration over the sale of entel after bolivia issued two decrees aimed at renationalising the company .

mr ortega returned to power earlier this year .
in the 1980s and 1990s his sandinista government fought us-funded contra rebels .

earlier this year , the royal college of midwives reported that maternity services were being pared back , putting the care of women at risk .

undercover reporter hayley cutts said : " we spoke to women across the uk who reported problems similar to those that we saw undercover so there 's no reason to believe that they just apply to the two hospitals that we went into .
" in its last report on this issue - maternity matters - the government did n't make any specific commitment to more midwives .
" it says it 's leaving it up to trusts to decide on staffing levels . "
' pared back ' the programme will do little to dampen the concerns of opposition mps who argue that a shortage of midwives has sparked a crisis .
but the government insists the uk remains one of the safest countries in the world in which to have a baby and that increased investment will see the number of midwives rise .
earlier this year , the royal college of midwives reported that maternity services were being pared back , putting the care of women at risk .
a poll of 102 out of 216 department heads found two-thirds thought their units were understaffed and one in five had lost staff in the last year .
the royal college of midwives estimates the profession needs another 3,000 midwives in the coming years .
wayne coyne 's baby daughter caitlin died after she was starved of oxygen during an emergency caesarean in hospital three years ago .
an independent inquiry recommended 24 areas where there was room for improvement at the unit which might have contributed to caitlin 's death .
he said : " the lack of midwivery care is not due to the fact that we have bad midwives .
it is the fact that they are put under so much pressure these days .
" midwives are looking after two , or maybe three mothers at the same time .
they are struggling . "

a block housing up to 450 inmates would be built at parc prison near bridgend , creating 150 jobs .
the proposal requires the go-ahead from bridgend council and the home office and it would be able to accommodate more than 1,500 prisoners .
the home office says it needs 10,000 extra prison places in wales and england by 2012 .
parc prison , run by group 4 securicor , currently provides over 1,000 places for adults , young offenders and non-convicted juveniles .
the company is putting together its proposal for a new block within the existing walls of the jail which celebrates its tenth anniversary in november .
the planning application is to be submitted to bridgend council at the end of the month .
if approval is given , a final decision will then be made by the home office .
group 4 securicor has set a target date for the new block to be opened in 2009 .
however , the probation service in wales has said it is concerned that the costs for the expansion could divert resources away from other areas .
the chief probation officer for south wales , ian lankshear , has suggested the issue of prison population should be debated .
" it raises something more fundamental which is about deciding whether we want to continue moving in the direction of a rise in prison population , " he said .
around 150 jobs could be created with the expansion " there are other ways to deal with offenders who do n't need to be incarcerated for the immediate protection of the public . "
local residents , who fought a high profile campaign against the creation of the jail , say they have no objection in principle , but have called for some localised road improvements .
in may 2006 a penal reform charity criticised overcrowding in wales ' five prisons .
according to the campaign group howard league for penal reform welsh jails were over official capacity .
during may 2006 swansea jail held 424 inmates , despite the accommodation level being 248 .
usk prison housed 238 men even though it had space for 150 men cardiff had 752 inmates , despite having room for only 524 .
parc had 1007 prisoners , although its maximum accommodation figure was 839 .

richard and wendy camp 's home at sennybridge near brecon , powys , is just metres away from heavy machinery that is operating 12 hours a day .
the noise abatement society -lrb- nas -rrb- measured the sound for the couple and said it was equivalent to a chainsaw .
the national grid said it would erect screening to help reduce the problem .
the nas measured the sound of the work at between 76 and 80 decibels , which it said was equivalent to heavy traffic or the sound of a chainsaw .
peter wakeham , of the nas , said eight residents in the sennybridge area of powys had so far complained about building project .
the constant din is making our life a misery richard camp in february , the department of trade and industry -lrb- dti -rrb- gave the go ahead for the second phase of the pipeline , part of which is passing through the brecon beacons national park .
once finished , the entire network will stretch from milford haven to gloucestershire .
mr camp , 70 , and his wife wendy , 76 , who live in the national park , said they had been complaining to national grid since march .
" we have phoned national grid 10 times and written to them five times .
we 've received no replies to our letters and just three replies to our phone calls , " said mr camp .
" it was n't until we contacted the bbc on tuesday that national grid finally decided to take action . "
mr camp said he understood the work near his home would continue for " some months " .
he added : " the heavy machinery and the beeping from reversing lorries is constant throughout the day .
" the machinery is supposed to start at 7am , but sometimes starts earlier .
it does n't finish until 7pm , and by the time its driven away it 's 7.15pm.
the camps said they have complained repeatedly " the plant is just 10 metres from our rear garden .
the constant din is making our life a misery . "
a spokeswoman for national grid said work near mr camp 's home was at its " noisiest " at the moment .
she blamed it on a process called " benching " , which sees machines remove top soil and sub-soil .
" we have been in regular contact with mr and mrs camp .
we have spoken to them and are aware of their concerns , " added the spokeswoman .
" we have come up with a tailor-made noise mitigation programme for them , which means erecting screening between their property and the working area .
" the benching process is expected to finish shortly . "

it is expected to end its term on a positive note , with evidence of growing confidence in the police .
policing has been a controversial element of the peace process in recent years , and the board has been , at times , a political battlefield .
the meeting is expected to be relatively low-key .
a new board is to be formed after the stormont assembly is restored next week .
chief constable sir hugh orde will not attend as he is otherwise engaged .
his deputy , paul leighton , will step in and he is expected to reveal that research carried out in recent months indicates growing public confidence in the police , particularly in nationalist areas .
next month 's first meeting of the new board is expected to be a very different affair .
at that point , sinn fein is expected to take its seats for the first time , which will be anything but low-key .
a former ira prisoner is one of sinn fein 's three nominees to the reconstituted policing board .
martina anderson was convicted of conspiracy to cause explosions in england in 1986 .
she is now an assembly member for foyle and the party 's director of engagement with unionists .
she will join party policing spokesman alex maskey and north antrim assembly member daithi mckay on the board .

a social worker and local councillor in a poor suburb north-east of paris , she was monitoring the vote and the last place she expected to see the deprived youths she had cared for over the years was a polling station .
" almost all of them turned up - i had never seen such political commitment , " ms ribeaucourt marvels .
" it was a moving moment .
for most of them it was the first time they had voted .
some did not even know what booths were for . "
many youths stayed behind to help count the ballots - as every french voter is entitled to do .
" it took hours because they had to be taught everything .
but it was worth it .
they got an education in citizenship , " she says .
triumph turnout at the polling station was 83 % of registered voters .
this matched the high national average .
but in one of france 's worst sink estates - where usually only about 40 % bother to vote - it was an unprecedented triumph .
the result may have been exceptional - but it was replicated in other immigrant suburbs .
in nearby clichy , one of the most deprived towns in france 's poorest department , seine-saint-denis , turnout also topped 80 % .
a year and a half ago , clichy 's teenagers launched a wave of riots that spread to banlieues -lrb- suburbs -rrb- across france .
2005 flashpoints map today , local youths - most of whom have french citizenship - are eager to air their grievances by casting ballots , not burning cars .
" electing a president is important , " says first-time voter alain djoudjou , 18 .
he recalls that in the previous presidential election in 2002 , far-right leader jean-marie le pen made it to the run-off largely through voter apathy .
" each votes counts , " he says .
in clichy - as in many other french suburbs - the vote was overwhelmingly in favour of segolene royal .
there are several reasons why the socialist candidate appeals to banlieue youths .
unlike her second-round conservative rival , nicolas sarkozy , she did bother to come to clichy during the campaign .
she is seen as reassuring and tolerant , and has promised to " listen to our suburbs where the fire is still smouldering " .
her pledge to create subsidised jobs strikes a chord in areas where unemployment is sky-high .
lofti allag , 22 , a plumbing worker from clichy , is particularly attracted by ms royal 's pledge to raise the minimum wage by 19 % .
" i 'd feel great about that , " he says .
' open season ' but to most young men in the suburbs , ms royal 's main attraction is that she is not mr sarkozy .
journalist nadir dendoune , who noted the same unprecedented level of mobilisation near saint-denis north of paris , says : " it was a vote against sarkozy . "
as interior minister , he antagonised many people by speaking about cleaning estates " with a pressure hose " and called delinquents " rabble " - a word widely used in the suburb but seen as offensive from a minister .
" i did not like his word , " says karim hamdoune , an 18-year-old from clichy , who feels that mr sarkozy " branded all arab youths as criminals " .
mehdi bigaderne , of ac le feu , an association highlighting the plight of neglected suburbs , calls mr sarkozy " scary , unpredictable and dangerously divisive " .
perhaps the most controversial aspect of the former interior minister 's legacy , in the eyes of young banlieue voters , is his decision to drop community policing in favour of tough law-and-order measures .
" sniff " , a 25-year-old from clichy who says he has been beaten by police officers , blames mr sarkozy for the sharp deterioration in relations between police and youths .
" we have been parked in sink estates and cops come here to taunt us , " he says .
" i 've seen what he did as a minister and i do n't want him as president . "
women 's vote many youths say they are much more worried about mr sarkozy than they ever were about mr le pen . "
sarkozy is reassuring - he stands for discipline - most women around here will tell you that we need him to clean this place up " sonya latrache " le pen was seen as a troublemaker rather than a serious politician , " says akram belkaid , a journalist with the business daily la tribune .
" there was never a danger of him becoming president . "
some are finding imaginative ways of fighting mr sarkozy .
omar dawson , who runs a youth association in grigny , south of paris , secretly recorded on his mobile phone a meeting between the candidate and activists in february , and posted the clip on the web .
in it , mr sarkozy is heard using typically blunt language about his own immigrant origins and the duties of newcomers .
mr dawson says he " wanted to show a different image of someone who might be our future president " - although the clip appears unlikely to change anyone 's view of the tough-talking former minister .
concern about mr sarkozy , however , is far from universal in the banlieues .
in seine-saint-denis , more than a quarter of voters voted for the centre-right candidate .
many pensioners living near estates support mr sarkozy 's firm stance on crime - and so do a large number of women residents .
sonya latrache , a 30-year-old mother of five from clichy , says she finds mr sarkozy much more reassuring than his rival .
" she does not speak with clarity and conviction ; it 's just hot air .
she is nice but she will do nothing , " she says .
" with sarkozy , you know where you stand .
he wants to help people get back to work and stands for discipline .
" most women around here will tell you that we need him to clean the place up . "
mobilisation and indeed , this is the opinion you generally hear when you speak to young girls and mothers across seine saint-denis .
elodie , a 22-year-old from montreuil a few miles from clichy , says she trusts mr sarkozy to improve security .
" in my estate , he is called racist but i do n't agree , " she says .
on the whole , however , ms royal will have the suburbs ' vote .
whether this will help her capture the presidency is unclear .
but whatever the final result , ms ribeaucourt says she is optimistic about the growing political influence of the banlieues .
" they are going to take part in public affairs , " she says .
" on every issue they will remain mobilised . "

in nearby clichy , one of the most deprived towns in france 's poorest department , seine-saint-denis , turnout also topped 80 % .
a year and a half ago , clichy 's teenagers launched a wave of riots that spread to banlieues -lrb- suburbs -rrb- across france .
2005 flashpoints map today , local youths - most of whom have french citizenship - are eager to air their grievances by casting ballots , not burning cars .
" electing a president is important , " says first-time voter alain djoudjou , 18 .
he recalls that in the previous presidential election in 2002 , far-right leader jean-marie le pen made it to the run-off largely through voter apathy .
" each votes counts , " he says .
in clichy - as in many other french suburbs - the vote was overwhelmingly in favour of segolene royal .
there are several reasons why the socialist candidate appeals to banlieue youths .
unlike her second-round conservative rival , nicolas sarkozy , she did bother to come to clichy during the campaign .
she is seen as reassuring and tolerant , and has promised to " listen to our suburbs where the fire is still smouldering " .
her pledge to create subsidised jobs strikes a chord in areas where unemployment is sky-high .
lofti allag , 22 , a plumbing worker from clichy , is particularly attracted by ms royal 's pledge to raise the minimum wage by 19 % .
" i 'd feel great about that , " he says .
' open season ' but to most young men in the suburbs , ms royal 's main attraction is that she is not mr sarkozy .
laurence ribeaucourt was amazed by the unprecedented turnout journalist nadir dendoune , who noted the same unprecedented level of mobilisation near saint-denis north of paris , says : " it was a vote against sarkozy . "
as interior minister , he antagonised many people by speaking about cleaning estates " with a pressure hose " and called delinquents " rabble " - a word widely used in the suburb but seen as offensive from a minister .
" i did not like his word , " says karim hamdoune , an 18-year-old from clichy , who feels that mr sarkozy " branded all arab youths as criminals " .
mehdi bigaderne , of ac le feu , an association highlighting the plight of neglected suburbs , calls mr sarkozy " scary , unpredictable and dangerously divisive " .
perhaps the most controversial aspect of the former interior minister 's legacy , in the eyes of young banlieue voters , is his decision to drop community policing in favour of tough law-and-order measures .
" sniff " , a 25-year-old from clichy who says he has been beaten by police officers , blames mr sarkozy for the sharp deterioration in relations between police and youths .
" we have been parked in sink estates and cops come here to taunt us , " he says .
" i 've seen what he did as a minister and i do n't want him as president . "
women 's vote many youths say they are much more worried about mr sarkozy than they ever were about mr le pen .
sarkozy is reassuring - he stands for discipline - most women around here will tell you that we need him to clean this place up sonya latrache " le pen was seen as a troublemaker rather than a serious politician , " says akram belkaid , a journalist with the business daily la tribune .
" there was never a danger of him becoming president . "
some are finding imaginative ways of fighting mr sarkozy .
omar dawson , who runs a youth association in grigny , south of paris , secretly recorded on his mobile phone a meeting between the candidate and activists in february , and posted the clip on the web .
in it , mr sarkozy is heard using typically blunt language about his own immigrant origins and the duties of newcomers .
mr dawson says he " wanted to show a different image of someone who might be our future president " - although the clip appears unlikely to change anyone 's view of the tough-talking former minister .
concern about mr sarkozy , however , is far from universal in the banlieues .
in seine-saint-denis , more than a quarter of voters voted for the centre-right candidate .
many pensioners living near estates support mr sarkozy 's firm stance on crime - and so do a large number of women residents .
sonya latrache , a 30-year-old mother of five from clichy , says she finds mr sarkozy much more reassuring than his rival .
" she does not speak with clarity and conviction ; it 's just hot air .
she is nice but she will do nothing , " she says .
" with sarkozy , you know where you stand .
he wants to help people get back to work and stands for discipline .
" most women around here will tell you that we need him to clean the place up . "

" in my estate , he is called racist but i do n't agree , " she says .

the 60 - one for every am to be elected on thursday - was selected to represent a broad range of opinion in wales .
they have been airing their views on bbc wales throughout .
now , as wales decides , it is time for the 60 to have their last say as well .
so we asked some for a final verdict on the campaign and the candidates .
owain phillips , 19 , student , aberystwyth , ceredigion : " i 'd say that it 's been a very interesting and open campaign - the most open contest for years .
" i 've heard people in other parts of wales saying that you would n't know that there 's an election on - but here in ceredigion you certainly do .
it 's been a really fierce battle and there are posters everywhere . "
owain phillips has thoroughly enjoyed the campaign kelvin griffiths , 53 , farmer and former police officer , carmel , flintshire : " in a word - it 's been disappointing .
nobody has got to grips with the real problems facing the country they 're just tinkering around the edges .
not one party is putting the country first . "
margaret teare -lrb- and husband keith -rrb- , 58 , retired market gardener , llanbrynmair , powys : " we were on richard evans ' programme on radio wales and had the opportunity to interview all the party leaders .
this has helped us for the first time to understand the differences between the parties . "
greg burke , 18 , student , barry , vale of glamorgan : " the parties are all talk and no policy .
they will say , ' this party is doing this and this party is going that - vote for us ' rather than offering hard policies of their own .
there has been a lack of policy . "
andy rinvolucri , 24 , personal carer , lampeter , ceredigion : " there have been a lot of petitions on local issues such as plans to move the post office and there are a lot of strong feelings about this .
" i 've always been a floating voter and as i 've come to see how the assembly could be run , i 've changed my mind about politics and seen the importance of taking local opinion into account in developing policies . "
allyson westbrook-howell , 45 , full-time mother and student , pentwyn , cardiff : " on the streets i have n't seen anybody .
we 've had leaflets from some of the parties .
there does n't seem to be much awareness amongst the public .
bedwyr griffiths , 32 , carer , denbigh : " i think there 's less apathy than usual locally - there are more posters and placards in fields than have been for years - more people are taking an interest this time i think . "
allyson westbrook-howell has not seen anybody out campaigning lisa berry , 18 , student , newport : " i do n't think it has been very prominent in this area .
we 've had lots of leaflets through the door but no-one has knocked the door here .
" the election seems to be all about the nhs , which is important , but only one of the parties seems to be saying anything much about what it would do for students . "
jason lewis , 37 , businessman / sales manager , tredegar , blaenau gwent : " i think the politicians have given up on the silent majority .
it has not been targeted at the working man .
they 've not been going after people who do n't vote .
i struggle to see a clear message from any of them . "
mary elen rowlands , 22 , administration assistant , amlwch , anglesey : " i 've enjoyed being part of wales 60 .
i joined the group to try and change things and it 's been a chance to voice my opinion .
" but i 'm angry that the politicians do n't listen .
i raised a question about anglesey on the debate programme from llandudno and no-one on the panel answered me - they just do n't want to know about anglesey . "
ieuan davies , 52 , chauffeur and insurance investigator , pontprennau , cardiff : " the only thing i 've really noticed is how negative the campaigning has been .
the parties have all been saying what 's wrong with each other - taking cheap shots at each other .
" the policies seem to be pretty similar and i think they should have concentrated more on their differences - something they have n't done very successfully . "

minister urmas paet said russia had launched real , psychological and - via the internet - virtual attacks since estonia decided to relocate the statue .
mr paet called for a " vigorous " eu reaction to moscow .
estonians of russian origin rioted last week in protest at the decision to move the statue of a red army soldier .
one person died and 153 were injured in the unrest .
on monday , russian mps paid their respects at the controversial monument which was re-erected on monday at a military cemetery in tallinn , away from the city centre .
estonians say the soldier symbolised soviet occupation .
russians describe it as a tribute to those who fought the nazis .
' cyber terrorists ' in a statement issued on tuesday evening , mr paet protested against what he said were " co-ordinated activities undertaken against estonia by russia " in response to the row .
estonia-russia ties 1918 : estonia gained independence from russia 1940 : forcibly incorporated into soviet union 1941-1944 : occupied by nazi germany 1944 : soviets return as nazis retreat 1991 : gains independence as soviet union collapses 1994 : last russian forces leave estonia now : ethnic russians make up quarter of estonia 's 1.3m people history at the heart of row he said " cyber terrorists " ' attacks against internet pages of estonian government agencies and the office of the president had originated from russian government computers .
russian youth organisation " nashi " has laid a siege to the estonian embassy in moscow , he said , accusing the kremlin of paying the demonstrators .
" we find it necessary that the reaction on behalf of the european union to the behaviour of russia should be as vigorous as possible , " he said .
" this could mean suspending different talks between the european union and russia or not commencing them at all .
the postponement of the european union - russia summit should be also given full consideration . "
reports said russian police scuffled with pro-kremlin youth activists outside the estonian embassy on wednesday , arresting one person as protestors attempted to prevent diplomats entering or leaving the building .
' barbaric ' tensions have escalated ahead of the world war ii victory day anniversary on 9 may .
the anniversary is traditionally a day of patriotism and pride for many russians .
moscow mayor yuri luzhkov called for " a boycott of all things connected with estonia , " at a may day rally on tuesday .
he said estonia had dismantled the soviet memorial " in the most barbaric way " .
more than a quarter of estonia 's 1.3m people are ethnically russian , and speak russian .
however , half of them do not have estonian citizenship .
during the years of soviet occupation after the war tens of thousands of estonians were killed .
they say their country was effectively colonised , with many russians being brought in as workers and military personnel .

called the centre for earth observation instrumentation , it will pull together university and industry expertise .
british instruments fly on many of today 's major satellites , gathering data on changes in the atmosphere , in the oceans and on the land .
it is hoped the centre will put the uk in a strong position to win contracts for work on future spacecraft .
the new initiative comes from the natural environment research council -lrb- nerc -rrb- and the department for trade and industry -lrb- dti -rrb- .
the centre will have offices at the astrium aerospace company in stevenage and at the university of leicester - but its main role will be to coordinate research efforts across the country .
" the priorities in the first instance will concentrate on new remote sensing technologies relating to atmospheric chemistry and how that relates to climate , " explained dr arwyn davies , director of earth observation for both nerc and the british national space centre .
" we think we have a number of strengths in the uk to play to on that front , " he told bbc news .
british instrumentation has been incorporated into a number of recent high-profile earth observation missions , including the european space agency 's -lrb- esa -rrb- envisat platform and the us space agency 's -lrb- nasa -rrb- aura satellite .
50 years an example of the excellence the centre hopes to encourage is the microwave humidity sounder which was lofted last year on metop , europe 's most advanced weather and climate spacecraft .
the mhs maps water vapour in the atmosphere at unprecedented resolution .
cryosat : mission guide the uk is playing a significant role in esa 's earth explorer programme .
this is developing smart , relatively low-cost missions to obtain fast answers to important environmental questions .
the uk is currently leading one mission - the cryosat mission to track changes in the polar ice caps - and has a significant interest in a second venture called earthcare , which will study clouds and atmospheric particles -lrb- aerosols -rrb- .
the data these and other spacecraft obtain will deepen scientists ' understanding of the earth system and help refine the computer models they use to forecast the future .
commenting on the new centre , science and innovation minister malcolm wicks said : " we 've come a long way from the first basic satellite of 50 years ago to the sophisticated instruments we use today .
" earth observation technology is becoming increasingly important for monitoring climate change .
this new centre will boost the uk 's capability in international programmes and ensure that it remains at the forefront of earth observation technology well into the future . "
the centre is a partnership between eads astrium , the university of leicester , the uk 's science and technologies facilities council , the defence firm qinetiq , and the rutherford appleton laboratory in didcot .

called the centre for earth observation instrumentation , it will pull together university and industry expertise .
british instruments fly on many of today 's major satellites , gathering data on changes in the atmosphere , in the oceans and on the land .
it is hoped the centre will put the uk in a strong position to win contracts for work on future spacecraft .
the new initiative comes from the natural environment research council -lrb- nerc -rrb- and the department for trade and industry -lrb- dti -rrb- .
the centre will have offices at the astrium aerospace company in stevenage and at the university of leicester - but its main role will be to coordinate research efforts across the country .
" the priorities in the first instance will concentrate on new remote sensing technologies relating to atmospheric chemistry and how that relates to climate , " explained dr arwyn davies , director of earth observation for both nerc and the british national space centre .
" we think we have a number of strengths in the uk to play to on that front , " he told bbc news .
british instrumentation has been incorporated into a number of recent high-profile earth observation missions , including the european space agency 's -lrb- esa -rrb- envisat platform and the us space agency 's -lrb- nasa -rrb- aura satellite .
50 years an example of the excellence the centre hopes to encourage is the microwave humidity sounder which was lofted last year on metop , europe 's most advanced weather and climate spacecraft .
the mhs maps water vapour in the atmosphere at unprecedented resolution .
cryosat : mission guide the uk is playing a significant role in esa 's earth explorer programme .
this is developing smart , relatively low-cost missions to obtain fast answers to important environmental questions .
the uk is currently leading one mission - the cryosat mission to track changes in the polar ice caps - and has a significant interest in a second venture called earthcare , which will study clouds and atmospheric particles -lrb- aerosols -rrb- .
the data these and other spacecraft obtain will deepen scientists ' understanding of the earth system and help refine the computer models they use to forecast the future .
commenting on the new centre , science and innovation minister malcolm wicks said : " we 've come a long way from the first basic satellite of 50 years ago to the sophisticated instruments we use today .
" earth observation technology is becoming increasingly important for monitoring climate change .
this new centre will boost the uk 's capability in international programmes and ensure that it remains at the forefront of earth observation technology well into the future . "
the centre is a partnership between eads astrium , the university of leicester , the uk 's science and technologies facilities council , the defence firm qinetiq , and the rutherford appleton laboratory in didcot .

bbc correspondent alastair leithead said a lack of heavily armed land rovers was a particular problem .
lieutenant colonel charlie mayo , spokesman in helmand province , said only 126 of the 170 needed were in working order .
the ministry of defence insisted troops were properly equipped to do their job .

return from taleban fight mr leithead , who is embedded with british troops , said an average of one of these vehicles a week was being lost and replacements sent from the uk often arrived late .
lt col mayo said the wmiks were taking " a hell of a hammering " in the hot and dusty conditions and said the situation was " tight , but not critical yet " .
a fifth of the fleet is damaged or has been destroyed by enemy fire , he added , but more would be arriving soon .
another vehicle , a pinzgauer , has been fitted with extra armour to try to cover the shortfall , but there is a limit to the number of men and the amount of equipment they can carry , our correspondent said .
and the strain was increased because extra troops had recently been deployed without extra vehicles , he added .
a spokesman for the mod denied there was a shortage and said huge investments had been made in equipment for the army .

the intelligence and security committee probing 7/7 did not see all of the pictures taken in 2004 showing mohammad sidique khan with terrorist suspects .
shadow home secretary david davis said there was a fear " that someone was being economical with the evidence " .
data released after the fertiliser bomb plot trial has sparked the controversy .
security sources say mi5 said it did not reveal the images to the parliamentary committee because they were taken by police officers not mi5 operatives .
on monday , it emerged at the end of the year-long court case that mi5 had watched and followed two of the 7 july bombers a year before the attacks as part of their surveillance of the fertiliser bomb plotters .
six photographs by june 2004 mi5 had part of khan 's name on file twice , a family address and various pictures of him .
bugged by mi5 " it all depends on the situation ... everybody wants to go to the front , everybody wants to fight " omar khyam speaking to mohammad sidique khan mi5 watch 2,000 suspects revealed : bomber transcript send us your comments the isc committee investigating 7/7 only ever saw one mi5 photograph of khan .
it did not see any of the other photographs obtained by the bbc .
a senior whitehall source has told the bbc that the committee were aware other pictures existed and could have seen them if they had been requested .
mr davis said : " what is clear is that there is a massive difference between what the public know and the impression given by the isc report last year .
" we must have an inquiry which allows us to know what the facts are and not feel , as we might do today , that we have been misled . "
jacqui putnam , who survived the edgware road bomb , also called for an inquiry , saying it was " inevitable " the truth would come out .
" i do not understand why they lie so inadequately to cover up these things .
it is disrespectful , it seems to me , to the people who died and the families who are struggling to live with it , " she said .
ministers are opposed to an inquiry but a parliamentary committee will consider why the bombers were not picked up .
those affected by the 2005 attacks have delivered a letter to the home office .
the document , requesting an " impartial public inquiry " , was handed to an official from the department .
it says one of the purposes would be " to examine issues aimed at saving lives , minimising suffering and improving the response of government agencies to the continuing threat of terrorist attacks " .
the letter was signed by more than 18 people , including 7 july survivors ms putnam and paul mitchell , as well as relatives of those affected - such as ros morley , whose husband , colin , was killed .
bugged conversation survivor rachel north said : " this is not about blame but about future public safety - understanding what happened , how it happened and to stop it happening again . "
evidence since trial khan followed feb 2004 photographed with extremists recorded talking with plot ringleader home address seen car ownership and surname known june 04 panorama 's investigation in response , the home office released a statement saying the home secretary would " give very careful consideration " to the letter .
on monday , five men were given life sentences for a foiled plot to build a huge fertiliser bomb for a uk attack .
it emerged during the trial that mi5 had tailed london suicide bombers mohammad sidique khan and shehzad tanweer while investigating that case , but took no action .
the bbc has now published a full transcript of an mi5 bugged conversation in which the bomber discusses leaving the uk to join jihadi extremists in the pakistan-afghanistan border areas .
the media were briefed that khan and fellow bombers were " clean skins " - men with no previous record of terrorist associations .
but evidence following the end of the trial reveals mi5 photographed khan as he met other extremists , followed him home - and by the summer of 2004 they knew his surname and that he owned a car .
prime minister tony blair has asked the parliamentary intelligence and security committee -lrb- isc -rrb- to consider why the 7 july bombers were not picked up .
the committee , which comprises mps and lords , is expected to examine claims that west yorkshire police special branch was not told about the mi5 surveillance operation .
isc chairman paul murphy mp has previously indicated that police were informed .

by hannah goff bbc news education reporter mathematicians have a sense of humour too maths teaching is in need of a makeover .
experts agree .
but if the response to a royal society of chemistry maths challenge is anything to go by - 1,800 entries , massive web traffic , internet blogs discussing it - maths is n't as much of a turn-off as some people assume .
the rsc 's brian emsley said : " we would have put extra staff on had we realised .
" it became a bit like the harry potter owls delivering letters .
entries and e-mails were coming in through every crack and crevice of the building . "
what 's needed is for someone to write an eats , shoots and leaves for maths david brockley so if a chinese maths challenge can elicit that sort of response , why are so many people so down on the subject ?
the winner of the rsc challenge , software engineer david brockley , said : " maths does suffer from an image problem .
" it 's seen as a nerdy subject - but then i am a stereotypical geek .
" what 's needed is for someone to write an eats , shoots and leaves for maths . "
attempts have been made to do this - for example , the jeremy wyndham and rob eastaway books why do buses come in threes ? and how long is a piece of string ?
but they do not seem to have captured the popular imagination in the same way as lynne truss 's book about punctuation .
mr brockley added : " maths is all around , you can use it to calculate all sorts of interesting things but a lot of people do n't attempt to because they think they will fail . "
' practice makes perfect ' edinburgh university chemistry lecturer dr perdita barran says not only is it seen as " uncool " to do maths but pupils are also made to think it is too hard .
the senior research fellow , who used to teach remedial maths to science undergraduates at sussex university , argues that teachers themselves are setting pupils up to fail very early on .
" in primary school , children feel they can do almost anything up until about the age of 12 .
" but when they reach the end of key stage 2 a sense of failure comes along .
" they are being told things like , ' we are going to do long division - it 's going to be difficult - but if you practise you should be able to do it ' .
" so they are already being warned off maths as a difficult subject . "
she argues that maths is actually no harder than any other subject - it is just perceived to be so .
and there the conundrum begins .
head teacher of king john school in benfleet , essex , and maths expert , margaret wilson , responded by setting her pupils up to succeed and to do so earlier .
money matters " we decided we were going to tackle the image of maths by entering all our pupils early for gcse .
" this has made a huge change in perceptions , because instead of it just being the top set , we did it for everyone so they started to think ; ' we must be good at this ' .
" also it meant we could really focus on it . "
now the school has 74 % of pupils achieving grade a * to c and many more go on to do maths a-level .
but miss wilson , who is a member of the maths panel at the specialist schools and academies trust , also reveals that the school goes back over the basics which pupils are expected to have learnt for their key stage 2 tests .
" schools do a lot of teaching to the test which means some of the foundations you need to move on like multiplication , long division and the times tables are n't there , " she says .
chairwoman of the association of teachers of mathematics sue johnstone-wilder said maths became more difficult when a person was anxious or upset .
she said : " possibly because the anxiety affects the functioning of the frontal lobe where memory is used for calculating .
" this has serious implications for policy - expecting that children will attain a certain level at a certain age , and stressing those who have not , is damaging their mathematical health and potential attainment . "
confidence but there is also a real shortage of maths graduates wanting to become teachers , partly because they can earn much more as accountants probably .
institute of mathematics education adviser professor nigel steele says teachers can have a problem with confidence in the subject .
" when you have got changes in the curriculum , teachers who are less than 100 % sure of what they are doing , and i sympathise , they get rather concerned and they can go into their shells and maths comes out as a boring subject in school . "
for our rsc puzzle winner , software engineer david brockley , the key to the conundrum is making maths relevant .
this , along with subject support , is something professor steele sees as vital .
" perhaps we could get people who use maths in their daily lives to go into schools and let pupils know how important it is and how they can make a lot of money doing it . "
but until the panel of bbc two 's dragon 's den can be persuaded to take time out from making money to go back to the classroom , we 'll have to rely on teachers to bring the subject alive .

by hannah goff bbc news education reporter mathematicians have a sense of humour too maths teaching is in need of a makeover .
experts agree .
but if the response to a royal society of chemistry maths challenge is anything to go by - 1,800 entries , massive web traffic , internet blogs discussing it - maths is n't as much of a turn-off as some people assume .
the rsc 's brian emsley said : " we would have put extra staff on had we realised .
" it became a bit like the harry potter owls delivering letters .
entries and e-mails were coming in through every crack and crevice of the building . "
what 's needed is for someone to write an eats , shoots and leaves for maths david brockley so if a chinese maths challenge can elicit that sort of response , why are so many people so down on the subject ?
the winner of the rsc challenge , software engineer david brockley , said : " maths does suffer from an image problem .
" it 's seen as a nerdy subject - but then i am a stereotypical geek .
" what 's needed is for someone to write an eats , shoots and leaves for maths . "
attempts have been made to do this - for example , the jeremy wyndham and rob eastaway books why do buses come in threes ? and how long is a piece of string ?
but they do not seem to have captured the popular imagination in the same way as lynne truss 's book about punctuation .
mr brockley added : " maths is all around , you can use it to calculate all sorts of interesting things but a lot of people do n't attempt to because they think they will fail . "
' practice makes perfect ' edinburgh university chemistry lecturer dr perdita barran says not only is it seen as " uncool " to do maths but pupils are also made to think it is too hard .
the senior research fellow , who used to teach remedial maths to science undergraduates at sussex university , argues that teachers themselves are setting pupils up to fail very early on .
" in primary school , children feel they can do almost anything up until about the age of 12 .
" but when they reach the end of key stage 2 a sense of failure comes along .
" they are being told things like , ' we are going to do long division - it 's going to be difficult - but if you practise you should be able to do it ' .
" so they are already being warned off maths as a difficult subject . "
she argues that maths is actually no harder than any other subject - it is just perceived to be so .
and there the conundrum begins .
head teacher of king john school in benfleet , essex , and maths expert , margaret wilson , responded by setting her pupils up to succeed and to do so earlier .
money matters " we decided we were going to tackle the image of maths by entering all our pupils early for gcse .
" this has made a huge change in perceptions , because instead of it just being the top set , we did it for everyone so they started to think ; ' we must be good at this ' .
" also it meant we could really focus on it . "
now the school has 74 % of pupils achieving grade a * to c and many more go on to do maths a-level .
but miss wilson , who is a member of the maths panel at the specialist schools and academies trust , also reveals that the school goes back over the basics which pupils are expected to have learnt for their key stage 2 tests .
" schools do a lot of teaching to the test which means some of the foundations you need to move on like multiplication , long division and the times tables are n't there , " she says .
chairwoman of the association of teachers of mathematics sue johnstone-wilder said maths became more difficult when a person was anxious or upset .
she said : " possibly because the anxiety affects the functioning of the frontal lobe where memory is used for calculating .
" this has serious implications for policy - expecting that children will attain a certain level at a certain age , and stressing those who have not , is damaging their mathematical health and potential attainment . "
confidence but there is also a real shortage of maths graduates wanting to become teachers , partly because they can earn much more as accountants probably .
institute of mathematics education adviser professor nigel steele says teachers can have a problem with confidence in the subject .
" when you have got changes in the curriculum , teachers who are less than 100 % sure of what they are doing , and i sympathise , they get rather concerned and they can go into their shells and maths comes out as a boring subject in school . "

she argues that maths is actually no harder than any other subject - it is just perceived to be so .
and there the conundrum begins .
head teacher of king john school in benfleet , essex , and maths expert , margaret wilson , responded by setting her pupils up to succeed and to do so earlier .
money matters " we decided we were going to tackle the image of maths by entering all our pupils early for gcse .
" this has made a huge change in perceptions , because instead of it just being the top set , we did it for everyone so they started to think ; ' we must be good at this ' .
" also it meant we could really focus on it . "
now the school has 74 % of pupils achieving grade a * to c and many more go on to do maths a-level .
but miss wilson , who is a member of the maths panel at the specialist schools and academies trust , also reveals that the school goes back over the basics which pupils are expected to have learnt for their key stage 2 tests .
" schools do a lot of teaching to the test which means some of the foundations you need to move on like multiplication , long division and the times tables are n't there , " she says .
chairwoman of the association of teachers of mathematics sue johnstone-wilder said maths became more difficult when a person was anxious or upset .
she said : " possibly because the anxiety affects the functioning of the frontal lobe where memory is used for calculating .
" this has serious implications for policy - expecting that children will attain a certain level at a certain age , and stressing those who have not , is damaging their mathematical health and potential attainment . "
confidence but there is also a real shortage of maths graduates wanting to become teachers , partly because they can earn much more as accountants probably .
institute of mathematics education adviser professor nigel steele says teachers can have a problem with confidence in the subject .
" when you have got changes in the curriculum , teachers who are less than 100 % sure of what they are doing , and i sympathise , they get rather concerned and they can go into their shells and maths comes out as a boring subject in school . "
for our rsc puzzle winner , software engineer david brockley , the key to the conundrum is making maths relevant .
this , along with subject support , is something professor steele sees as vital .
" perhaps we could get people who use maths in their daily lives to go into schools and let pupils know how important it is and how they can make a lot of money doing it . "
but until the panel of bbc two 's dragon 's den can be persuaded to take time out from making money to go back to the classroom , we 'll have to rely on teachers to bring the subject alive .

by hannah goff bbc news education reporter maths teaching is in need of a makeover .
experts agree .
but if the response to a royal society of chemistry maths challenge is anything to go by - 1,800 entries , massive web traffic , internet blogs discussing it - maths is n't as much of a turn-off as some people assume .
the rsc 's brian emsley said : " we would have put extra staff on had we realised .
" it became a bit like the harry potter owls delivering letters .
entries and e-mails were coming in through every crack and crevice of the building . "
" what 's needed is for someone to write an eats , shoots and leaves for maths " david brockley so if a chinese maths challenge can elicit that sort of response , why are so many people so down on the subject ?
the winner of the rsc challenge , software engineer david brockley , said : " maths does suffer from an image problem .
" it 's seen as a nerdy subject - but then i am a stereotypical geek .
" what 's needed is for someone to write an eats , shoots and leaves for maths . "
attempts have been made to do this - for example , the jeremy wyndham and rob eastaway books why do buses come in threes ? and how long is a piece of string ?
but they do not seem to have captured the popular imagination in the same way as lynne truss 's book about punctuation .
mr brockley added : " maths is all around , you can use it to calculate all sorts of interesting things but a lot of people do n't attempt to because they think they will fail . "
' practice makes perfect ' edinburgh university chemistry lecturer dr perdita barran says not only is it seen as " uncool " to do maths but pupils are also made to think it is too hard .
the senior research fellow , who used to teach remedial maths to science undergraduates at sussex university , argues that teachers themselves are setting pupils up to fail very early on .
" in primary school , children feel they can do almost anything up until about the age of 12 .
" but when they reach the end of key stage 2 a sense of failure comes along .
" they are being told things like , ' we are going to do long division - it 's going to be difficult - but if you practise you should be able to do it ' .
" so they are already being warned off maths as a difficult subject . "
she argues that maths is actually no harder than any other subject - it is just perceived to be so .
and there the conundrum begins .
head teacher of king john school in benfleet , essex , and maths expert , margaret wilson , responded by setting her pupils up to succeed and to do so earlier .

the photograph shows the queen sitting in the white drawing room at buckingham palace dressed in a pale gold evening dress , fur stole and diamond tiara .
ms leibovitz , best known for her work for rolling stone and vanity fair magazines , has said she wanted to take " a very simple portrait " .
the picture was released ahead of the queen 's six-day tour of the us .
it is one of a series commissioned to coincide with the queen 's first state visit to america for 16 years which begins on thursday .

shortly after being asked to photograph the queen , ms leibovitz said she was likely to take inspiration from cecil beaton who photographed the queen mother at the palace .

by sending magnetic pulses through the skulls of sleeping volunteers , us researchers were able to stimulate the slow brain waves seen in deep sleep .
such a machine-generated " power nap " could one day be an insomnia treatment , the proceedings of the national academy of sciences study suggests .
however , it is unclear whether electronically assisted sleep confers the same benefits as natural sleep .
the deepest stage of sleep is characterised by brain patterns known as slow wave activity - electrical waves which wash across the brain , roughly once a second , 1,000 times a night .
slow wave activity is believed to be critical to the restoration of mood and the ability to learn , think and remember .
with a single pulse , we were able to induce a wave that looks identical to the waves the brain makes normally during sleep professor giulio tononi professor giulio tononi and colleagues used a technique called transcranial magnetic stimulation -lrb- tms -rrb- - a harmless magnetic signal which activates electrical impulses in the brain - to initiate slow waves in sleeping volunteers .
they then recorded brain electrical activity .
in response to each magnetic pulse , the participants ' brains immediately produced the slow waves typical of deep sleep .
the researchers managed to position the tms device to cause slow waves to travel throughout the brain .
' restorative powers ' professor tononi , from the university of wisconsin said slow waves may be important in sleep 's " restorative powers " .
he said a sleep-deprived person has larger and more numerous slow waves once asleep .
and as sleep proceeds , the slow waves weaken , which may signal that the need for sleep is partially satisfied .
" with a single pulse , we were able to induce a wave that looks identical to the waves the brain makes normally during sleep . "
he added that creating slow waves on demand could one day lead to treatments for insomnia , where slow waves may be reduced , or a magnetically stimulated " power nap , " which might confer the benefit of eight hours sleep in just a few hours .
but he said researchers must first discover if artificial slow waves have restorative benefits to the brain , and the team are planning further experiments .
dr chris idzikowski , director of the edinburgh sleep centre said the notion of trying to support deep sleep was sound .
" out of all the stages of sleep we think that 's the one that provides the basic biological function of recovery .
