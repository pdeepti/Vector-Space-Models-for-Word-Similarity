now , german chancellor angela merkel also boasts one , 60 miles north of berlin . a magnificent 1738-built baroque-style property called schloss meseberg -lrb- castle meseberg -rrb- is situated in the eastern state of brandenburg encircling berlin . on friday , german chancellor angela merkel will play host at the castle for the first time to french president jacques chirac , during one of their regular german-franco consultations . under a deal reached with the messerschmidt foundation - a privately-owned organization that bought the castle in the mid-nineties - the government will be allowed to use the property as its guesthouse for high-ranking officials over a 20-year period at a rent of just one euro a year . the government for its part has in the past year spent 13 million euros -lrb- $ 17 million -rrb- modernizing its kitchen and heating facilities and by ensuring its security and technical facilities are also state-of-the-art . mixed feelings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques chirac will be merkel 's first guest at meseberg while there is general satisfaction in brandenburg that a worthy role has been found for the magnificently-restored property , feelings in meseberg -lrb- population 135 -rrb- are mixed . the decision to renew the 1.7 kilometer-long -lrb- 1 mile -rrb- approach road to the castle has raised eyebrows in the village even though community officials say the rough-surfaced , pot-holed road , was in dire need of repair . the main cost will be borne by the german government and brandenburg state , but villagers with properties along the route are also being called on to make contributions , ranging from 2,000 to 15,000 euros . where were they before ? evelyn briesmeister , 65 , a village resident , is furious . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the castle has been meticulously restored to its past splendor " the state of the road did n't bother a soul in earlier times , " briesmeister said .
" now , because government officials will be driving cars along it to the schloss the whole village is made poor . " her husband , horst briesemeister , 70 , agrees .
both have signed a citizen 's petition in protest . frank stege , 45 , the district 's head official claims the decision to renew the approach road at a cost of 1.2 million euros was taken in december 2005 . " we aim to make the payments socially tolerable for the villagers , " he said . transfer of power in the old federal republic during the years of division , the government 's official guesthouse was to be found atop a hill overlooking the rhine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meseberg is probably the cheapest castle in the world : the german government will be renting it for 1 euro per year nick-named the " rotunde " -lrb- rotunda -rrb- with its 23 conference rooms , it played host to a whole list of world leaders in the post-war years , ranging from leonid breschnev to bill clinton , the shah of persia to queen elizabeth of england . but after german reunification and the controversial political " power transfer " from bonn to berlin in 1999 , it was clear a new government guesthouse would have to be found closer to the old-new capital . schloss meseberg received little consideration at the time .
situated in the former gdr -lrb- east germany -rrb- , it was just one of a series of decaying country retreats which had fallen on hard times during the communist era . then , the munich-based messerschmidt foundation , a private organization that renovates dilapidated monuments across germany , acquired the castle in the mid-1990s , and spent 25 million euros over the next 10 years restoring it . footing the bill the brandenburg state government , it was thought , would find a role for the castle and was miffed when matthias platzeck , the state 's premier , ultimately rejected the idea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last summer , merkel welcomed george w. bush in her constituency in stralsund but platzeck did toss the idea to then german chancellor gerhard schröder who was seeking a suitable venue for summer government conclaves and a place for putting up high-ranking foreign visitors . his dilemma was spotlighted in early 2005 when president bush arrived for a visit .
concern about his safety led to a planned berlin stop-over being moved to mainz , near frankfurt . late last month , german chancellory minister thomas de maiziere was handed a symbolic key to schloss meseberg . referring to the castle as a government venue for international conferences and foreign guests making overnight stays , de maiziere predicted that " history would be written in the meseberg meetings of the future .

' no danger to democracy ' germany 's fourth estate has other , worse weaknesses , djv 's zörner notes .
a recent report by reporters without borders ranked the country a low 23nd in terms of press freedoms , based mostly on controversial government searches of newspaper offices . but " despite all the problems and dangers , " zörner said , overall , german journalism is " qualitatively very good . " " you ca n't say that -lrb- the practice of allowing interview revisions -rrb- poses a danger to democracy , " he said .
and after all , he pointed out , interviews are not the only tool reporters have . " there are reports , opinion pieces - there are many other forms of journalism available .

dw-world.de caught up with la-based screenwriter matt witten to find out how projects like the " writer 's room " can help . the recent berlin film festival proved that german cinema is in fine fettle . but television is looking a lot less robust .
a record number of new shows are tanking spectacularly - take private station pro 7 's latest disaster , the much-hyped " crazy about clara . "
given that viewers loved " ally mcbeal " and " sex and the city , " they should have devoured a home-grown series about a 20-something city girl juggling work and relationships .
but no one was crazy about clara at all , and this enormously expensive series was shunted off into a late-night slot after just two episodes . but while viewers ca n't switch off german shows fast enough , they 're more addicted than ever to us imports , with most prime-time slots filled with the likes of " desperate housewives , " " medical investigation " and " er . "
the networks are realizing it 's time for a re-think - and are sending for the marines . organized by media consultancy mediaxchange , the third " writer 's room " recently took place in germany .
its goal is to bring together experienced us writers to work with their local counterparts in developing ideas for drama series to be sold to local channels and the international market .
guest of honor at january 's session was writer and producer matt witten - whose credits include " house m.d. , " " csi : miami " and " law & order . " dw-world.de asked him how it went . matt witten : it went well !
the german writers were talented and interesting and it was very productive .
we came up with some terrific ideas for shows and also i think it gave the german writers a good idea of how us tv shows run . did you see any german tv shows ? i saw " alarm für cobra 11 " and " lasko " -lrb- two series made by german production company " action concept , " which co-organized the event -rrb- .
one thing i noticed was that the action sequences were fabulous , probably better than anything i 've ever seen on american television .
you might see that kind of action in the movies but never on television .
the first episode i saw of " cobra 11 " had a 400 car pile-up !
" action concept " manages to do these incredible things on relatively small budgets , significantly less than those of american shows . so is us tv as good as it is often simply because of economies of scale ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " csi : miami " shows the way because we have more money to put into it ?
yes .
but we 've also been making tv in the us since 1950 .
we have a longer history - we 've been developing our tv for 50 years , so there might be some catch-up to do for german television .
but are americans inherently better writers than germans ?
no , of course not ! when you talked to the german participants in the writer 's room , did you get the impression that they need help to create good tv ? american shows tend to be pretty fast-paced and vigorously structured , and the way we structure the action and the conflict for our main characters has been thought through in ways that are fresh for german writers , they have n't necessarily heard it described in these terms .
so it gives them a new way of looking at the writing they 're doing .
they were also intrigued by the fact that in america we have staff writers who meet every day , and we have a head writer responsible for the consistency of the show - " the show-runner . "
these concepts are new in germany , where there is no cohesion of writing staff .
instead , episodes are written by freelancers who turn in maybe just two a year .
another thing in american tv is that directors do n't have the power to change the script without talking to the writer .
it makes sense that the writers are in charge because after all , they will be involved with all thirteen episodes in the series whereas a director is only involved with three or four . does that mean that german shows never quite rival american ones because of structures - because germany doesn ’ t have the same efficient systems in place that the us has ?
should germany focus more on this aspect of tv production ? i would agree with that .
when you have a good infrastructure the writers will also get better because of it - by being with the production for all 13 or 24 episodes , being around the other writers on set , working with the actors and the directors , getting involved with the editing .
better writing is an inevitable by-product .
" action concept " ceo hermann joha for one is very keen to run all his shows more according to this model .
he specifically wants to establish this kind of infrastructure and to introduce this way of working in germany . what germany has right now is a lot of shows billed as the german " sex and the city , " the german " law & order " etc .
but somehow they don ’ t really work .
what ’ s missing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans loved " sex and the city " for myself as a writer i feel that if you 're passionate about your show it has a good chance of becoming a success .
but you also need the infrastructure to carry that passion forward and make it workable for a 13 or 24 episode season , and i guess there 's a possibility that some of these aspects are lacking in germany . tv is essentially escapist , and germany still has a fascination with the us .
might german tv writers be fighting a losing battle , because their audiences are actually quite happy not to have home-grown shows ? my guess is that germans would respond really well to a terrific home-grown show .
it 's only logical .
i used to live in saratoga springs in upstate new york and i would always be intrigued by any novel set there .
i 'm jewish , so i always enjoy jewish novels .
if a story is somehow close to me i 'll be interested … .
i have two children and i 'm always interested in a story about a dad with kids .
so i can only imagine that if i were german i would want to watch shows in german , i would think : " hey , we germans can put out good shows too . "
i 'd feel proud . a lot of good series in the us are made by cable network hbo , so they don ’ t need mass appeal .
in germany , tv series need to work across the board .
is it easier for writers to maintain high standards when they know they only need to reach a certain audience ? yes , but it depends on your idea .
there are good network shows that do have mass appeal , and that does n't have to be a bad thing .
a lot of the shows i love are on hbo and it 's great to have these outlets .
shows like " the sopranos " and " nip / tuck " really push the envelope and that probably has the effect of making the broadcast networks better generally because it raises the bar .
germany could probably benefit from an equivalent .
it would be great if german tv writers did n't feel they had to get 50 million viewers . is there a risk that projects like the " writer ’ s room " might result in very homogenous shows ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the unlucky clara the structures and strategies we 're introducing to german writers and executives have nothing to do with content .
they will just lead to better shows .
if the german writers have exciting ideas that are uniquely german , then projects like the " writer 's room " will just help them realize these ideas more fully .

dw-world.de caught up with la-based screenwriter matt witten to find out how projects like the " writer 's room " can help . the recent berlin film festival proved that german cinema is in fine fettle . but television is looking a lot less robust .
a record number of new shows are tanking spectacularly - take private station pro 7 's latest disaster , the much-hyped " crazy about clara . "
given that viewers loved " ally mcbeal " and " sex and the city , " they should have devoured a home-grown series about a 20-something city girl juggling work and relationships .
but no one was crazy about clara at all , and this enormously expensive series was shunted off into a late-night slot after just two episodes . but while viewers ca n't switch off german shows fast enough , they 're more addicted than ever to us imports , with most prime-time slots filled with the likes of " desperate housewives , " " medical investigation " and " er . "
the networks are realizing it 's time for a re-think - and are sending for the marines . organized by media consultancy mediaxchange , the third " writer 's room " recently took place in germany .
its goal is to bring together experienced us writers to work with their local counterparts in developing ideas for drama series to be sold to local channels and the international market .
guest of honor at january 's session was writer and producer matt witten - whose credits include " house m.d. , " " csi : miami " and " law & order . " dw-world.de asked him how it went . matt witten : it went well !
the german writers were talented and interesting and it was very productive .
we came up with some terrific ideas for shows and also i think it gave the german writers a good idea of how us tv shows run . did you see any german tv shows ? i saw " alarm für cobra 11 " and " lasko " -lrb- two series made by german production company " action concept , " which co-organized the event -rrb- .
one thing i noticed was that the action sequences were fabulous , probably better than anything i 've ever seen on american television .
you might see that kind of action in the movies but never on television .
the first episode i saw of " cobra 11 " had a 400 car pile-up !
" action concept " manages to do these incredible things on relatively small budgets , significantly less than those of american shows . so is us tv as good as it is often simply because of economies of scale ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " csi : miami " shows the way because we have more money to put into it ?
yes .
but we 've also been making tv in the us since 1950 .
we have a longer history - we 've been developing our tv for 50 years , so there might be some catch-up to do for german television .
but are americans inherently better writers than germans ?
no , of course not ! when you talked to the german participants in the writer 's room , did you get the impression that they need help to create good tv ? american shows tend to be pretty fast-paced and vigorously structured , and the way we structure the action and the conflict for our main characters has been thought through in ways that are fresh for german writers , they have n't necessarily heard it described in these terms .
so it gives them a new way of looking at the writing they 're doing .
they were also intrigued by the fact that in america we have staff writers who meet every day , and we have a head writer responsible for the consistency of the show - " the show-runner . "
these concepts are new in germany , where there is no cohesion of writing staff .
instead , episodes are written by freelancers who turn in maybe just two a year .
another thing in american tv is that directors do n't have the power to change the script without talking to the writer .
it makes sense that the writers are in charge because after all , they will be involved with all thirteen episodes in the series whereas a director is only involved with three or four . does that mean that german shows never quite rival american ones because of structures - because germany doesn ’ t have the same efficient systems in place that the us has ?
should germany focus more on this aspect of tv production ? i would agree with that .
when you have a good infrastructure the writers will also get better because of it - by being with the production for all 13 or 24 episodes , being around the other writers on set , working with the actors and the directors , getting involved with the editing .
better writing is an inevitable by-product .
" action concept " ceo hermann joha for one is very keen to run all his shows more according to this model .
he specifically wants to establish this kind of infrastructure and to introduce this way of working in germany . what germany has right now is a lot of shows billed as the german " sex and the city , " the german " law & order " etc .
but somehow they don ’ t really work .
what ’ s missing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans loved " sex and the city " for myself as a writer i feel that if you 're passionate about your show it has a good chance of becoming a success .
but you also need the infrastructure to carry that passion forward and make it workable for a 13 or 24 episode season , and i guess there 's a possibility that some of these aspects are lacking in germany . tv is essentially escapist , and germany still has a fascination with the us .
might german tv writers be fighting a losing battle , because their audiences are actually quite happy not to have home-grown shows ? my guess is that germans would respond really well to a terrific home-grown show .
it 's only logical .
i used to live in saratoga springs in upstate new york and i would always be intrigued by any novel set there .
i 'm jewish , so i always enjoy jewish novels .
if a story is somehow close to me i 'll be interested … .
i have two children and i 'm always interested in a story about a dad with kids .
so i can only imagine that if i were german i would want to watch shows in german , i would think : " hey , we germans can put out good shows too . "
i 'd feel proud . a lot of good series in the us are made by cable network hbo , so they don ’ t need mass appeal .
in germany , tv series need to work across the board .
is it easier for writers to maintain high standards when they know they only need to reach a certain audience ? yes , but it depends on your idea .

so i can only imagine that if i were german i would want to watch shows in german , i would think : " hey , we germans can put out good shows too . "
i 'd feel proud . a lot of good series in the us are made by cable network hbo , so they don ’ t need mass appeal .
in germany , tv series need to work across the board .
is it easier for writers to maintain high standards when they know they only need to reach a certain audience ? yes , but it depends on your idea .
there are good network shows that do have mass appeal , and that does n't have to be a bad thing .
a lot of the shows i love are on hbo and it 's great to have these outlets .
shows like " the sopranos " and " nip / tuck " really push the envelope and that probably has the effect of making the broadcast networks better generally because it raises the bar .
germany could probably benefit from an equivalent .
it would be great if german tv writers did n't feel they had to get 50 million viewers . is there a risk that projects like the " writer ’ s room " might result in very homogenous shows ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the unlucky clara the structures and strategies we 're introducing to german writers and executives have nothing to do with content .
they will just lead to better shows .
if the german writers have exciting ideas that are uniquely german , then projects like the " writer 's room " will just help them realize these ideas more fully .

' shocked and stunned ' for the february issue of youth and lifestyle glossy u _ mag , writer volker sievert sat down to chat with up-and-coming starlet hannah herzsprung .
but after providing the actress with the agreed-upon transcript of the interview , he said he was " shocked and stunned " when her final version came back . so much of the text had been excised that it looked more like it had been attacked by wartime censors than simply vetted for errors or slips of the tongue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the editors of u _ mag decided to show readers how modern media works " i really felt like i had been censored , " sievert wrote in an e-mail .
" i could n't understand this massive interference in the least . " as a result of herzsprung 's changes , sievert wrote , the interview was " almost grotesquely disfigured . "
the end result is " something that resembles a self-promotional text more than a lively , vital interview , " he added . cozy relationship u _ mag 's response ?
print the interview in full - heavily blacked-out sections included . " we felt used , " sievert said .
" we decided to print the interview with the crossed out sections , to give our readers a look into the modern media landscape . " the event caused a stir in the german media and awoke a sleeping discussion on what some say is an overly-cozy relationship between the german press and public figures . " journalists are not legally required to have interview partners authorize their statements . … but unfortunately in germany , that has almost become common practice , " said hendrik zörner , spokesman for the german journalists ' association -lrb- djv -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der spiegel is known for letting subjects alter interviews , one commentator said big-name papers tend to " follow clearer journalistic practices , " while the smaller , local outlets that make up the majority of papers in the country , " might have to deal with certain interview partners more frequently , " and so are more likely to allow sources to sign off on interviews , zörner said . " this leads to the practice that looks a little like mutual back-scratching , " he added . good for everyone ? but ingrid kolb , director of the henri nannen school for journalism in hamburg , said some of the country 's biggest media outlets - for instance , renowned news magazines der spiegel and stern - are noted for the practice . " the long interviews that der spiegel publishes with famous public figures , their so-called talks , are known for this , " kolb said .
" they can go back and forth a dozen times , with each side bringing their argument a bit more to the point , refining it , improving it .
in a best-case scenario , it serves the interests of both sides . " if anything , the controversy certainly makes plain the mutual give-and-take relationship between public figures and the media : the one side in need of a platform to promote themselves and their ideas , the other constantly looking for interesting material to fill an ever expanding news hole . still , in the us , britain or australia , the idea of a journalist giving an interview subject a whack at editing his or her own comments after the fact would be grounds for derision , if not dismissal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the us , anything said " on the record " goes in the paper " i 'm aware that there is a big difference on this subject between the anglo-saxon world and the german world , " kolb said .
" but in germany it has become a custom to get a longer interview or quotes authorized . … in general the interview partner tells the journalist that he expects it . " ' scorched earth ' action according to kolb , printing an interview with the blacked out parts shown , like u _ mag did , is " essentially a scorched-earth kind of act .
this person will never have something to do with the publication again . " according to the journalists ' association 's zörner , the practice represents " a real weakness in german journalism ; journalists are much too ready to allow interview authorization . " " interviews are meant to serve an informative and explanatory function .
but if interviews are changed after the fact , they are no longer interviews .
they are pr texts , " he said . prior occurrence the hannah herzsprung case is n't the first time the issue of journalistic integrity has made headlines here .
the last time was in 2003 , when the press went on the attack against the government 's supposed " control mania . " back then , a group of the country 's heavyweight newspapers , including the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , die welt , süddeutsche zeitung and the financial times deutschland , all printed commentaries and articles deploring the practice of interview approval . most memorable was the move by leftist newspaper tageszeitung .
in an apparent bid to point up the notion that newsmakers need the press just as much as the press needs them , the paper printed a censored interview with the then secretary general of the social democrats - with all his responses blacked out in protest . ' no danger to democracy ' germany 's fourth estate has other , worse weaknesses , djv 's zörner notes .
a recent report by reporters without borders ranked the country a low 23nd in terms of press freedoms , based mostly on controversial government searches of newspaper offices . but " despite all the problems and dangers , " zörner said , overall , german journalism is " qualitatively very good . " " you ca n't say that -lrb- the practice of allowing interview revisions -rrb- poses a danger to democracy , " he said .
and after all , he pointed out , interviews are not the only tool reporters have . " there are reports , opinion pieces - there are many other forms of journalism available .

oslo considers un talks on the issue last year a failure and hopes to launch efforts for an international ban backed by germany . representatives from over 40 countries and international organizations are gathering in oslo on thursday and friday to discuss ways to outlaw cluster bombs .
norway and other nations in favor of a ban are being hampered by nations that oppose one . the scandinavian country hopes the two-day meeting , which will be attended by senior ministry officials from around the world , will be the start of a process that will ultimately lead to the adoption of an international ban - even without the support of some key countries , such as opponents britain and the united states . " it is better that the like-minded -lrb- pro-ban -rrb- nations work in the same direction , " said raymond johansen , norway 's state secretary of foreign affairs .
he said that an international accord would put pressure on anti-ban nations to eventually comply . the pro-ban countries expected to be represented include norway , sweden , germany , mozambique and angola .
on the other side , britain , canada , france , china , india and russia belong to those opposed .
the united states , which is also opposed , will not be in attendance . several un organizations will also attend , as well as the cluster munition coalition -lrb- cmc -rrb- , the umbrella organization grouping non-governmental organizations campaigning for a ban . " it 's a double whammy . " a cluster bomb consists of a container holding up to hundreds of smaller so-called bomblets .
it opens in mid-air and disperses these grenades over a large area .
cluster munitions are stockpiled by most countries ' armies and have often been used in the past 40 years , most recently during the war in lebanon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demining unexploded cluster bombs in lebanon is dangerous work opponents of cluster munitions consider these weapons an unacceptable danger to civilians . " it 's a double whammy , " said cmc 's co-chairman steve goose .
" at the time of the attack , the bomblets spread over a large area and they can not be guided .
a large number of them do not explode upon impact , and so they can kill years later . "
he said that cluster bombs disproportionately target civilians . " cluster munitions caused more civilian casualties during the -lrb- last -rrb- iraq war and in kosovo than any other type of weapon , " goose said . proponents of a ban argue that a prohibition is achievable .
they point to the 1997 mine ban treaty that banned the production , stockpiling and use of anti-personnel landmines - also the result of a norwegian initiative . " the landmine treaty created a powerful standard , " goose said .
" we think the same can happen with cluster munitions . " can a ban influence the right countries ? some experts remain cautious about a ban , though . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unexploded cluster munitions threaten civilians even after a conflict is over " the worry is that , with cluster munitions , it will be a treaty binding those who are already in agreement , but wo n't touch those countries that are affected by them , or manufacture them , " said nicholas sims , an expert on arms limitation at the london school of economics and political science . that fear is compounded by the fact that the united states , russia , china , britain and france - the five permanent members of the un security council - are against an international ban on cluster munitions . another source of concern touches the scope of the ban .
non-governmental organizations are calling for a comprehensive ban on the production , stockpiling and use of all types of cluster munitions .
however , even a pro-ban nation like norway has suggested that a ban could exclude certain types of cluster munitions , such as those that self-destruct on impact . the norwegian government decided to host the conference , as it considered the latest un talks on the issue , held in geneva in november , a failure . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court considers national accountability in foreign missions a kosovo man whose son was killed by a nato cluster bomb took france to europe 's top human rights court wednesday over the boy 's death .

she 's now under police protection after members received death threats . earlier this month , iran-born human rights activist mina ahadi founded the central council of ex-muslims , in the western-german city of cologne .
ahadi told the german news magazine focus : " i happened to be born in a muslim family , and i have decided not to be a muslim . "
that was the motivation for forming the group , whose members consists of some three dozen people who have turned their back on the religion .
ahadi 's decision to form the group is a controversial one considering that in most strictly islamic countries such as iran , saudi arabia , afghanistan , pakistan , sudan und mauritania , a muslim who rejects his or her religion faces the death sentence in accordance with the sharia law . other countries may not try apostates in a court of law , but they may be ostracized instead .
the topic is also sensitive in europe . an official renunciation of islam is almost unheard of .
death threats on the internet the name of ahadi 's group is also a play on the central council of muslims -lrb- zmd -rrb- , one of germany 's best-known umbrella muslim groups , also based in cologne .
the zmd is said to have around 800,00 members according to its own estimates .
ahadi , an exiled iranian living in germany , decided it was time to shine a light on the subject of born-muslims living in europe who do not want to be part of islam .
the aim of her organization , ahadi said , is to offer former muslims a voice in a country that is not represented by official muslim organizations , she told focus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green mp deligöz wanted to get rid of headscarves - and wound up with police protection but since the group 's formation , she told the magazine , she has been " terrorized . "
members of the group have gotten death threats via the internet .
about a week ago , the police approached ahadi and offered her protection .
the affair has echoes of another recent case in germany where green party politician ekin deligöz , who in october called for muslim women and girls to stop wearing head scarves , was also placed under police protection after receiving threats . at the same time ahadi is well aware of the taboos she is breaking with the founding of her group .
she said she could imagine " that there would be calls for a fatwa against us .
our project may also be discussed in the arab world . " in the coming week , members of the central council of ex-muslims have said they plan to hold a press conference to introduce the group to the public at large .
their slogan : " we have renounced . " defense for the secular ahadi told focus she is hoping the group can offer oppressed women a way to freedom , and defend secular people who live in germany and are integrated in the society here . " we want to improve society , to make it possible for us to get along better .
i hope for more peace , " the magazine quoted her as saying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european mp özdemir : looking for diverse images of islam in germany cem özdemir , a green politician fom germany with turkish roots at the european parliament told der spiegel magazine that ahadi 's project and the greens had something in common : both are hoping to expand the variety of images of islam in germany . " we have to understand , and deal with , the fact that 3.5 million muslims in germany are extremely heterogeneous .
some of them don ’ t have anything to do with religion , and do n't identify themselves as muslim , even if they were born to muslim families . still , özdemir told the magazine he did n't think the new group would attract many adherents .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 22.02.2007 germany to back ban on cluster bombs at conference großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cluster bombs were also dropped by nato during the kosovo war in 1999 the norwegian government is hosting a meeting thursday on cluster munitions .
oslo considers un talks on the issue last year a failure and hopes to launch efforts for an international ban backed by germany . representatives from over 40 countries and international organizations are gathering in oslo on thursday and friday to discuss ways to outlaw cluster bombs .
norway and other nations in favor of a ban are being hampered by nations that oppose one . the scandinavian country hopes the two-day meeting , which will be attended by senior ministry officials from around the world , will be the start of a process that will ultimately lead to the adoption of an international ban - even without the support of some key countries , such as opponents britain and the united states . " it is better that the like-minded -lrb- pro-ban -rrb- nations work in the same direction , " said raymond johansen , norway 's state secretary of foreign affairs .
he said that an international accord would put pressure on anti-ban nations to eventually comply . the pro-ban countries expected to be represented include norway , sweden , germany , mozambique and angola .
on the other side , britain , canada , france , china , india and russia belong to those opposed .
the united states , which is also opposed , will not be in attendance . several un organizations will also attend , as well as the cluster munition coalition -lrb- cmc -rrb- , the umbrella organization grouping non-governmental organizations campaigning for a ban . " it 's a double whammy . " a cluster bomb consists of a container holding up to hundreds of smaller so-called bomblets .
it opens in mid-air and disperses these grenades over a large area .
cluster munitions are stockpiled by most countries ' armies and have often been used in the past 40 years , most recently during the war in lebanon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demining unexploded cluster bombs in lebanon is dangerous work opponents of cluster munitions consider these weapons an unacceptable danger to civilians . " it 's a double whammy , " said cmc 's co-chairman steve goose .
" at the time of the attack , the bomblets spread over a large area and they can not be guided .
a large number of them do not explode upon impact , and so they can kill years later . "
he said that cluster bombs disproportionately target civilians . " cluster munitions caused more civilian casualties during the -lrb- last -rrb- iraq war and in kosovo than any other type of weapon , " goose said . proponents of a ban argue that a prohibition is achievable .
they point to the 1997 mine ban treaty that banned the production , stockpiling and use of anti-personnel landmines - also the result of a norwegian initiative . " the landmine treaty created a powerful standard , " goose said .
" we think the same can happen with cluster munitions . " can a ban influence the right countries ? some experts remain cautious about a ban , though . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unexploded cluster munitions threaten civilians even after a conflict is over " the worry is that , with cluster munitions , it will be a treaty binding those who are already in agreement , but wo n't touch those countries that are affected by them , or manufacture them , " said nicholas sims , an expert on arms limitation at the london school of economics and political science . that fear is compounded by the fact that the united states , russia , china , britain and france - the five permanent members of the un security council - are against an international ban on cluster munitions . another source of concern touches the scope of the ban .
non-governmental organizations are calling for a comprehensive ban on the production , stockpiling and use of all types of cluster munitions .
however , even a pro-ban nation like norway has suggested that a ban could exclude certain types of cluster munitions , such as those that self-destruct on impact . the norwegian government decided to host the conference , as it considered the latest un talks on the issue , held in geneva in november , a failure . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court considers national accountability in foreign missions a kosovo man whose son was killed by a nato cluster bomb took france to europe 's top human rights court wednesday over the boy 's death .

oslo considers un talks on the issue last year a failure and hopes to launch efforts for an international ban backed by germany . representatives from over 40 countries and international organizations are gathering in oslo on thursday and friday to discuss ways to outlaw cluster bombs .
norway and other nations in favor of a ban are being hampered by nations that oppose one . the scandinavian country hopes the two-day meeting , which will be attended by senior ministry officials from around the world , will be the start of a process that will ultimately lead to the adoption of an international ban - even without the support of some key countries , such as opponents britain and the united states . " it is better that the like-minded -lrb- pro-ban -rrb- nations work in the same direction , " said raymond johansen , norway 's state secretary of foreign affairs .
he said that an international accord would put pressure on anti-ban nations to eventually comply . the pro-ban countries expected to be represented include norway , sweden , germany , mozambique and angola .
on the other side , britain , canada , france , china , india and russia belong to those opposed .

non-governmental organizations are calling for a comprehensive ban on the production , stockpiling and use of all types of cluster munitions .

see what other readers experienced while traveling in germany . my husband and i visited berlin in august 2006 .
it 's really a great city to stay in .
the people are very polite and helpful .
we do not speak german , but everybody always tried to help us and i think this is really important when you are in a place where you do n't know the language .
we stayed for only three days but we intend to be back soon and stay longer . - aurelia cofré , curitiba , brazil i went to germany to visit the in-laws in the siegen area in september of 2006 .
i had one heck of a time getting dollars changed to euros !
i could n't even find a bank in dresden that would do it .
next time i go , i 'll get more money changed at the airport before ever stepping on the plane .
thank goodness i had the sense to change $ 200 dollars for euros in denver .
if my niece andrea had n't had a friend at the local branch bank in wilgersdorf who changed another couple hundred dollars for me as a favor to andrea , i 'd really have been in a pickle . - laurie kunze editor 's tip : getting cash straight from the atm always has the best exchange rate , even if you have to pay a small fee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nürnberger bratwurst is a highlight for one traveler to germany i have visited germany eight times and will soon make my ninth visit .

we entered the home , laid the keys down on a table in the entranceway and began to look around .
all of the ladies decided to go out into the backyard and i went out front to begin to bring in the luggage .
the doors closed behind us and we did n't realize that they locked automatically .
five minutes after getting to the house , we were locked out .
we then spent the next one half hour trying to explain to the older gentleman from whom we had gotten the first set of keys that the americans had quickly locked themselves out of their own home and needed another key to get in .
despite this early setback , we all had a great time in germany . - woody compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de readers offer german travel tales and tips planning a trip to germany anytime soon ?

he could reject prodi 's resignation and ask him to seek a vote of confidence in parliament , or give him a mandate to form a new government . alternatively , he could give the mandate to a different center-left leader or an institutional figure .
a final option , seen as less likely at present , would be to call fresh elections that would take place in the spring . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi 's government lost a key vote over foreign policy in a drama reminiscent of italian politics of the 1980s and 1990s when governments sometimes lasted less than a week , prodi stepped down on wednesday , just nine months after assuming office , after he lost a key vote in parliament 's upper house over his government 's foreign policy .
the center-left government was forced onto the defensive over the deployment of 2,000 troops in afghanistan and the enlargement of a us military base in northern italy . both are policies most opposed by far-left parties within prodi 's coalition . opposition called for prodi 's resignation but it is the conservative opposition , led by silvio berlusconi , who was narrowly forced out of the prime minister 's office by prodi in an election last april , who led calls for prodi to go . right wing senators shouted " resign ! resign ! " after the result of the vote in the italian senate was announced .

he could reject prodi 's resignation and ask him to seek a vote of confidence in parliament , or give him a mandate to form a new government . alternatively , he could give the mandate to a different center-left leader or an institutional figure .
a final option , seen as less likely at present , would be to call fresh elections that would take place in the spring . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi 's government lost a key vote over foreign policy in a drama reminiscent of italian politics of the 1980s and 1990s when governments sometimes lasted less than a week , prodi stepped down on wednesday , just nine months after assuming office , after he lost a key vote in parliament 's upper house over his government 's foreign policy .
the center-left government was forced onto the defensive over the deployment of 2,000 troops in afghanistan and the enlargement of a us military base in northern italy . both are policies most opposed by far-left parties within prodi 's coalition . opposition called for prodi 's resignation but it is the conservative opposition , led by silvio berlusconi , who was narrowly forced out of the prime minister 's office by prodi in an election last april , who led calls for prodi to go . right wing senators shouted " resign ! resign ! " after the result of the vote in the italian senate was announced .
prodi should " tender his resignation immediately , " declared berlusconi . the government needed 160 votes in the senate debate to get a formal motion of support .
but only 158 senators voted in favor and 136 opposed the government .

he could reject prodi 's resignation and ask him to seek a vote of confidence in parliament , or give him a mandate to form a new government . alternatively , he could give the mandate to a different center-left leader or an institutional figure .
a final option , seen as less likely at present , would be to call fresh elections that would take place in the spring . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi 's government lost a key vote over foreign policy in a drama reminiscent of italian politics of the 1980s and 1990s when governments sometimes lasted less than a week , prodi stepped down on wednesday , just nine months after assuming office , after he lost a key vote in parliament 's upper house over his government 's foreign policy .
the center-left government was forced onto the defensive over the deployment of 2,000 troops in afghanistan and the enlargement of a us military base in northern italy . both are policies most opposed by far-left parties within prodi 's coalition . opposition called for prodi 's resignation but it is the conservative opposition , led by silvio berlusconi , who was narrowly forced out of the prime minister 's office by prodi in an election last april , who led calls for prodi to go . right wing senators shouted " resign ! resign ! " after the result of the vote in the italian senate was announced .
prodi should " tender his resignation immediately , " declared berlusconi . the government needed 160 votes in the senate debate to get a formal motion of support .
but only 158 senators voted in favor and 136 opposed the government .
several left-wing senators were reportedly absent from the upper chamber . though it was not a formal vote of confidence , foreign minister massimo d 'alema said tuesday that the government would " go home " if it lost . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tide of public opinion can turn quickly , and brutally " it is a grave , serious and worrying fact to not obtain a majority for the speech of a foreign minister , " acknowledged vannino chiti , the minister for relations with parliament . immediately after , prodi held a crisis meeting with d 'alema , defence minister arturo parisi and deputy prime minister francesco rutelli . he then tendered his resignation to the president .
napolitano , who rushed back to rome from a visit to the provinces , said in a statement that he " reserves his decision " on the future of the government . under pressure over afghanistan d 'alema had to defend italy 's military mission in afghanistan to senators before the vote .
italy currently has around 2,000 troops deployed in the country as part of a nato-led peacekeeping mission . " it 's not a nato mission , but a united nations mission in which nato has an important military function , " d 'alema told the parliament . " it is a political and civil mission . "
the afghanistan deployment and the enlargement of the us base at vicenza in northern italy are both strongly opposed by the greens and communists who are part of a ruling coalition which also includes liberal and roman catholic parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters at a demonstration against the expansion of a us military base in vicenza more than 80,000 people took part in a rally last saturday in vicenza against the base enlargement . d 'alema said that to go back on the approval for the base that the prime minister gave last month for the base enlargement would be a " hostile act " toward the united states . no stranger to controversy prodi 's union coalition narrowly won an election in april last year that ended berlusconi 's five year-old government - one of the longest in recent italian political history . prodi is no stranger to the dangers of running italian governments . he resigned as prime minister in 1997 and 1998 when leading governments .
the first time he won a vote of confidence from parliament .
the second time he had to let d 'alema take over .

now , german chancellor angela merkel also boasts one , 60 miles north of berlin . a magnificent 1738-built baroque-style property called schloss meseberg -lrb- castle meseberg -rrb- is situated in the eastern state of brandenburg encircling berlin . on friday , german chancellor angela merkel will play host at the castle for the first time to french president jacques chirac , during one of their regular german-franco consultations . under a deal reached with the messerschmidt foundation - a privately-owned organization that bought the castle in the mid-nineties - the government will be allowed to use the property as its guesthouse for high-ranking officials over a 20-year period at a rent of just one euro a year . the government for its part has in the past year spent 13 million euros -lrb- $ 17 million -rrb- modernizing its kitchen and heating facilities and by ensuring its security and technical facilities are also state-of-the-art . mixed feelings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques chirac will be merkel 's first guest at meseberg while there is general satisfaction in brandenburg that a worthy role has been found for the magnificently-restored property , feelings in meseberg -lrb- population 135 -rrb- are mixed . the decision to renew the 1.7 kilometer-long -lrb- 1 mile -rrb- approach road to the castle has raised eyebrows in the village even though community officials say the rough-surfaced , pot-holed road , was in dire need of repair . the main cost will be borne by the german government and brandenburg state , but villagers with properties along the route are also being called on to make contributions , ranging from 2,000 to 15,000 euros . where were they before ? evelyn briesmeister , 65 , a village resident , is furious . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the castle has been meticulously restored to its past splendor " the state of the road did n't bother a soul in earlier times , " briesmeister said .
" now , because government officials will be driving cars along it to the schloss the whole village is made poor . " her husband , horst briesemeister , 70 , agrees .
both have signed a citizen 's petition in protest . frank stege , 45 , the district 's head official claims the decision to renew the approach road at a cost of 1.2 million euros was taken in december 2005 . " we aim to make the payments socially tolerable for the villagers , " he said . transfer of power in the old federal republic during the years of division , the government 's official guesthouse was to be found atop a hill overlooking the rhine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meseberg is probably the cheapest castle in the world : the german government will be renting it for 1 euro per year nick-named the " rotunde " -lrb- rotunda -rrb- with its 23 conference rooms , it played host to a whole list of world leaders in the post-war years , ranging from leonid breschnev to bill clinton , the shah of persia to queen elizabeth of england . but after german reunification and the controversial political " power transfer " from bonn to berlin in 1999 , it was clear a new government guesthouse would have to be found closer to the old-new capital . schloss meseberg received little consideration at the time .
situated in the former gdr -lrb- east germany -rrb- , it was just one of a series of decaying country retreats which had fallen on hard times during the communist era . then , the munich-based messerschmidt foundation , a private organization that renovates dilapidated monuments across germany , acquired the castle in the mid-1990s , and spent 25 million euros over the next 10 years restoring it . footing the bill the brandenburg state government , it was thought , would find a role for the castle and was miffed when matthias platzeck , the state 's premier , ultimately rejected the idea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last summer , merkel welcomed george w. bush in her constituency in stralsund but platzeck did toss the idea to then german chancellor gerhard schröder who was seeking a suitable venue for summer government conclaves and a place for putting up high-ranking foreign visitors . his dilemma was spotlighted in early 2005 when president bush arrived for a visit .
concern about his safety led to a planned berlin stop-over being moved to mainz , near frankfurt . late last month , german chancellory minister thomas de maiziere was handed a symbolic key to schloss meseberg . referring to the castle as a government venue for international conferences and foreign guests making overnight stays , de maiziere predicted that " history would be written in the meseberg meetings of the future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 22.02.2007 the power behind the german smoking ban stalemate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's smoke-filled bars and cafes are almost a rarity in western europe as a crucial meeting on protecting non-smokers opens in germany friday , a look at the country 's powerful tobacco lobby offers some clues as to why germany has successfully resisted an outright smoking ban so far . the struggle in germany to agree on a smoking ban continues this week when government ministers convene in hanover on friday to discuss the issue of protection for non-smokers before a state premiers ' debate on march 22 .
the meeting , to be chaired by federal minister for health , ulla schmidt and consumer affairs minister , horst seehofer will be used to further discuss whether smoking in schools , public buildings and most restaurants should be banned by germany 's 16 federal states .
the decision to hand the responsibility for approving the ban to the individual states came after germany 's ruling coalition rescinded the original ban proposal on constitutional grounds in december last year .
the government said an outright federal ban could infringe on individual states ' rights , many of which can not be overridden by berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the states are responsible for issuing bans in public places it is the 16 states , not the federal government , which have power over local government facilities such as schools and hospitals , as well as places such as bars and restaurants - those places where the smoking ban was proposed .
pro-smoking lobbyists pulling the strings ?
the decision was also seen as another example of the german government 's unwillingness to confront the country 's powerful pro-smoking lobby which opposition politicians and anti-smoking campaigners believe holds too much influence over the ruling coalition of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
germany has been slow to follow the lead of those eu states which have already agreed and have implemented their own smoking bans .
france , italy and england have already passed laws that ban smoking in bars and restaurants , as well as public buildings , putting germany out of step with many of its european counterparts .
pressure from the anti-smoking lobby is suspected as being the reason why germany continues to lag behind .
but does the pro- lobby really have that amount of power , that the german government would defy european union directives to satisfy its wishes ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lobbyists are accused of pressuring the government " the pro-smoker lobby is stronger in germany than in any other european country , " siggi ermer , the chairman of pro rauchfrei , the german lobby for non-smokers said . " even the tobacco companies are proud of that fact .
its influence is so strong that pro rauchfrei talks about a tobacco dictatorship in a democratic state .
-lrb- the pro- lobby -rrb- has affected the legislation for decades and crucially has steered the politicians .
" it is so powerful that in the current discussions , the cdu / csu parliamentary group brought in a regulation paper from the german tobacco industry association -lrb- vdc -rrb- and presented it word for word as their own proposal for the negotiations . "
the german tobacco industry association -lrb- vdc -rrb- was unavailable for comment on its involvement in any parliamentary decisions or the extent of its influence over the government .
wolfgang hainer , head of the powerful vdc , who represents the interests of philip morris , british american tobacco , reemtsma and four other tobacco companies in germany recently told german weekly die zeit , " we collect information , channel the opinions of our members and then present the facts to the politicians . " the vdc is also said to organize regular parties at its headquarters in berlin which usually pulls in younger employees from the german ministries and the offices of parliamentarians . no such thing as a free lunch in lobbyists ' eyes germany is an important battleground for the pro-smoking lobby .
it is europe 's biggest tobacco market with about 22 million smokers , which is 27 percent of the population , according to the federal statistics office .
and with more and more eu countries cracking down on smokers , the hearts , minds and lungs of german smokers have become more valuable to the tobacco companies .
for the pro-smoking lobby to retain its advantage , alliances have to be formed with those in power .
" in germany , the tobacco lobby has a strong influence on the politicians , " pro rauchfrei 's ermer says .
" that begins with regular gifts directly to the desks of the delegates , and goes as far as direct payments for local government events and party meetings . "
" beyond that the delegates are invited regularly to meetings of the tobacco industry , the agendas of which are disguised by social topics .
until 2006 , the total of direct payments paid to the federal government by the tobacco industry amounts to 11.2 million euros . "
inaction and stalling can not stop ban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hopes of the anti- lobby regularly get trodden on ermer states that there is a network of pro-smoking sympathizers within the political arena in germany and that smokers within the government have an obvious agenda .
" whole parliamentary committees , such as the tourism committee , have been infiltrated by the tobacco lobby , " he added " in addition , the health minister ulla schmidt avoids making clear decisions .
unlike in other european countries , the german health minister doesn ’ t take the leadership in the ban discussion and leaves the demagogues to take the lead . "
despite the power wielded by the pro-lobby , ermer believes that the move towards a smoke-free europe is an irreversible one .
" while the influence in germany is large , the german pro-smoker lobby has only a small influence on europe , " ermer concludes .
" on a european scale , germany is isolated , as the judgment of the european court of justice pointed out with the tobacco advertising ban in 2005 .
only germany complained and lost , " he said .
" the european way into a smokeless future can not be stopped , it can only be slowed down by germany .

the meeting , to be chaired by federal minister for health , ulla schmidt and consumer affairs minister , horst seehofer will be used to further discuss whether smoking in schools , public buildings and most restaurants should be banned by germany 's 16 federal states .
the decision to hand the responsibility for approving the ban to the individual states came after germany 's ruling coalition rescinded the original ban proposal on constitutional grounds in december last year .
the government said an outright federal ban could infringe on individual states ' rights , many of which can not be overridden by berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the states are responsible for issuing bans in public places it is the 16 states , not the federal government , which have power over local government facilities such as schools and hospitals , as well as places such as bars and restaurants - those places where the smoking ban was proposed .
pro-smoking lobbyists pulling the strings ?
the decision was also seen as another example of the german government 's unwillingness to confront the country 's powerful pro-smoking lobby which opposition politicians and anti-smoking campaigners believe holds too much influence over the ruling coalition of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
germany has been slow to follow the lead of those eu states which have already agreed and have implemented their own smoking bans .
france , italy and england have already passed laws that ban smoking in bars and restaurants , as well as public buildings , putting germany out of step with many of its european counterparts .
pressure from the anti-smoking lobby is suspected as being the reason why germany continues to lag behind .
but does the pro- lobby really have that amount of power , that the german government would defy european union directives to satisfy its wishes ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lobbyists are accused of pressuring the government " the pro-smoker lobby is stronger in germany than in any other european country , " siggi ermer , the chairman of pro rauchfrei , the german lobby for non-smokers said .

the german tobacco industry association -lrb- vdc -rrb- was unavailable for comment on its involvement in any parliamentary decisions or the extent of its influence over the government .

it is europe 's biggest tobacco market with about 22 million smokers , which is 27 percent of the population , according to the federal statistics office .
and with more and more eu countries cracking down on smokers , the hearts , minds and lungs of german smokers have become more valuable to the tobacco companies .
for the pro-smoking lobby to retain its advantage , alliances have to be formed with those in power .
" in germany , the tobacco lobby has a strong influence on the politicians , " pro rauchfrei 's ermer says .

" beyond that the delegates are invited regularly to meetings of the tobacco industry , the agendas of which are disguised by social topics .

now , german chancellor angela merkel also boasts one , 60 miles north of berlin . a magnificent 1738-built baroque-style property called schloss meseberg -lrb- castle meseberg -rrb- is situated in the eastern state of brandenburg encircling berlin . on friday , german chancellor angela merkel will play host at the castle for the first time to french president jacques chirac , during one of their regular german-franco consultations . under a deal reached with the messerschmidt foundation - a privately-owned organization that bought the castle in the mid-nineties - the government will be allowed to use the property as its guesthouse for high-ranking officials over a 20-year period at a rent of just one euro a year . the government for its part has in the past year spent 13 million euros -lrb- $ 17 million -rrb- modernizing its kitchen and heating facilities and by ensuring its security and technical facilities are also state-of-the-art . mixed feelings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques chirac will be merkel 's first guest at meseberg while there is general satisfaction in brandenburg that a worthy role has been found for the magnificently-restored property , feelings in meseberg -lrb- population 135 -rrb- are mixed . the decision to renew the 1.7 kilometer-long -lrb- 1 mile -rrb- approach road to the castle has raised eyebrows in the village even though community officials say the rough-surfaced , pot-holed road , was in dire need of repair . the main cost will be borne by the german government and brandenburg state , but villagers with properties along the route are also being called on to make contributions , ranging from 2,000 to 15,000 euros . where were they before ? evelyn briesmeister , 65 , a village resident , is furious . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the castle has been meticulously restored to its past splendor " the state of the road did n't bother a soul in earlier times , " briesmeister said .
" now , because government officials will be driving cars along it to the schloss the whole village is made poor . " her husband , horst briesemeister , 70 , agrees .
both have signed a citizen 's petition in protest . frank stege , 45 , the district 's head official claims the decision to renew the approach road at a cost of 1.2 million euros was taken in december 2005 . " we aim to make the payments socially tolerable for the villagers , " he said . transfer of power in the old federal republic during the years of division , the government 's official guesthouse was to be found atop a hill overlooking the rhine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meseberg is probably the cheapest castle in the world : the german government will be renting it for 1 euro per year nick-named the " rotunde " -lrb- rotunda -rrb- with its 23 conference rooms , it played host to a whole list of world leaders in the post-war years , ranging from leonid breschnev to bill clinton , the shah of persia to queen elizabeth of england . but after german reunification and the controversial political " power transfer " from bonn to berlin in 1999 , it was clear a new government guesthouse would have to be found closer to the old-new capital . schloss meseberg received little consideration at the time .
situated in the former gdr -lrb- east germany -rrb- , it was just one of a series of decaying country retreats which had fallen on hard times during the communist era . then , the munich-based messerschmidt foundation , a private organization that renovates dilapidated monuments across germany , acquired the castle in the mid-1990s , and spent 25 million euros over the next 10 years restoring it . footing the bill the brandenburg state government , it was thought , would find a role for the castle and was miffed when matthias platzeck , the state 's premier , ultimately rejected the idea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last summer , merkel welcomed george w. bush in her constituency in stralsund but platzeck did toss the idea to then german chancellor gerhard schröder who was seeking a suitable venue for summer government conclaves and a place for putting up high-ranking foreign visitors . his dilemma was spotlighted in early 2005 when president bush arrived for a visit .
concern about his safety led to a planned berlin stop-over being moved to mainz , near frankfurt . late last month , german chancellory minister thomas de maiziere was handed a symbolic key to schloss meseberg . referring to the castle as a government venue for international conferences and foreign guests making overnight stays , de maiziere predicted that " history would be written in the meseberg meetings of the future .

oslo considers un talks on the issue last year a failure and hopes to launch efforts for an international ban backed by germany . representatives from over 40 countries and international organizations are gathering in oslo on thursday and friday to discuss ways to outlaw cluster bombs .
norway and other nations in favor of a ban are being hampered by nations that oppose one . the scandinavian country hopes the two-day meeting , which will be attended by senior ministry officials from around the world , will be the start of a process that will ultimately lead to the adoption of an international ban - even without the support of some key countries , such as opponents britain and the united states . " it is better that the like-minded -lrb- pro-ban -rrb- nations work in the same direction , " said raymond johansen , norway 's state secretary of foreign affairs .
he said that an international accord would put pressure on anti-ban nations to eventually comply . the pro-ban countries expected to be represented include norway , sweden , germany , mozambique and angola .
on the other side , britain , canada , france , china , india and russia belong to those opposed .
the united states , which is also opposed , will not be in attendance . several un organizations will also attend , as well as the cluster munition coalition -lrb- cmc -rrb- , the umbrella organization grouping non-governmental organizations campaigning for a ban . " it 's a double whammy . " a cluster bomb consists of a container holding up to hundreds of smaller so-called bomblets .
it opens in mid-air and disperses these grenades over a large area .
cluster munitions are stockpiled by most countries ' armies and have often been used in the past 40 years , most recently during the war in lebanon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demining unexploded cluster bombs in lebanon is dangerous work opponents of cluster munitions consider these weapons an unacceptable danger to civilians . " it 's a double whammy , " said cmc 's co-chairman steve goose .
" at the time of the attack , the bomblets spread over a large area and they can not be guided .
a large number of them do not explode upon impact , and so they can kill years later . "
he said that cluster bombs disproportionately target civilians . " cluster munitions caused more civilian casualties during the -lrb- last -rrb- iraq war and in kosovo than any other type of weapon , " goose said . proponents of a ban argue that a prohibition is achievable .
they point to the 1997 mine ban treaty that banned the production , stockpiling and use of anti-personnel landmines - also the result of a norwegian initiative . " the landmine treaty created a powerful standard , " goose said .
" we think the same can happen with cluster munitions . " can a ban influence the right countries ? some experts remain cautious about a ban , though . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unexploded cluster munitions threaten civilians even after a conflict is over " the worry is that , with cluster munitions , it will be a treaty binding those who are already in agreement , but wo n't touch those countries that are affected by them , or manufacture them , " said nicholas sims , an expert on arms limitation at the london school of economics and political science . that fear is compounded by the fact that the united states , russia , china , britain and france - the five permanent members of the un security council - are against an international ban on cluster munitions . another source of concern touches the scope of the ban .
non-governmental organizations are calling for a comprehensive ban on the production , stockpiling and use of all types of cluster munitions .
however , even a pro-ban nation like norway has suggested that a ban could exclude certain types of cluster munitions , such as those that self-destruct on impact . the norwegian government decided to host the conference , as it considered the latest un talks on the issue , held in geneva in november , a failure . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court considers national accountability in foreign missions a kosovo man whose son was killed by a nato cluster bomb took france to europe 's top human rights court wednesday over the boy 's death .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 22.02.2007 the power behind the german smoking ban stalemate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's smoke-filled bars and cafes are almost a rarity in western europe as a crucial meeting on protecting non-smokers opens in germany friday , a look at the country 's powerful tobacco lobby offers some clues as to why germany has successfully resisted an outright smoking ban so far . the struggle in germany to agree on a smoking ban continues this week when government ministers convene in hanover on friday to discuss the issue of protection for non-smokers before a state premiers ' debate on march 22 .
the meeting , to be chaired by federal minister for health , ulla schmidt and consumer affairs minister , horst seehofer will be used to further discuss whether smoking in schools , public buildings and most restaurants should be banned by germany 's 16 federal states .
the decision to hand the responsibility for approving the ban to the individual states came after germany 's ruling coalition rescinded the original ban proposal on constitutional grounds in december last year .
the government said an outright federal ban could infringe on individual states ' rights , many of which can not be overridden by berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the states are responsible for issuing bans in public places it is the 16 states , not the federal government , which have power over local government facilities such as schools and hospitals , as well as places such as bars and restaurants - those places where the smoking ban was proposed .
pro-smoking lobbyists pulling the strings ?
the decision was also seen as another example of the german government 's unwillingness to confront the country 's powerful pro-smoking lobby which opposition politicians and anti-smoking campaigners believe holds too much influence over the ruling coalition of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
germany has been slow to follow the lead of those eu states which have already agreed and have implemented their own smoking bans .
france , italy and england have already passed laws that ban smoking in bars and restaurants , as well as public buildings , putting germany out of step with many of its european counterparts .
pressure from the anti-smoking lobby is suspected as being the reason why germany continues to lag behind .
but does the pro- lobby really have that amount of power , that the german government would defy european union directives to satisfy its wishes ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lobbyists are accused of pressuring the government " the pro-smoker lobby is stronger in germany than in any other european country , " siggi ermer , the chairman of pro rauchfrei , the german lobby for non-smokers said . " even the tobacco companies are proud of that fact .
its influence is so strong that pro rauchfrei talks about a tobacco dictatorship in a democratic state .
-lrb- the pro- lobby -rrb- has affected the legislation for decades and crucially has steered the politicians .
" it is so powerful that in the current discussions , the cdu / csu parliamentary group brought in a regulation paper from the german tobacco industry association -lrb- vdc -rrb- and presented it word for word as their own proposal for the negotiations . "
the german tobacco industry association -lrb- vdc -rrb- was unavailable for comment on its involvement in any parliamentary decisions or the extent of its influence over the government .
wolfgang hainer , head of the powerful vdc , who represents the interests of philip morris , british american tobacco , reemtsma and four other tobacco companies in germany recently told german weekly die zeit , " we collect information , channel the opinions of our members and then present the facts to the politicians . " the vdc is also said to organize regular parties at its headquarters in berlin which usually pulls in younger employees from the german ministries and the offices of parliamentarians . no such thing as a free lunch in lobbyists ' eyes germany is an important battleground for the pro-smoking lobby .
it is europe 's biggest tobacco market with about 22 million smokers , which is 27 percent of the population , according to the federal statistics office .
and with more and more eu countries cracking down on smokers , the hearts , minds and lungs of german smokers have become more valuable to the tobacco companies .
for the pro-smoking lobby to retain its advantage , alliances have to be formed with those in power .
" in germany , the tobacco lobby has a strong influence on the politicians , " pro rauchfrei 's ermer says .
" that begins with regular gifts directly to the desks of the delegates , and goes as far as direct payments for local government events and party meetings . "
" beyond that the delegates are invited regularly to meetings of the tobacco industry , the agendas of which are disguised by social topics .
until 2006 , the total of direct payments paid to the federal government by the tobacco industry amounts to 11.2 million euros . "
inaction and stalling can not stop ban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hopes of the anti- lobby regularly get trodden on ermer states that there is a network of pro-smoking sympathizers within the political arena in germany and that smokers within the government have an obvious agenda .
" whole parliamentary committees , such as the tourism committee , have been infiltrated by the tobacco lobby , " he added " in addition , the health minister ulla schmidt avoids making clear decisions .
unlike in other european countries , the german health minister doesn ’ t take the leadership in the ban discussion and leaves the demagogues to take the lead . "
despite the power wielded by the pro-lobby , ermer believes that the move towards a smoke-free europe is an irreversible one .
" while the influence in germany is large , the german pro-smoker lobby has only a small influence on europe , " ermer concludes .
" on a european scale , germany is isolated , as the judgment of the european court of justice pointed out with the tobacco advertising ban in 2005 .
only germany complained and lost , " he said .
" the european way into a smokeless future can not be stopped , it can only be slowed down by germany .

the meeting , to be chaired by federal minister for health , ulla schmidt and consumer affairs minister , horst seehofer will be used to further discuss whether smoking in schools , public buildings and most restaurants should be banned by germany 's 16 federal states .
the decision to hand the responsibility for approving the ban to the individual states came after germany 's ruling coalition rescinded the original ban proposal on constitutional grounds in december last year .
the government said an outright federal ban could infringe on individual states ' rights , many of which can not be overridden by berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the states are responsible for issuing bans in public places it is the 16 states , not the federal government , which have power over local government facilities such as schools and hospitals , as well as places such as bars and restaurants - those places where the smoking ban was proposed .
pro-smoking lobbyists pulling the strings ?
the decision was also seen as another example of the german government 's unwillingness to confront the country 's powerful pro-smoking lobby which opposition politicians and anti-smoking campaigners believe holds too much influence over the ruling coalition of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
germany has been slow to follow the lead of those eu states which have already agreed and have implemented their own smoking bans .
france , italy and england have already passed laws that ban smoking in bars and restaurants , as well as public buildings , putting germany out of step with many of its european counterparts .
pressure from the anti-smoking lobby is suspected as being the reason why germany continues to lag behind .
but does the pro- lobby really have that amount of power , that the german government would defy european union directives to satisfy its wishes ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lobbyists are accused of pressuring the government " the pro-smoker lobby is stronger in germany than in any other european country , " siggi ermer , the chairman of pro rauchfrei , the german lobby for non-smokers said . " even the tobacco companies are proud of that fact .
its influence is so strong that pro rauchfrei talks about a tobacco dictatorship in a democratic state .
-lrb- the pro- lobby -rrb- has affected the legislation for decades and crucially has steered the politicians .
" it is so powerful that in the current discussions , the cdu / csu parliamentary group brought in a regulation paper from the german tobacco industry association -lrb- vdc -rrb- and presented it word for word as their own proposal for the negotiations . "
the german tobacco industry association -lrb- vdc -rrb- was unavailable for comment on its involvement in any parliamentary decisions or the extent of its influence over the government .
wolfgang hainer , head of the powerful vdc , who represents the interests of philip morris , british american tobacco , reemtsma and four other tobacco companies in germany recently told german weekly die zeit , " we collect information , channel the opinions of our members and then present the facts to the politicians . " the vdc is also said to organize regular parties at its headquarters in berlin which usually pulls in younger employees from the german ministries and the offices of parliamentarians . no such thing as a free lunch in lobbyists ' eyes germany is an important battleground for the pro-smoking lobby .
it is europe 's biggest tobacco market with about 22 million smokers , which is 27 percent of the population , according to the federal statistics office .
and with more and more eu countries cracking down on smokers , the hearts , minds and lungs of german smokers have become more valuable to the tobacco companies .
for the pro-smoking lobby to retain its advantage , alliances have to be formed with those in power .
" in germany , the tobacco lobby has a strong influence on the politicians , " pro rauchfrei 's ermer says .
" that begins with regular gifts directly to the desks of the delegates , and goes as far as direct payments for local government events and party meetings . "
" beyond that the delegates are invited regularly to meetings of the tobacco industry , the agendas of which are disguised by social topics .
until 2006 , the total of direct payments paid to the federal government by the tobacco industry amounts to 11.2 million euros . "

oslo considers un talks on the issue last year a failure and hopes to launch efforts for an international ban backed by germany . representatives from over 40 countries and international organizations are gathering in oslo on thursday and friday to discuss ways to outlaw cluster bombs .
norway and other nations in favor of a ban are being hampered by nations that oppose one . the scandinavian country hopes the two-day meeting , which will be attended by senior ministry officials from around the world , will be the start of a process that will ultimately lead to the adoption of an international ban - even without the support of some key countries , such as opponents britain and the united states . " it is better that the like-minded -lrb- pro-ban -rrb- nations work in the same direction , " said raymond johansen , norway 's state secretary of foreign affairs .
he said that an international accord would put pressure on anti-ban nations to eventually comply . the pro-ban countries expected to be represented include norway , sweden , germany , mozambique and angola .
on the other side , britain , canada , france , china , india and russia belong to those opposed .
the united states , which is also opposed , will not be in attendance . several un organizations will also attend , as well as the cluster munition coalition -lrb- cmc -rrb- , the umbrella organization grouping non-governmental organizations campaigning for a ban . " it 's a double whammy . " a cluster bomb consists of a container holding up to hundreds of smaller so-called bomblets .
it opens in mid-air and disperses these grenades over a large area .
cluster munitions are stockpiled by most countries ' armies and have often been used in the past 40 years , most recently during the war in lebanon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demining unexploded cluster bombs in lebanon is dangerous work opponents of cluster munitions consider these weapons an unacceptable danger to civilians . " it 's a double whammy , " said cmc 's co-chairman steve goose .
" at the time of the attack , the bomblets spread over a large area and they can not be guided .
a large number of them do not explode upon impact , and so they can kill years later . "
he said that cluster bombs disproportionately target civilians . " cluster munitions caused more civilian casualties during the -lrb- last -rrb- iraq war and in kosovo than any other type of weapon , " goose said . proponents of a ban argue that a prohibition is achievable .
they point to the 1997 mine ban treaty that banned the production , stockpiling and use of anti-personnel landmines - also the result of a norwegian initiative . " the landmine treaty created a powerful standard , " goose said .
" we think the same can happen with cluster munitions . " can a ban influence the right countries ? some experts remain cautious about a ban , though . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unexploded cluster munitions threaten civilians even after a conflict is over " the worry is that , with cluster munitions , it will be a treaty binding those who are already in agreement , but wo n't touch those countries that are affected by them , or manufacture them , " said nicholas sims , an expert on arms limitation at the london school of economics and political science . that fear is compounded by the fact that the united states , russia , china , britain and france - the five permanent members of the un security council - are against an international ban on cluster munitions . another source of concern touches the scope of the ban .
non-governmental organizations are calling for a comprehensive ban on the production , stockpiling and use of all types of cluster munitions .
however , even a pro-ban nation like norway has suggested that a ban could exclude certain types of cluster munitions , such as those that self-destruct on impact . the norwegian government decided to host the conference , as it considered the latest un talks on the issue , held in geneva in november , a failure . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court considers national accountability in foreign missions a kosovo man whose son was killed by a nato cluster bomb took france to europe 's top human rights court wednesday over the boy 's death .

napolitano 's flurry of meetings thursday were to continue friday , consulting with the speakers of the two houses of parliament , the heads of parliamentary groups and the presidents who preceded him . prodi , head of italy 's 61st government since world war ii , was also prime minister for two years and five months in 1996-98 , falling when communists withdrew their support . possible reinstatement napolitano is widely expected to rename prodi as prime minister .
but he also has the option of choosing a new government leader from the center-left coalition , appointing a technocrat government or dissolving parliament and calling new elections . while fresh elections are considered unlikely , the economic daily il sole 24 ore warned thursday against prodi 's simple reinstatement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's president giorgio napolitano is scrambling for a new government " experience shows that -lrb- such -rrb- governments are always mediocre , especially when the differences that brought about the crisis are not resolved , " it said in an editorial . and franco pavoncello of rome 's john cabot university said it was " highly improbable " that napolitano would call an election after the current round of consultations . foreign policy trip-up " i do n't think it will happen , " he told german news agency dpa .
" italy needs to change its electoral system first and ensure that the new law produces more stable governments in the future , " pavoncello said . gianfranco pasquino of john hopkins university told sky italia television he expected the president would ask prodi to stay on , but only after ensuring " he has a workable majority " in the senate . prodi stepped down on wednesday , just nine months after he assumed office , after losing a key vote in parliament 's upper house over his government 's foreign policy . a government-sponsored motion received just 158 votes in favor , two short of the required majority of 160 .
a total of 136 lawmakers voted against and 24 , including two far-left dissidents , abstained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's foreign policy proved prodi 's undoing the two communist senators in prodi 's coalition , who are staunchly opposed to the planned enlargement of a us military base in northern italy , tipped the balance with their crucial " no " votes . giovanni sartori , one of italy 's leading constitutional experts , said the president could decide to form an " institutional " or " technocrat " government backed by an enlarged majority . " the last thing to do would be to go to the polls , " sartori told sky italia . berlusconi law prodi assumed office in may of last year after defeating silvio berlusconi in april 's general election , the closest in modern italian history . a convoluted electoral law approved by berlusconi in the final weeks of the past legislature ensured that a future government would be guaranteed a comfortable majority in the chamber of deputies , but not in the senate . prodi had been commanding a wafer-thin majority in the upper house and lost wednesday 's vote because two far-left dissident lawmakers refused to back it in disagreement at italy 's peacekeeping mission in afghanistan . napolitano began his round of consultations by meeting the presidents of the two branches of parliament , fausto bertinotti and franco marini , ahead of talks with former italian presidents and party leaders friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did prodi 's departure open the door for berlusconi , again ?
berlusconi , who leads prodi in latest opinion polls , wednesday called for fresh elections . searching for alternatives but many of his center-right allies were thursday conceding that napolitano would explore alternative solutions to the crisis first . " we would like elections , but our alternative is to find a transitional solution to solve the big problems facing the country , " said renato schifani , a whip in berlusconi 's forza italia party . the catholic udc , a small but influential opposition party that has been distancing itself from berlusconi since last year 's election defeat , has said it may decide to join a new government , but only if there is " discontinuity " with the previous administration . all of the nine center-left ruling parties have indicated that they want prodi to stay on as premier . napolitano was expected to make a decision on prodi 's future on friday evening or saturday at the latest . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italian president looks for post-prodi direction italy 's president was to consult with party and government leaders on the future of the government thursday , following the resignation of prime minister romano prodi wednesday .

two people were killed on february 10 during outbreaks . this week , there was a bomb attack on united nations vehicles in pristina .
are the negotiations failing ? fatmir sejdiu : these developments are not helping the situation in kosovo - it 's been a dark day for kosovo since the outbursts occurred .
they have been violent protests and it was absolutely unnecessary for those two people to die . not only do the deaths mean a major loss for the families .
the severity of the attacks has a very negative effect on kosovo 's prospects .
it damages the political processes . of course , everyone has the right to protest and express his or her opinions , but it 's essential that this occurs within the framework of the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo president fatmir sejdiu i believe kosovo 's negotiating group has done its job .
we have clearly represented kosovo 's interests at all of the meetings in vienna , and it 's true that we have reached a consensus in all of our decisions .
this shows that we have represented the absolute majority of kosovo 's population and its institutions . before the talks in vienna began , kosovo 's negotiating group presented a list of contentious points .
do you believe that un special envoy ahtisaari 's scheme can still be altered during the negotiations ? perhaps .
there surely wo n't be any more major changes , but it could be that arguments we have presented will be integrated in some way .
we 'll have to wait and see .
however , we do not want to start debating ahtisaari 's recommendations all over again .
that would just mean an endless round of discussions which would n't go anywhere , other than putting kosovo at further risk .
it would jeopardize its future . i would like to point out that it 's essential that the un security council keep track of this process ; it 's that group which will hear the recommendations for the future of kosovo .
the political formulations and kosovo 's independence are central here . the serbian negotiating delegation has demanded that ahtisaari 's plan be divided into technical and political sections .
what 's your opinion on that ? i think belgrade 's interest during the discussions in vienna is prolonging them as much as possible , thereby discrediting them .
that would increase the tensions in kosovo - with the aim of trying to show that kosovo is not yet ready for independence , that it 's unstable , that it offers no prospects for its citizens , and especially , for its serbian citizens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were also demonstrations in pristina in november 2006 ahtisaari himself said two-thirds of his recommendations address the safety of serbs in kosovo alone .
serbs in kosovo , for their part , say ahtisaari 's plan is unfair because it treats all minorities in the region alike .
that would mean that the serbs - the largest minority in kosovo - should have more rights than , say , the roma or ashkali groups . it certainly is a major boost for the serbian minority in kosovo that ahtisaari has addressed the situation of their equality to such an extent .
of course , other minorities have also demanded the same rights as the serbian minority , although kosovo 's institutions have integrated these into their democratic processes .
that is why those parts of the plan addressing the safety of the serbian minority are based on international norms and standards .
there are even aspects which go well beyond normal international standards . bekim shehu interviewed fatmir sejdiu -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de serbia rejects un plan for kosovo serbia 's newly elected parliament has overwhelmingly voted against a un plan on the future of its breakaway province of kosovo as a violation of the country 's territorial integrity .

she 's now under police protection after members received death threats . earlier this month , iran-born human rights activist mina ahadi founded the central council of ex-muslims , in the western-german city of cologne .
ahadi told the german news magazine focus : " i happened to be born in a muslim family , and i have decided not to be a muslim . "
that was the motivation for forming the group , whose members consists of some three dozen people who have turned their back on the religion .
ahadi 's decision to form the group is a controversial one considering that in most strictly islamic countries such as iran , saudi arabia , afghanistan , pakistan , sudan und mauritania , a muslim who rejects his or her religion faces the death sentence in accordance with the sharia law . other countries may not try apostates in a court of law , but they may be ostracized instead .
the topic is also sensitive in europe . an official renunciation of islam is almost unheard of .
death threats on the internet the name of ahadi 's group is also a play on the central council of muslims -lrb- zmd -rrb- , one of germany 's best-known umbrella muslim groups , also based in cologne .
the zmd is said to have around 800,00 members according to its own estimates .
ahadi , an exiled iranian living in germany , decided it was time to shine a light on the subject of born-muslims living in europe who do not want to be part of islam .
the aim of her organization , ahadi said , is to offer former muslims a voice in a country that is not represented by official muslim organizations , she told focus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green mp deligöz wanted to get rid of headscarves - and wound up with police protection but since the group 's formation , she told the magazine , she has been " terrorized . "
members of the group have gotten death threats via the internet .
about a week ago , the police approached ahadi and offered her protection .
the affair has echoes of another recent case in germany where green party politician ekin deligöz , who in october called for muslim women and girls to stop wearing head scarves , was also placed under police protection after receiving threats . at the same time ahadi is well aware of the taboos she is breaking with the founding of her group .
she said she could imagine " that there would be calls for a fatwa against us .
our project may also be discussed in the arab world . " in the coming week , members of the central council of ex-muslims have said they plan to hold a press conference to introduce the group to the public at large .
their slogan : " we have renounced . " defense for the secular ahadi told focus she is hoping the group can offer oppressed women a way to freedom , and defend secular people who live in germany and are integrated in the society here . " we want to improve society , to make it possible for us to get along better .
i hope for more peace , " the magazine quoted her as saying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european mp özdemir : looking for diverse images of islam in germany cem özdemir , a green politician fom germany with turkish roots at the european parliament told der spiegel magazine that ahadi 's project and the greens had something in common : both are hoping to expand the variety of images of islam in germany . " we have to understand , and deal with , the fact that 3.5 million muslims in germany are extremely heterogeneous .
some of them don ’ t have anything to do with religion , and do n't identify themselves as muslim , even if they were born to muslim families . still , özdemir told the magazine he did n't think the new group would attract many adherents . " openly admitting atheism is rather unusual among muslims , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " ' it is okay to be both turkish and german " ekin deligöz made waves when she called for turkish women to take off their headscarves .

he could reject prodi 's resignation and ask him to seek a vote of confidence in parliament , or give him a mandate to form a new government . alternatively , he could give the mandate to a different center-left leader or an institutional figure .
a final option , seen as less likely at present , would be to call fresh elections that would take place in the spring . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi 's government lost a key vote over foreign policy in a drama reminiscent of italian politics of the 1980s and 1990s when governments sometimes lasted less than a week , prodi stepped down on wednesday , just nine months after assuming office , after he lost a key vote in parliament 's upper house over his government 's foreign policy .
the center-left government was forced onto the defensive over the deployment of 2,000 troops in afghanistan and the enlargement of a us military base in northern italy . both are policies most opposed by far-left parties within prodi 's coalition . opposition called for prodi 's resignation but it is the conservative opposition , led by silvio berlusconi , who was narrowly forced out of the prime minister 's office by prodi in an election last april , who led calls for prodi to go . right wing senators shouted " resign ! resign ! " after the result of the vote in the italian senate was announced .
prodi should " tender his resignation immediately , " declared berlusconi . the government needed 160 votes in the senate debate to get a formal motion of support .
but only 158 senators voted in favor and 136 opposed the government .

several left-wing senators were reportedly absent from the upper chamber . though it was not a formal vote of confidence , foreign minister massimo d 'alema said tuesday that the government would " go home " if it lost . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tide of public opinion can turn quickly , and brutally " it is a grave , serious and worrying fact to not obtain a majority for the speech of a foreign minister , " acknowledged vannino chiti , the minister for relations with parliament . immediately after , prodi held a crisis meeting with d 'alema , defence minister arturo parisi and deputy prime minister francesco rutelli . he then tendered his resignation to the president .
napolitano , who rushed back to rome from a visit to the provinces , said in a statement that he " reserves his decision " on the future of the government . under pressure over afghanistan d 'alema had to defend italy 's military mission in afghanistan to senators before the vote .
italy currently has around 2,000 troops deployed in the country as part of a nato-led peacekeeping mission . " it 's not a nato mission , but a united nations mission in which nato has an important military function , " d 'alema told the parliament . " it is a political and civil mission . "
the afghanistan deployment and the enlargement of the us base at vicenza in northern italy are both strongly opposed by the greens and communists who are part of a ruling coalition which also includes liberal and roman catholic parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters at a demonstration against the expansion of a us military base in vicenza more than 80,000 people took part in a rally last saturday in vicenza against the base enlargement . d 'alema said that to go back on the approval for the base that the prime minister gave last month for the base enlargement would be a " hostile act " toward the united states . no stranger to controversy prodi 's union coalition narrowly won an election in april last year that ended berlusconi 's five year-old government - one of the longest in recent italian political history . prodi is no stranger to the dangers of running italian governments . he resigned as prime minister in 1997 and 1998 when leading governments .

napolitano 's flurry of meetings thursday were to continue friday , consulting with the speakers of the two houses of parliament , the heads of parliamentary groups and the presidents who preceded him . prodi , head of italy 's 61st government since world war ii , was also prime minister for two years and five months in 1996-98 , falling when communists withdrew their support . possible reinstatement napolitano is widely expected to rename prodi as prime minister .
but he also has the option of choosing a new government leader from the center-left coalition , appointing a technocrat government or dissolving parliament and calling new elections . while fresh elections are considered unlikely , the economic daily il sole 24 ore warned thursday against prodi 's simple reinstatement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's president giorgio napolitano is scrambling for a new government " experience shows that -lrb- such -rrb- governments are always mediocre , especially when the differences that brought about the crisis are not resolved , " it said in an editorial . and franco pavoncello of rome 's john cabot university said it was " highly improbable " that napolitano would call an election after the current round of consultations . foreign policy trip-up " i do n't think it will happen , " he told german news agency dpa .
" italy needs to change its electoral system first and ensure that the new law produces more stable governments in the future , " pavoncello said . gianfranco pasquino of john hopkins university told sky italia television he expected the president would ask prodi to stay on , but only after ensuring " he has a workable majority " in the senate . prodi stepped down on wednesday , just nine months after he assumed office , after losing a key vote in parliament 's upper house over his government 's foreign policy . a government-sponsored motion received just 158 votes in favor , two short of the required majority of 160 .
a total of 136 lawmakers voted against and 24 , including two far-left dissidents , abstained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's foreign policy proved prodi 's undoing the two communist senators in prodi 's coalition , who are staunchly opposed to the planned enlargement of a us military base in northern italy , tipped the balance with their crucial " no " votes . giovanni sartori , one of italy 's leading constitutional experts , said the president could decide to form an " institutional " or " technocrat " government backed by an enlarged majority . " the last thing to do would be to go to the polls , " sartori told sky italia . berlusconi law prodi assumed office in may of last year after defeating silvio berlusconi in april 's general election , the closest in modern italian history . a convoluted electoral law approved by berlusconi in the final weeks of the past legislature ensured that a future government would be guaranteed a comfortable majority in the chamber of deputies , but not in the senate . prodi had been commanding a wafer-thin majority in the upper house and lost wednesday 's vote because two far-left dissident lawmakers refused to back it in disagreement at italy 's peacekeeping mission in afghanistan . napolitano began his round of consultations by meeting the presidents of the two branches of parliament , fausto bertinotti and franco marini , ahead of talks with former italian presidents and party leaders friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did prodi 's departure open the door for berlusconi , again ?
berlusconi , who leads prodi in latest opinion polls , wednesday called for fresh elections . searching for alternatives but many of his center-right allies were thursday conceding that napolitano would explore alternative solutions to the crisis first . " we would like elections , but our alternative is to find a transitional solution to solve the big problems facing the country , " said renato schifani , a whip in berlusconi 's forza italia party . the catholic udc , a small but influential opposition party that has been distancing itself from berlusconi since last year 's election defeat , has said it may decide to join a new government , but only if there is " discontinuity " with the previous administration . all of the nine center-left ruling parties have indicated that they want prodi to stay on as premier . napolitano was expected to make a decision on prodi 's future on friday evening or saturday at the latest . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italian president looks for post-prodi direction italy 's president was to consult with party and government leaders on the future of the government thursday , following the resignation of prime minister romano prodi wednesday .

she 's now under police protection after members received death threats . earlier this month , iran-born human rights activist mina ahadi founded the central council of ex-muslims , in the western-german city of cologne .
ahadi told the german news magazine focus : " i happened to be born in a muslim family , and i have decided not to be a muslim . "
that was the motivation for forming the group , whose members consists of some three dozen people who have turned their back on the religion .
ahadi 's decision to form the group is a controversial one considering that in most strictly islamic countries such as iran , saudi arabia , afghanistan , pakistan , sudan und mauritania , a muslim who rejects his or her religion faces the death sentence in accordance with the sharia law . other countries may not try apostates in a court of law , but they may be ostracized instead .

she 's now under police protection after members received death threats . earlier this month , iran-born human rights activist mina ahadi founded the central council of ex-muslims , in the western-german city of cologne .
ahadi told the german news magazine focus : " i happened to be born in a muslim family , and i have decided not to be a muslim . "
that was the motivation for forming the group , whose members consists of some three dozen people who have turned their back on the religion .
ahadi 's decision to form the group is a controversial one considering that in most strictly islamic countries such as iran , saudi arabia , afghanistan , pakistan , sudan und mauritania , a muslim who rejects his or her religion faces the death sentence in accordance with the sharia law . other countries may not try apostates in a court of law , but they may be ostracized instead .

it stops short of granting full independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un envoy martti ahtisaari under the envoy 's plan , kosovo 's government would be overseen by a new european union-led mission which would take over from the un , which has administered the province since the end of the kosovo war in 1999 . as a final round of talks , expected to last into march , got underway in vienna on the un blueprint , dw-world.de spoke with fatmir sejdiu , president of kosovo , about the fate of the region . dw-world.de : mr. president , violence has increased in kosovo this month .
two people were killed on february 10 during outbreaks . this week , there was a bomb attack on united nations vehicles in pristina .
are the negotiations failing ? fatmir sejdiu : these developments are not helping the situation in kosovo - it 's been a dark day for kosovo since the outbursts occurred .
they have been violent protests and it was absolutely unnecessary for those two people to die . not only do the deaths mean a major loss for the families .
the severity of the attacks has a very negative effect on kosovo 's prospects .
it damages the political processes . of course , everyone has the right to protest and express his or her opinions , but it 's essential that this occurs within the framework of the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo president fatmir sejdiu i believe kosovo 's negotiating group has done its job .
we have clearly represented kosovo 's interests at all of the meetings in vienna , and it 's true that we have reached a consensus in all of our decisions .
this shows that we have represented the absolute majority of kosovo 's population and its institutions . before the talks in vienna began , kosovo 's negotiating group presented a list of contentious points .
do you believe that un special envoy ahtisaari 's scheme can still be altered during the negotiations ? perhaps .
there surely wo n't be any more major changes , but it could be that arguments we have presented will be integrated in some way .
we 'll have to wait and see .
however , we do not want to start debating ahtisaari 's recommendations all over again .
that would just mean an endless round of discussions which would n't go anywhere , other than putting kosovo at further risk .
it would jeopardize its future . i would like to point out that it 's essential that the un security council keep track of this process ; it 's that group which will hear the recommendations for the future of kosovo .
the political formulations and kosovo 's independence are central here . the serbian negotiating delegation has demanded that ahtisaari 's plan be divided into technical and political sections .
what 's your opinion on that ? i think belgrade 's interest during the discussions in vienna is prolonging them as much as possible , thereby discrediting them .
that would increase the tensions in kosovo - with the aim of trying to show that kosovo is not yet ready for independence , that it 's unstable , that it offers no prospects for its citizens , and especially , for its serbian citizens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were also demonstrations in pristina in november 2006 ahtisaari himself said two-thirds of his recommendations address the safety of serbs in kosovo alone .
serbs in kosovo , for their part , say ahtisaari 's plan is unfair because it treats all minorities in the region alike .
that would mean that the serbs - the largest minority in kosovo - should have more rights than , say , the roma or ashkali groups . it certainly is a major boost for the serbian minority in kosovo that ahtisaari has addressed the situation of their equality to such an extent .
of course , other minorities have also demanded the same rights as the serbian minority , although kosovo 's institutions have integrated these into their democratic processes .
that is why those parts of the plan addressing the safety of the serbian minority are based on international norms and standards .
there are even aspects which go well beyond normal international standards . bekim shehu interviewed fatmir sejdiu -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de serbia rejects un plan for kosovo serbia 's newly elected parliament has overwhelmingly voted against a un plan on the future of its breakaway province of kosovo as a violation of the country 's territorial integrity .

she 's now under police protection after members received death threats . earlier this month , iran-born human rights activist mina ahadi founded the central council of ex-muslims , in the western-german city of cologne .
ahadi told the german news magazine focus : " i happened to be born in a muslim family , and i have decided not to be a muslim . "
that was the motivation for forming the group , whose members consists of some three dozen people who have turned their back on the religion .
ahadi 's decision to form the group is a controversial one considering that in most strictly islamic countries such as iran , saudi arabia , afghanistan , pakistan , sudan und mauritania , a muslim who rejects his or her religion faces the death sentence in accordance with the sharia law . other countries may not try apostates in a court of law , but they may be ostracized instead .
the topic is also sensitive in europe . an official renunciation of islam is almost unheard of .
death threats on the internet the name of ahadi 's group is also a play on the central council of muslims -lrb- zmd -rrb- , one of germany 's best-known umbrella muslim groups , also based in cologne .
the zmd is said to have around 800,00 members according to its own estimates .
ahadi , an exiled iranian living in germany , decided it was time to shine a light on the subject of born-muslims living in europe who do not want to be part of islam .
the aim of her organization , ahadi said , is to offer former muslims a voice in a country that is not represented by official muslim organizations , she told focus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green mp deligöz wanted to get rid of headscarves - and wound up with police protection but since the group 's formation , she told the magazine , she has been " terrorized . "
members of the group have gotten death threats via the internet .
about a week ago , the police approached ahadi and offered her protection .
the affair has echoes of another recent case in germany where green party politician ekin deligöz , who in october called for muslim women and girls to stop wearing head scarves , was also placed under police protection after receiving threats . at the same time ahadi is well aware of the taboos she is breaking with the founding of her group .
she said she could imagine " that there would be calls for a fatwa against us .
our project may also be discussed in the arab world . " in the coming week , members of the central council of ex-muslims have said they plan to hold a press conference to introduce the group to the public at large .
their slogan : " we have renounced . " defense for the secular ahadi told focus she is hoping the group can offer oppressed women a way to freedom , and defend secular people who live in germany and are integrated in the society here . " we want to improve society , to make it possible for us to get along better .
i hope for more peace , " the magazine quoted her as saying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european mp özdemir : looking for diverse images of islam in germany cem özdemir , a green politician fom germany with turkish roots at the european parliament told der spiegel magazine that ahadi 's project and the greens had something in common : both are hoping to expand the variety of images of islam in germany . " we have to understand , and deal with , the fact that 3.5 million muslims in germany are extremely heterogeneous .
some of them don ’ t have anything to do with religion , and do n't identify themselves as muslim , even if they were born to muslim families . still , özdemir told the magazine he did n't think the new group would attract many adherents . " openly admitting atheism is rather unusual among muslims , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " ' it is okay to be both turkish and german " ekin deligöz made waves when she called for turkish women to take off their headscarves .

' shocked and stunned ' for the february issue of youth and lifestyle glossy u _ mag , writer volker sievert sat down to chat with up-and-coming starlet hannah herzsprung .
but after providing the actress with the agreed-upon transcript of the interview , he said he was " shocked and stunned " when her final version came back . so much of the text had been excised that it looked more like it had been attacked by wartime censors than simply vetted for errors or slips of the tongue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the editors of u _ mag decided to show readers how modern media works " i really felt like i had been censored , " sievert wrote in an e-mail .
" i could n't understand this massive interference in the least . " as a result of herzsprung 's changes , sievert wrote , the interview was " almost grotesquely disfigured . "
the end result is " something that resembles a self-promotional text more than a lively , vital interview , " he added . cozy relationship u _ mag 's response ?
print the interview in full - heavily blacked-out sections included . " we felt used , " sievert said .
" we decided to print the interview with the crossed out sections , to give our readers a look into the modern media landscape . " the event caused a stir in the german media and awoke a sleeping discussion on what some say is an overly-cozy relationship between the german press and public figures . " journalists are not legally required to have interview partners authorize their statements . … but unfortunately in germany , that has almost become common practice , " said hendrik zörner , spokesman for the german journalists ' association -lrb- djv -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der spiegel is known for letting subjects alter interviews , one commentator said big-name papers tend to " follow clearer journalistic practices , " while the smaller , local outlets that make up the majority of papers in the country , " might have to deal with certain interview partners more frequently , " and so are more likely to allow sources to sign off on interviews , zörner said . " this leads to the practice that looks a little like mutual back-scratching , " he added . good for everyone ? but ingrid kolb , director of the henri nannen school for journalism in hamburg , said some of the country 's biggest media outlets - for instance , renowned news magazines der spiegel and stern - are noted for the practice . " the long interviews that der spiegel publishes with famous public figures , their so-called talks , are known for this , " kolb said .

' shocked and stunned ' for the february issue of youth and lifestyle glossy u _ mag , writer volker sievert sat down to chat with up-and-coming starlet hannah herzsprung .
but after providing the actress with the agreed-upon transcript of the interview , he said he was " shocked and stunned " when her final version came back . so much of the text had been excised that it looked more like it had been attacked by wartime censors than simply vetted for errors or slips of the tongue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the editors of u _ mag decided to show readers how modern media works " i really felt like i had been censored , " sievert wrote in an e-mail .

" journalists are not legally required to have interview partners authorize their statements . … but unfortunately in germany , that has almost become common practice , " said hendrik zörner , spokesman for the german journalists ' association -lrb- djv -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der spiegel is known for letting subjects alter interviews , one commentator said big-name papers tend to " follow clearer journalistic practices , " while the smaller , local outlets that make up the majority of papers in the country , " might have to deal with certain interview partners more frequently , " and so are more likely to allow sources to sign off on interviews , zörner said .

she 's now under police protection after members received death threats . earlier this month , iran-born human rights activist mina ahadi founded the central council of ex-muslims , in the western-german city of cologne .
ahadi told the german news magazine focus : " i happened to be born in a muslim family , and i have decided not to be a muslim . "
that was the motivation for forming the group , whose members consists of some three dozen people who have turned their back on the religion .
ahadi 's decision to form the group is a controversial one considering that in most strictly islamic countries such as iran , saudi arabia , afghanistan , pakistan , sudan und mauritania , a muslim who rejects his or her religion faces the death sentence in accordance with the sharia law . other countries may not try apostates in a court of law , but they may be ostracized instead .
the topic is also sensitive in europe . an official renunciation of islam is almost unheard of .
death threats on the internet the name of ahadi 's group is also a play on the central council of muslims -lrb- zmd -rrb- , one of germany 's best-known umbrella muslim groups , also based in cologne .
the zmd is said to have around 800,00 members according to its own estimates .
ahadi , an exiled iranian living in germany , decided it was time to shine a light on the subject of born-muslims living in europe who do not want to be part of islam .
the aim of her organization , ahadi said , is to offer former muslims a voice in a country that is not represented by official muslim organizations , she told focus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green mp deligöz wanted to get rid of headscarves - and wound up with police protection but since the group 's formation , she told the magazine , she has been " terrorized . "
members of the group have gotten death threats via the internet .
about a week ago , the police approached ahadi and offered her protection .
the affair has echoes of another recent case in germany where green party politician ekin deligöz , who in october called for muslim women and girls to stop wearing head scarves , was also placed under police protection after receiving threats . at the same time ahadi is well aware of the taboos she is breaking with the founding of her group .
she said she could imagine " that there would be calls for a fatwa against us .
our project may also be discussed in the arab world . " in the coming week , members of the central council of ex-muslims have said they plan to hold a press conference to introduce the group to the public at large .
their slogan : " we have renounced . " defense for the secular ahadi told focus she is hoping the group can offer oppressed women a way to freedom , and defend secular people who live in germany and are integrated in the society here . " we want to improve society , to make it possible for us to get along better .
i hope for more peace , " the magazine quoted her as saying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european mp özdemir : looking for diverse images of islam in germany cem özdemir , a green politician fom germany with turkish roots at the european parliament told der spiegel magazine that ahadi 's project and the greens had something in common : both are hoping to expand the variety of images of islam in germany . " we have to understand , and deal with , the fact that 3.5 million muslims in germany are extremely heterogeneous .
some of them don ’ t have anything to do with religion , and do n't identify themselves as muslim , even if they were born to muslim families . still , özdemir told the magazine he did n't think the new group would attract many adherents . " openly admitting atheism is rather unusual among muslims , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " ' it is okay to be both turkish and german " ekin deligöz made waves when she called for turkish women to take off their headscarves .

it stops short of granting full independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un envoy martti ahtisaari under the envoy 's plan , kosovo 's government would be overseen by a new european union-led mission which would take over from the un , which has administered the province since the end of the kosovo war in 1999 . as a final round of talks , expected to last into march , got underway in vienna on the un blueprint , dw-world.de spoke with fatmir sejdiu , president of kosovo , about the fate of the region . dw-world.de : mr. president , violence has increased in kosovo this month .
two people were killed on february 10 during outbreaks . this week , there was a bomb attack on united nations vehicles in pristina .
are the negotiations failing ? fatmir sejdiu : these developments are not helping the situation in kosovo - it 's been a dark day for kosovo since the outbursts occurred .
they have been violent protests and it was absolutely unnecessary for those two people to die . not only do the deaths mean a major loss for the families .
the severity of the attacks has a very negative effect on kosovo 's prospects .
it damages the political processes . of course , everyone has the right to protest and express his or her opinions , but it 's essential that this occurs within the framework of the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo president fatmir sejdiu i believe kosovo 's negotiating group has done its job .
we have clearly represented kosovo 's interests at all of the meetings in vienna , and it 's true that we have reached a consensus in all of our decisions .
this shows that we have represented the absolute majority of kosovo 's population and its institutions . before the talks in vienna began , kosovo 's negotiating group presented a list of contentious points .
do you believe that un special envoy ahtisaari 's scheme can still be altered during the negotiations ? perhaps .
there surely wo n't be any more major changes , but it could be that arguments we have presented will be integrated in some way .
we 'll have to wait and see .
however , we do not want to start debating ahtisaari 's recommendations all over again .
that would just mean an endless round of discussions which would n't go anywhere , other than putting kosovo at further risk .
it would jeopardize its future . i would like to point out that it 's essential that the un security council keep track of this process ; it 's that group which will hear the recommendations for the future of kosovo .
the political formulations and kosovo 's independence are central here . the serbian negotiating delegation has demanded that ahtisaari 's plan be divided into technical and political sections .
what 's your opinion on that ? i think belgrade 's interest during the discussions in vienna is prolonging them as much as possible , thereby discrediting them .
that would increase the tensions in kosovo - with the aim of trying to show that kosovo is not yet ready for independence , that it 's unstable , that it offers no prospects for its citizens , and especially , for its serbian citizens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were also demonstrations in pristina in november 2006 ahtisaari himself said two-thirds of his recommendations address the safety of serbs in kosovo alone .
serbs in kosovo , for their part , say ahtisaari 's plan is unfair because it treats all minorities in the region alike .
that would mean that the serbs - the largest minority in kosovo - should have more rights than , say , the roma or ashkali groups . it certainly is a major boost for the serbian minority in kosovo that ahtisaari has addressed the situation of their equality to such an extent .
of course , other minorities have also demanded the same rights as the serbian minority , although kosovo 's institutions have integrated these into their democratic processes .
that is why those parts of the plan addressing the safety of the serbian minority are based on international norms and standards .
there are even aspects which go well beyond normal international standards . bekim shehu interviewed fatmir sejdiu -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de serbia rejects un plan for kosovo serbia 's newly elected parliament has overwhelmingly voted against a un plan on the future of its breakaway province of kosovo as a violation of the country 's territorial integrity .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 22.02.2007 germany to back ban on cluster bombs at conference großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cluster bombs were also dropped by nato during the kosovo war in 1999 the norwegian government is hosting a meeting thursday on cluster munitions .
oslo considers un talks on the issue last year a failure and hopes to launch efforts for an international ban backed by germany . representatives from over 40 countries and international organizations are gathering in oslo on thursday and friday to discuss ways to outlaw cluster bombs .
norway and other nations in favor of a ban are being hampered by nations that oppose one . the scandinavian country hopes the two-day meeting , which will be attended by senior ministry officials from around the world , will be the start of a process that will ultimately lead to the adoption of an international ban - even without the support of some key countries , such as opponents britain and the united states . " it is better that the like-minded -lrb- pro-ban -rrb- nations work in the same direction , " said raymond johansen , norway 's state secretary of foreign affairs .
he said that an international accord would put pressure on anti-ban nations to eventually comply . the pro-ban countries expected to be represented include norway , sweden , germany , mozambique and angola .
on the other side , britain , canada , france , china , india and russia belong to those opposed .
the united states , which is also opposed , will not be in attendance . several un organizations will also attend , as well as the cluster munition coalition -lrb- cmc -rrb- , the umbrella organization grouping non-governmental organizations campaigning for a ban . " it 's a double whammy . " a cluster bomb consists of a container holding up to hundreds of smaller so-called bomblets .
it opens in mid-air and disperses these grenades over a large area .
cluster munitions are stockpiled by most countries ' armies and have often been used in the past 40 years , most recently during the war in lebanon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demining unexploded cluster bombs in lebanon is dangerous work opponents of cluster munitions consider these weapons an unacceptable danger to civilians . " it 's a double whammy , " said cmc 's co-chairman steve goose .
" at the time of the attack , the bomblets spread over a large area and they can not be guided .
a large number of them do not explode upon impact , and so they can kill years later . "
he said that cluster bombs disproportionately target civilians . " cluster munitions caused more civilian casualties during the -lrb- last -rrb- iraq war and in kosovo than any other type of weapon , " goose said . proponents of a ban argue that a prohibition is achievable .
they point to the 1997 mine ban treaty that banned the production , stockpiling and use of anti-personnel landmines - also the result of a norwegian initiative . " the landmine treaty created a powerful standard , " goose said .
" we think the same can happen with cluster munitions . " can a ban influence the right countries ? some experts remain cautious about a ban , though . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unexploded cluster munitions threaten civilians even after a conflict is over " the worry is that , with cluster munitions , it will be a treaty binding those who are already in agreement , but wo n't touch those countries that are affected by them , or manufacture them , " said nicholas sims , an expert on arms limitation at the london school of economics and political science . that fear is compounded by the fact that the united states , russia , china , britain and france - the five permanent members of the un security council - are against an international ban on cluster munitions . another source of concern touches the scope of the ban .
non-governmental organizations are calling for a comprehensive ban on the production , stockpiling and use of all types of cluster munitions .
however , even a pro-ban nation like norway has suggested that a ban could exclude certain types of cluster munitions , such as those that self-destruct on impact . the norwegian government decided to host the conference , as it considered the latest un talks on the issue , held in geneva in november , a failure . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court considers national accountability in foreign missions a kosovo man whose son was killed by a nato cluster bomb took france to europe 's top human rights court wednesday over the boy 's death .

she 's now under police protection after members received death threats . earlier this month , iran-born human rights activist mina ahadi founded the central council of ex-muslims , in the western-german city of cologne .
ahadi told the german news magazine focus : " i happened to be born in a muslim family , and i have decided not to be a muslim . "
that was the motivation for forming the group , whose members consists of some three dozen people who have turned their back on the religion .
ahadi 's decision to form the group is a controversial one considering that in most strictly islamic countries such as iran , saudi arabia , afghanistan , pakistan , sudan und mauritania , a muslim who rejects his or her religion faces the death sentence in accordance with the sharia law . other countries may not try apostates in a court of law , but they may be ostracized instead .
the topic is also sensitive in europe . an official renunciation of islam is almost unheard of .
death threats on the internet the name of ahadi 's group is also a play on the central council of muslims -lrb- zmd -rrb- , one of germany 's best-known umbrella muslim groups , also based in cologne .
the zmd is said to have around 800,00 members according to its own estimates .
ahadi , an exiled iranian living in germany , decided it was time to shine a light on the subject of born-muslims living in europe who do not want to be part of islam .
the aim of her organization , ahadi said , is to offer former muslims a voice in a country that is not represented by official muslim organizations , she told focus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green mp deligöz wanted to get rid of headscarves - and wound up with police protection but since the group 's formation , she told the magazine , she has been " terrorized . "
members of the group have gotten death threats via the internet .
about a week ago , the police approached ahadi and offered her protection .
the affair has echoes of another recent case in germany where green party politician ekin deligöz , who in october called for muslim women and girls to stop wearing head scarves , was also placed under police protection after receiving threats . at the same time ahadi is well aware of the taboos she is breaking with the founding of her group .
she said she could imagine " that there would be calls for a fatwa against us .
our project may also be discussed in the arab world . " in the coming week , members of the central council of ex-muslims have said they plan to hold a press conference to introduce the group to the public at large .
their slogan : " we have renounced . " defense for the secular ahadi told focus she is hoping the group can offer oppressed women a way to freedom , and defend secular people who live in germany and are integrated in the society here . " we want to improve society , to make it possible for us to get along better .
i hope for more peace , " the magazine quoted her as saying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european mp özdemir : looking for diverse images of islam in germany cem özdemir , a green politician fom germany with turkish roots at the european parliament told der spiegel magazine that ahadi 's project and the greens had something in common : both are hoping to expand the variety of images of islam in germany . " we have to understand , and deal with , the fact that 3.5 million muslims in germany are extremely heterogeneous .
some of them don ’ t have anything to do with religion , and do n't identify themselves as muslim , even if they were born to muslim families . still , özdemir told the magazine he did n't think the new group would attract many adherents .

it stops short of granting full independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un envoy martti ahtisaari under the envoy 's plan , kosovo 's government would be overseen by a new european union-led mission which would take over from the un , which has administered the province since the end of the kosovo war in 1999 . as a final round of talks , expected to last into march , got underway in vienna on the un blueprint , dw-world.de spoke with fatmir sejdiu , president of kosovo , about the fate of the region . dw-world.de : mr. president , violence has increased in kosovo this month .
two people were killed on february 10 during outbreaks . this week , there was a bomb attack on united nations vehicles in pristina .
are the negotiations failing ? fatmir sejdiu : these developments are not helping the situation in kosovo - it 's been a dark day for kosovo since the outbursts occurred .
they have been violent protests and it was absolutely unnecessary for those two people to die . not only do the deaths mean a major loss for the families .
the severity of the attacks has a very negative effect on kosovo 's prospects .
it damages the political processes . of course , everyone has the right to protest and express his or her opinions , but it 's essential that this occurs within the framework of the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo president fatmir sejdiu i believe kosovo 's negotiating group has done its job .
we have clearly represented kosovo 's interests at all of the meetings in vienna , and it 's true that we have reached a consensus in all of our decisions .
this shows that we have represented the absolute majority of kosovo 's population and its institutions . before the talks in vienna began , kosovo 's negotiating group presented a list of contentious points .
do you believe that un special envoy ahtisaari 's scheme can still be altered during the negotiations ? perhaps .
there surely wo n't be any more major changes , but it could be that arguments we have presented will be integrated in some way .
we 'll have to wait and see .
however , we do not want to start debating ahtisaari 's recommendations all over again .
that would just mean an endless round of discussions which would n't go anywhere , other than putting kosovo at further risk .
it would jeopardize its future . i would like to point out that it 's essential that the un security council keep track of this process ; it 's that group which will hear the recommendations for the future of kosovo .
the political formulations and kosovo 's independence are central here . the serbian negotiating delegation has demanded that ahtisaari 's plan be divided into technical and political sections .
what 's your opinion on that ? i think belgrade 's interest during the discussions in vienna is prolonging them as much as possible , thereby discrediting them .
that would increase the tensions in kosovo - with the aim of trying to show that kosovo is not yet ready for independence , that it 's unstable , that it offers no prospects for its citizens , and especially , for its serbian citizens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were also demonstrations in pristina in november 2006 ahtisaari himself said two-thirds of his recommendations address the safety of serbs in kosovo alone .
serbs in kosovo , for their part , say ahtisaari 's plan is unfair because it treats all minorities in the region alike .
that would mean that the serbs - the largest minority in kosovo - should have more rights than , say , the roma or ashkali groups . it certainly is a major boost for the serbian minority in kosovo that ahtisaari has addressed the situation of their equality to such an extent .
of course , other minorities have also demanded the same rights as the serbian minority , although kosovo 's institutions have integrated these into their democratic processes .
that is why those parts of the plan addressing the safety of the serbian minority are based on international norms and standards .
there are even aspects which go well beyond normal international standards . bekim shehu interviewed fatmir sejdiu -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de serbia rejects un plan for kosovo serbia 's newly elected parliament has overwhelmingly voted against a un plan on the future of its breakaway province of kosovo as a violation of the country 's territorial integrity .

" that begins with regular gifts directly to the desks of the delegates , and goes as far as direct payments for local government events and party meetings . "
" beyond that the delegates are invited regularly to meetings of the tobacco industry , the agendas of which are disguised by social topics .
until 2006 , the total of direct payments paid to the federal government by the tobacco industry amounts to 11.2 million euros . "
inaction and stalling can not stop ban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hopes of the anti- lobby regularly get trodden on ermer states that there is a network of pro-smoking sympathizers within the political arena in germany and that smokers within the government have an obvious agenda .
" whole parliamentary committees , such as the tourism committee , have been infiltrated by the tobacco lobby , " he added " in addition , the health minister ulla schmidt avoids making clear decisions .
unlike in other european countries , the german health minister doesn ’ t take the leadership in the ban discussion and leaves the demagogues to take the lead . "
despite the power wielded by the pro-lobby , ermer believes that the move towards a smoke-free europe is an irreversible one .
" while the influence in germany is large , the german pro-smoker lobby has only a small influence on europe , " ermer concludes .
" on a european scale , germany is isolated , as the judgment of the european court of justice pointed out with the tobacco advertising ban in 2005 .
only germany complained and lost , " he said .
" the european way into a smokeless future can not be stopped , it can only be slowed down by germany .

it stops short of granting full independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un envoy martti ahtisaari under the envoy 's plan , kosovo 's government would be overseen by a new european union-led mission which would take over from the un , which has administered the province since the end of the kosovo war in 1999 . as a final round of talks , expected to last into march , got underway in vienna on the un blueprint , dw-world.de spoke with fatmir sejdiu , president of kosovo , about the fate of the region . dw-world.de : mr. president , violence has increased in kosovo this month .
two people were killed on february 10 during outbreaks . this week , there was a bomb attack on united nations vehicles in pristina .
are the negotiations failing ? fatmir sejdiu : these developments are not helping the situation in kosovo - it 's been a dark day for kosovo since the outbursts occurred .
they have been violent protests and it was absolutely unnecessary for those two people to die . not only do the deaths mean a major loss for the families .
the severity of the attacks has a very negative effect on kosovo 's prospects .
it damages the political processes . of course , everyone has the right to protest and express his or her opinions , but it 's essential that this occurs within the framework of the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo president fatmir sejdiu i believe kosovo 's negotiating group has done its job .
we have clearly represented kosovo 's interests at all of the meetings in vienna , and it 's true that we have reached a consensus in all of our decisions .
this shows that we have represented the absolute majority of kosovo 's population and its institutions . before the talks in vienna began , kosovo 's negotiating group presented a list of contentious points .
do you believe that un special envoy ahtisaari 's scheme can still be altered during the negotiations ? perhaps .
there surely wo n't be any more major changes , but it could be that arguments we have presented will be integrated in some way .
we 'll have to wait and see .
however , we do not want to start debating ahtisaari 's recommendations all over again .
that would just mean an endless round of discussions which would n't go anywhere , other than putting kosovo at further risk .
it would jeopardize its future . i would like to point out that it 's essential that the un security council keep track of this process ; it 's that group which will hear the recommendations for the future of kosovo .

it stops short of granting full independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un envoy martti ahtisaari under the envoy 's plan , kosovo 's government would be overseen by a new european union-led mission which would take over from the un , which has administered the province since the end of the kosovo war in 1999 . as a final round of talks , expected to last into march , got underway in vienna on the un blueprint , dw-world.de spoke with fatmir sejdiu , president of kosovo , about the fate of the region . dw-world.de : mr. president , violence has increased in kosovo this month .
two people were killed on february 10 during outbreaks . this week , there was a bomb attack on united nations vehicles in pristina .
are the negotiations failing ? fatmir sejdiu : these developments are not helping the situation in kosovo - it 's been a dark day for kosovo since the outbursts occurred .
they have been violent protests and it was absolutely unnecessary for those two people to die . not only do the deaths mean a major loss for the families .
the severity of the attacks has a very negative effect on kosovo 's prospects .
it damages the political processes . of course , everyone has the right to protest and express his or her opinions , but it 's essential that this occurs within the framework of the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo president fatmir sejdiu i believe kosovo 's negotiating group has done its job .
we have clearly represented kosovo 's interests at all of the meetings in vienna , and it 's true that we have reached a consensus in all of our decisions .
this shows that we have represented the absolute majority of kosovo 's population and its institutions . before the talks in vienna began , kosovo 's negotiating group presented a list of contentious points .
do you believe that un special envoy ahtisaari 's scheme can still be altered during the negotiations ? perhaps .
there surely wo n't be any more major changes , but it could be that arguments we have presented will be integrated in some way .
we 'll have to wait and see .
however , we do not want to start debating ahtisaari 's recommendations all over again .
that would just mean an endless round of discussions which would n't go anywhere , other than putting kosovo at further risk .
it would jeopardize its future . i would like to point out that it 's essential that the un security council keep track of this process ; it 's that group which will hear the recommendations for the future of kosovo .
the political formulations and kosovo 's independence are central here . the serbian negotiating delegation has demanded that ahtisaari 's plan be divided into technical and political sections .
what 's your opinion on that ? i think belgrade 's interest during the discussions in vienna is prolonging them as much as possible , thereby discrediting them .

oslo considers un talks on the issue last year a failure and hopes to launch efforts for an international ban backed by germany . representatives from over 40 countries and international organizations are gathering in oslo on thursday and friday to discuss ways to outlaw cluster bombs .
norway and other nations in favor of a ban are being hampered by nations that oppose one . the scandinavian country hopes the two-day meeting , which will be attended by senior ministry officials from around the world , will be the start of a process that will ultimately lead to the adoption of an international ban - even without the support of some key countries , such as opponents britain and the united states . " it is better that the like-minded -lrb- pro-ban -rrb- nations work in the same direction , " said raymond johansen , norway 's state secretary of foreign affairs .
he said that an international accord would put pressure on anti-ban nations to eventually comply . the pro-ban countries expected to be represented include norway , sweden , germany , mozambique and angola .
on the other side , britain , canada , france , china , india and russia belong to those opposed .
the united states , which is also opposed , will not be in attendance . several un organizations will also attend , as well as the cluster munition coalition -lrb- cmc -rrb- , the umbrella organization grouping non-governmental organizations campaigning for a ban . " it 's a double whammy . " a cluster bomb consists of a container holding up to hundreds of smaller so-called bomblets .
it opens in mid-air and disperses these grenades over a large area .
cluster munitions are stockpiled by most countries ' armies and have often been used in the past 40 years , most recently during the war in lebanon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demining unexploded cluster bombs in lebanon is dangerous work opponents of cluster munitions consider these weapons an unacceptable danger to civilians . " it 's a double whammy , " said cmc 's co-chairman steve goose .
" at the time of the attack , the bomblets spread over a large area and they can not be guided .
a large number of them do not explode upon impact , and so they can kill years later . "
he said that cluster bombs disproportionately target civilians . " cluster munitions caused more civilian casualties during the -lrb- last -rrb- iraq war and in kosovo than any other type of weapon , " goose said . proponents of a ban argue that a prohibition is achievable .
they point to the 1997 mine ban treaty that banned the production , stockpiling and use of anti-personnel landmines - also the result of a norwegian initiative . " the landmine treaty created a powerful standard , " goose said .
" we think the same can happen with cluster munitions . " can a ban influence the right countries ? some experts remain cautious about a ban , though . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unexploded cluster munitions threaten civilians even after a conflict is over " the worry is that , with cluster munitions , it will be a treaty binding those who are already in agreement , but wo n't touch those countries that are affected by them , or manufacture them , " said nicholas sims , an expert on arms limitation at the london school of economics and political science . that fear is compounded by the fact that the united states , russia , china , britain and france - the five permanent members of the un security council - are against an international ban on cluster munitions . another source of concern touches the scope of the ban .
non-governmental organizations are calling for a comprehensive ban on the production , stockpiling and use of all types of cluster munitions .
however , even a pro-ban nation like norway has suggested that a ban could exclude certain types of cluster munitions , such as those that self-destruct on impact . the norwegian government decided to host the conference , as it considered the latest un talks on the issue , held in geneva in november , a failure . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court considers national accountability in foreign missions a kosovo man whose son was killed by a nato cluster bomb took france to europe 's top human rights court wednesday over the boy 's death .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 22.02.2007 the power behind the german smoking ban stalemate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's smoke-filled bars and cafes are almost a rarity in western europe as a crucial meeting on protecting non-smokers opens in germany friday , a look at the country 's powerful tobacco lobby offers some clues as to why germany has successfully resisted an outright smoking ban so far . the struggle in germany to agree on a smoking ban continues this week when government ministers convene in hanover on friday to discuss the issue of protection for non-smokers before a state premiers ' debate on march 22 .
the meeting , to be chaired by federal minister for health , ulla schmidt and consumer affairs minister , horst seehofer will be used to further discuss whether smoking in schools , public buildings and most restaurants should be banned by germany 's 16 federal states .
the decision to hand the responsibility for approving the ban to the individual states came after germany 's ruling coalition rescinded the original ban proposal on constitutional grounds in december last year .
the government said an outright federal ban could infringe on individual states ' rights , many of which can not be overridden by berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the states are responsible for issuing bans in public places it is the 16 states , not the federal government , which have power over local government facilities such as schools and hospitals , as well as places such as bars and restaurants - those places where the smoking ban was proposed .
pro-smoking lobbyists pulling the strings ?
the decision was also seen as another example of the german government 's unwillingness to confront the country 's powerful pro-smoking lobby which opposition politicians and anti-smoking campaigners believe holds too much influence over the ruling coalition of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
germany has been slow to follow the lead of those eu states which have already agreed and have implemented their own smoking bans .
france , italy and england have already passed laws that ban smoking in bars and restaurants , as well as public buildings , putting germany out of step with many of its european counterparts .
pressure from the anti-smoking lobby is suspected as being the reason why germany continues to lag behind .
but does the pro- lobby really have that amount of power , that the german government would defy european union directives to satisfy its wishes ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lobbyists are accused of pressuring the government " the pro-smoker lobby is stronger in germany than in any other european country , " siggi ermer , the chairman of pro rauchfrei , the german lobby for non-smokers said . " even the tobacco companies are proud of that fact .
its influence is so strong that pro rauchfrei talks about a tobacco dictatorship in a democratic state .
-lrb- the pro- lobby -rrb- has affected the legislation for decades and crucially has steered the politicians .
" it is so powerful that in the current discussions , the cdu / csu parliamentary group brought in a regulation paper from the german tobacco industry association -lrb- vdc -rrb- and presented it word for word as their own proposal for the negotiations . "
the german tobacco industry association -lrb- vdc -rrb- was unavailable for comment on its involvement in any parliamentary decisions or the extent of its influence over the government .
wolfgang hainer , head of the powerful vdc , who represents the interests of philip morris , british american tobacco , reemtsma and four other tobacco companies in germany recently told german weekly die zeit , " we collect information , channel the opinions of our members and then present the facts to the politicians . " the vdc is also said to organize regular parties at its headquarters in berlin which usually pulls in younger employees from the german ministries and the offices of parliamentarians . no such thing as a free lunch in lobbyists ' eyes germany is an important battleground for the pro-smoking lobby .
it is europe 's biggest tobacco market with about 22 million smokers , which is 27 percent of the population , according to the federal statistics office .
and with more and more eu countries cracking down on smokers , the hearts , minds and lungs of german smokers have become more valuable to the tobacco companies .
for the pro-smoking lobby to retain its advantage , alliances have to be formed with those in power .
" in germany , the tobacco lobby has a strong influence on the politicians , " pro rauchfrei 's ermer says .
" that begins with regular gifts directly to the desks of the delegates , and goes as far as direct payments for local government events and party meetings . "
" beyond that the delegates are invited regularly to meetings of the tobacco industry , the agendas of which are disguised by social topics .
until 2006 , the total of direct payments paid to the federal government by the tobacco industry amounts to 11.2 million euros . "
inaction and stalling can not stop ban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hopes of the anti- lobby regularly get trodden on ermer states that there is a network of pro-smoking sympathizers within the political arena in germany and that smokers within the government have an obvious agenda .
" whole parliamentary committees , such as the tourism committee , have been infiltrated by the tobacco lobby , " he added " in addition , the health minister ulla schmidt avoids making clear decisions .
unlike in other european countries , the german health minister doesn ’ t take the leadership in the ban discussion and leaves the demagogues to take the lead . "
despite the power wielded by the pro-lobby , ermer believes that the move towards a smoke-free europe is an irreversible one .
" while the influence in germany is large , the german pro-smoker lobby has only a small influence on europe , " ermer concludes .
" on a european scale , germany is isolated , as the judgment of the european court of justice pointed out with the tobacco advertising ban in 2005 .
only germany complained and lost , " he said .
" the european way into a smokeless future can not be stopped , it can only be slowed down by germany .

for bavarian leader , it 's same difference großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a german tradition : mixing politics with beer in his last grand speech as bavarian premier , edmund stoiber got a little confused .
or did he ?
after 30 years in politics and countless slips of the tongue , maybe he finally knew what he was doing . jan .
18 , 2007 , will go down in history as germany thought it had gone seriously hard of hearing .
millions of german television viewers cranked up the volume on their tv sets as their jaws dropped collectively in the most unifying moment of national self-awareness since the world cup .
there are unconfirmed reports that bavarian maternity hospitals went practically silent as thousands of babies - inexplicably sensing that something big was happening - stopped crying . on that solemn day , premier of bavaria and chairman of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , edmund stoiber announced he was going to step down in september - after his own party decided that enough was enough . to an outsider , this may not seem like such a big deal .
politicians come and go .
in most parts of the world - with the exception , perhaps , of north korea , where presidents remain in power even after they 've gone to the communist version of heaven - the news of a politician stepping down is no more extraordinary than reports of paula abdul being drunk on american idol , again . bavaria , however , is a unique gem in the german federal system and stoiber , an exceptional personality on the german political scene . life after stoiber - is it possible ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bye-bye , eddie !
you 'll be missed !
edmund stoiber has been the alpha and omega of bavarian politics for so long that his supporters and his critics began to see in him something more than a politician : a symbol of constancy and a monument to the bavarian way of life . many a german politician would sell their mother to get the kind of popularity that stoiber has enjoyed in his neck of the woods - the most pious but also the most beer-drinking of all german states , a folksy dream come true . so everybody was , understandably , emotional about stoiber 's speech at a post-carnival , beer-bash on wednesday , most likely , the last grand speech in his political career .
mixing wishful thinking with political blindness , stoiber told his followers not to worry - and warned his opponents not to get their hopes up - by sounding totally convinced that nothing would change in bavaria after his departure , that everything would stay the same .
everybody cheered . what 's in a name ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leonid brezhnev probably never thought he could be mistaken for a us president the gentleman that he is , stoiber was going to compliment german chancellor merkel on her tough stance against us president george w. bush .
but that 's where things got a little complicated . " i found it refreshing , " stoiber said , " that the chancelor criticized guantanamo in front of us president brezhnev . " us president brezhnev ?
hello , bavaria , this is earth speaking !
what was edmund stoiber thinking when he mixed up bush - himself a master of the freudian slip - and brezhnev - a man who loved vodka as much as communism ? he 's done it before stoiber is known for not always saying the right thing .
the country is laughing to this day about the time he addressed sabine christiansen - the people 's princess of german political talk shows - as " frau merkel . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel is friendly but tough with the real us president admittedly , not all of his faux pas were equally entertaining .
the entire population of eastern germany , for instance , was not in the least amused when stoiber - during the 2005 election run-up - called them " the frustrated ones " and said he was not leaving the country 's fate to them . stoiber has raised his inability to form complete sentences to the level of rhetorical bravado .
one of his speeches about the transrapid railway system , for example , has inspired numerous music geeks to remix his staccato gobbledygook into a musical and poetic firework that became an instant success on the german-speaking internet . very few politicians get to have their speeches set to cheap techno or german rap .
but stoiber is not like other politicians .
he could easily make the transition from herr prime minister to mc kool dawg eddie and land a contract with a major record label , without even trying . a new career in sight ? various theories are circulating about his latest slip of the tongue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no , it 's not brezhnev in the background .
it 's theo waigel unlike former chancellor schröder - who , by general agreement , must have had a little too much to drink on the night of the 2005 elections , which made him sound overoptimistic and belligerent on tv that night - stoiber seemed as sober as the uncrowned king of bavaria could possibly be . some claim that it was the sight of another fellow conservative , politician theo waigel in the audience that triggered the confusion .
weigel - the owner of the most impressive unibrow on the german political scene - could be said to resemble leonid brezhnev , at least as far as excess hair between their eyebrows is concerned . but what if this was not a slip of the tongue at all ?
what if stoiber - by consciously comparing us president bush to a soviet communist dictator - was simply preparing himself for a career in the exciting business of human rights ?
everybody 's criticizing bush these days , so why not ?
or was stoiber preparing to enter the world of stand-up comedy ? is stoiber going the heide simonis way ? just like heide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heide simonis , left , did not make a smooth transition to entertainment simonis was a social democratic politician and prime minister of schleswig-holstein .
after her own election debacle in 2005 -lrb- when members of her own party refused to elect her in four consecutive ballots in the state parliament -rrb- , she became head of the german unicef . in the weirdest pr miscalculation of the year , simonis , with her stiff posture and absolute lack of any sense of humor , became the laughing stock of the entire nation with her consistently horrifying performance in the tv contest " let 's dance " last year . stoiber would probably never do such a thing - prance around with celebrities and ballroom dancing stars .
but he may consider a political comedy show .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 22.02.2007 the power behind the german smoking ban stalemate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's smoke-filled bars and cafes are almost a rarity in western europe as a crucial meeting on protecting non-smokers opens in germany friday , a look at the country 's powerful tobacco lobby offers some clues as to why germany has successfully resisted an outright smoking ban so far . the struggle in germany to agree on a smoking ban continues this week when government ministers convene in hanover on friday to discuss the issue of protection for non-smokers before a state premiers ' debate on march 22 .
the meeting , to be chaired by federal minister for health , ulla schmidt and consumer affairs minister , horst seehofer will be used to further discuss whether smoking in schools , public buildings and most restaurants should be banned by germany 's 16 federal states .
the decision to hand the responsibility for approving the ban to the individual states came after germany 's ruling coalition rescinded the original ban proposal on constitutional grounds in december last year .
the government said an outright federal ban could infringe on individual states ' rights , many of which can not be overridden by berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the states are responsible for issuing bans in public places it is the 16 states , not the federal government , which have power over local government facilities such as schools and hospitals , as well as places such as bars and restaurants - those places where the smoking ban was proposed .
pro-smoking lobbyists pulling the strings ?
the decision was also seen as another example of the german government 's unwillingness to confront the country 's powerful pro-smoking lobby which opposition politicians and anti-smoking campaigners believe holds too much influence over the ruling coalition of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
germany has been slow to follow the lead of those eu states which have already agreed and have implemented their own smoking bans .
france , italy and england have already passed laws that ban smoking in bars and restaurants , as well as public buildings , putting germany out of step with many of its european counterparts .
pressure from the anti-smoking lobby is suspected as being the reason why germany continues to lag behind .
but does the pro- lobby really have that amount of power , that the german government would defy european union directives to satisfy its wishes ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lobbyists are accused of pressuring the government " the pro-smoker lobby is stronger in germany than in any other european country , " siggi ermer , the chairman of pro rauchfrei , the german lobby for non-smokers said . " even the tobacco companies are proud of that fact .
its influence is so strong that pro rauchfrei talks about a tobacco dictatorship in a democratic state .
-lrb- the pro- lobby -rrb- has affected the legislation for decades and crucially has steered the politicians .
" it is so powerful that in the current discussions , the cdu / csu parliamentary group brought in a regulation paper from the german tobacco industry association -lrb- vdc -rrb- and presented it word for word as their own proposal for the negotiations . "
the german tobacco industry association -lrb- vdc -rrb- was unavailable for comment on its involvement in any parliamentary decisions or the extent of its influence over the government .
wolfgang hainer , head of the powerful vdc , who represents the interests of philip morris , british american tobacco , reemtsma and four other tobacco companies in germany recently told german weekly die zeit , " we collect information , channel the opinions of our members and then present the facts to the politicians . " the vdc is also said to organize regular parties at its headquarters in berlin which usually pulls in younger employees from the german ministries and the offices of parliamentarians . no such thing as a free lunch in lobbyists ' eyes germany is an important battleground for the pro-smoking lobby .
it is europe 's biggest tobacco market with about 22 million smokers , which is 27 percent of the population , according to the federal statistics office .
and with more and more eu countries cracking down on smokers , the hearts , minds and lungs of german smokers have become more valuable to the tobacco companies .
for the pro-smoking lobby to retain its advantage , alliances have to be formed with those in power .
" in germany , the tobacco lobby has a strong influence on the politicians , " pro rauchfrei 's ermer says .
" that begins with regular gifts directly to the desks of the delegates , and goes as far as direct payments for local government events and party meetings . "
" beyond that the delegates are invited regularly to meetings of the tobacco industry , the agendas of which are disguised by social topics .
until 2006 , the total of direct payments paid to the federal government by the tobacco industry amounts to 11.2 million euros . "
inaction and stalling can not stop ban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hopes of the anti- lobby regularly get trodden on ermer states that there is a network of pro-smoking sympathizers within the political arena in germany and that smokers within the government have an obvious agenda .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 22.02.2007 the power behind the german smoking ban stalemate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's smoke-filled bars and cafes are almost a rarity in western europe as a crucial meeting on protecting non-smokers opens in germany friday , a look at the country 's powerful tobacco lobby offers some clues as to why germany has successfully resisted an outright smoking ban so far . the struggle in germany to agree on a smoking ban continues this week when government ministers convene in hanover on friday to discuss the issue of protection for non-smokers before a state premiers ' debate on march 22 .
the meeting , to be chaired by federal minister for health , ulla schmidt and consumer affairs minister , horst seehofer will be used to further discuss whether smoking in schools , public buildings and most restaurants should be banned by germany 's 16 federal states .
the decision to hand the responsibility for approving the ban to the individual states came after germany 's ruling coalition rescinded the original ban proposal on constitutional grounds in december last year .
the government said an outright federal ban could infringe on individual states ' rights , many of which can not be overridden by berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the states are responsible for issuing bans in public places it is the 16 states , not the federal government , which have power over local government facilities such as schools and hospitals , as well as places such as bars and restaurants - those places where the smoking ban was proposed .
pro-smoking lobbyists pulling the strings ?
the decision was also seen as another example of the german government 's unwillingness to confront the country 's powerful pro-smoking lobby which opposition politicians and anti-smoking campaigners believe holds too much influence over the ruling coalition of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
germany has been slow to follow the lead of those eu states which have already agreed and have implemented their own smoking bans .
france , italy and england have already passed laws that ban smoking in bars and restaurants , as well as public buildings , putting germany out of step with many of its european counterparts .
pressure from the anti-smoking lobby is suspected as being the reason why germany continues to lag behind .
but does the pro- lobby really have that amount of power , that the german government would defy european union directives to satisfy its wishes ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lobbyists are accused of pressuring the government " the pro-smoker lobby is stronger in germany than in any other european country , " siggi ermer , the chairman of pro rauchfrei , the german lobby for non-smokers said . " even the tobacco companies are proud of that fact .
its influence is so strong that pro rauchfrei talks about a tobacco dictatorship in a democratic state .
-lrb- the pro- lobby -rrb- has affected the legislation for decades and crucially has steered the politicians .
" it is so powerful that in the current discussions , the cdu / csu parliamentary group brought in a regulation paper from the german tobacco industry association -lrb- vdc -rrb- and presented it word for word as their own proposal for the negotiations . "
the german tobacco industry association -lrb- vdc -rrb- was unavailable for comment on its involvement in any parliamentary decisions or the extent of its influence over the government .
wolfgang hainer , head of the powerful vdc , who represents the interests of philip morris , british american tobacco , reemtsma and four other tobacco companies in germany recently told german weekly die zeit , " we collect information , channel the opinions of our members and then present the facts to the politicians . " the vdc is also said to organize regular parties at its headquarters in berlin which usually pulls in younger employees from the german ministries and the offices of parliamentarians . no such thing as a free lunch in lobbyists ' eyes germany is an important battleground for the pro-smoking lobby .
it is europe 's biggest tobacco market with about 22 million smokers , which is 27 percent of the population , according to the federal statistics office .
and with more and more eu countries cracking down on smokers , the hearts , minds and lungs of german smokers have become more valuable to the tobacco companies .
for the pro-smoking lobby to retain its advantage , alliances have to be formed with those in power .
" in germany , the tobacco lobby has a strong influence on the politicians , " pro rauchfrei 's ermer says .
" that begins with regular gifts directly to the desks of the delegates , and goes as far as direct payments for local government events and party meetings . "
" beyond that the delegates are invited regularly to meetings of the tobacco industry , the agendas of which are disguised by social topics .
until 2006 , the total of direct payments paid to the federal government by the tobacco industry amounts to 11.2 million euros . "
inaction and stalling can not stop ban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hopes of the anti- lobby regularly get trodden on ermer states that there is a network of pro-smoking sympathizers within the political arena in germany and that smokers within the government have an obvious agenda .
" whole parliamentary committees , such as the tourism committee , have been infiltrated by the tobacco lobby , " he added " in addition , the health minister ulla schmidt avoids making clear decisions .
unlike in other european countries , the german health minister doesn ’ t take the leadership in the ban discussion and leaves the demagogues to take the lead . "
despite the power wielded by the pro-lobby , ermer believes that the move towards a smoke-free europe is an irreversible one .
" while the influence in germany is large , the german pro-smoker lobby has only a small influence on europe , " ermer concludes .
" on a european scale , germany is isolated , as the judgment of the european court of justice pointed out with the tobacco advertising ban in 2005 .
only germany complained and lost , " he said .
" the european way into a smokeless future can not be stopped , it can only be slowed down by germany .

' shocked and stunned ' for the february issue of youth and lifestyle glossy u _ mag , writer volker sievert sat down to chat with up-and-coming starlet hannah herzsprung .
but after providing the actress with the agreed-upon transcript of the interview , he said he was " shocked and stunned " when her final version came back . so much of the text had been excised that it looked more like it had been attacked by wartime censors than simply vetted for errors or slips of the tongue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the editors of u _ mag decided to show readers how modern media works " i really felt like i had been censored , " sievert wrote in an e-mail .

napolitano 's flurry of meetings thursday were to continue friday , consulting with the speakers of the two houses of parliament , the heads of parliamentary groups and the presidents who preceded him . prodi , head of italy 's 61st government since world war ii , was also prime minister for two years and five months in 1996-98 , falling when communists withdrew their support . possible reinstatement napolitano is widely expected to rename prodi as prime minister .
but he also has the option of choosing a new government leader from the center-left coalition , appointing a technocrat government or dissolving parliament and calling new elections . while fresh elections are considered unlikely , the economic daily il sole 24 ore warned thursday against prodi 's simple reinstatement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's president giorgio napolitano is scrambling for a new government " experience shows that -lrb- such -rrb- governments are always mediocre , especially when the differences that brought about the crisis are not resolved , " it said in an editorial . and franco pavoncello of rome 's john cabot university said it was " highly improbable " that napolitano would call an election after the current round of consultations . foreign policy trip-up " i do n't think it will happen , " he told german news agency dpa .

napolitano 's flurry of meetings thursday were to continue friday , consulting with the speakers of the two houses of parliament , the heads of parliamentary groups and the presidents who preceded him . prodi , head of italy 's 61st government since world war ii , was also prime minister for two years and five months in 1996-98 , falling when communists withdrew their support . possible reinstatement napolitano is widely expected to rename prodi as prime minister .
but he also has the option of choosing a new government leader from the center-left coalition , appointing a technocrat government or dissolving parliament and calling new elections . while fresh elections are considered unlikely , the economic daily il sole 24 ore warned thursday against prodi 's simple reinstatement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's president giorgio napolitano is scrambling for a new government " experience shows that -lrb- such -rrb- governments are always mediocre , especially when the differences that brought about the crisis are not resolved , " it said in an editorial . and franco pavoncello of rome 's john cabot university said it was " highly improbable " that napolitano would call an election after the current round of consultations . foreign policy trip-up " i do n't think it will happen , " he told german news agency dpa .
" italy needs to change its electoral system first and ensure that the new law produces more stable governments in the future , " pavoncello said . gianfranco pasquino of john hopkins university told sky italia television he expected the president would ask prodi to stay on , but only after ensuring " he has a workable majority " in the senate . prodi stepped down on wednesday , just nine months after he assumed office , after losing a key vote in parliament 's upper house over his government 's foreign policy . a government-sponsored motion received just 158 votes in favor , two short of the required majority of 160 .
a total of 136 lawmakers voted against and 24 , including two far-left dissidents , abstained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's foreign policy proved prodi 's undoing the two communist senators in prodi 's coalition , who are staunchly opposed to the planned enlargement of a us military base in northern italy , tipped the balance with their crucial " no " votes . giovanni sartori , one of italy 's leading constitutional experts , said the president could decide to form an " institutional " or " technocrat " government backed by an enlarged majority .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 22.02.2007 germany to back ban on cluster bombs at conference großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cluster bombs were also dropped by nato during the kosovo war in 1999 the norwegian government is hosting a meeting thursday on cluster munitions .
oslo considers un talks on the issue last year a failure and hopes to launch efforts for an international ban backed by germany . representatives from over 40 countries and international organizations are gathering in oslo on thursday and friday to discuss ways to outlaw cluster bombs .
norway and other nations in favor of a ban are being hampered by nations that oppose one . the scandinavian country hopes the two-day meeting , which will be attended by senior ministry officials from around the world , will be the start of a process that will ultimately lead to the adoption of an international ban - even without the support of some key countries , such as opponents britain and the united states . " it is better that the like-minded -lrb- pro-ban -rrb- nations work in the same direction , " said raymond johansen , norway 's state secretary of foreign affairs .
he said that an international accord would put pressure on anti-ban nations to eventually comply . the pro-ban countries expected to be represented include norway , sweden , germany , mozambique and angola .
on the other side , britain , canada , france , china , india and russia belong to those opposed .
the united states , which is also opposed , will not be in attendance . several un organizations will also attend , as well as the cluster munition coalition -lrb- cmc -rrb- , the umbrella organization grouping non-governmental organizations campaigning for a ban . " it 's a double whammy . " a cluster bomb consists of a container holding up to hundreds of smaller so-called bomblets .
it opens in mid-air and disperses these grenades over a large area .
cluster munitions are stockpiled by most countries ' armies and have often been used in the past 40 years , most recently during the war in lebanon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demining unexploded cluster bombs in lebanon is dangerous work opponents of cluster munitions consider these weapons an unacceptable danger to civilians . " it 's a double whammy , " said cmc 's co-chairman steve goose .
" at the time of the attack , the bomblets spread over a large area and they can not be guided .
a large number of them do not explode upon impact , and so they can kill years later . "
he said that cluster bombs disproportionately target civilians . " cluster munitions caused more civilian casualties during the -lrb- last -rrb- iraq war and in kosovo than any other type of weapon , " goose said . proponents of a ban argue that a prohibition is achievable .
they point to the 1997 mine ban treaty that banned the production , stockpiling and use of anti-personnel landmines - also the result of a norwegian initiative . " the landmine treaty created a powerful standard , " goose said .
" we think the same can happen with cluster munitions . " can a ban influence the right countries ? some experts remain cautious about a ban , though . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unexploded cluster munitions threaten civilians even after a conflict is over " the worry is that , with cluster munitions , it will be a treaty binding those who are already in agreement , but wo n't touch those countries that are affected by them , or manufacture them , " said nicholas sims , an expert on arms limitation at the london school of economics and political science . that fear is compounded by the fact that the united states , russia , china , britain and france - the five permanent members of the un security council - are against an international ban on cluster munitions . another source of concern touches the scope of the ban .
non-governmental organizations are calling for a comprehensive ban on the production , stockpiling and use of all types of cluster munitions .
however , even a pro-ban nation like norway has suggested that a ban could exclude certain types of cluster munitions , such as those that self-destruct on impact . the norwegian government decided to host the conference , as it considered the latest un talks on the issue , held in geneva in november , a failure . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court considers national accountability in foreign missions a kosovo man whose son was killed by a nato cluster bomb took france to europe 's top human rights court wednesday over the boy 's death .

he could reject prodi 's resignation and ask him to seek a vote of confidence in parliament , or give him a mandate to form a new government . alternatively , he could give the mandate to a different center-left leader or an institutional figure .
a final option , seen as less likely at present , would be to call fresh elections that would take place in the spring . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi 's government lost a key vote over foreign policy in a drama reminiscent of italian politics of the 1980s and 1990s when governments sometimes lasted less than a week , prodi stepped down on wednesday , just nine months after assuming office , after he lost a key vote in parliament 's upper house over his government 's foreign policy .
the center-left government was forced onto the defensive over the deployment of 2,000 troops in afghanistan and the enlargement of a us military base in northern italy . both are policies most opposed by far-left parties within prodi 's coalition . opposition called for prodi 's resignation but it is the conservative opposition , led by silvio berlusconi , who was narrowly forced out of the prime minister 's office by prodi in an election last april , who led calls for prodi to go . right wing senators shouted " resign ! resign ! " after the result of the vote in the italian senate was announced .
prodi should " tender his resignation immediately , " declared berlusconi . the government needed 160 votes in the senate debate to get a formal motion of support .
but only 158 senators voted in favor and 136 opposed the government .

napolitano , who rushed back to rome from a visit to the provinces , said in a statement that he " reserves his decision " on the future of the government . under pressure over afghanistan d 'alema had to defend italy 's military mission in afghanistan to senators before the vote .
italy currently has around 2,000 troops deployed in the country as part of a nato-led peacekeeping mission . " it 's not a nato mission , but a united nations mission in which nato has an important military function , " d 'alema told the parliament . " it is a political and civil mission . "

he could reject prodi 's resignation and ask him to seek a vote of confidence in parliament , or give him a mandate to form a new government . alternatively , he could give the mandate to a different center-left leader or an institutional figure .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 22.02.2007 local anger at swank new german government guesthouse großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meseberg castle is all about pomp and circumstance most nations have official guesthouses where government leaders can entertain high-ranking foreign visitors .
now , german chancellor angela merkel also boasts one , 60 miles north of berlin . a magnificent 1738-built baroque-style property called schloss meseberg -lrb- castle meseberg -rrb- is situated in the eastern state of brandenburg encircling berlin . on friday , german chancellor angela merkel will play host at the castle for the first time to french president jacques chirac , during one of their regular german-franco consultations . under a deal reached with the messerschmidt foundation - a privately-owned organization that bought the castle in the mid-nineties - the government will be allowed to use the property as its guesthouse for high-ranking officials over a 20-year period at a rent of just one euro a year . the government for its part has in the past year spent 13 million euros -lrb- $ 17 million -rrb- modernizing its kitchen and heating facilities and by ensuring its security and technical facilities are also state-of-the-art . mixed feelings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques chirac will be merkel 's first guest at meseberg while there is general satisfaction in brandenburg that a worthy role has been found for the magnificently-restored property , feelings in meseberg -lrb- population 135 -rrb- are mixed . the decision to renew the 1.7 kilometer-long -lrb- 1 mile -rrb- approach road to the castle has raised eyebrows in the village even though community officials say the rough-surfaced , pot-holed road , was in dire need of repair . the main cost will be borne by the german government and brandenburg state , but villagers with properties along the route are also being called on to make contributions , ranging from 2,000 to 15,000 euros . where were they before ? evelyn briesmeister , 65 , a village resident , is furious . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the castle has been meticulously restored to its past splendor " the state of the road did n't bother a soul in earlier times , " briesmeister said .
" now , because government officials will be driving cars along it to the schloss the whole village is made poor . " her husband , horst briesemeister , 70 , agrees .
both have signed a citizen 's petition in protest . frank stege , 45 , the district 's head official claims the decision to renew the approach road at a cost of 1.2 million euros was taken in december 2005 .

situated in the former gdr -lrb- east germany -rrb- , it was just one of a series of decaying country retreats which had fallen on hard times during the communist era . then , the munich-based messerschmidt foundation , a private organization that renovates dilapidated monuments across germany , acquired the castle in the mid-1990s , and spent 25 million euros over the next 10 years restoring it . footing the bill the brandenburg state government , it was thought , would find a role for the castle and was miffed when matthias platzeck , the state 's premier , ultimately rejected the idea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last summer , merkel welcomed george w. bush in her constituency in stralsund but platzeck did toss the idea to then german chancellor gerhard schröder who was seeking a suitable venue for summer government conclaves and a place for putting up high-ranking foreign visitors . his dilemma was spotlighted in early 2005 when president bush arrived for a visit .
concern about his safety led to a planned berlin stop-over being moved to mainz , near frankfurt . late last month , german chancellory minister thomas de maiziere was handed a symbolic key to schloss meseberg . referring to the castle as a government venue for international conferences and foreign guests making overnight stays , de maiziere predicted that " history would be written in the meseberg meetings of the future .

oslo considers un talks on the issue last year a failure and hopes to launch efforts for an international ban backed by germany . representatives from over 40 countries and international organizations are gathering in oslo on thursday and friday to discuss ways to outlaw cluster bombs .
norway and other nations in favor of a ban are being hampered by nations that oppose one . the scandinavian country hopes the two-day meeting , which will be attended by senior ministry officials from around the world , will be the start of a process that will ultimately lead to the adoption of an international ban - even without the support of some key countries , such as opponents britain and the united states . " it is better that the like-minded -lrb- pro-ban -rrb- nations work in the same direction , " said raymond johansen , norway 's state secretary of foreign affairs .
he said that an international accord would put pressure on anti-ban nations to eventually comply . the pro-ban countries expected to be represented include norway , sweden , germany , mozambique and angola .
on the other side , britain , canada , france , china , india and russia belong to those opposed .

" at the time of the attack , the bomblets spread over a large area and they can not be guided .
a large number of them do not explode upon impact , and so they can kill years later . "
he said that cluster bombs disproportionately target civilians . " cluster munitions caused more civilian casualties during the -lrb- last -rrb- iraq war and in kosovo than any other type of weapon , " goose said . proponents of a ban argue that a prohibition is achievable .
they point to the 1997 mine ban treaty that banned the production , stockpiling and use of anti-personnel landmines - also the result of a norwegian initiative . " the landmine treaty created a powerful standard , " goose said .
" we think the same can happen with cluster munitions .

' shocked and stunned ' for the february issue of youth and lifestyle glossy u _ mag , writer volker sievert sat down to chat with up-and-coming starlet hannah herzsprung .
but after providing the actress with the agreed-upon transcript of the interview , he said he was " shocked and stunned " when her final version came back . so much of the text had been excised that it looked more like it had been attacked by wartime censors than simply vetted for errors or slips of the tongue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the editors of u _ mag decided to show readers how modern media works " i really felt like i had been censored , " sievert wrote in an e-mail .
" i could n't understand this massive interference in the least . " as a result of herzsprung 's changes , sievert wrote , the interview was " almost grotesquely disfigured . "
the end result is " something that resembles a self-promotional text more than a lively , vital interview , " he added . cozy relationship u _ mag 's response ?
print the interview in full - heavily blacked-out sections included . " we felt used , " sievert said .
" we decided to print the interview with the crossed out sections , to give our readers a look into the modern media landscape . " the event caused a stir in the german media and awoke a sleeping discussion on what some say is an overly-cozy relationship between the german press and public figures . " journalists are not legally required to have interview partners authorize their statements . … but unfortunately in germany , that has almost become common practice , " said hendrik zörner , spokesman for the german journalists ' association -lrb- djv -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der spiegel is known for letting subjects alter interviews , one commentator said big-name papers tend to " follow clearer journalistic practices , " while the smaller , local outlets that make up the majority of papers in the country , " might have to deal with certain interview partners more frequently , " and so are more likely to allow sources to sign off on interviews , zörner said . " this leads to the practice that looks a little like mutual back-scratching , " he added . good for everyone ? but ingrid kolb , director of the henri nannen school for journalism in hamburg , said some of the country 's biggest media outlets - for instance , renowned news magazines der spiegel and stern - are noted for the practice . " the long interviews that der spiegel publishes with famous public figures , their so-called talks , are known for this , " kolb said .
" they can go back and forth a dozen times , with each side bringing their argument a bit more to the point , refining it , improving it .
in a best-case scenario , it serves the interests of both sides . " if anything , the controversy certainly makes plain the mutual give-and-take relationship between public figures and the media : the one side in need of a platform to promote themselves and their ideas , the other constantly looking for interesting material to fill an ever expanding news hole . still , in the us , britain or australia , the idea of a journalist giving an interview subject a whack at editing his or her own comments after the fact would be grounds for derision , if not dismissal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the us , anything said " on the record " goes in the paper " i 'm aware that there is a big difference on this subject between the anglo-saxon world and the german world , " kolb said .
" but in germany it has become a custom to get a longer interview or quotes authorized . … in general the interview partner tells the journalist that he expects it . " ' scorched earth ' action according to kolb , printing an interview with the blacked out parts shown , like u _ mag did , is " essentially a scorched-earth kind of act .
this person will never have something to do with the publication again . " according to the journalists ' association 's zörner , the practice represents " a real weakness in german journalism ; journalists are much too ready to allow interview authorization . " " interviews are meant to serve an informative and explanatory function .
but if interviews are changed after the fact , they are no longer interviews .
they are pr texts , " he said . prior occurrence the hannah herzsprung case is n't the first time the issue of journalistic integrity has made headlines here .
the last time was in 2003 , when the press went on the attack against the government 's supposed " control mania . " back then , a group of the country 's heavyweight newspapers , including the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , die welt , süddeutsche zeitung and the financial times deutschland , all printed commentaries and articles deploring the practice of interview approval . most memorable was the move by leftist newspaper tageszeitung .
in an apparent bid to point up the notion that newsmakers need the press just as much as the press needs them , the paper printed a censored interview with the then secretary general of the social democrats - with all his responses blacked out in protest . ' no danger to democracy ' germany 's fourth estate has other , worse weaknesses , djv 's zörner notes .
a recent report by reporters without borders ranked the country a low 23nd in terms of press freedoms , based mostly on controversial government searches of newspaper offices . but " despite all the problems and dangers , " zörner said , overall , german journalism is " qualitatively very good . " " you ca n't say that -lrb- the practice of allowing interview revisions -rrb- poses a danger to democracy , " he said .
and after all , he pointed out , interviews are not the only tool reporters have . " there are reports , opinion pieces - there are many other forms of journalism available .

now , german chancellor angela merkel also boasts one , 60 miles north of berlin . a magnificent 1738-built baroque-style property called schloss meseberg -lrb- castle meseberg -rrb- is situated in the eastern state of brandenburg encircling berlin . on friday , german chancellor angela merkel will play host at the castle for the first time to french president jacques chirac , during one of their regular german-franco consultations . under a deal reached with the messerschmidt foundation - a privately-owned organization that bought the castle in the mid-nineties - the government will be allowed to use the property as its guesthouse for high-ranking officials over a 20-year period at a rent of just one euro a year . the government for its part has in the past year spent 13 million euros -lrb- $ 17 million -rrb- modernizing its kitchen and heating facilities and by ensuring its security and technical facilities are also state-of-the-art . mixed feelings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques chirac will be merkel 's first guest at meseberg while there is general satisfaction in brandenburg that a worthy role has been found for the magnificently-restored property , feelings in meseberg -lrb- population 135 -rrb- are mixed . the decision to renew the 1.7 kilometer-long -lrb- 1 mile -rrb- approach road to the castle has raised eyebrows in the village even though community officials say the rough-surfaced , pot-holed road , was in dire need of repair . the main cost will be borne by the german government and brandenburg state , but villagers with properties along the route are also being called on to make contributions , ranging from 2,000 to 15,000 euros . where were they before ? evelyn briesmeister , 65 , a village resident , is furious . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the castle has been meticulously restored to its past splendor " the state of the road did n't bother a soul in earlier times , " briesmeister said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 22.02.2007 the power behind the german smoking ban stalemate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's smoke-filled bars and cafes are almost a rarity in western europe as a crucial meeting on protecting non-smokers opens in germany friday , a look at the country 's powerful tobacco lobby offers some clues as to why germany has successfully resisted an outright smoking ban so far . the struggle in germany to agree on a smoking ban continues this week when government ministers convene in hanover on friday to discuss the issue of protection for non-smokers before a state premiers ' debate on march 22 .
the meeting , to be chaired by federal minister for health , ulla schmidt and consumer affairs minister , horst seehofer will be used to further discuss whether smoking in schools , public buildings and most restaurants should be banned by germany 's 16 federal states .
the decision to hand the responsibility for approving the ban to the individual states came after germany 's ruling coalition rescinded the original ban proposal on constitutional grounds in december last year .
the government said an outright federal ban could infringe on individual states ' rights , many of which can not be overridden by berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the states are responsible for issuing bans in public places it is the 16 states , not the federal government , which have power over local government facilities such as schools and hospitals , as well as places such as bars and restaurants - those places where the smoking ban was proposed .
pro-smoking lobbyists pulling the strings ?
the decision was also seen as another example of the german government 's unwillingness to confront the country 's powerful pro-smoking lobby which opposition politicians and anti-smoking campaigners believe holds too much influence over the ruling coalition of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
germany has been slow to follow the lead of those eu states which have already agreed and have implemented their own smoking bans .
france , italy and england have already passed laws that ban smoking in bars and restaurants , as well as public buildings , putting germany out of step with many of its european counterparts .
pressure from the anti-smoking lobby is suspected as being the reason why germany continues to lag behind .
but does the pro- lobby really have that amount of power , that the german government would defy european union directives to satisfy its wishes ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lobbyists are accused of pressuring the government " the pro-smoker lobby is stronger in germany than in any other european country , " siggi ermer , the chairman of pro rauchfrei , the german lobby for non-smokers said . " even the tobacco companies are proud of that fact .
its influence is so strong that pro rauchfrei talks about a tobacco dictatorship in a democratic state .
-lrb- the pro- lobby -rrb- has affected the legislation for decades and crucially has steered the politicians .
" it is so powerful that in the current discussions , the cdu / csu parliamentary group brought in a regulation paper from the german tobacco industry association -lrb- vdc -rrb- and presented it word for word as their own proposal for the negotiations . "
the german tobacco industry association -lrb- vdc -rrb- was unavailable for comment on its involvement in any parliamentary decisions or the extent of its influence over the government .
wolfgang hainer , head of the powerful vdc , who represents the interests of philip morris , british american tobacco , reemtsma and four other tobacco companies in germany recently told german weekly die zeit , " we collect information , channel the opinions of our members and then present the facts to the politicians . " the vdc is also said to organize regular parties at its headquarters in berlin which usually pulls in younger employees from the german ministries and the offices of parliamentarians . no such thing as a free lunch in lobbyists ' eyes germany is an important battleground for the pro-smoking lobby .
it is europe 's biggest tobacco market with about 22 million smokers , which is 27 percent of the population , according to the federal statistics office .
and with more and more eu countries cracking down on smokers , the hearts , minds and lungs of german smokers have become more valuable to the tobacco companies .
for the pro-smoking lobby to retain its advantage , alliances have to be formed with those in power .
" in germany , the tobacco lobby has a strong influence on the politicians , " pro rauchfrei 's ermer says .
" that begins with regular gifts directly to the desks of the delegates , and goes as far as direct payments for local government events and party meetings . "
" beyond that the delegates are invited regularly to meetings of the tobacco industry , the agendas of which are disguised by social topics .
until 2006 , the total of direct payments paid to the federal government by the tobacco industry amounts to 11.2 million euros . "
inaction and stalling can not stop ban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hopes of the anti- lobby regularly get trodden on ermer states that there is a network of pro-smoking sympathizers within the political arena in germany and that smokers within the government have an obvious agenda .
" whole parliamentary committees , such as the tourism committee , have been infiltrated by the tobacco lobby , " he added " in addition , the health minister ulla schmidt avoids making clear decisions .
unlike in other european countries , the german health minister doesn ’ t take the leadership in the ban discussion and leaves the demagogues to take the lead . "
despite the power wielded by the pro-lobby , ermer believes that the move towards a smoke-free europe is an irreversible one .
" while the influence in germany is large , the german pro-smoker lobby has only a small influence on europe , " ermer concludes .
" on a european scale , germany is isolated , as the judgment of the european court of justice pointed out with the tobacco advertising ban in 2005 .
only germany complained and lost , " he said .
" the european way into a smokeless future can not be stopped , it can only be slowed down by germany .

dw-world.de caught up with la-based screenwriter matt witten to find out how projects like the " writer 's room " can help . the recent berlin film festival proved that german cinema is in fine fettle . but television is looking a lot less robust .
a record number of new shows are tanking spectacularly - take private station pro 7 's latest disaster , the much-hyped " crazy about clara . "
given that viewers loved " ally mcbeal " and " sex and the city , " they should have devoured a home-grown series about a 20-something city girl juggling work and relationships .
but no one was crazy about clara at all , and this enormously expensive series was shunted off into a late-night slot after just two episodes . but while viewers ca n't switch off german shows fast enough , they 're more addicted than ever to us imports , with most prime-time slots filled with the likes of " desperate housewives , " " medical investigation " and " er . "
the networks are realizing it 's time for a re-think - and are sending for the marines . organized by media consultancy mediaxchange , the third " writer 's room " recently took place in germany .
its goal is to bring together experienced us writers to work with their local counterparts in developing ideas for drama series to be sold to local channels and the international market .
guest of honor at january 's session was writer and producer matt witten - whose credits include " house m.d. , " " csi : miami " and " law & order . " dw-world.de asked him how it went . matt witten : it went well !
the german writers were talented and interesting and it was very productive .
we came up with some terrific ideas for shows and also i think it gave the german writers a good idea of how us tv shows run . did you see any german tv shows ? i saw " alarm für cobra 11 " and " lasko " -lrb- two series made by german production company " action concept , " which co-organized the event -rrb- .
one thing i noticed was that the action sequences were fabulous , probably better than anything i 've ever seen on american television .
you might see that kind of action in the movies but never on television .
the first episode i saw of " cobra 11 " had a 400 car pile-up !
" action concept " manages to do these incredible things on relatively small budgets , significantly less than those of american shows . so is us tv as good as it is often simply because of economies of scale ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " csi : miami " shows the way because we have more money to put into it ?
yes .
but we 've also been making tv in the us since 1950 .
we have a longer history - we 've been developing our tv for 50 years , so there might be some catch-up to do for german television .
but are americans inherently better writers than germans ?
no , of course not ! when you talked to the german participants in the writer 's room , did you get the impression that they need help to create good tv ? american shows tend to be pretty fast-paced and vigorously structured , and the way we structure the action and the conflict for our main characters has been thought through in ways that are fresh for german writers , they have n't necessarily heard it described in these terms .
so it gives them a new way of looking at the writing they 're doing .
they were also intrigued by the fact that in america we have staff writers who meet every day , and we have a head writer responsible for the consistency of the show - " the show-runner . "
these concepts are new in germany , where there is no cohesion of writing staff .
instead , episodes are written by freelancers who turn in maybe just two a year .
another thing in american tv is that directors do n't have the power to change the script without talking to the writer .
it makes sense that the writers are in charge because after all , they will be involved with all thirteen episodes in the series whereas a director is only involved with three or four . does that mean that german shows never quite rival american ones because of structures - because germany doesn ’ t have the same efficient systems in place that the us has ?
should germany focus more on this aspect of tv production ? i would agree with that .
when you have a good infrastructure the writers will also get better because of it - by being with the production for all 13 or 24 episodes , being around the other writers on set , working with the actors and the directors , getting involved with the editing .
better writing is an inevitable by-product .
" action concept " ceo hermann joha for one is very keen to run all his shows more according to this model .
he specifically wants to establish this kind of infrastructure and to introduce this way of working in germany . what germany has right now is a lot of shows billed as the german " sex and the city , " the german " law & order " etc .
but somehow they don ’ t really work .
what ’ s missing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans loved " sex and the city " for myself as a writer i feel that if you 're passionate about your show it has a good chance of becoming a success .
but you also need the infrastructure to carry that passion forward and make it workable for a 13 or 24 episode season , and i guess there 's a possibility that some of these aspects are lacking in germany . tv is essentially escapist , and germany still has a fascination with the us .
might german tv writers be fighting a losing battle , because their audiences are actually quite happy not to have home-grown shows ? my guess is that germans would respond really well to a terrific home-grown show .
it 's only logical .
i used to live in saratoga springs in upstate new york and i would always be intrigued by any novel set there .
i 'm jewish , so i always enjoy jewish novels .
if a story is somehow close to me i 'll be interested … .
i have two children and i 'm always interested in a story about a dad with kids .
so i can only imagine that if i were german i would want to watch shows in german , i would think : " hey , we germans can put out good shows too . "
i 'd feel proud . a lot of good series in the us are made by cable network hbo , so they don ’ t need mass appeal .
in germany , tv series need to work across the board .
is it easier for writers to maintain high standards when they know they only need to reach a certain audience ? yes , but it depends on your idea .
there are good network shows that do have mass appeal , and that does n't have to be a bad thing .
a lot of the shows i love are on hbo and it 's great to have these outlets .
shows like " the sopranos " and " nip / tuck " really push the envelope and that probably has the effect of making the broadcast networks better generally because it raises the bar .
germany could probably benefit from an equivalent .
it would be great if german tv writers did n't feel they had to get 50 million viewers . is there a risk that projects like the " writer ’ s room " might result in very homogenous shows ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the unlucky clara the structures and strategies we 're introducing to german writers and executives have nothing to do with content .
they will just lead to better shows .
if the german writers have exciting ideas that are uniquely german , then projects like the " writer 's room " will just help them realize these ideas more fully .

dw-world.de caught up with la-based screenwriter matt witten to find out how projects like the " writer 's room " can help . the recent berlin film festival proved that german cinema is in fine fettle . but television is looking a lot less robust .
a record number of new shows are tanking spectacularly - take private station pro 7 's latest disaster , the much-hyped " crazy about clara . "
given that viewers loved " ally mcbeal " and " sex and the city , " they should have devoured a home-grown series about a 20-something city girl juggling work and relationships .
but no one was crazy about clara at all , and this enormously expensive series was shunted off into a late-night slot after just two episodes . but while viewers ca n't switch off german shows fast enough , they 're more addicted than ever to us imports , with most prime-time slots filled with the likes of " desperate housewives , " " medical investigation " and " er . "
the networks are realizing it 's time for a re-think - and are sending for the marines . organized by media consultancy mediaxchange , the third " writer 's room " recently took place in germany .
its goal is to bring together experienced us writers to work with their local counterparts in developing ideas for drama series to be sold to local channels and the international market .

now , german chancellor angela merkel also boasts one , 60 miles north of berlin . a magnificent 1738-built baroque-style property called schloss meseberg -lrb- castle meseberg -rrb- is situated in the eastern state of brandenburg encircling berlin . on friday , german chancellor angela merkel will play host at the castle for the first time to french president jacques chirac , during one of their regular german-franco consultations . under a deal reached with the messerschmidt foundation - a privately-owned organization that bought the castle in the mid-nineties - the government will be allowed to use the property as its guesthouse for high-ranking officials over a 20-year period at a rent of just one euro a year . the government for its part has in the past year spent 13 million euros -lrb- $ 17 million -rrb- modernizing its kitchen and heating facilities and by ensuring its security and technical facilities are also state-of-the-art . mixed feelings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques chirac will be merkel 's first guest at meseberg while there is general satisfaction in brandenburg that a worthy role has been found for the magnificently-restored property , feelings in meseberg -lrb- population 135 -rrb- are mixed . the decision to renew the 1.7 kilometer-long -lrb- 1 mile -rrb- approach road to the castle has raised eyebrows in the village even though community officials say the rough-surfaced , pot-holed road , was in dire need of repair . the main cost will be borne by the german government and brandenburg state , but villagers with properties along the route are also being called on to make contributions , ranging from 2,000 to 15,000 euros . where were they before ? evelyn briesmeister , 65 , a village resident , is furious . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the castle has been meticulously restored to its past splendor " the state of the road did n't bother a soul in earlier times , " briesmeister said .
" now , because government officials will be driving cars along it to the schloss the whole village is made poor . " her husband , horst briesemeister , 70 , agrees .
both have signed a citizen 's petition in protest . frank stege , 45 , the district 's head official claims the decision to renew the approach road at a cost of 1.2 million euros was taken in december 2005 . " we aim to make the payments socially tolerable for the villagers , " he said . transfer of power in the old federal republic during the years of division , the government 's official guesthouse was to be found atop a hill overlooking the rhine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meseberg is probably the cheapest castle in the world : the german government will be renting it for 1 euro per year nick-named the " rotunde " -lrb- rotunda -rrb- with its 23 conference rooms , it played host to a whole list of world leaders in the post-war years , ranging from leonid breschnev to bill clinton , the shah of persia to queen elizabeth of england . but after german reunification and the controversial political " power transfer " from bonn to berlin in 1999 , it was clear a new government guesthouse would have to be found closer to the old-new capital . schloss meseberg received little consideration at the time .
situated in the former gdr -lrb- east germany -rrb- , it was just one of a series of decaying country retreats which had fallen on hard times during the communist era . then , the munich-based messerschmidt foundation , a private organization that renovates dilapidated monuments across germany , acquired the castle in the mid-1990s , and spent 25 million euros over the next 10 years restoring it . footing the bill the brandenburg state government , it was thought , would find a role for the castle and was miffed when matthias platzeck , the state 's premier , ultimately rejected the idea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last summer , merkel welcomed george w. bush in her constituency in stralsund but platzeck did toss the idea to then german chancellor gerhard schröder who was seeking a suitable venue for summer government conclaves and a place for putting up high-ranking foreign visitors . his dilemma was spotlighted in early 2005 when president bush arrived for a visit .
concern about his safety led to a planned berlin stop-over being moved to mainz , near frankfurt . late last month , german chancellory minister thomas de maiziere was handed a symbolic key to schloss meseberg . referring to the castle as a government venue for international conferences and foreign guests making overnight stays , de maiziere predicted that " history would be written in the meseberg meetings of the future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 22.02.2007 the power behind the german smoking ban stalemate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's smoke-filled bars and cafes are almost a rarity in western europe as a crucial meeting on protecting non-smokers opens in germany friday , a look at the country 's powerful tobacco lobby offers some clues as to why germany has successfully resisted an outright smoking ban so far . the struggle in germany to agree on a smoking ban continues this week when government ministers convene in hanover on friday to discuss the issue of protection for non-smokers before a state premiers ' debate on march 22 .
the meeting , to be chaired by federal minister for health , ulla schmidt and consumer affairs minister , horst seehofer will be used to further discuss whether smoking in schools , public buildings and most restaurants should be banned by germany 's 16 federal states .
the decision to hand the responsibility for approving the ban to the individual states came after germany 's ruling coalition rescinded the original ban proposal on constitutional grounds in december last year .
the government said an outright federal ban could infringe on individual states ' rights , many of which can not be overridden by berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the states are responsible for issuing bans in public places it is the 16 states , not the federal government , which have power over local government facilities such as schools and hospitals , as well as places such as bars and restaurants - those places where the smoking ban was proposed .
pro-smoking lobbyists pulling the strings ?
the decision was also seen as another example of the german government 's unwillingness to confront the country 's powerful pro-smoking lobby which opposition politicians and anti-smoking campaigners believe holds too much influence over the ruling coalition of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
germany has been slow to follow the lead of those eu states which have already agreed and have implemented their own smoking bans .
france , italy and england have already passed laws that ban smoking in bars and restaurants , as well as public buildings , putting germany out of step with many of its european counterparts .
pressure from the anti-smoking lobby is suspected as being the reason why germany continues to lag behind .
but does the pro- lobby really have that amount of power , that the german government would defy european union directives to satisfy its wishes ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lobbyists are accused of pressuring the government " the pro-smoker lobby is stronger in germany than in any other european country , " siggi ermer , the chairman of pro rauchfrei , the german lobby for non-smokers said . " even the tobacco companies are proud of that fact .
its influence is so strong that pro rauchfrei talks about a tobacco dictatorship in a democratic state .
-lrb- the pro- lobby -rrb- has affected the legislation for decades and crucially has steered the politicians .
" it is so powerful that in the current discussions , the cdu / csu parliamentary group brought in a regulation paper from the german tobacco industry association -lrb- vdc -rrb- and presented it word for word as their own proposal for the negotiations . "
the german tobacco industry association -lrb- vdc -rrb- was unavailable for comment on its involvement in any parliamentary decisions or the extent of its influence over the government .
wolfgang hainer , head of the powerful vdc , who represents the interests of philip morris , british american tobacco , reemtsma and four other tobacco companies in germany recently told german weekly die zeit , " we collect information , channel the opinions of our members and then present the facts to the politicians . " the vdc is also said to organize regular parties at its headquarters in berlin which usually pulls in younger employees from the german ministries and the offices of parliamentarians . no such thing as a free lunch in lobbyists ' eyes germany is an important battleground for the pro-smoking lobby .
it is europe 's biggest tobacco market with about 22 million smokers , which is 27 percent of the population , according to the federal statistics office .
and with more and more eu countries cracking down on smokers , the hearts , minds and lungs of german smokers have become more valuable to the tobacco companies .
for the pro-smoking lobby to retain its advantage , alliances have to be formed with those in power .
" in germany , the tobacco lobby has a strong influence on the politicians , " pro rauchfrei 's ermer says .
" that begins with regular gifts directly to the desks of the delegates , and goes as far as direct payments for local government events and party meetings . "
" beyond that the delegates are invited regularly to meetings of the tobacco industry , the agendas of which are disguised by social topics .

the meeting , to be chaired by federal minister for health , ulla schmidt and consumer affairs minister , horst seehofer will be used to further discuss whether smoking in schools , public buildings and most restaurants should be banned by germany 's 16 federal states .
the decision to hand the responsibility for approving the ban to the individual states came after germany 's ruling coalition rescinded the original ban proposal on constitutional grounds in december last year .
the government said an outright federal ban could infringe on individual states ' rights , many of which can not be overridden by berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the states are responsible for issuing bans in public places it is the 16 states , not the federal government , which have power over local government facilities such as schools and hospitals , as well as places such as bars and restaurants - those places where the smoking ban was proposed .
pro-smoking lobbyists pulling the strings ?
the decision was also seen as another example of the german government 's unwillingness to confront the country 's powerful pro-smoking lobby which opposition politicians and anti-smoking campaigners believe holds too much influence over the ruling coalition of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
germany has been slow to follow the lead of those eu states which have already agreed and have implemented their own smoking bans .
france , italy and england have already passed laws that ban smoking in bars and restaurants , as well as public buildings , putting germany out of step with many of its european counterparts .
pressure from the anti-smoking lobby is suspected as being the reason why germany continues to lag behind .
but does the pro- lobby really have that amount of power , that the german government would defy european union directives to satisfy its wishes ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lobbyists are accused of pressuring the government " the pro-smoker lobby is stronger in germany than in any other european country , " siggi ermer , the chairman of pro rauchfrei , the german lobby for non-smokers said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 22.02.2007 " there is no cohesion of tv writing staff in germany " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the boys from " alarm für cobra 11 " give good lead german tv networks are taking their cues state-side in a bid to create better drama series .
dw-world.de caught up with la-based screenwriter matt witten to find out how projects like the " writer 's room " can help . the recent berlin film festival proved that german cinema is in fine fettle . but television is looking a lot less robust .
a record number of new shows are tanking spectacularly - take private station pro 7 's latest disaster , the much-hyped " crazy about clara . "
given that viewers loved " ally mcbeal " and " sex and the city , " they should have devoured a home-grown series about a 20-something city girl juggling work and relationships .
but no one was crazy about clara at all , and this enormously expensive series was shunted off into a late-night slot after just two episodes . but while viewers ca n't switch off german shows fast enough , they 're more addicted than ever to us imports , with most prime-time slots filled with the likes of " desperate housewives , " " medical investigation " and " er . "
the networks are realizing it 's time for a re-think - and are sending for the marines . organized by media consultancy mediaxchange , the third " writer 's room " recently took place in germany .
its goal is to bring together experienced us writers to work with their local counterparts in developing ideas for drama series to be sold to local channels and the international market .
guest of honor at january 's session was writer and producer matt witten - whose credits include " house m.d. , " " csi : miami " and " law & order . " dw-world.de asked him how it went . matt witten : it went well !
the german writers were talented and interesting and it was very productive .
we came up with some terrific ideas for shows and also i think it gave the german writers a good idea of how us tv shows run . did you see any german tv shows ? i saw " alarm für cobra 11 " and " lasko " -lrb- two series made by german production company " action concept , " which co-organized the event -rrb- .
one thing i noticed was that the action sequences were fabulous , probably better than anything i 've ever seen on american television .
you might see that kind of action in the movies but never on television .
the first episode i saw of " cobra 11 " had a 400 car pile-up !
" action concept " manages to do these incredible things on relatively small budgets , significantly less than those of american shows . so is us tv as good as it is often simply because of economies of scale ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " csi : miami " shows the way because we have more money to put into it ?
yes .
but we 've also been making tv in the us since 1950 .
we have a longer history - we 've been developing our tv for 50 years , so there might be some catch-up to do for german television .
but are americans inherently better writers than germans ?
no , of course not ! when you talked to the german participants in the writer 's room , did you get the impression that they need help to create good tv ? american shows tend to be pretty fast-paced and vigorously structured , and the way we structure the action and the conflict for our main characters has been thought through in ways that are fresh for german writers , they have n't necessarily heard it described in these terms .
so it gives them a new way of looking at the writing they 're doing .
they were also intrigued by the fact that in america we have staff writers who meet every day , and we have a head writer responsible for the consistency of the show - " the show-runner . "
these concepts are new in germany , where there is no cohesion of writing staff .
instead , episodes are written by freelancers who turn in maybe just two a year .
another thing in american tv is that directors do n't have the power to change the script without talking to the writer .
it makes sense that the writers are in charge because after all , they will be involved with all thirteen episodes in the series whereas a director is only involved with three or four . does that mean that german shows never quite rival american ones because of structures - because germany doesn ’ t have the same efficient systems in place that the us has ?
should germany focus more on this aspect of tv production ? i would agree with that .
when you have a good infrastructure the writers will also get better because of it - by being with the production for all 13 or 24 episodes , being around the other writers on set , working with the actors and the directors , getting involved with the editing .
better writing is an inevitable by-product .
" action concept " ceo hermann joha for one is very keen to run all his shows more according to this model .
he specifically wants to establish this kind of infrastructure and to introduce this way of working in germany . what germany has right now is a lot of shows billed as the german " sex and the city , " the german " law & order " etc .
but somehow they don ’ t really work .
what ’ s missing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans loved " sex and the city " for myself as a writer i feel that if you 're passionate about your show it has a good chance of becoming a success .
but you also need the infrastructure to carry that passion forward and make it workable for a 13 or 24 episode season , and i guess there 's a possibility that some of these aspects are lacking in germany . tv is essentially escapist , and germany still has a fascination with the us .
might german tv writers be fighting a losing battle , because their audiences are actually quite happy not to have home-grown shows ? my guess is that germans would respond really well to a terrific home-grown show .
it 's only logical .
i used to live in saratoga springs in upstate new york and i would always be intrigued by any novel set there .
i 'm jewish , so i always enjoy jewish novels .
if a story is somehow close to me i 'll be interested … .
i have two children and i 'm always interested in a story about a dad with kids .
so i can only imagine that if i were german i would want to watch shows in german , i would think : " hey , we germans can put out good shows too . "
i 'd feel proud . a lot of good series in the us are made by cable network hbo , so they don ’ t need mass appeal .
in germany , tv series need to work across the board .
is it easier for writers to maintain high standards when they know they only need to reach a certain audience ? yes , but it depends on your idea .
there are good network shows that do have mass appeal , and that does n't have to be a bad thing .
a lot of the shows i love are on hbo and it 's great to have these outlets .
shows like " the sopranos " and " nip / tuck " really push the envelope and that probably has the effect of making the broadcast networks better generally because it raises the bar .
germany could probably benefit from an equivalent .
it would be great if german tv writers did n't feel they had to get 50 million viewers . is there a risk that projects like the " writer ’ s room " might result in very homogenous shows ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the unlucky clara the structures and strategies we 're introducing to german writers and executives have nothing to do with content .
they will just lead to better shows .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 22.02.2007 " there is no cohesion of tv writing staff in germany " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the boys from " alarm für cobra 11 " give good lead german tv networks are taking their cues state-side in a bid to create better drama series .
dw-world.de caught up with la-based screenwriter matt witten to find out how projects like the " writer 's room " can help . the recent berlin film festival proved that german cinema is in fine fettle . but television is looking a lot less robust .
a record number of new shows are tanking spectacularly - take private station pro 7 's latest disaster , the much-hyped " crazy about clara . "
given that viewers loved " ally mcbeal " and " sex and the city , " they should have devoured a home-grown series about a 20-something city girl juggling work and relationships .
but no one was crazy about clara at all , and this enormously expensive series was shunted off into a late-night slot after just two episodes . but while viewers ca n't switch off german shows fast enough , they 're more addicted than ever to us imports , with most prime-time slots filled with the likes of " desperate housewives , " " medical investigation " and " er . "
the networks are realizing it 's time for a re-think - and are sending for the marines . organized by media consultancy mediaxchange , the third " writer 's room " recently took place in germany .
its goal is to bring together experienced us writers to work with their local counterparts in developing ideas for drama series to be sold to local channels and the international market .
guest of honor at january 's session was writer and producer matt witten - whose credits include " house m.d. , " " csi : miami " and " law & order . " dw-world.de asked him how it went . matt witten : it went well !
the german writers were talented and interesting and it was very productive .
we came up with some terrific ideas for shows and also i think it gave the german writers a good idea of how us tv shows run . did you see any german tv shows ? i saw " alarm für cobra 11 " and " lasko " -lrb- two series made by german production company " action concept , " which co-organized the event -rrb- .
one thing i noticed was that the action sequences were fabulous , probably better than anything i 've ever seen on american television .
you might see that kind of action in the movies but never on television .
the first episode i saw of " cobra 11 " had a 400 car pile-up !

' shocked and stunned ' for the february issue of youth and lifestyle glossy u _ mag , writer volker sievert sat down to chat with up-and-coming starlet hannah herzsprung .
but after providing the actress with the agreed-upon transcript of the interview , he said he was " shocked and stunned " when her final version came back . so much of the text had been excised that it looked more like it had been attacked by wartime censors than simply vetted for errors or slips of the tongue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the editors of u _ mag decided to show readers how modern media works " i really felt like i had been censored , " sievert wrote in an e-mail .
" i could n't understand this massive interference in the least . " as a result of herzsprung 's changes , sievert wrote , the interview was " almost grotesquely disfigured . "

" journalists are not legally required to have interview partners authorize their statements . … but unfortunately in germany , that has almost become common practice , " said hendrik zörner , spokesman for the german journalists ' association -lrb- djv -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der spiegel is known for letting subjects alter interviews , one commentator said big-name papers tend to " follow clearer journalistic practices , " while the smaller , local outlets that make up the majority of papers in the country , " might have to deal with certain interview partners more frequently , " and so are more likely to allow sources to sign off on interviews , zörner said . " this leads to the practice that looks a little like mutual back-scratching , " he added . good for everyone ? but ingrid kolb , director of the henri nannen school for journalism in hamburg , said some of the country 's biggest media outlets - for instance , renowned news magazines der spiegel and stern - are noted for the practice . " the long interviews that der spiegel publishes with famous public figures , their so-called talks , are known for this , " kolb said .
" they can go back and forth a dozen times , with each side bringing their argument a bit more to the point , refining it , improving it .
in a best-case scenario , it serves the interests of both sides . " if anything , the controversy certainly makes plain the mutual give-and-take relationship between public figures and the media : the one side in need of a platform to promote themselves and their ideas , the other constantly looking for interesting material to fill an ever expanding news hole . still , in the us , britain or australia , the idea of a journalist giving an interview subject a whack at editing his or her own comments after the fact would be grounds for derision , if not dismissal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the us , anything said " on the record " goes in the paper " i 'm aware that there is a big difference on this subject between the anglo-saxon world and the german world , " kolb said .
" but in germany it has become a custom to get a longer interview or quotes authorized . … in general the interview partner tells the journalist that he expects it . " ' scorched earth ' action according to kolb , printing an interview with the blacked out parts shown , like u _ mag did , is " essentially a scorched-earth kind of act .
this person will never have something to do with the publication again . " according to the journalists ' association 's zörner , the practice represents " a real weakness in german journalism ; journalists are much too ready to allow interview authorization . " " interviews are meant to serve an informative and explanatory function .
but if interviews are changed after the fact , they are no longer interviews .
they are pr texts , " he said . prior occurrence the hannah herzsprung case is n't the first time the issue of journalistic integrity has made headlines here .
the last time was in 2003 , when the press went on the attack against the government 's supposed " control mania . " back then , a group of the country 's heavyweight newspapers , including the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , die welt , süddeutsche zeitung and the financial times deutschland , all printed commentaries and articles deploring the practice of interview approval . most memorable was the move by leftist newspaper tageszeitung .
in an apparent bid to point up the notion that newsmakers need the press just as much as the press needs them , the paper printed a censored interview with the then secretary general of the social democrats - with all his responses blacked out in protest . ' no danger to democracy ' germany 's fourth estate has other , worse weaknesses , djv 's zörner notes .
a recent report by reporters without borders ranked the country a low 23nd in terms of press freedoms , based mostly on controversial government searches of newspaper offices . but " despite all the problems and dangers , " zörner said , overall , german journalism is " qualitatively very good . " " you ca n't say that -lrb- the practice of allowing interview revisions -rrb- poses a danger to democracy , " he said .
and after all , he pointed out , interviews are not the only tool reporters have . " there are reports , opinion pieces - there are many other forms of journalism available .

" according to the journalists ' association 's zörner , the practice represents " a real weakness in german journalism ; journalists are much too ready to allow interview authorization . " " interviews are meant to serve an informative and explanatory function .
but if interviews are changed after the fact , they are no longer interviews .
they are pr texts , " he said . prior occurrence the hannah herzsprung case is n't the first time the issue of journalistic integrity has made headlines here .
the last time was in 2003 , when the press went on the attack against the government 's supposed " control mania . " back then , a group of the country 's heavyweight newspapers , including the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , die welt , süddeutsche zeitung and the financial times deutschland , all printed commentaries and articles deploring the practice of interview approval . most memorable was the move by leftist newspaper tageszeitung .
in an apparent bid to point up the notion that newsmakers need the press just as much as the press needs them , the paper printed a censored interview with the then secretary general of the social democrats - with all his responses blacked out in protest . ' no danger to democracy ' germany 's fourth estate has other , worse weaknesses , djv 's zörner notes .
a recent report by reporters without borders ranked the country a low 23nd in terms of press freedoms , based mostly on controversial government searches of newspaper offices . but " despite all the problems and dangers , " zörner said , overall , german journalism is " qualitatively very good . " " you ca n't say that -lrb- the practice of allowing interview revisions -rrb- poses a danger to democracy , " he said .
and after all , he pointed out , interviews are not the only tool reporters have . " there are reports , opinion pieces - there are many other forms of journalism available .

she 's now under police protection after members received death threats . earlier this month , iran-born human rights activist mina ahadi founded the central council of ex-muslims , in the western-german city of cologne .
ahadi told the german news magazine focus : " i happened to be born in a muslim family , and i have decided not to be a muslim . "
that was the motivation for forming the group , whose members consists of some three dozen people who have turned their back on the religion .
ahadi 's decision to form the group is a controversial one considering that in most strictly islamic countries such as iran , saudi arabia , afghanistan , pakistan , sudan und mauritania , a muslim who rejects his or her religion faces the death sentence in accordance with the sharia law . other countries may not try apostates in a court of law , but they may be ostracized instead .
the topic is also sensitive in europe . an official renunciation of islam is almost unheard of .
death threats on the internet the name of ahadi 's group is also a play on the central council of muslims -lrb- zmd -rrb- , one of germany 's best-known umbrella muslim groups , also based in cologne .
the zmd is said to have around 800,00 members according to its own estimates .
ahadi , an exiled iranian living in germany , decided it was time to shine a light on the subject of born-muslims living in europe who do not want to be part of islam .
the aim of her organization , ahadi said , is to offer former muslims a voice in a country that is not represented by official muslim organizations , she told focus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green mp deligöz wanted to get rid of headscarves - and wound up with police protection but since the group 's formation , she told the magazine , she has been " terrorized . "
members of the group have gotten death threats via the internet .
about a week ago , the police approached ahadi and offered her protection .
the affair has echoes of another recent case in germany where green party politician ekin deligöz , who in october called for muslim women and girls to stop wearing head scarves , was also placed under police protection after receiving threats . at the same time ahadi is well aware of the taboos she is breaking with the founding of her group .
she said she could imagine " that there would be calls for a fatwa against us .
our project may also be discussed in the arab world . " in the coming week , members of the central council of ex-muslims have said they plan to hold a press conference to introduce the group to the public at large .
their slogan : " we have renounced . " defense for the secular ahadi told focus she is hoping the group can offer oppressed women a way to freedom , and defend secular people who live in germany and are integrated in the society here . " we want to improve society , to make it possible for us to get along better .
i hope for more peace , " the magazine quoted her as saying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european mp özdemir : looking for diverse images of islam in germany cem özdemir , a green politician fom germany with turkish roots at the european parliament told der spiegel magazine that ahadi 's project and the greens had something in common : both are hoping to expand the variety of images of islam in germany . " we have to understand , and deal with , the fact that 3.5 million muslims in germany are extremely heterogeneous .
some of them don ’ t have anything to do with religion , and do n't identify themselves as muslim , even if they were born to muslim families . still , özdemir told the magazine he did n't think the new group would attract many adherents .

she 's now under police protection after members received death threats . earlier this month , iran-born human rights activist mina ahadi founded the central council of ex-muslims , in the western-german city of cologne .
ahadi told the german news magazine focus : " i happened to be born in a muslim family , and i have decided not to be a muslim . "
that was the motivation for forming the group , whose members consists of some three dozen people who have turned their back on the religion .
ahadi 's decision to form the group is a controversial one considering that in most strictly islamic countries such as iran , saudi arabia , afghanistan , pakistan , sudan und mauritania , a muslim who rejects his or her religion faces the death sentence in accordance with the sharia law . other countries may not try apostates in a court of law , but they may be ostracized instead .
the topic is also sensitive in europe . an official renunciation of islam is almost unheard of .
death threats on the internet the name of ahadi 's group is also a play on the central council of muslims -lrb- zmd -rrb- , one of germany 's best-known umbrella muslim groups , also based in cologne .
the zmd is said to have around 800,00 members according to its own estimates .
ahadi , an exiled iranian living in germany , decided it was time to shine a light on the subject of born-muslims living in europe who do not want to be part of islam .
the aim of her organization , ahadi said , is to offer former muslims a voice in a country that is not represented by official muslim organizations , she told focus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green mp deligöz wanted to get rid of headscarves - and wound up with police protection but since the group 's formation , she told the magazine , she has been " terrorized . "
members of the group have gotten death threats via the internet .
about a week ago , the police approached ahadi and offered her protection .
the affair has echoes of another recent case in germany where green party politician ekin deligöz , who in october called for muslim women and girls to stop wearing head scarves , was also placed under police protection after receiving threats . at the same time ahadi is well aware of the taboos she is breaking with the founding of her group .
she said she could imagine " that there would be calls for a fatwa against us .
our project may also be discussed in the arab world . " in the coming week , members of the central council of ex-muslims have said they plan to hold a press conference to introduce the group to the public at large .
their slogan : " we have renounced . " defense for the secular ahadi told focus she is hoping the group can offer oppressed women a way to freedom , and defend secular people who live in germany and are integrated in the society here . " we want to improve society , to make it possible for us to get along better .
i hope for more peace , " the magazine quoted her as saying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european mp özdemir : looking for diverse images of islam in germany cem özdemir , a green politician fom germany with turkish roots at the european parliament told der spiegel magazine that ahadi 's project and the greens had something in common : both are hoping to expand the variety of images of islam in germany .

' shocked and stunned ' for the february issue of youth and lifestyle glossy u _ mag , writer volker sievert sat down to chat with up-and-coming starlet hannah herzsprung .
but after providing the actress with the agreed-upon transcript of the interview , he said he was " shocked and stunned " when her final version came back . so much of the text had been excised that it looked more like it had been attacked by wartime censors than simply vetted for errors or slips of the tongue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the editors of u _ mag decided to show readers how modern media works " i really felt like i had been censored , " sievert wrote in an e-mail .
" i could n't understand this massive interference in the least . " as a result of herzsprung 's changes , sievert wrote , the interview was " almost grotesquely disfigured . "
the end result is " something that resembles a self-promotional text more than a lively , vital interview , " he added . cozy relationship u _ mag 's response ?
print the interview in full - heavily blacked-out sections included . " we felt used , " sievert said .
" we decided to print the interview with the crossed out sections , to give our readers a look into the modern media landscape . " the event caused a stir in the german media and awoke a sleeping discussion on what some say is an overly-cozy relationship between the german press and public figures . " journalists are not legally required to have interview partners authorize their statements . … but unfortunately in germany , that has almost become common practice , " said hendrik zörner , spokesman for the german journalists ' association -lrb- djv -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der spiegel is known for letting subjects alter interviews , one commentator said big-name papers tend to " follow clearer journalistic practices , " while the smaller , local outlets that make up the majority of papers in the country , " might have to deal with certain interview partners more frequently , " and so are more likely to allow sources to sign off on interviews , zörner said . " this leads to the practice that looks a little like mutual back-scratching , " he added . good for everyone ? but ingrid kolb , director of the henri nannen school for journalism in hamburg , said some of the country 's biggest media outlets - for instance , renowned news magazines der spiegel and stern - are noted for the practice . " the long interviews that der spiegel publishes with famous public figures , their so-called talks , are known for this , " kolb said .
" they can go back and forth a dozen times , with each side bringing their argument a bit more to the point , refining it , improving it .
in a best-case scenario , it serves the interests of both sides . " if anything , the controversy certainly makes plain the mutual give-and-take relationship between public figures and the media : the one side in need of a platform to promote themselves and their ideas , the other constantly looking for interesting material to fill an ever expanding news hole . still , in the us , britain or australia , the idea of a journalist giving an interview subject a whack at editing his or her own comments after the fact would be grounds for derision , if not dismissal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the us , anything said " on the record " goes in the paper " i 'm aware that there is a big difference on this subject between the anglo-saxon world and the german world , " kolb said .
" but in germany it has become a custom to get a longer interview or quotes authorized . … in general the interview partner tells the journalist that he expects it . " ' scorched earth ' action according to kolb , printing an interview with the blacked out parts shown , like u _ mag did , is " essentially a scorched-earth kind of act .
this person will never have something to do with the publication again . " according to the journalists ' association 's zörner , the practice represents " a real weakness in german journalism ; journalists are much too ready to allow interview authorization . " " interviews are meant to serve an informative and explanatory function .
but if interviews are changed after the fact , they are no longer interviews .
they are pr texts , " he said . prior occurrence the hannah herzsprung case is n't the first time the issue of journalistic integrity has made headlines here .
the last time was in 2003 , when the press went on the attack against the government 's supposed " control mania . " back then , a group of the country 's heavyweight newspapers , including the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , die welt , süddeutsche zeitung and the financial times deutschland , all printed commentaries and articles deploring the practice of interview approval . most memorable was the move by leftist newspaper tageszeitung .
in an apparent bid to point up the notion that newsmakers need the press just as much as the press needs them , the paper printed a censored interview with the then secretary general of the social democrats - with all his responses blacked out in protest . ' no danger to democracy ' germany 's fourth estate has other , worse weaknesses , djv 's zörner notes .
a recent report by reporters without borders ranked the country a low 23nd in terms of press freedoms , based mostly on controversial government searches of newspaper offices . but " despite all the problems and dangers , " zörner said , overall , german journalism is " qualitatively very good . " " you ca n't say that -lrb- the practice of allowing interview revisions -rrb- poses a danger to democracy , " he said .
and after all , he pointed out , interviews are not the only tool reporters have . " there are reports , opinion pieces - there are many other forms of journalism available .

" back then , a group of the country 's heavyweight newspapers , including the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , die welt , süddeutsche zeitung and the financial times deutschland , all printed commentaries and articles deploring the practice of interview approval . most memorable was the move by leftist newspaper tageszeitung .
in an apparent bid to point up the notion that newsmakers need the press just as much as the press needs them , the paper printed a censored interview with the then secretary general of the social democrats - with all his responses blacked out in protest . ' no danger to democracy ' germany 's fourth estate has other , worse weaknesses , djv 's zörner notes .
a recent report by reporters without borders ranked the country a low 23nd in terms of press freedoms , based mostly on controversial government searches of newspaper offices . but " despite all the problems and dangers , " zörner said , overall , german journalism is " qualitatively very good . " " you ca n't say that -lrb- the practice of allowing interview revisions -rrb- poses a danger to democracy , " he said .
and after all , he pointed out , interviews are not the only tool reporters have . " there are reports , opinion pieces - there are many other forms of journalism available .

it stops short of granting full independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un envoy martti ahtisaari under the envoy 's plan , kosovo 's government would be overseen by a new european union-led mission which would take over from the un , which has administered the province since the end of the kosovo war in 1999 . as a final round of talks , expected to last into march , got underway in vienna on the un blueprint , dw-world.de spoke with fatmir sejdiu , president of kosovo , about the fate of the region . dw-world.de : mr. president , violence has increased in kosovo this month .
two people were killed on february 10 during outbreaks . this week , there was a bomb attack on united nations vehicles in pristina .
are the negotiations failing ? fatmir sejdiu : these developments are not helping the situation in kosovo - it 's been a dark day for kosovo since the outbursts occurred .
they have been violent protests and it was absolutely unnecessary for those two people to die . not only do the deaths mean a major loss for the families .
the severity of the attacks has a very negative effect on kosovo 's prospects .
it damages the political processes . of course , everyone has the right to protest and express his or her opinions , but it 's essential that this occurs within the framework of the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo president fatmir sejdiu i believe kosovo 's negotiating group has done its job .
we have clearly represented kosovo 's interests at all of the meetings in vienna , and it 's true that we have reached a consensus in all of our decisions .
this shows that we have represented the absolute majority of kosovo 's population and its institutions . before the talks in vienna began , kosovo 's negotiating group presented a list of contentious points .
do you believe that un special envoy ahtisaari 's scheme can still be altered during the negotiations ? perhaps .
there surely wo n't be any more major changes , but it could be that arguments we have presented will be integrated in some way .
we 'll have to wait and see .
however , we do not want to start debating ahtisaari 's recommendations all over again .
that would just mean an endless round of discussions which would n't go anywhere , other than putting kosovo at further risk .
it would jeopardize its future . i would like to point out that it 's essential that the un security council keep track of this process ; it 's that group which will hear the recommendations for the future of kosovo .
the political formulations and kosovo 's independence are central here . the serbian negotiating delegation has demanded that ahtisaari 's plan be divided into technical and political sections .
what 's your opinion on that ? i think belgrade 's interest during the discussions in vienna is prolonging them as much as possible , thereby discrediting them .
that would increase the tensions in kosovo - with the aim of trying to show that kosovo is not yet ready for independence , that it 's unstable , that it offers no prospects for its citizens , and especially , for its serbian citizens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were also demonstrations in pristina in november 2006 ahtisaari himself said two-thirds of his recommendations address the safety of serbs in kosovo alone .
serbs in kosovo , for their part , say ahtisaari 's plan is unfair because it treats all minorities in the region alike .
that would mean that the serbs - the largest minority in kosovo - should have more rights than , say , the roma or ashkali groups . it certainly is a major boost for the serbian minority in kosovo that ahtisaari has addressed the situation of their equality to such an extent .
of course , other minorities have also demanded the same rights as the serbian minority , although kosovo 's institutions have integrated these into their democratic processes .
that is why those parts of the plan addressing the safety of the serbian minority are based on international norms and standards .
there are even aspects which go well beyond normal international standards . bekim shehu interviewed fatmir sejdiu -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de serbia rejects un plan for kosovo serbia 's newly elected parliament has overwhelmingly voted against a un plan on the future of its breakaway province of kosovo as a violation of the country 's territorial integrity .

dw-world.de caught up with la-based screenwriter matt witten to find out how projects like the " writer 's room " can help . the recent berlin film festival proved that german cinema is in fine fettle . but television is looking a lot less robust .
a record number of new shows are tanking spectacularly - take private station pro 7 's latest disaster , the much-hyped " crazy about clara . "
given that viewers loved " ally mcbeal " and " sex and the city , " they should have devoured a home-grown series about a 20-something city girl juggling work and relationships .
but no one was crazy about clara at all , and this enormously expensive series was shunted off into a late-night slot after just two episodes . but while viewers ca n't switch off german shows fast enough , they 're more addicted than ever to us imports , with most prime-time slots filled with the likes of " desperate housewives , " " medical investigation " and " er . "
the networks are realizing it 's time for a re-think - and are sending for the marines . organized by media consultancy mediaxchange , the third " writer 's room " recently took place in germany .
its goal is to bring together experienced us writers to work with their local counterparts in developing ideas for drama series to be sold to local channels and the international market .
guest of honor at january 's session was writer and producer matt witten - whose credits include " house m.d. , " " csi : miami " and " law & order . " dw-world.de asked him how it went . matt witten : it went well !
the german writers were talented and interesting and it was very productive .
we came up with some terrific ideas for shows and also i think it gave the german writers a good idea of how us tv shows run . did you see any german tv shows ? i saw " alarm für cobra 11 " and " lasko " -lrb- two series made by german production company " action concept , " which co-organized the event -rrb- .
one thing i noticed was that the action sequences were fabulous , probably better than anything i 've ever seen on american television .
you might see that kind of action in the movies but never on television .
the first episode i saw of " cobra 11 " had a 400 car pile-up !
" action concept " manages to do these incredible things on relatively small budgets , significantly less than those of american shows . so is us tv as good as it is often simply because of economies of scale ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " csi : miami " shows the way because we have more money to put into it ?
yes .
but we 've also been making tv in the us since 1950 .
we have a longer history - we 've been developing our tv for 50 years , so there might be some catch-up to do for german television .
but are americans inherently better writers than germans ?
no , of course not ! when you talked to the german participants in the writer 's room , did you get the impression that they need help to create good tv ? american shows tend to be pretty fast-paced and vigorously structured , and the way we structure the action and the conflict for our main characters has been thought through in ways that are fresh for german writers , they have n't necessarily heard it described in these terms .
so it gives them a new way of looking at the writing they 're doing .
they were also intrigued by the fact that in america we have staff writers who meet every day , and we have a head writer responsible for the consistency of the show - " the show-runner . "
these concepts are new in germany , where there is no cohesion of writing staff .
instead , episodes are written by freelancers who turn in maybe just two a year .
another thing in american tv is that directors do n't have the power to change the script without talking to the writer .
it makes sense that the writers are in charge because after all , they will be involved with all thirteen episodes in the series whereas a director is only involved with three or four . does that mean that german shows never quite rival american ones because of structures - because germany doesn ’ t have the same efficient systems in place that the us has ?
should germany focus more on this aspect of tv production ? i would agree with that .
when you have a good infrastructure the writers will also get better because of it - by being with the production for all 13 or 24 episodes , being around the other writers on set , working with the actors and the directors , getting involved with the editing .
better writing is an inevitable by-product .
" action concept " ceo hermann joha for one is very keen to run all his shows more according to this model .
he specifically wants to establish this kind of infrastructure and to introduce this way of working in germany . what germany has right now is a lot of shows billed as the german " sex and the city , " the german " law & order " etc .
but somehow they don ’ t really work .
what ’ s missing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans loved " sex and the city " for myself as a writer i feel that if you 're passionate about your show it has a good chance of becoming a success .
but you also need the infrastructure to carry that passion forward and make it workable for a 13 or 24 episode season , and i guess there 's a possibility that some of these aspects are lacking in germany . tv is essentially escapist , and germany still has a fascination with the us .
might german tv writers be fighting a losing battle , because their audiences are actually quite happy not to have home-grown shows ? my guess is that germans would respond really well to a terrific home-grown show .
it 's only logical .
i used to live in saratoga springs in upstate new york and i would always be intrigued by any novel set there .
i 'm jewish , so i always enjoy jewish novels .
if a story is somehow close to me i 'll be interested … .
i have two children and i 'm always interested in a story about a dad with kids .
so i can only imagine that if i were german i would want to watch shows in german , i would think : " hey , we germans can put out good shows too . "
i 'd feel proud . a lot of good series in the us are made by cable network hbo , so they don ’ t need mass appeal .
in germany , tv series need to work across the board .
is it easier for writers to maintain high standards when they know they only need to reach a certain audience ? yes , but it depends on your idea .
there are good network shows that do have mass appeal , and that does n't have to be a bad thing .
a lot of the shows i love are on hbo and it 's great to have these outlets .
shows like " the sopranos " and " nip / tuck " really push the envelope and that probably has the effect of making the broadcast networks better generally because it raises the bar .
germany could probably benefit from an equivalent .
it would be great if german tv writers did n't feel they had to get 50 million viewers . is there a risk that projects like the " writer ’ s room " might result in very homogenous shows ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the unlucky clara the structures and strategies we 're introducing to german writers and executives have nothing to do with content .
they will just lead to better shows .

it stops short of granting full independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un envoy martti ahtisaari under the envoy 's plan , kosovo 's government would be overseen by a new european union-led mission which would take over from the un , which has administered the province since the end of the kosovo war in 1999 . as a final round of talks , expected to last into march , got underway in vienna on the un blueprint , dw-world.de spoke with fatmir sejdiu , president of kosovo , about the fate of the region . dw-world.de : mr. president , violence has increased in kosovo this month .
two people were killed on february 10 during outbreaks . this week , there was a bomb attack on united nations vehicles in pristina .
are the negotiations failing ? fatmir sejdiu : these developments are not helping the situation in kosovo - it 's been a dark day for kosovo since the outbursts occurred .
they have been violent protests and it was absolutely unnecessary for those two people to die . not only do the deaths mean a major loss for the families .
the severity of the attacks has a very negative effect on kosovo 's prospects .
it damages the political processes . of course , everyone has the right to protest and express his or her opinions , but it 's essential that this occurs within the framework of the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo president fatmir sejdiu i believe kosovo 's negotiating group has done its job .
we have clearly represented kosovo 's interests at all of the meetings in vienna , and it 's true that we have reached a consensus in all of our decisions .
this shows that we have represented the absolute majority of kosovo 's population and its institutions . before the talks in vienna began , kosovo 's negotiating group presented a list of contentious points .
do you believe that un special envoy ahtisaari 's scheme can still be altered during the negotiations ? perhaps .
there surely wo n't be any more major changes , but it could be that arguments we have presented will be integrated in some way .
we 'll have to wait and see .
however , we do not want to start debating ahtisaari 's recommendations all over again .
that would just mean an endless round of discussions which would n't go anywhere , other than putting kosovo at further risk .
it would jeopardize its future . i would like to point out that it 's essential that the un security council keep track of this process ; it 's that group which will hear the recommendations for the future of kosovo .
the political formulations and kosovo 's independence are central here . the serbian negotiating delegation has demanded that ahtisaari 's plan be divided into technical and political sections .
what 's your opinion on that ? i think belgrade 's interest during the discussions in vienna is prolonging them as much as possible , thereby discrediting them .
that would increase the tensions in kosovo - with the aim of trying to show that kosovo is not yet ready for independence , that it 's unstable , that it offers no prospects for its citizens , and especially , for its serbian citizens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were also demonstrations in pristina in november 2006 ahtisaari himself said two-thirds of his recommendations address the safety of serbs in kosovo alone .
serbs in kosovo , for their part , say ahtisaari 's plan is unfair because it treats all minorities in the region alike .
that would mean that the serbs - the largest minority in kosovo - should have more rights than , say , the roma or ashkali groups . it certainly is a major boost for the serbian minority in kosovo that ahtisaari has addressed the situation of their equality to such an extent .
of course , other minorities have also demanded the same rights as the serbian minority , although kosovo 's institutions have integrated these into their democratic processes .
that is why those parts of the plan addressing the safety of the serbian minority are based on international norms and standards .
there are even aspects which go well beyond normal international standards . bekim shehu interviewed fatmir sejdiu -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de serbia rejects un plan for kosovo serbia 's newly elected parliament has overwhelmingly voted against a un plan on the future of its breakaway province of kosovo as a violation of the country 's territorial integrity .

he could reject prodi 's resignation and ask him to seek a vote of confidence in parliament , or give him a mandate to form a new government . alternatively , he could give the mandate to a different center-left leader or an institutional figure .
a final option , seen as less likely at present , would be to call fresh elections that would take place in the spring . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi 's government lost a key vote over foreign policy in a drama reminiscent of italian politics of the 1980s and 1990s when governments sometimes lasted less than a week , prodi stepped down on wednesday , just nine months after assuming office , after he lost a key vote in parliament 's upper house over his government 's foreign policy .
the center-left government was forced onto the defensive over the deployment of 2,000 troops in afghanistan and the enlargement of a us military base in northern italy . both are policies most opposed by far-left parties within prodi 's coalition . opposition called for prodi 's resignation but it is the conservative opposition , led by silvio berlusconi , who was narrowly forced out of the prime minister 's office by prodi in an election last april , who led calls for prodi to go . right wing senators shouted " resign ! resign ! " after the result of the vote in the italian senate was announced .
prodi should " tender his resignation immediately , " declared berlusconi . the government needed 160 votes in the senate debate to get a formal motion of support .
but only 158 senators voted in favor and 136 opposed the government .
several left-wing senators were reportedly absent from the upper chamber . though it was not a formal vote of confidence , foreign minister massimo d 'alema said tuesday that the government would " go home " if it lost . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tide of public opinion can turn quickly , and brutally " it is a grave , serious and worrying fact to not obtain a majority for the speech of a foreign minister , " acknowledged vannino chiti , the minister for relations with parliament . immediately after , prodi held a crisis meeting with d 'alema , defence minister arturo parisi and deputy prime minister francesco rutelli . he then tendered his resignation to the president .
napolitano , who rushed back to rome from a visit to the provinces , said in a statement that he " reserves his decision " on the future of the government . under pressure over afghanistan d 'alema had to defend italy 's military mission in afghanistan to senators before the vote .
italy currently has around 2,000 troops deployed in the country as part of a nato-led peacekeeping mission . " it 's not a nato mission , but a united nations mission in which nato has an important military function , " d 'alema told the parliament . " it is a political and civil mission . "
the afghanistan deployment and the enlargement of the us base at vicenza in northern italy are both strongly opposed by the greens and communists who are part of a ruling coalition which also includes liberal and roman catholic parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters at a demonstration against the expansion of a us military base in vicenza more than 80,000 people took part in a rally last saturday in vicenza against the base enlargement . d 'alema said that to go back on the approval for the base that the prime minister gave last month for the base enlargement would be a " hostile act " toward the united states . no stranger to controversy prodi 's union coalition narrowly won an election in april last year that ended berlusconi 's five year-old government - one of the longest in recent italian political history . prodi is no stranger to the dangers of running italian governments . he resigned as prime minister in 1997 and 1998 when leading governments .

he could reject prodi 's resignation and ask him to seek a vote of confidence in parliament , or give him a mandate to form a new government . alternatively , he could give the mandate to a different center-left leader or an institutional figure .
a final option , seen as less likely at present , would be to call fresh elections that would take place in the spring . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi 's government lost a key vote over foreign policy in a drama reminiscent of italian politics of the 1980s and 1990s when governments sometimes lasted less than a week , prodi stepped down on wednesday , just nine months after assuming office , after he lost a key vote in parliament 's upper house over his government 's foreign policy .
the center-left government was forced onto the defensive over the deployment of 2,000 troops in afghanistan and the enlargement of a us military base in northern italy . both are policies most opposed by far-left parties within prodi 's coalition . opposition called for prodi 's resignation but it is the conservative opposition , led by silvio berlusconi , who was narrowly forced out of the prime minister 's office by prodi in an election last april , who led calls for prodi to go . right wing senators shouted " resign ! resign ! " after the result of the vote in the italian senate was announced .
prodi should " tender his resignation immediately , " declared berlusconi . the government needed 160 votes in the senate debate to get a formal motion of support .
but only 158 senators voted in favor and 136 opposed the government .
several left-wing senators were reportedly absent from the upper chamber . though it was not a formal vote of confidence , foreign minister massimo d 'alema said tuesday that the government would " go home " if it lost . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tide of public opinion can turn quickly , and brutally " it is a grave , serious and worrying fact to not obtain a majority for the speech of a foreign minister , " acknowledged vannino chiti , the minister for relations with parliament . immediately after , prodi held a crisis meeting with d 'alema , defence minister arturo parisi and deputy prime minister francesco rutelli . he then tendered his resignation to the president .
napolitano , who rushed back to rome from a visit to the provinces , said in a statement that he " reserves his decision " on the future of the government . under pressure over afghanistan d 'alema had to defend italy 's military mission in afghanistan to senators before the vote .
italy currently has around 2,000 troops deployed in the country as part of a nato-led peacekeeping mission . " it 's not a nato mission , but a united nations mission in which nato has an important military function , " d 'alema told the parliament . " it is a political and civil mission . "
the afghanistan deployment and the enlargement of the us base at vicenza in northern italy are both strongly opposed by the greens and communists who are part of a ruling coalition which also includes liberal and roman catholic parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters at a demonstration against the expansion of a us military base in vicenza more than 80,000 people took part in a rally last saturday in vicenza against the base enlargement . d 'alema said that to go back on the approval for the base that the prime minister gave last month for the base enlargement would be a " hostile act " toward the united states . no stranger to controversy prodi 's union coalition narrowly won an election in april last year that ended berlusconi 's five year-old government - one of the longest in recent italian political history . prodi is no stranger to the dangers of running italian governments . he resigned as prime minister in 1997 and 1998 when leading governments .

a final option , seen as less likely at present , would be to call fresh elections that would take place in the spring . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi 's government lost a key vote over foreign policy in a drama reminiscent of italian politics of the 1980s and 1990s when governments sometimes lasted less than a week , prodi stepped down on wednesday , just nine months after assuming office , after he lost a key vote in parliament 's upper house over his government 's foreign policy .
the center-left government was forced onto the defensive over the deployment of 2,000 troops in afghanistan and the enlargement of a us military base in northern italy . both are policies most opposed by far-left parties within prodi 's coalition . opposition called for prodi 's resignation but it is the conservative opposition , led by silvio berlusconi , who was narrowly forced out of the prime minister 's office by prodi in an election last april , who led calls for prodi to go . right wing senators shouted " resign ! resign !

prodi should " tender his resignation immediately , " declared berlusconi . the government needed 160 votes in the senate debate to get a formal motion of support .

napolitano , who rushed back to rome from a visit to the provinces , said in a statement that he " reserves his decision " on the future of the government . under pressure over afghanistan d 'alema had to defend italy 's military mission in afghanistan to senators before the vote .
italy currently has around 2,000 troops deployed in the country as part of a nato-led peacekeeping mission . " it 's not a nato mission , but a united nations mission in which nato has an important military function , " d 'alema told the parliament . " it is a political and civil mission . "

now , german chancellor angela merkel also boasts one , 60 miles north of berlin . a magnificent 1738-built baroque-style property called schloss meseberg -lrb- castle meseberg -rrb- is situated in the eastern state of brandenburg encircling berlin . on friday , german chancellor angela merkel will play host at the castle for the first time to french president jacques chirac , during one of their regular german-franco consultations . under a deal reached with the messerschmidt foundation - a privately-owned organization that bought the castle in the mid-nineties - the government will be allowed to use the property as its guesthouse for high-ranking officials over a 20-year period at a rent of just one euro a year . the government for its part has in the past year spent 13 million euros -lrb- $ 17 million -rrb- modernizing its kitchen and heating facilities and by ensuring its security and technical facilities are also state-of-the-art . mixed feelings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques chirac will be merkel 's first guest at meseberg while there is general satisfaction in brandenburg that a worthy role has been found for the magnificently-restored property , feelings in meseberg -lrb- population 135 -rrb- are mixed . the decision to renew the 1.7 kilometer-long -lrb- 1 mile -rrb- approach road to the castle has raised eyebrows in the village even though community officials say the rough-surfaced , pot-holed road , was in dire need of repair . the main cost will be borne by the german government and brandenburg state , but villagers with properties along the route are also being called on to make contributions , ranging from 2,000 to 15,000 euros . where were they before ? evelyn briesmeister , 65 , a village resident , is furious . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the castle has been meticulously restored to its past splendor " the state of the road did n't bother a soul in earlier times , " briesmeister said .
" now , because government officials will be driving cars along it to the schloss the whole village is made poor . " her husband , horst briesemeister , 70 , agrees .
both have signed a citizen 's petition in protest . frank stege , 45 , the district 's head official claims the decision to renew the approach road at a cost of 1.2 million euros was taken in december 2005 . " we aim to make the payments socially tolerable for the villagers , " he said . transfer of power in the old federal republic during the years of division , the government 's official guesthouse was to be found atop a hill overlooking the rhine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meseberg is probably the cheapest castle in the world : the german government will be renting it for 1 euro per year nick-named the " rotunde " -lrb- rotunda -rrb- with its 23 conference rooms , it played host to a whole list of world leaders in the post-war years , ranging from leonid breschnev to bill clinton , the shah of persia to queen elizabeth of england . but after german reunification and the controversial political " power transfer " from bonn to berlin in 1999 , it was clear a new government guesthouse would have to be found closer to the old-new capital . schloss meseberg received little consideration at the time .
situated in the former gdr -lrb- east germany -rrb- , it was just one of a series of decaying country retreats which had fallen on hard times during the communist era . then , the munich-based messerschmidt foundation , a private organization that renovates dilapidated monuments across germany , acquired the castle in the mid-1990s , and spent 25 million euros over the next 10 years restoring it . footing the bill the brandenburg state government , it was thought , would find a role for the castle and was miffed when matthias platzeck , the state 's premier , ultimately rejected the idea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last summer , merkel welcomed george w. bush in her constituency in stralsund but platzeck did toss the idea to then german chancellor gerhard schröder who was seeking a suitable venue for summer government conclaves and a place for putting up high-ranking foreign visitors . his dilemma was spotlighted in early 2005 when president bush arrived for a visit .
concern about his safety led to a planned berlin stop-over being moved to mainz , near frankfurt . late last month , german chancellory minister thomas de maiziere was handed a symbolic key to schloss meseberg . referring to the castle as a government venue for international conferences and foreign guests making overnight stays , de maiziere predicted that " history would be written in the meseberg meetings of the future .

two people were killed on february 10 during outbreaks . this week , there was a bomb attack on united nations vehicles in pristina .
are the negotiations failing ? fatmir sejdiu : these developments are not helping the situation in kosovo - it 's been a dark day for kosovo since the outbursts occurred .
they have been violent protests and it was absolutely unnecessary for those two people to die . not only do the deaths mean a major loss for the families .
the severity of the attacks has a very negative effect on kosovo 's prospects .
it damages the political processes . of course , everyone has the right to protest and express his or her opinions , but it 's essential that this occurs within the framework of the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo president fatmir sejdiu i believe kosovo 's negotiating group has done its job .
we have clearly represented kosovo 's interests at all of the meetings in vienna , and it 's true that we have reached a consensus in all of our decisions .
this shows that we have represented the absolute majority of kosovo 's population and its institutions . before the talks in vienna began , kosovo 's negotiating group presented a list of contentious points .
do you believe that un special envoy ahtisaari 's scheme can still be altered during the negotiations ? perhaps .
there surely wo n't be any more major changes , but it could be that arguments we have presented will be integrated in some way .
we 'll have to wait and see .
however , we do not want to start debating ahtisaari 's recommendations all over again .
that would just mean an endless round of discussions which would n't go anywhere , other than putting kosovo at further risk .
it would jeopardize its future . i would like to point out that it 's essential that the un security council keep track of this process ; it 's that group which will hear the recommendations for the future of kosovo .
the political formulations and kosovo 's independence are central here . the serbian negotiating delegation has demanded that ahtisaari 's plan be divided into technical and political sections .
what 's your opinion on that ? i think belgrade 's interest during the discussions in vienna is prolonging them as much as possible , thereby discrediting them .
that would increase the tensions in kosovo - with the aim of trying to show that kosovo is not yet ready for independence , that it 's unstable , that it offers no prospects for its citizens , and especially , for its serbian citizens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were also demonstrations in pristina in november 2006 ahtisaari himself said two-thirds of his recommendations address the safety of serbs in kosovo alone .
serbs in kosovo , for their part , say ahtisaari 's plan is unfair because it treats all minorities in the region alike .
that would mean that the serbs - the largest minority in kosovo - should have more rights than , say , the roma or ashkali groups . it certainly is a major boost for the serbian minority in kosovo that ahtisaari has addressed the situation of their equality to such an extent .
of course , other minorities have also demanded the same rights as the serbian minority , although kosovo 's institutions have integrated these into their democratic processes .

but he also has the option of choosing a new government leader from the center-left coalition , appointing a technocrat government or dissolving parliament and calling new elections . while fresh elections are considered unlikely , the economic daily il sole 24 ore warned thursday against prodi 's simple reinstatement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's president giorgio napolitano is scrambling for a new government " experience shows that -lrb- such -rrb- governments are always mediocre , especially when the differences that brought about the crisis are not resolved , " it said in an editorial . and franco pavoncello of rome 's john cabot university said it was " highly improbable " that napolitano would call an election after the current round of consultations . foreign policy trip-up " i do n't think it will happen , " he told german news agency dpa .
" italy needs to change its electoral system first and ensure that the new law produces more stable governments in the future , " pavoncello said . gianfranco pasquino of john hopkins university told sky italia television he expected the president would ask prodi to stay on , but only after ensuring " he has a workable majority " in the senate . prodi stepped down on wednesday , just nine months after he assumed office , after losing a key vote in parliament 's upper house over his government 's foreign policy . a government-sponsored motion received just 158 votes in favor , two short of the required majority of 160 .
a total of 136 lawmakers voted against and 24 , including two far-left dissidents , abstained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's foreign policy proved prodi 's undoing the two communist senators in prodi 's coalition , who are staunchly opposed to the planned enlargement of a us military base in northern italy , tipped the balance with their crucial " no " votes . giovanni sartori , one of italy 's leading constitutional experts , said the president could decide to form an " institutional " or " technocrat " government backed by an enlarged majority . " the last thing to do would be to go to the polls , " sartori told sky italia . berlusconi law prodi assumed office in may of last year after defeating silvio berlusconi in april 's general election , the closest in modern italian history . a convoluted electoral law approved by berlusconi in the final weeks of the past legislature ensured that a future government would be guaranteed a comfortable majority in the chamber of deputies , but not in the senate . prodi had been commanding a wafer-thin majority in the upper house and lost wednesday 's vote because two far-left dissident lawmakers refused to back it in disagreement at italy 's peacekeeping mission in afghanistan . napolitano began his round of consultations by meeting the presidents of the two branches of parliament , fausto bertinotti and franco marini , ahead of talks with former italian presidents and party leaders friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did prodi 's departure open the door for berlusconi , again ?
berlusconi , who leads prodi in latest opinion polls , wednesday called for fresh elections . searching for alternatives but many of his center-right allies were thursday conceding that napolitano would explore alternative solutions to the crisis first . " we would like elections , but our alternative is to find a transitional solution to solve the big problems facing the country , " said renato schifani , a whip in berlusconi 's forza italia party . the catholic udc , a small but influential opposition party that has been distancing itself from berlusconi since last year 's election defeat , has said it may decide to join a new government , but only if there is " discontinuity " with the previous administration . all of the nine center-left ruling parties have indicated that they want prodi to stay on as premier . napolitano was expected to make a decision on prodi 's future on friday evening or saturday at the latest . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italian president looks for post-prodi direction italy 's president was to consult with party and government leaders on the future of the government thursday , following the resignation of prime minister romano prodi wednesday .

for bavarian leader , it 's same difference großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a german tradition : mixing politics with beer in his last grand speech as bavarian premier , edmund stoiber got a little confused .
or did he ?
after 30 years in politics and countless slips of the tongue , maybe he finally knew what he was doing . jan .
18 , 2007 , will go down in history as germany thought it had gone seriously hard of hearing .
millions of german television viewers cranked up the volume on their tv sets as their jaws dropped collectively in the most unifying moment of national self-awareness since the world cup .
there are unconfirmed reports that bavarian maternity hospitals went practically silent as thousands of babies - inexplicably sensing that something big was happening - stopped crying . on that solemn day , premier of bavaria and chairman of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , edmund stoiber announced he was going to step down in september - after his own party decided that enough was enough . to an outsider , this may not seem like such a big deal .
politicians come and go .
in most parts of the world - with the exception , perhaps , of north korea , where presidents remain in power even after they 've gone to the communist version of heaven - the news of a politician stepping down is no more extraordinary than reports of paula abdul being drunk on american idol , again . bavaria , however , is a unique gem in the german federal system and stoiber , an exceptional personality on the german political scene . life after stoiber - is it possible ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bye-bye , eddie !
you 'll be missed !
edmund stoiber has been the alpha and omega of bavarian politics for so long that his supporters and his critics began to see in him something more than a politician : a symbol of constancy and a monument to the bavarian way of life . many a german politician would sell their mother to get the kind of popularity that stoiber has enjoyed in his neck of the woods - the most pious but also the most beer-drinking of all german states , a folksy dream come true . so everybody was , understandably , emotional about stoiber 's speech at a post-carnival , beer-bash on wednesday , most likely , the last grand speech in his political career .
mixing wishful thinking with political blindness , stoiber told his followers not to worry - and warned his opponents not to get their hopes up - by sounding totally convinced that nothing would change in bavaria after his departure , that everything would stay the same .
everybody cheered . what 's in a name ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leonid brezhnev probably never thought he could be mistaken for a us president the gentleman that he is , stoiber was going to compliment german chancellor merkel on her tough stance against us president george w. bush .
but that 's where things got a little complicated . " i found it refreshing , " stoiber said , " that the chancelor criticized guantanamo in front of us president brezhnev . " us president brezhnev ?
hello , bavaria , this is earth speaking !
what was edmund stoiber thinking when he mixed up bush - himself a master of the freudian slip - and brezhnev - a man who loved vodka as much as communism ? he 's done it before stoiber is known for not always saying the right thing .
the country is laughing to this day about the time he addressed sabine christiansen - the people 's princess of german political talk shows - as " frau merkel . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel is friendly but tough with the real us president admittedly , not all of his faux pas were equally entertaining .
the entire population of eastern germany , for instance , was not in the least amused when stoiber - during the 2005 election run-up - called them " the frustrated ones " and said he was not leaving the country 's fate to them . stoiber has raised his inability to form complete sentences to the level of rhetorical bravado .
one of his speeches about the transrapid railway system , for example , has inspired numerous music geeks to remix his staccato gobbledygook into a musical and poetic firework that became an instant success on the german-speaking internet . very few politicians get to have their speeches set to cheap techno or german rap .
but stoiber is not like other politicians .
he could easily make the transition from herr prime minister to mc kool dawg eddie and land a contract with a major record label , without even trying . a new career in sight ? various theories are circulating about his latest slip of the tongue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no , it 's not brezhnev in the background .
it 's theo waigel unlike former chancellor schröder - who , by general agreement , must have had a little too much to drink on the night of the 2005 elections , which made him sound overoptimistic and belligerent on tv that night - stoiber seemed as sober as the uncrowned king of bavaria could possibly be . some claim that it was the sight of another fellow conservative , politician theo waigel in the audience that triggered the confusion .
weigel - the owner of the most impressive unibrow on the german political scene - could be said to resemble leonid brezhnev , at least as far as excess hair between their eyebrows is concerned . but what if this was not a slip of the tongue at all ?
what if stoiber - by consciously comparing us president bush to a soviet communist dictator - was simply preparing himself for a career in the exciting business of human rights ?
everybody 's criticizing bush these days , so why not ?
or was stoiber preparing to enter the world of stand-up comedy ? is stoiber going the heide simonis way ? just like heide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heide simonis , left , did not make a smooth transition to entertainment simonis was a social democratic politician and prime minister of schleswig-holstein .
after her own election debacle in 2005 -lrb- when members of her own party refused to elect her in four consecutive ballots in the state parliament -rrb- , she became head of the german unicef . in the weirdest pr miscalculation of the year , simonis , with her stiff posture and absolute lack of any sense of humor , became the laughing stock of the entire nation with her consistently horrifying performance in the tv contest " let 's dance " last year . stoiber would probably never do such a thing - prance around with celebrities and ballroom dancing stars .
but he may consider a political comedy show .
" late night with eddie - the other side of politics " or " laughing with eddie - unplugged and unscripted . " if only germany were that lucky . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " germany is certainly facing serious problems , but it 's also important not to forget to laugh once in a while .

for bavarian leader , it 's same difference großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a german tradition : mixing politics with beer in his last grand speech as bavarian premier , edmund stoiber got a little confused .
or did he ?
after 30 years in politics and countless slips of the tongue , maybe he finally knew what he was doing . jan .
18 , 2007 , will go down in history as germany thought it had gone seriously hard of hearing .
millions of german television viewers cranked up the volume on their tv sets as their jaws dropped collectively in the most unifying moment of national self-awareness since the world cup .
there are unconfirmed reports that bavarian maternity hospitals went practically silent as thousands of babies - inexplicably sensing that something big was happening - stopped crying . on that solemn day , premier of bavaria and chairman of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , edmund stoiber announced he was going to step down in september - after his own party decided that enough was enough . to an outsider , this may not seem like such a big deal .
politicians come and go .
in most parts of the world - with the exception , perhaps , of north korea , where presidents remain in power even after they 've gone to the communist version of heaven - the news of a politician stepping down is no more extraordinary than reports of paula abdul being drunk on american idol , again . bavaria , however , is a unique gem in the german federal system and stoiber , an exceptional personality on the german political scene . life after stoiber - is it possible ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bye-bye , eddie !
you 'll be missed !
edmund stoiber has been the alpha and omega of bavarian politics for so long that his supporters and his critics began to see in him something more than a politician : a symbol of constancy and a monument to the bavarian way of life . many a german politician would sell their mother to get the kind of popularity that stoiber has enjoyed in his neck of the woods - the most pious but also the most beer-drinking of all german states , a folksy dream come true . so everybody was , understandably , emotional about stoiber 's speech at a post-carnival , beer-bash on wednesday , most likely , the last grand speech in his political career .
mixing wishful thinking with political blindness , stoiber told his followers not to worry - and warned his opponents not to get their hopes up - by sounding totally convinced that nothing would change in bavaria after his departure , that everything would stay the same .
everybody cheered . what 's in a name ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leonid brezhnev probably never thought he could be mistaken for a us president the gentleman that he is , stoiber was going to compliment german chancellor merkel on her tough stance against us president george w. bush .
but that 's where things got a little complicated . " i found it refreshing , " stoiber said , " that the chancelor criticized guantanamo in front of us president brezhnev . " us president brezhnev ?
hello , bavaria , this is earth speaking !
what was edmund stoiber thinking when he mixed up bush - himself a master of the freudian slip - and brezhnev - a man who loved vodka as much as communism ? he 's done it before stoiber is known for not always saying the right thing .
the country is laughing to this day about the time he addressed sabine christiansen - the people 's princess of german political talk shows - as " frau merkel . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel is friendly but tough with the real us president admittedly , not all of his faux pas were equally entertaining .
the entire population of eastern germany , for instance , was not in the least amused when stoiber - during the 2005 election run-up - called them " the frustrated ones " and said he was not leaving the country 's fate to them . stoiber has raised his inability to form complete sentences to the level of rhetorical bravado .
one of his speeches about the transrapid railway system , for example , has inspired numerous music geeks to remix his staccato gobbledygook into a musical and poetic firework that became an instant success on the german-speaking internet . very few politicians get to have their speeches set to cheap techno or german rap .
but stoiber is not like other politicians .
he could easily make the transition from herr prime minister to mc kool dawg eddie and land a contract with a major record label , without even trying . a new career in sight ? various theories are circulating about his latest slip of the tongue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no , it 's not brezhnev in the background .
it 's theo waigel unlike former chancellor schröder - who , by general agreement , must have had a little too much to drink on the night of the 2005 elections , which made him sound overoptimistic and belligerent on tv that night - stoiber seemed as sober as the uncrowned king of bavaria could possibly be . some claim that it was the sight of another fellow conservative , politician theo waigel in the audience that triggered the confusion .
weigel - the owner of the most impressive unibrow on the german political scene - could be said to resemble leonid brezhnev , at least as far as excess hair between their eyebrows is concerned . but what if this was not a slip of the tongue at all ?
what if stoiber - by consciously comparing us president bush to a soviet communist dictator - was simply preparing himself for a career in the exciting business of human rights ?
everybody 's criticizing bush these days , so why not ?
or was stoiber preparing to enter the world of stand-up comedy ? is stoiber going the heide simonis way ? just like heide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heide simonis , left , did not make a smooth transition to entertainment simonis was a social democratic politician and prime minister of schleswig-holstein .

see what other readers experienced while traveling in germany . my husband and i visited berlin in august 2006 .
it 's really a great city to stay in .
the people are very polite and helpful .
we do not speak german , but everybody always tried to help us and i think this is really important when you are in a place where you do n't know the language .
we stayed for only three days but we intend to be back soon and stay longer . - aurelia cofré , curitiba , brazil i went to germany to visit the in-laws in the siegen area in september of 2006 .
i had one heck of a time getting dollars changed to euros !
i could n't even find a bank in dresden that would do it .
next time i go , i 'll get more money changed at the airport before ever stepping on the plane .
thank goodness i had the sense to change $ 200 dollars for euros in denver .
if my niece andrea had n't had a friend at the local branch bank in wilgersdorf who changed another couple hundred dollars for me as a favor to andrea , i 'd really have been in a pickle . - laurie kunze editor 's tip : getting cash straight from the atm always has the best exchange rate , even if you have to pay a small fee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nürnberger bratwurst is a highlight for one traveler to germany i have visited germany eight times and will soon make my ninth visit .
i usually stay three weeks at a time , and cram as much sightseeing in as possible .
i ca n't say which are my favorite places , because i love the whole country .
i suppose my favorites would be any of the smaller villages and cities .
i 've been from düsseldorf to bavaria and everywhere in between . - peggy carter adams once you visit germany , you want to return again and again .
i could go on and on about what i enjoy about germany .
beginning with the delicious food , especially the breakfast , spätzle , nürnberger sausage , the high quality of draught beer , the autobahn and excellent driving etiquette , polite and courteous people , beer gardens , the black forest , bavaria , the history in berlin , and lots more .
i ca n't wait to return to germany ! - scott m. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keep an eye on your keys while traveling my pregnant wife , my daughter , my niece , her friend and i rented a home in birkenhordt -lrb- rheinland-pfalz -rrb- for a week .
we entered the home , laid the keys down on a table in the entranceway and began to look around .
all of the ladies decided to go out into the backyard and i went out front to begin to bring in the luggage .
the doors closed behind us and we did n't realize that they locked automatically .
five minutes after getting to the house , we were locked out .
we then spent the next one half hour trying to explain to the older gentleman from whom we had gotten the first set of keys that the americans had quickly locked themselves out of their own home and needed another key to get in .

oslo considers un talks on the issue last year a failure and hopes to launch efforts for an international ban backed by germany . representatives from over 40 countries and international organizations are gathering in oslo on thursday and friday to discuss ways to outlaw cluster bombs .
norway and other nations in favor of a ban are being hampered by nations that oppose one . the scandinavian country hopes the two-day meeting , which will be attended by senior ministry officials from around the world , will be the start of a process that will ultimately lead to the adoption of an international ban - even without the support of some key countries , such as opponents britain and the united states . " it is better that the like-minded -lrb- pro-ban -rrb- nations work in the same direction , " said raymond johansen , norway 's state secretary of foreign affairs .
he said that an international accord would put pressure on anti-ban nations to eventually comply . the pro-ban countries expected to be represented include norway , sweden , germany , mozambique and angola .
on the other side , britain , canada , france , china , india and russia belong to those opposed .
the united states , which is also opposed , will not be in attendance . several un organizations will also attend , as well as the cluster munition coalition -lrb- cmc -rrb- , the umbrella organization grouping non-governmental organizations campaigning for a ban . " it 's a double whammy . " a cluster bomb consists of a container holding up to hundreds of smaller so-called bomblets .
it opens in mid-air and disperses these grenades over a large area .
cluster munitions are stockpiled by most countries ' armies and have often been used in the past 40 years , most recently during the war in lebanon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demining unexploded cluster bombs in lebanon is dangerous work opponents of cluster munitions consider these weapons an unacceptable danger to civilians . " it 's a double whammy , " said cmc 's co-chairman steve goose .
" at the time of the attack , the bomblets spread over a large area and they can not be guided .
a large number of them do not explode upon impact , and so they can kill years later . "
he said that cluster bombs disproportionately target civilians . " cluster munitions caused more civilian casualties during the -lrb- last -rrb- iraq war and in kosovo than any other type of weapon , " goose said . proponents of a ban argue that a prohibition is achievable .
they point to the 1997 mine ban treaty that banned the production , stockpiling and use of anti-personnel landmines - also the result of a norwegian initiative . " the landmine treaty created a powerful standard , " goose said .
" we think the same can happen with cluster munitions . " can a ban influence the right countries ? some experts remain cautious about a ban , though . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unexploded cluster munitions threaten civilians even after a conflict is over " the worry is that , with cluster munitions , it will be a treaty binding those who are already in agreement , but wo n't touch those countries that are affected by them , or manufacture them , " said nicholas sims , an expert on arms limitation at the london school of economics and political science . that fear is compounded by the fact that the united states , russia , china , britain and france - the five permanent members of the un security council - are against an international ban on cluster munitions . another source of concern touches the scope of the ban .
non-governmental organizations are calling for a comprehensive ban on the production , stockpiling and use of all types of cluster munitions .
however , even a pro-ban nation like norway has suggested that a ban could exclude certain types of cluster munitions , such as those that self-destruct on impact . the norwegian government decided to host the conference , as it considered the latest un talks on the issue , held in geneva in november , a failure . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court considers national accountability in foreign missions a kosovo man whose son was killed by a nato cluster bomb took france to europe 's top human rights court wednesday over the boy 's death .

oslo considers un talks on the issue last year a failure and hopes to launch efforts for an international ban backed by germany . representatives from over 40 countries and international organizations are gathering in oslo on thursday and friday to discuss ways to outlaw cluster bombs .
norway and other nations in favor of a ban are being hampered by nations that oppose one . the scandinavian country hopes the two-day meeting , which will be attended by senior ministry officials from around the world , will be the start of a process that will ultimately lead to the adoption of an international ban - even without the support of some key countries , such as opponents britain and the united states . " it is better that the like-minded -lrb- pro-ban -rrb- nations work in the same direction , " said raymond johansen , norway 's state secretary of foreign affairs .
he said that an international accord would put pressure on anti-ban nations to eventually comply . the pro-ban countries expected to be represented include norway , sweden , germany , mozambique and angola .
on the other side , britain , canada , france , china , india and russia belong to those opposed .
the united states , which is also opposed , will not be in attendance . several un organizations will also attend , as well as the cluster munition coalition -lrb- cmc -rrb- , the umbrella organization grouping non-governmental organizations campaigning for a ban .

" at the time of the attack , the bomblets spread over a large area and they can not be guided .

he said that cluster bombs disproportionately target civilians . " cluster munitions caused more civilian casualties during the -lrb- last -rrb- iraq war and in kosovo than any other type of weapon , " goose said . proponents of a ban argue that a prohibition is achievable .
they point to the 1997 mine ban treaty that banned the production , stockpiling and use of anti-personnel landmines - also the result of a norwegian initiative . " the landmine treaty created a powerful standard , " goose said .

non-governmental organizations are calling for a comprehensive ban on the production , stockpiling and use of all types of cluster munitions .
however , even a pro-ban nation like norway has suggested that a ban could exclude certain types of cluster munitions , such as those that self-destruct on impact . the norwegian government decided to host the conference , as it considered the latest un talks on the issue , held in geneva in november , a failure . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court considers national accountability in foreign missions a kosovo man whose son was killed by a nato cluster bomb took france to europe 's top human rights court wednesday over the boy 's death .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 22.02.2007 " there is no cohesion of tv writing staff in germany " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the boys from " alarm für cobra 11 " give good lead german tv networks are taking their cues state-side in a bid to create better drama series .
dw-world.de caught up with la-based screenwriter matt witten to find out how projects like the " writer 's room " can help . the recent berlin film festival proved that german cinema is in fine fettle . but television is looking a lot less robust .
a record number of new shows are tanking spectacularly - take private station pro 7 's latest disaster , the much-hyped " crazy about clara . "
given that viewers loved " ally mcbeal " and " sex and the city , " they should have devoured a home-grown series about a 20-something city girl juggling work and relationships .
but no one was crazy about clara at all , and this enormously expensive series was shunted off into a late-night slot after just two episodes . but while viewers ca n't switch off german shows fast enough , they 're more addicted than ever to us imports , with most prime-time slots filled with the likes of " desperate housewives , " " medical investigation " and " er . "
the networks are realizing it 's time for a re-think - and are sending for the marines . organized by media consultancy mediaxchange , the third " writer 's room " recently took place in germany .
its goal is to bring together experienced us writers to work with their local counterparts in developing ideas for drama series to be sold to local channels and the international market .
guest of honor at january 's session was writer and producer matt witten - whose credits include " house m.d. , " " csi : miami " and " law & order . " dw-world.de asked him how it went . matt witten : it went well !
the german writers were talented and interesting and it was very productive .
we came up with some terrific ideas for shows and also i think it gave the german writers a good idea of how us tv shows run . did you see any german tv shows ? i saw " alarm für cobra 11 " and " lasko " -lrb- two series made by german production company " action concept , " which co-organized the event -rrb- .
one thing i noticed was that the action sequences were fabulous , probably better than anything i 've ever seen on american television .
you might see that kind of action in the movies but never on television .
the first episode i saw of " cobra 11 " had a 400 car pile-up !
" action concept " manages to do these incredible things on relatively small budgets , significantly less than those of american shows . so is us tv as good as it is often simply because of economies of scale ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " csi : miami " shows the way because we have more money to put into it ?
yes .
but we 've also been making tv in the us since 1950 .
we have a longer history - we 've been developing our tv for 50 years , so there might be some catch-up to do for german television .
but are americans inherently better writers than germans ?
no , of course not ! when you talked to the german participants in the writer 's room , did you get the impression that they need help to create good tv ? american shows tend to be pretty fast-paced and vigorously structured , and the way we structure the action and the conflict for our main characters has been thought through in ways that are fresh for german writers , they have n't necessarily heard it described in these terms .
so it gives them a new way of looking at the writing they 're doing .
they were also intrigued by the fact that in america we have staff writers who meet every day , and we have a head writer responsible for the consistency of the show - " the show-runner . "
these concepts are new in germany , where there is no cohesion of writing staff .
instead , episodes are written by freelancers who turn in maybe just two a year .
another thing in american tv is that directors do n't have the power to change the script without talking to the writer .
it makes sense that the writers are in charge because after all , they will be involved with all thirteen episodes in the series whereas a director is only involved with three or four . does that mean that german shows never quite rival american ones because of structures - because germany doesn ’ t have the same efficient systems in place that the us has ?
should germany focus more on this aspect of tv production ? i would agree with that .
when you have a good infrastructure the writers will also get better because of it - by being with the production for all 13 or 24 episodes , being around the other writers on set , working with the actors and the directors , getting involved with the editing .
better writing is an inevitable by-product .
" action concept " ceo hermann joha for one is very keen to run all his shows more according to this model .
he specifically wants to establish this kind of infrastructure and to introduce this way of working in germany . what germany has right now is a lot of shows billed as the german " sex and the city , " the german " law & order " etc .
but somehow they don ’ t really work .
what ’ s missing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans loved " sex and the city " for myself as a writer i feel that if you 're passionate about your show it has a good chance of becoming a success .
but you also need the infrastructure to carry that passion forward and make it workable for a 13 or 24 episode season , and i guess there 's a possibility that some of these aspects are lacking in germany . tv is essentially escapist , and germany still has a fascination with the us .
might german tv writers be fighting a losing battle , because their audiences are actually quite happy not to have home-grown shows ? my guess is that germans would respond really well to a terrific home-grown show .
it 's only logical .
i used to live in saratoga springs in upstate new york and i would always be intrigued by any novel set there .
i 'm jewish , so i always enjoy jewish novels .
if a story is somehow close to me i 'll be interested … .
i have two children and i 'm always interested in a story about a dad with kids .
so i can only imagine that if i were german i would want to watch shows in german , i would think : " hey , we germans can put out good shows too . "
i 'd feel proud . a lot of good series in the us are made by cable network hbo , so they don ’ t need mass appeal .
in germany , tv series need to work across the board .
is it easier for writers to maintain high standards when they know they only need to reach a certain audience ? yes , but it depends on your idea .
there are good network shows that do have mass appeal , and that does n't have to be a bad thing .
a lot of the shows i love are on hbo and it 's great to have these outlets .
shows like " the sopranos " and " nip / tuck " really push the envelope and that probably has the effect of making the broadcast networks better generally because it raises the bar .
germany could probably benefit from an equivalent .
it would be great if german tv writers did n't feel they had to get 50 million viewers . is there a risk that projects like the " writer ’ s room " might result in very homogenous shows ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the unlucky clara the structures and strategies we 're introducing to german writers and executives have nothing to do with content .
they will just lead to better shows .
if the german writers have exciting ideas that are uniquely german , then projects like the " writer 's room " will just help them realize these ideas more fully .
we 're not pushing any content on them . jane paulick interviewed matt witten send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " this was just the beginning " benjamin heisenberg and nicolas wackerbarth belong to the avant-garde of young german cinema .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 22.02.2007 the power behind the german smoking ban stalemate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's smoke-filled bars and cafes are almost a rarity in western europe as a crucial meeting on protecting non-smokers opens in germany friday , a look at the country 's powerful tobacco lobby offers some clues as to why germany has successfully resisted an outright smoking ban so far . the struggle in germany to agree on a smoking ban continues this week when government ministers convene in hanover on friday to discuss the issue of protection for non-smokers before a state premiers ' debate on march 22 .
the meeting , to be chaired by federal minister for health , ulla schmidt and consumer affairs minister , horst seehofer will be used to further discuss whether smoking in schools , public buildings and most restaurants should be banned by germany 's 16 federal states .
the decision to hand the responsibility for approving the ban to the individual states came after germany 's ruling coalition rescinded the original ban proposal on constitutional grounds in december last year .
the government said an outright federal ban could infringe on individual states ' rights , many of which can not be overridden by berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the states are responsible for issuing bans in public places it is the 16 states , not the federal government , which have power over local government facilities such as schools and hospitals , as well as places such as bars and restaurants - those places where the smoking ban was proposed .
pro-smoking lobbyists pulling the strings ?
the decision was also seen as another example of the german government 's unwillingness to confront the country 's powerful pro-smoking lobby which opposition politicians and anti-smoking campaigners believe holds too much influence over the ruling coalition of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
germany has been slow to follow the lead of those eu states which have already agreed and have implemented their own smoking bans .
france , italy and england have already passed laws that ban smoking in bars and restaurants , as well as public buildings , putting germany out of step with many of its european counterparts .
pressure from the anti-smoking lobby is suspected as being the reason why germany continues to lag behind .
but does the pro- lobby really have that amount of power , that the german government would defy european union directives to satisfy its wishes ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lobbyists are accused of pressuring the government " the pro-smoker lobby is stronger in germany than in any other european country , " siggi ermer , the chairman of pro rauchfrei , the german lobby for non-smokers said . " even the tobacco companies are proud of that fact .
its influence is so strong that pro rauchfrei talks about a tobacco dictatorship in a democratic state .
-lrb- the pro- lobby -rrb- has affected the legislation for decades and crucially has steered the politicians .
" it is so powerful that in the current discussions , the cdu / csu parliamentary group brought in a regulation paper from the german tobacco industry association -lrb- vdc -rrb- and presented it word for word as their own proposal for the negotiations . "
the german tobacco industry association -lrb- vdc -rrb- was unavailable for comment on its involvement in any parliamentary decisions or the extent of its influence over the government .
wolfgang hainer , head of the powerful vdc , who represents the interests of philip morris , british american tobacco , reemtsma and four other tobacco companies in germany recently told german weekly die zeit , " we collect information , channel the opinions of our members and then present the facts to the politicians . " the vdc is also said to organize regular parties at its headquarters in berlin which usually pulls in younger employees from the german ministries and the offices of parliamentarians . no such thing as a free lunch in lobbyists ' eyes germany is an important battleground for the pro-smoking lobby .
it is europe 's biggest tobacco market with about 22 million smokers , which is 27 percent of the population , according to the federal statistics office .
and with more and more eu countries cracking down on smokers , the hearts , minds and lungs of german smokers have become more valuable to the tobacco companies .
for the pro-smoking lobby to retain its advantage , alliances have to be formed with those in power .
" in germany , the tobacco lobby has a strong influence on the politicians , " pro rauchfrei 's ermer says .
" that begins with regular gifts directly to the desks of the delegates , and goes as far as direct payments for local government events and party meetings . "
" beyond that the delegates are invited regularly to meetings of the tobacco industry , the agendas of which are disguised by social topics .
until 2006 , the total of direct payments paid to the federal government by the tobacco industry amounts to 11.2 million euros . "
inaction and stalling can not stop ban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hopes of the anti- lobby regularly get trodden on ermer states that there is a network of pro-smoking sympathizers within the political arena in germany and that smokers within the government have an obvious agenda .
" whole parliamentary committees , such as the tourism committee , have been infiltrated by the tobacco lobby , " he added " in addition , the health minister ulla schmidt avoids making clear decisions .
unlike in other european countries , the german health minister doesn ’ t take the leadership in the ban discussion and leaves the demagogues to take the lead . "
despite the power wielded by the pro-lobby , ermer believes that the move towards a smoke-free europe is an irreversible one .
" while the influence in germany is large , the german pro-smoker lobby has only a small influence on europe , " ermer concludes .
" on a european scale , germany is isolated , as the judgment of the european court of justice pointed out with the tobacco advertising ban in 2005 .
only germany complained and lost , " he said .
" the european way into a smokeless future can not be stopped , it can only be slowed down by germany .

dw-world.de caught up with la-based screenwriter matt witten to find out how projects like the " writer 's room " can help . the recent berlin film festival proved that german cinema is in fine fettle . but television is looking a lot less robust .
a record number of new shows are tanking spectacularly - take private station pro 7 's latest disaster , the much-hyped " crazy about clara . "
given that viewers loved " ally mcbeal " and " sex and the city , " they should have devoured a home-grown series about a 20-something city girl juggling work and relationships .
but no one was crazy about clara at all , and this enormously expensive series was shunted off into a late-night slot after just two episodes . but while viewers ca n't switch off german shows fast enough , they 're more addicted than ever to us imports , with most prime-time slots filled with the likes of " desperate housewives , " " medical investigation " and " er . "
the networks are realizing it 's time for a re-think - and are sending for the marines . organized by media consultancy mediaxchange , the third " writer 's room " recently took place in germany .
its goal is to bring together experienced us writers to work with their local counterparts in developing ideas for drama series to be sold to local channels and the international market .
guest of honor at january 's session was writer and producer matt witten - whose credits include " house m.d. , " " csi : miami " and " law & order . " dw-world.de asked him how it went . matt witten : it went well !
the german writers were talented and interesting and it was very productive .
we came up with some terrific ideas for shows and also i think it gave the german writers a good idea of how us tv shows run . did you see any german tv shows ? i saw " alarm für cobra 11 " and " lasko " -lrb- two series made by german production company " action concept , " which co-organized the event -rrb- .
one thing i noticed was that the action sequences were fabulous , probably better than anything i 've ever seen on american television .
you might see that kind of action in the movies but never on television .
the first episode i saw of " cobra 11 " had a 400 car pile-up !
" action concept " manages to do these incredible things on relatively small budgets , significantly less than those of american shows . so is us tv as good as it is often simply because of economies of scale ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " csi : miami " shows the way because we have more money to put into it ?
yes .
but we 've also been making tv in the us since 1950 .
we have a longer history - we 've been developing our tv for 50 years , so there might be some catch-up to do for german television .
but are americans inherently better writers than germans ?
no , of course not ! when you talked to the german participants in the writer 's room , did you get the impression that they need help to create good tv ? american shows tend to be pretty fast-paced and vigorously structured , and the way we structure the action and the conflict for our main characters has been thought through in ways that are fresh for german writers , they have n't necessarily heard it described in these terms .
so it gives them a new way of looking at the writing they 're doing .
they were also intrigued by the fact that in america we have staff writers who meet every day , and we have a head writer responsible for the consistency of the show - " the show-runner . "
these concepts are new in germany , where there is no cohesion of writing staff .
instead , episodes are written by freelancers who turn in maybe just two a year .
another thing in american tv is that directors do n't have the power to change the script without talking to the writer .
it makes sense that the writers are in charge because after all , they will be involved with all thirteen episodes in the series whereas a director is only involved with three or four . does that mean that german shows never quite rival american ones because of structures - because germany doesn ’ t have the same efficient systems in place that the us has ?
should germany focus more on this aspect of tv production ? i would agree with that .
when you have a good infrastructure the writers will also get better because of it - by being with the production for all 13 or 24 episodes , being around the other writers on set , working with the actors and the directors , getting involved with the editing .
better writing is an inevitable by-product .
" action concept " ceo hermann joha for one is very keen to run all his shows more according to this model .
he specifically wants to establish this kind of infrastructure and to introduce this way of working in germany . what germany has right now is a lot of shows billed as the german " sex and the city , " the german " law & order " etc .
but somehow they don ’ t really work .
what ’ s missing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans loved " sex and the city " for myself as a writer i feel that if you 're passionate about your show it has a good chance of becoming a success .
but you also need the infrastructure to carry that passion forward and make it workable for a 13 or 24 episode season , and i guess there 's a possibility that some of these aspects are lacking in germany . tv is essentially escapist , and germany still has a fascination with the us .
might german tv writers be fighting a losing battle , because their audiences are actually quite happy not to have home-grown shows ? my guess is that germans would respond really well to a terrific home-grown show .
it 's only logical .
i used to live in saratoga springs in upstate new york and i would always be intrigued by any novel set there .
i 'm jewish , so i always enjoy jewish novels .
if a story is somehow close to me i 'll be interested … .
i have two children and i 'm always interested in a story about a dad with kids .
so i can only imagine that if i were german i would want to watch shows in german , i would think : " hey , we germans can put out good shows too . "
i 'd feel proud . a lot of good series in the us are made by cable network hbo , so they don ’ t need mass appeal .
in germany , tv series need to work across the board .
is it easier for writers to maintain high standards when they know they only need to reach a certain audience ? yes , but it depends on your idea .
there are good network shows that do have mass appeal , and that does n't have to be a bad thing .
a lot of the shows i love are on hbo and it 's great to have these outlets .
shows like " the sopranos " and " nip / tuck " really push the envelope and that probably has the effect of making the broadcast networks better generally because it raises the bar .
germany could probably benefit from an equivalent .
it would be great if german tv writers did n't feel they had to get 50 million viewers . is there a risk that projects like the " writer ’ s room " might result in very homogenous shows ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the unlucky clara the structures and strategies we 're introducing to german writers and executives have nothing to do with content .
they will just lead to better shows .
if the german writers have exciting ideas that are uniquely german , then projects like the " writer 's room " will just help them realize these ideas more fully .

dw-world.de caught up with la-based screenwriter matt witten to find out how projects like the " writer 's room " can help . the recent berlin film festival proved that german cinema is in fine fettle . but television is looking a lot less robust .
a record number of new shows are tanking spectacularly - take private station pro 7 's latest disaster , the much-hyped " crazy about clara . "
given that viewers loved " ally mcbeal " and " sex and the city , " they should have devoured a home-grown series about a 20-something city girl juggling work and relationships .
but no one was crazy about clara at all , and this enormously expensive series was shunted off into a late-night slot after just two episodes . but while viewers ca n't switch off german shows fast enough , they 're more addicted than ever to us imports , with most prime-time slots filled with the likes of " desperate housewives , " " medical investigation " and " er . "
the networks are realizing it 's time for a re-think - and are sending for the marines . organized by media consultancy mediaxchange , the third " writer 's room " recently took place in germany .
its goal is to bring together experienced us writers to work with their local counterparts in developing ideas for drama series to be sold to local channels and the international market .
guest of honor at january 's session was writer and producer matt witten - whose credits include " house m.d. , " " csi : miami " and " law & order . " dw-world.de asked him how it went . matt witten : it went well !
the german writers were talented and interesting and it was very productive .
we came up with some terrific ideas for shows and also i think it gave the german writers a good idea of how us tv shows run . did you see any german tv shows ? i saw " alarm für cobra 11 " and " lasko " -lrb- two series made by german production company " action concept , " which co-organized the event -rrb- .
one thing i noticed was that the action sequences were fabulous , probably better than anything i 've ever seen on american television .
you might see that kind of action in the movies but never on television .
the first episode i saw of " cobra 11 " had a 400 car pile-up !
" action concept " manages to do these incredible things on relatively small budgets , significantly less than those of american shows . so is us tv as good as it is often simply because of economies of scale ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " csi : miami " shows the way because we have more money to put into it ?
yes .
but we 've also been making tv in the us since 1950 .
we have a longer history - we 've been developing our tv for 50 years , so there might be some catch-up to do for german television .
but are americans inherently better writers than germans ?
no , of course not ! when you talked to the german participants in the writer 's room , did you get the impression that they need help to create good tv ? american shows tend to be pretty fast-paced and vigorously structured , and the way we structure the action and the conflict for our main characters has been thought through in ways that are fresh for german writers , they have n't necessarily heard it described in these terms .
so it gives them a new way of looking at the writing they 're doing .
they were also intrigued by the fact that in america we have staff writers who meet every day , and we have a head writer responsible for the consistency of the show - " the show-runner . "
these concepts are new in germany , where there is no cohesion of writing staff .
instead , episodes are written by freelancers who turn in maybe just two a year .
another thing in american tv is that directors do n't have the power to change the script without talking to the writer .
it makes sense that the writers are in charge because after all , they will be involved with all thirteen episodes in the series whereas a director is only involved with three or four . does that mean that german shows never quite rival american ones because of structures - because germany doesn ’ t have the same efficient systems in place that the us has ?
should germany focus more on this aspect of tv production ? i would agree with that .
when you have a good infrastructure the writers will also get better because of it - by being with the production for all 13 or 24 episodes , being around the other writers on set , working with the actors and the directors , getting involved with the editing .
better writing is an inevitable by-product .
" action concept " ceo hermann joha for one is very keen to run all his shows more according to this model .
he specifically wants to establish this kind of infrastructure and to introduce this way of working in germany . what germany has right now is a lot of shows billed as the german " sex and the city , " the german " law & order " etc .
but somehow they don ’ t really work .
what ’ s missing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans loved " sex and the city " for myself as a writer i feel that if you 're passionate about your show it has a good chance of becoming a success .
but you also need the infrastructure to carry that passion forward and make it workable for a 13 or 24 episode season , and i guess there 's a possibility that some of these aspects are lacking in germany . tv is essentially escapist , and germany still has a fascination with the us .
might german tv writers be fighting a losing battle , because their audiences are actually quite happy not to have home-grown shows ? my guess is that germans would respond really well to a terrific home-grown show .
it 's only logical .
i used to live in saratoga springs in upstate new york and i would always be intrigued by any novel set there .
i 'm jewish , so i always enjoy jewish novels .
if a story is somehow close to me i 'll be interested … .
i have two children and i 'm always interested in a story about a dad with kids .
so i can only imagine that if i were german i would want to watch shows in german , i would think : " hey , we germans can put out good shows too . "
i 'd feel proud . a lot of good series in the us are made by cable network hbo , so they don ’ t need mass appeal .
in germany , tv series need to work across the board .
is it easier for writers to maintain high standards when they know they only need to reach a certain audience ? yes , but it depends on your idea .
there are good network shows that do have mass appeal , and that does n't have to be a bad thing .
a lot of the shows i love are on hbo and it 's great to have these outlets .
shows like " the sopranos " and " nip / tuck " really push the envelope and that probably has the effect of making the broadcast networks better generally because it raises the bar .
germany could probably benefit from an equivalent .
it would be great if german tv writers did n't feel they had to get 50 million viewers . is there a risk that projects like the " writer ’ s room " might result in very homogenous shows ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the unlucky clara the structures and strategies we 're introducing to german writers and executives have nothing to do with content .
they will just lead to better shows .
if the german writers have exciting ideas that are uniquely german , then projects like the " writer 's room " will just help them realize these ideas more fully .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 22.02.2007 german journalism practice raises censorship question großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you do n't say : after the interview , herzsprung decided to take back her words a heavily edited star interview in a german lifestyle magazine raised questions about the common practice of quote authorization , and the thinning line between journalism and pr . when it comes to the fight for journalistic integrity , decisive battles are not often played out on the field of the celebrity interview . but recent events led a german pop culture and lifestyle magazine to take a stand on what has become a standard practice in the german press : allowing a subject a chance to " authorize " - and often revise - an interview before it appears in print . ' shocked and stunned ' for the february issue of youth and lifestyle glossy u _ mag , writer volker sievert sat down to chat with up-and-coming starlet hannah herzsprung .
but after providing the actress with the agreed-upon transcript of the interview , he said he was " shocked and stunned " when her final version came back . so much of the text had been excised that it looked more like it had been attacked by wartime censors than simply vetted for errors or slips of the tongue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the editors of u _ mag decided to show readers how modern media works " i really felt like i had been censored , " sievert wrote in an e-mail .
" i could n't understand this massive interference in the least . " as a result of herzsprung 's changes , sievert wrote , the interview was " almost grotesquely disfigured . "
the end result is " something that resembles a self-promotional text more than a lively , vital interview , " he added . cozy relationship u _ mag 's response ?
print the interview in full - heavily blacked-out sections included . " we felt used , " sievert said .
" we decided to print the interview with the crossed out sections , to give our readers a look into the modern media landscape . " the event caused a stir in the german media and awoke a sleeping discussion on what some say is an overly-cozy relationship between the german press and public figures . " journalists are not legally required to have interview partners authorize their statements . … but unfortunately in germany , that has almost become common practice , " said hendrik zörner , spokesman for the german journalists ' association -lrb- djv -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der spiegel is known for letting subjects alter interviews , one commentator said big-name papers tend to " follow clearer journalistic practices , " while the smaller , local outlets that make up the majority of papers in the country , " might have to deal with certain interview partners more frequently , " and so are more likely to allow sources to sign off on interviews , zörner said . " this leads to the practice that looks a little like mutual back-scratching , " he added . good for everyone ? but ingrid kolb , director of the henri nannen school for journalism in hamburg , said some of the country 's biggest media outlets - for instance , renowned news magazines der spiegel and stern - are noted for the practice . " the long interviews that der spiegel publishes with famous public figures , their so-called talks , are known for this , " kolb said .
" they can go back and forth a dozen times , with each side bringing their argument a bit more to the point , refining it , improving it .
in a best-case scenario , it serves the interests of both sides . " if anything , the controversy certainly makes plain the mutual give-and-take relationship between public figures and the media : the one side in need of a platform to promote themselves and their ideas , the other constantly looking for interesting material to fill an ever expanding news hole . still , in the us , britain or australia , the idea of a journalist giving an interview subject a whack at editing his or her own comments after the fact would be grounds for derision , if not dismissal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the us , anything said " on the record " goes in the paper " i 'm aware that there is a big difference on this subject between the anglo-saxon world and the german world , " kolb said .
" but in germany it has become a custom to get a longer interview or quotes authorized . … in general the interview partner tells the journalist that he expects it . " ' scorched earth ' action according to kolb , printing an interview with the blacked out parts shown , like u _ mag did , is " essentially a scorched-earth kind of act .
this person will never have something to do with the publication again . " according to the journalists ' association 's zörner , the practice represents " a real weakness in german journalism ; journalists are much too ready to allow interview authorization . " " interviews are meant to serve an informative and explanatory function .
but if interviews are changed after the fact , they are no longer interviews .
they are pr texts , " he said . prior occurrence the hannah herzsprung case is n't the first time the issue of journalistic integrity has made headlines here .
the last time was in 2003 , when the press went on the attack against the government 's supposed " control mania . " back then , a group of the country 's heavyweight newspapers , including the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , die welt , süddeutsche zeitung and the financial times deutschland , all printed commentaries and articles deploring the practice of interview approval . most memorable was the move by leftist newspaper tageszeitung .
in an apparent bid to point up the notion that newsmakers need the press just as much as the press needs them , the paper printed a censored interview with the then secretary general of the social democrats - with all his responses blacked out in protest . ' no danger to democracy ' germany 's fourth estate has other , worse weaknesses , djv 's zörner notes .
a recent report by reporters without borders ranked the country a low 23nd in terms of press freedoms , based mostly on controversial government searches of newspaper offices . but " despite all the problems and dangers , " zörner said , overall , german journalism is " qualitatively very good . " " you ca n't say that -lrb- the practice of allowing interview revisions -rrb- poses a danger to democracy , " he said .
and after all , he pointed out , interviews are not the only tool reporters have . " there are reports , opinion pieces - there are many other forms of journalism available .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 22.02.2007 " there is no cohesion of tv writing staff in germany " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the boys from " alarm für cobra 11 " give good lead german tv networks are taking their cues state-side in a bid to create better drama series .
dw-world.de caught up with la-based screenwriter matt witten to find out how projects like the " writer 's room " can help . the recent berlin film festival proved that german cinema is in fine fettle . but television is looking a lot less robust .
a record number of new shows are tanking spectacularly - take private station pro 7 's latest disaster , the much-hyped " crazy about clara . "
given that viewers loved " ally mcbeal " and " sex and the city , " they should have devoured a home-grown series about a 20-something city girl juggling work and relationships .
but no one was crazy about clara at all , and this enormously expensive series was shunted off into a late-night slot after just two episodes . but while viewers ca n't switch off german shows fast enough , they 're more addicted than ever to us imports , with most prime-time slots filled with the likes of " desperate housewives , " " medical investigation " and " er . "
the networks are realizing it 's time for a re-think - and are sending for the marines . organized by media consultancy mediaxchange , the third " writer 's room " recently took place in germany .
its goal is to bring together experienced us writers to work with their local counterparts in developing ideas for drama series to be sold to local channels and the international market .
guest of honor at january 's session was writer and producer matt witten - whose credits include " house m.d. , " " csi : miami " and " law & order . " dw-world.de asked him how it went . matt witten : it went well !
the german writers were talented and interesting and it was very productive .
we came up with some terrific ideas for shows and also i think it gave the german writers a good idea of how us tv shows run . did you see any german tv shows ? i saw " alarm für cobra 11 " and " lasko " -lrb- two series made by german production company " action concept , " which co-organized the event -rrb- .
one thing i noticed was that the action sequences were fabulous , probably better than anything i 've ever seen on american television .
you might see that kind of action in the movies but never on television .
the first episode i saw of " cobra 11 " had a 400 car pile-up !
" action concept " manages to do these incredible things on relatively small budgets , significantly less than those of american shows . so is us tv as good as it is often simply because of economies of scale ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " csi : miami " shows the way because we have more money to put into it ?
yes .
but we 've also been making tv in the us since 1950 .
we have a longer history - we 've been developing our tv for 50 years , so there might be some catch-up to do for german television .
but are americans inherently better writers than germans ?
no , of course not ! when you talked to the german participants in the writer 's room , did you get the impression that they need help to create good tv ? american shows tend to be pretty fast-paced and vigorously structured , and the way we structure the action and the conflict for our main characters has been thought through in ways that are fresh for german writers , they have n't necessarily heard it described in these terms .
so it gives them a new way of looking at the writing they 're doing .
they were also intrigued by the fact that in america we have staff writers who meet every day , and we have a head writer responsible for the consistency of the show - " the show-runner . "
these concepts are new in germany , where there is no cohesion of writing staff .
instead , episodes are written by freelancers who turn in maybe just two a year .
another thing in american tv is that directors do n't have the power to change the script without talking to the writer .
it makes sense that the writers are in charge because after all , they will be involved with all thirteen episodes in the series whereas a director is only involved with three or four . does that mean that german shows never quite rival american ones because of structures - because germany doesn ’ t have the same efficient systems in place that the us has ?
should germany focus more on this aspect of tv production ? i would agree with that .
when you have a good infrastructure the writers will also get better because of it - by being with the production for all 13 or 24 episodes , being around the other writers on set , working with the actors and the directors , getting involved with the editing .
better writing is an inevitable by-product .
" action concept " ceo hermann joha for one is very keen to run all his shows more according to this model .
he specifically wants to establish this kind of infrastructure and to introduce this way of working in germany . what germany has right now is a lot of shows billed as the german " sex and the city , " the german " law & order " etc .
but somehow they don ’ t really work .
what ’ s missing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans loved " sex and the city " for myself as a writer i feel that if you 're passionate about your show it has a good chance of becoming a success .
but you also need the infrastructure to carry that passion forward and make it workable for a 13 or 24 episode season , and i guess there 's a possibility that some of these aspects are lacking in germany . tv is essentially escapist , and germany still has a fascination with the us .
might german tv writers be fighting a losing battle , because their audiences are actually quite happy not to have home-grown shows ? my guess is that germans would respond really well to a terrific home-grown show .
it 's only logical .
i used to live in saratoga springs in upstate new york and i would always be intrigued by any novel set there .
i 'm jewish , so i always enjoy jewish novels .
if a story is somehow close to me i 'll be interested … .
i have two children and i 'm always interested in a story about a dad with kids .
so i can only imagine that if i were german i would want to watch shows in german , i would think : " hey , we germans can put out good shows too . "
i 'd feel proud . a lot of good series in the us are made by cable network hbo , so they don ’ t need mass appeal .
in germany , tv series need to work across the board .
is it easier for writers to maintain high standards when they know they only need to reach a certain audience ? yes , but it depends on your idea .
there are good network shows that do have mass appeal , and that does n't have to be a bad thing .
a lot of the shows i love are on hbo and it 's great to have these outlets .
shows like " the sopranos " and " nip / tuck " really push the envelope and that probably has the effect of making the broadcast networks better generally because it raises the bar .
germany could probably benefit from an equivalent .
it would be great if german tv writers did n't feel they had to get 50 million viewers . is there a risk that projects like the " writer ’ s room " might result in very homogenous shows ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the unlucky clara the structures and strategies we 're introducing to german writers and executives have nothing to do with content .
they will just lead to better shows .
if the german writers have exciting ideas that are uniquely german , then projects like the " writer 's room " will just help them realize these ideas more fully .
we 're not pushing any content on them . jane paulick interviewed matt witten send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " this was just the beginning " benjamin heisenberg and nicolas wackerbarth belong to the avant-garde of young german cinema .
they 're often called members of the so-called berlin school .

the center-left government was forced onto the defensive over the deployment of 2,000 troops in afghanistan and the enlargement of a us military base in northern italy . both are policies most opposed by far-left parties within prodi 's coalition . opposition called for prodi 's resignation but it is the conservative opposition , led by silvio berlusconi , who was narrowly forced out of the prime minister 's office by prodi in an election last april , who led calls for prodi to go . right wing senators shouted " resign ! resign !

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 22.02.2007 " there is no cohesion of tv writing staff in germany " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the boys from " alarm für cobra 11 " give good lead german tv networks are taking their cues state-side in a bid to create better drama series .
dw-world.de caught up with la-based screenwriter matt witten to find out how projects like the " writer 's room " can help . the recent berlin film festival proved that german cinema is in fine fettle . but television is looking a lot less robust .
a record number of new shows are tanking spectacularly - take private station pro 7 's latest disaster , the much-hyped " crazy about clara . "
given that viewers loved " ally mcbeal " and " sex and the city , " they should have devoured a home-grown series about a 20-something city girl juggling work and relationships .
but no one was crazy about clara at all , and this enormously expensive series was shunted off into a late-night slot after just two episodes . but while viewers ca n't switch off german shows fast enough , they 're more addicted than ever to us imports , with most prime-time slots filled with the likes of " desperate housewives , " " medical investigation " and " er . "
the networks are realizing it 's time for a re-think - and are sending for the marines . organized by media consultancy mediaxchange , the third " writer 's room " recently took place in germany .
its goal is to bring together experienced us writers to work with their local counterparts in developing ideas for drama series to be sold to local channels and the international market .
guest of honor at january 's session was writer and producer matt witten - whose credits include " house m.d. , " " csi : miami " and " law & order . " dw-world.de asked him how it went . matt witten : it went well !
the german writers were talented and interesting and it was very productive .
we came up with some terrific ideas for shows and also i think it gave the german writers a good idea of how us tv shows run . did you see any german tv shows ? i saw " alarm für cobra 11 " and " lasko " -lrb- two series made by german production company " action concept , " which co-organized the event -rrb- .
one thing i noticed was that the action sequences were fabulous , probably better than anything i 've ever seen on american television .
you might see that kind of action in the movies but never on television .
the first episode i saw of " cobra 11 " had a 400 car pile-up !
" action concept " manages to do these incredible things on relatively small budgets , significantly less than those of american shows . so is us tv as good as it is often simply because of economies of scale ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " csi : miami " shows the way because we have more money to put into it ?
yes .
but we 've also been making tv in the us since 1950 .
we have a longer history - we 've been developing our tv for 50 years , so there might be some catch-up to do for german television .
but are americans inherently better writers than germans ?
no , of course not ! when you talked to the german participants in the writer 's room , did you get the impression that they need help to create good tv ? american shows tend to be pretty fast-paced and vigorously structured , and the way we structure the action and the conflict for our main characters has been thought through in ways that are fresh for german writers , they have n't necessarily heard it described in these terms .
so it gives them a new way of looking at the writing they 're doing .
they were also intrigued by the fact that in america we have staff writers who meet every day , and we have a head writer responsible for the consistency of the show - " the show-runner . "
these concepts are new in germany , where there is no cohesion of writing staff .
instead , episodes are written by freelancers who turn in maybe just two a year .
another thing in american tv is that directors do n't have the power to change the script without talking to the writer .
it makes sense that the writers are in charge because after all , they will be involved with all thirteen episodes in the series whereas a director is only involved with three or four . does that mean that german shows never quite rival american ones because of structures - because germany doesn ’ t have the same efficient systems in place that the us has ?
should germany focus more on this aspect of tv production ? i would agree with that .
when you have a good infrastructure the writers will also get better because of it - by being with the production for all 13 or 24 episodes , being around the other writers on set , working with the actors and the directors , getting involved with the editing .
better writing is an inevitable by-product .
" action concept " ceo hermann joha for one is very keen to run all his shows more according to this model .
he specifically wants to establish this kind of infrastructure and to introduce this way of working in germany . what germany has right now is a lot of shows billed as the german " sex and the city , " the german " law & order " etc .
but somehow they don ’ t really work .
what ’ s missing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans loved " sex and the city " for myself as a writer i feel that if you 're passionate about your show it has a good chance of becoming a success .
but you also need the infrastructure to carry that passion forward and make it workable for a 13 or 24 episode season , and i guess there 's a possibility that some of these aspects are lacking in germany . tv is essentially escapist , and germany still has a fascination with the us .
might german tv writers be fighting a losing battle , because their audiences are actually quite happy not to have home-grown shows ? my guess is that germans would respond really well to a terrific home-grown show .
it 's only logical .
i used to live in saratoga springs in upstate new york and i would always be intrigued by any novel set there .
i 'm jewish , so i always enjoy jewish novels .
if a story is somehow close to me i 'll be interested … .
i have two children and i 'm always interested in a story about a dad with kids .
so i can only imagine that if i were german i would want to watch shows in german , i would think : " hey , we germans can put out good shows too . "
i 'd feel proud . a lot of good series in the us are made by cable network hbo , so they don ’ t need mass appeal .
in germany , tv series need to work across the board .
is it easier for writers to maintain high standards when they know they only need to reach a certain audience ? yes , but it depends on your idea .
there are good network shows that do have mass appeal , and that does n't have to be a bad thing .
a lot of the shows i love are on hbo and it 's great to have these outlets .
shows like " the sopranos " and " nip / tuck " really push the envelope and that probably has the effect of making the broadcast networks better generally because it raises the bar .
germany could probably benefit from an equivalent .
it would be great if german tv writers did n't feel they had to get 50 million viewers . is there a risk that projects like the " writer ’ s room " might result in very homogenous shows ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the unlucky clara the structures and strategies we 're introducing to german writers and executives have nothing to do with content .
they will just lead to better shows .

dw-world.de caught up with la-based screenwriter matt witten to find out how projects like the " writer 's room " can help . the recent berlin film festival proved that german cinema is in fine fettle . but television is looking a lot less robust .
a record number of new shows are tanking spectacularly - take private station pro 7 's latest disaster , the much-hyped " crazy about clara . "
given that viewers loved " ally mcbeal " and " sex and the city , " they should have devoured a home-grown series about a 20-something city girl juggling work and relationships .
but no one was crazy about clara at all , and this enormously expensive series was shunted off into a late-night slot after just two episodes . but while viewers ca n't switch off german shows fast enough , they 're more addicted than ever to us imports , with most prime-time slots filled with the likes of " desperate housewives , " " medical investigation " and " er . "
the networks are realizing it 's time for a re-think - and are sending for the marines . organized by media consultancy mediaxchange , the third " writer 's room " recently took place in germany .
its goal is to bring together experienced us writers to work with their local counterparts in developing ideas for drama series to be sold to local channels and the international market .
guest of honor at january 's session was writer and producer matt witten - whose credits include " house m.d. , " " csi : miami " and " law & order . " dw-world.de asked him how it went . matt witten : it went well !
the german writers were talented and interesting and it was very productive .
we came up with some terrific ideas for shows and also i think it gave the german writers a good idea of how us tv shows run . did you see any german tv shows ? i saw " alarm für cobra 11 " and " lasko " -lrb- two series made by german production company " action concept , " which co-organized the event -rrb- .
one thing i noticed was that the action sequences were fabulous , probably better than anything i 've ever seen on american television .
you might see that kind of action in the movies but never on television .
the first episode i saw of " cobra 11 " had a 400 car pile-up !
" action concept " manages to do these incredible things on relatively small budgets , significantly less than those of american shows . so is us tv as good as it is often simply because of economies of scale ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " csi : miami " shows the way because we have more money to put into it ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 22.02.2007 italian president looks for post-prodi direction großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's government is in free fall for the time being italy 's president was to consult with party and government leaders on the future of the government thursday , following the resignation of prime minister romano prodi wednesday . after italian prime minister romano prodi handed in his resignation wednesday , italy 's president giorgio napolitano was to hold consultations with party leaders on the future of the government thursday . the talks were scheduled to begin with the speakers of the two branches of parliament and former presidents of the republic , followed by meetings with party whips . options for new government napolitano faces a number of options .
he could reject prodi 's resignation and ask him to seek a vote of confidence in parliament , or give him a mandate to form a new government . alternatively , he could give the mandate to a different center-left leader or an institutional figure .
a final option , seen as less likely at present , would be to call fresh elections that would take place in the spring . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi 's government lost a key vote over foreign policy in a drama reminiscent of italian politics of the 1980s and 1990s when governments sometimes lasted less than a week , prodi stepped down on wednesday , just nine months after assuming office , after he lost a key vote in parliament 's upper house over his government 's foreign policy .
the center-left government was forced onto the defensive over the deployment of 2,000 troops in afghanistan and the enlargement of a us military base in northern italy . both are policies most opposed by far-left parties within prodi 's coalition . opposition called for prodi 's resignation but it is the conservative opposition , led by silvio berlusconi , who was narrowly forced out of the prime minister 's office by prodi in an election last april , who led calls for prodi to go . right wing senators shouted " resign ! resign ! " after the result of the vote in the italian senate was announced .
prodi should " tender his resignation immediately , " declared berlusconi . the government needed 160 votes in the senate debate to get a formal motion of support .
but only 158 senators voted in favor and 136 opposed the government .
several left-wing senators were reportedly absent from the upper chamber . though it was not a formal vote of confidence , foreign minister massimo d 'alema said tuesday that the government would " go home " if it lost . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tide of public opinion can turn quickly , and brutally " it is a grave , serious and worrying fact to not obtain a majority for the speech of a foreign minister , " acknowledged vannino chiti , the minister for relations with parliament . immediately after , prodi held a crisis meeting with d 'alema , defence minister arturo parisi and deputy prime minister francesco rutelli . he then tendered his resignation to the president .
napolitano , who rushed back to rome from a visit to the provinces , said in a statement that he " reserves his decision " on the future of the government . under pressure over afghanistan d 'alema had to defend italy 's military mission in afghanistan to senators before the vote .
italy currently has around 2,000 troops deployed in the country as part of a nato-led peacekeeping mission . " it 's not a nato mission , but a united nations mission in which nato has an important military function , " d 'alema told the parliament . " it is a political and civil mission . "
the afghanistan deployment and the enlargement of the us base at vicenza in northern italy are both strongly opposed by the greens and communists who are part of a ruling coalition which also includes liberal and roman catholic parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters at a demonstration against the expansion of a us military base in vicenza more than 80,000 people took part in a rally last saturday in vicenza against the base enlargement . d 'alema said that to go back on the approval for the base that the prime minister gave last month for the base enlargement would be a " hostile act " toward the united states . no stranger to controversy prodi 's union coalition narrowly won an election in april last year that ended berlusconi 's five year-old government - one of the longest in recent italian political history . prodi is no stranger to the dangers of running italian governments . he resigned as prime minister in 1997 and 1998 when leading governments .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 22.02.2007 " there is no cohesion of tv writing staff in germany " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the boys from " alarm für cobra 11 " give good lead german tv networks are taking their cues state-side in a bid to create better drama series .
dw-world.de caught up with la-based screenwriter matt witten to find out how projects like the " writer 's room " can help . the recent berlin film festival proved that german cinema is in fine fettle . but television is looking a lot less robust .
a record number of new shows are tanking spectacularly - take private station pro 7 's latest disaster , the much-hyped " crazy about clara . "
given that viewers loved " ally mcbeal " and " sex and the city , " they should have devoured a home-grown series about a 20-something city girl juggling work and relationships .
but no one was crazy about clara at all , and this enormously expensive series was shunted off into a late-night slot after just two episodes . but while viewers ca n't switch off german shows fast enough , they 're more addicted than ever to us imports , with most prime-time slots filled with the likes of " desperate housewives , " " medical investigation " and " er . "
the networks are realizing it 's time for a re-think - and are sending for the marines . organized by media consultancy mediaxchange , the third " writer 's room " recently took place in germany .
its goal is to bring together experienced us writers to work with their local counterparts in developing ideas for drama series to be sold to local channels and the international market .
guest of honor at january 's session was writer and producer matt witten - whose credits include " house m.d. , " " csi : miami " and " law & order . " dw-world.de asked him how it went . matt witten : it went well !
the german writers were talented and interesting and it was very productive .
we came up with some terrific ideas for shows and also i think it gave the german writers a good idea of how us tv shows run . did you see any german tv shows ? i saw " alarm für cobra 11 " and " lasko " -lrb- two series made by german production company " action concept , " which co-organized the event -rrb- .
one thing i noticed was that the action sequences were fabulous , probably better than anything i 've ever seen on american television .
you might see that kind of action in the movies but never on television .
the first episode i saw of " cobra 11 " had a 400 car pile-up !
" action concept " manages to do these incredible things on relatively small budgets , significantly less than those of american shows . so is us tv as good as it is often simply because of economies of scale ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " csi : miami " shows the way because we have more money to put into it ?
yes .
but we 've also been making tv in the us since 1950 .
we have a longer history - we 've been developing our tv for 50 years , so there might be some catch-up to do for german television .
but are americans inherently better writers than germans ?
no , of course not ! when you talked to the german participants in the writer 's room , did you get the impression that they need help to create good tv ? american shows tend to be pretty fast-paced and vigorously structured , and the way we structure the action and the conflict for our main characters has been thought through in ways that are fresh for german writers , they have n't necessarily heard it described in these terms .
so it gives them a new way of looking at the writing they 're doing .
they were also intrigued by the fact that in america we have staff writers who meet every day , and we have a head writer responsible for the consistency of the show - " the show-runner . "
these concepts are new in germany , where there is no cohesion of writing staff .
instead , episodes are written by freelancers who turn in maybe just two a year .
another thing in american tv is that directors do n't have the power to change the script without talking to the writer .
it makes sense that the writers are in charge because after all , they will be involved with all thirteen episodes in the series whereas a director is only involved with three or four . does that mean that german shows never quite rival american ones because of structures - because germany doesn ’ t have the same efficient systems in place that the us has ?
should germany focus more on this aspect of tv production ? i would agree with that .
when you have a good infrastructure the writers will also get better because of it - by being with the production for all 13 or 24 episodes , being around the other writers on set , working with the actors and the directors , getting involved with the editing .
better writing is an inevitable by-product .
" action concept " ceo hermann joha for one is very keen to run all his shows more according to this model .
he specifically wants to establish this kind of infrastructure and to introduce this way of working in germany . what germany has right now is a lot of shows billed as the german " sex and the city , " the german " law & order " etc .
but somehow they don ’ t really work .
what ’ s missing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans loved " sex and the city " for myself as a writer i feel that if you 're passionate about your show it has a good chance of becoming a success .
but you also need the infrastructure to carry that passion forward and make it workable for a 13 or 24 episode season , and i guess there 's a possibility that some of these aspects are lacking in germany . tv is essentially escapist , and germany still has a fascination with the us .
might german tv writers be fighting a losing battle , because their audiences are actually quite happy not to have home-grown shows ? my guess is that germans would respond really well to a terrific home-grown show .
it 's only logical .
i used to live in saratoga springs in upstate new york and i would always be intrigued by any novel set there .
i 'm jewish , so i always enjoy jewish novels .
if a story is somehow close to me i 'll be interested … .
i have two children and i 'm always interested in a story about a dad with kids .
so i can only imagine that if i were german i would want to watch shows in german , i would think : " hey , we germans can put out good shows too . "
i 'd feel proud . a lot of good series in the us are made by cable network hbo , so they don ’ t need mass appeal .
in germany , tv series need to work across the board .
is it easier for writers to maintain high standards when they know they only need to reach a certain audience ? yes , but it depends on your idea .
there are good network shows that do have mass appeal , and that does n't have to be a bad thing .
a lot of the shows i love are on hbo and it 's great to have these outlets .
shows like " the sopranos " and " nip / tuck " really push the envelope and that probably has the effect of making the broadcast networks better generally because it raises the bar .
germany could probably benefit from an equivalent .
it would be great if german tv writers did n't feel they had to get 50 million viewers . is there a risk that projects like the " writer ’ s room " might result in very homogenous shows ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the unlucky clara the structures and strategies we 're introducing to german writers and executives have nothing to do with content .
they will just lead to better shows .
if the german writers have exciting ideas that are uniquely german , then projects like the " writer 's room " will just help them realize these ideas more fully .
we 're not pushing any content on them . jane paulick interviewed matt witten send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " this was just the beginning " benjamin heisenberg and nicolas wackerbarth belong to the avant-garde of young german cinema .

oslo considers un talks on the issue last year a failure and hopes to launch efforts for an international ban backed by germany . representatives from over 40 countries and international organizations are gathering in oslo on thursday and friday to discuss ways to outlaw cluster bombs .
norway and other nations in favor of a ban are being hampered by nations that oppose one . the scandinavian country hopes the two-day meeting , which will be attended by senior ministry officials from around the world , will be the start of a process that will ultimately lead to the adoption of an international ban - even without the support of some key countries , such as opponents britain and the united states . " it is better that the like-minded -lrb- pro-ban -rrb- nations work in the same direction , " said raymond johansen , norway 's state secretary of foreign affairs .
he said that an international accord would put pressure on anti-ban nations to eventually comply . the pro-ban countries expected to be represented include norway , sweden , germany , mozambique and angola .
on the other side , britain , canada , france , china , india and russia belong to those opposed .

cluster munitions are stockpiled by most countries ' armies and have often been used in the past 40 years , most recently during the war in lebanon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demining unexploded cluster bombs in lebanon is dangerous work opponents of cluster munitions consider these weapons an unacceptable danger to civilians . " it 's a double whammy , " said cmc 's co-chairman steve goose .
" at the time of the attack , the bomblets spread over a large area and they can not be guided .
a large number of them do not explode upon impact , and so they can kill years later . "
he said that cluster bombs disproportionately target civilians . " cluster munitions caused more civilian casualties during the -lrb- last -rrb- iraq war and in kosovo than any other type of weapon , " goose said . proponents of a ban argue that a prohibition is achievable .
they point to the 1997 mine ban treaty that banned the production , stockpiling and use of anti-personnel landmines - also the result of a norwegian initiative . " the landmine treaty created a powerful standard , " goose said .
" we think the same can happen with cluster munitions .

it stops short of granting full independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un envoy martti ahtisaari under the envoy 's plan , kosovo 's government would be overseen by a new european union-led mission which would take over from the un , which has administered the province since the end of the kosovo war in 1999 . as a final round of talks , expected to last into march , got underway in vienna on the un blueprint , dw-world.de spoke with fatmir sejdiu , president of kosovo , about the fate of the region . dw-world.de : mr. president , violence has increased in kosovo this month .
two people were killed on february 10 during outbreaks . this week , there was a bomb attack on united nations vehicles in pristina .
are the negotiations failing ? fatmir sejdiu : these developments are not helping the situation in kosovo - it 's been a dark day for kosovo since the outbursts occurred .
they have been violent protests and it was absolutely unnecessary for those two people to die . not only do the deaths mean a major loss for the families .
the severity of the attacks has a very negative effect on kosovo 's prospects .
it damages the political processes . of course , everyone has the right to protest and express his or her opinions , but it 's essential that this occurs within the framework of the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo president fatmir sejdiu i believe kosovo 's negotiating group has done its job .
we have clearly represented kosovo 's interests at all of the meetings in vienna , and it 's true that we have reached a consensus in all of our decisions .
this shows that we have represented the absolute majority of kosovo 's population and its institutions . before the talks in vienna began , kosovo 's negotiating group presented a list of contentious points .
do you believe that un special envoy ahtisaari 's scheme can still be altered during the negotiations ? perhaps .
there surely wo n't be any more major changes , but it could be that arguments we have presented will be integrated in some way .
we 'll have to wait and see .
however , we do not want to start debating ahtisaari 's recommendations all over again .
that would just mean an endless round of discussions which would n't go anywhere , other than putting kosovo at further risk .
it would jeopardize its future . i would like to point out that it 's essential that the un security council keep track of this process ; it 's that group which will hear the recommendations for the future of kosovo .
the political formulations and kosovo 's independence are central here . the serbian negotiating delegation has demanded that ahtisaari 's plan be divided into technical and political sections .
what 's your opinion on that ? i think belgrade 's interest during the discussions in vienna is prolonging them as much as possible , thereby discrediting them .
that would increase the tensions in kosovo - with the aim of trying to show that kosovo is not yet ready for independence , that it 's unstable , that it offers no prospects for its citizens , and especially , for its serbian citizens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were also demonstrations in pristina in november 2006 ahtisaari himself said two-thirds of his recommendations address the safety of serbs in kosovo alone .
serbs in kosovo , for their part , say ahtisaari 's plan is unfair because it treats all minorities in the region alike .
that would mean that the serbs - the largest minority in kosovo - should have more rights than , say , the roma or ashkali groups . it certainly is a major boost for the serbian minority in kosovo that ahtisaari has addressed the situation of their equality to such an extent .
of course , other minorities have also demanded the same rights as the serbian minority , although kosovo 's institutions have integrated these into their democratic processes .
that is why those parts of the plan addressing the safety of the serbian minority are based on international norms and standards .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 22.02.2007 " kosovo 's independence is the central thing " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a monument for kosovo albanian guerrillas killed during the 1998-99 kosovo war deutsche welle spoke with kosovo president fatmir sejdiu as final talks between serbians and ethnic albanian representatives on the region 's status opened in vienna . serbia on wednesday again rejected a united nations plan for independence for its breakaway kosovo province as a final round of talks on the blueprint began . un special envoy martti ahtisaari 's kosovo plan , published on february 2 , would give kosovo all the trappings of statehood - self-government , its own flag and anthem , and membership in international organizations .
it stops short of granting full independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un envoy martti ahtisaari under the envoy 's plan , kosovo 's government would be overseen by a new european union-led mission which would take over from the un , which has administered the province since the end of the kosovo war in 1999 . as a final round of talks , expected to last into march , got underway in vienna on the un blueprint , dw-world.de spoke with fatmir sejdiu , president of kosovo , about the fate of the region . dw-world.de : mr. president , violence has increased in kosovo this month .
two people were killed on february 10 during outbreaks . this week , there was a bomb attack on united nations vehicles in pristina .
are the negotiations failing ? fatmir sejdiu : these developments are not helping the situation in kosovo - it 's been a dark day for kosovo since the outbursts occurred .
they have been violent protests and it was absolutely unnecessary for those two people to die . not only do the deaths mean a major loss for the families .
the severity of the attacks has a very negative effect on kosovo 's prospects .
it damages the political processes . of course , everyone has the right to protest and express his or her opinions , but it 's essential that this occurs within the framework of the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo president fatmir sejdiu i believe kosovo 's negotiating group has done its job .
we have clearly represented kosovo 's interests at all of the meetings in vienna , and it 's true that we have reached a consensus in all of our decisions .
this shows that we have represented the absolute majority of kosovo 's population and its institutions . before the talks in vienna began , kosovo 's negotiating group presented a list of contentious points .
do you believe that un special envoy ahtisaari 's scheme can still be altered during the negotiations ? perhaps .
there surely wo n't be any more major changes , but it could be that arguments we have presented will be integrated in some way .
we 'll have to wait and see .
however , we do not want to start debating ahtisaari 's recommendations all over again .
that would just mean an endless round of discussions which would n't go anywhere , other than putting kosovo at further risk .
it would jeopardize its future . i would like to point out that it 's essential that the un security council keep track of this process ; it 's that group which will hear the recommendations for the future of kosovo .
the political formulations and kosovo 's independence are central here . the serbian negotiating delegation has demanded that ahtisaari 's plan be divided into technical and political sections .
what 's your opinion on that ? i think belgrade 's interest during the discussions in vienna is prolonging them as much as possible , thereby discrediting them .
that would increase the tensions in kosovo - with the aim of trying to show that kosovo is not yet ready for independence , that it 's unstable , that it offers no prospects for its citizens , and especially , for its serbian citizens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were also demonstrations in pristina in november 2006 ahtisaari himself said two-thirds of his recommendations address the safety of serbs in kosovo alone .

' shocked and stunned ' for the february issue of youth and lifestyle glossy u _ mag , writer volker sievert sat down to chat with up-and-coming starlet hannah herzsprung .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 22.02.2007 " there is no cohesion of tv writing staff in germany " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the boys from " alarm für cobra 11 " give good lead german tv networks are taking their cues state-side in a bid to create better drama series .
dw-world.de caught up with la-based screenwriter matt witten to find out how projects like the " writer 's room " can help . the recent berlin film festival proved that german cinema is in fine fettle . but television is looking a lot less robust .
a record number of new shows are tanking spectacularly - take private station pro 7 's latest disaster , the much-hyped " crazy about clara . "
given that viewers loved " ally mcbeal " and " sex and the city , " they should have devoured a home-grown series about a 20-something city girl juggling work and relationships .
but no one was crazy about clara at all , and this enormously expensive series was shunted off into a late-night slot after just two episodes . but while viewers ca n't switch off german shows fast enough , they 're more addicted than ever to us imports , with most prime-time slots filled with the likes of " desperate housewives , " " medical investigation " and " er . "
the networks are realizing it 's time for a re-think - and are sending for the marines . organized by media consultancy mediaxchange , the third " writer 's room " recently took place in germany .
its goal is to bring together experienced us writers to work with their local counterparts in developing ideas for drama series to be sold to local channels and the international market .
guest of honor at january 's session was writer and producer matt witten - whose credits include " house m.d. , " " csi : miami " and " law & order . " dw-world.de asked him how it went . matt witten : it went well !
the german writers were talented and interesting and it was very productive .
we came up with some terrific ideas for shows and also i think it gave the german writers a good idea of how us tv shows run . did you see any german tv shows ? i saw " alarm für cobra 11 " and " lasko " -lrb- two series made by german production company " action concept , " which co-organized the event -rrb- .
one thing i noticed was that the action sequences were fabulous , probably better than anything i 've ever seen on american television .
you might see that kind of action in the movies but never on television .
the first episode i saw of " cobra 11 " had a 400 car pile-up !
" action concept " manages to do these incredible things on relatively small budgets , significantly less than those of american shows . so is us tv as good as it is often simply because of economies of scale ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " csi : miami " shows the way because we have more money to put into it ?
yes .
but we 've also been making tv in the us since 1950 .
we have a longer history - we 've been developing our tv for 50 years , so there might be some catch-up to do for german television .
but are americans inherently better writers than germans ?
no , of course not ! when you talked to the german participants in the writer 's room , did you get the impression that they need help to create good tv ? american shows tend to be pretty fast-paced and vigorously structured , and the way we structure the action and the conflict for our main characters has been thought through in ways that are fresh for german writers , they have n't necessarily heard it described in these terms .
so it gives them a new way of looking at the writing they 're doing .
they were also intrigued by the fact that in america we have staff writers who meet every day , and we have a head writer responsible for the consistency of the show - " the show-runner . "
these concepts are new in germany , where there is no cohesion of writing staff .
instead , episodes are written by freelancers who turn in maybe just two a year .
another thing in american tv is that directors do n't have the power to change the script without talking to the writer .
it makes sense that the writers are in charge because after all , they will be involved with all thirteen episodes in the series whereas a director is only involved with three or four . does that mean that german shows never quite rival american ones because of structures - because germany doesn ’ t have the same efficient systems in place that the us has ?
should germany focus more on this aspect of tv production ? i would agree with that .
when you have a good infrastructure the writers will also get better because of it - by being with the production for all 13 or 24 episodes , being around the other writers on set , working with the actors and the directors , getting involved with the editing .
better writing is an inevitable by-product .
" action concept " ceo hermann joha for one is very keen to run all his shows more according to this model .
he specifically wants to establish this kind of infrastructure and to introduce this way of working in germany . what germany has right now is a lot of shows billed as the german " sex and the city , " the german " law & order " etc .
but somehow they don ’ t really work .
what ’ s missing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans loved " sex and the city " for myself as a writer i feel that if you 're passionate about your show it has a good chance of becoming a success .
but you also need the infrastructure to carry that passion forward and make it workable for a 13 or 24 episode season , and i guess there 's a possibility that some of these aspects are lacking in germany . tv is essentially escapist , and germany still has a fascination with the us .
might german tv writers be fighting a losing battle , because their audiences are actually quite happy not to have home-grown shows ? my guess is that germans would respond really well to a terrific home-grown show .
it 's only logical .
i used to live in saratoga springs in upstate new york and i would always be intrigued by any novel set there .
i 'm jewish , so i always enjoy jewish novels .
if a story is somehow close to me i 'll be interested … .
i have two children and i 'm always interested in a story about a dad with kids .
so i can only imagine that if i were german i would want to watch shows in german , i would think : " hey , we germans can put out good shows too . "
i 'd feel proud . a lot of good series in the us are made by cable network hbo , so they don ’ t need mass appeal .
in germany , tv series need to work across the board .
is it easier for writers to maintain high standards when they know they only need to reach a certain audience ? yes , but it depends on your idea .
there are good network shows that do have mass appeal , and that does n't have to be a bad thing .
a lot of the shows i love are on hbo and it 's great to have these outlets .
shows like " the sopranos " and " nip / tuck " really push the envelope and that probably has the effect of making the broadcast networks better generally because it raises the bar .
germany could probably benefit from an equivalent .
it would be great if german tv writers did n't feel they had to get 50 million viewers . is there a risk that projects like the " writer ’ s room " might result in very homogenous shows ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the unlucky clara the structures and strategies we 're introducing to german writers and executives have nothing to do with content .
they will just lead to better shows .

its goal is to bring together experienced us writers to work with their local counterparts in developing ideas for drama series to be sold to local channels and the international market .
guest of honor at january 's session was writer and producer matt witten - whose credits include " house m.d. , " " csi : miami " and " law & order . " dw-world.de asked him how it went . matt witten : it went well !
the german writers were talented and interesting and it was very productive .
we came up with some terrific ideas for shows and also i think it gave the german writers a good idea of how us tv shows run . did you see any german tv shows ? i saw " alarm für cobra 11 " and " lasko " -lrb- two series made by german production company " action concept , " which co-organized the event -rrb- .
one thing i noticed was that the action sequences were fabulous , probably better than anything i 've ever seen on american television .
you might see that kind of action in the movies but never on television .
the first episode i saw of " cobra 11 " had a 400 car pile-up !
" action concept " manages to do these incredible things on relatively small budgets , significantly less than those of american shows . so is us tv as good as it is often simply because of economies of scale ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " csi : miami " shows the way because we have more money to put into it ?
yes .
but we 've also been making tv in the us since 1950 .
we have a longer history - we 've been developing our tv for 50 years , so there might be some catch-up to do for german television .
but are americans inherently better writers than germans ?
no , of course not ! when you talked to the german participants in the writer 's room , did you get the impression that they need help to create good tv ? american shows tend to be pretty fast-paced and vigorously structured , and the way we structure the action and the conflict for our main characters has been thought through in ways that are fresh for german writers , they have n't necessarily heard it described in these terms .
so it gives them a new way of looking at the writing they 're doing .
they were also intrigued by the fact that in america we have staff writers who meet every day , and we have a head writer responsible for the consistency of the show - " the show-runner . "
these concepts are new in germany , where there is no cohesion of writing staff .
instead , episodes are written by freelancers who turn in maybe just two a year .
another thing in american tv is that directors do n't have the power to change the script without talking to the writer .
it makes sense that the writers are in charge because after all , they will be involved with all thirteen episodes in the series whereas a director is only involved with three or four . does that mean that german shows never quite rival american ones because of structures - because germany doesn ’ t have the same efficient systems in place that the us has ?
should germany focus more on this aspect of tv production ? i would agree with that .
when you have a good infrastructure the writers will also get better because of it - by being with the production for all 13 or 24 episodes , being around the other writers on set , working with the actors and the directors , getting involved with the editing .
better writing is an inevitable by-product .
" action concept " ceo hermann joha for one is very keen to run all his shows more according to this model .
he specifically wants to establish this kind of infrastructure and to introduce this way of working in germany . what germany has right now is a lot of shows billed as the german " sex and the city , " the german " law & order " etc .
but somehow they don ’ t really work .
what ’ s missing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans loved " sex and the city " for myself as a writer i feel that if you 're passionate about your show it has a good chance of becoming a success .
but you also need the infrastructure to carry that passion forward and make it workable for a 13 or 24 episode season , and i guess there 's a possibility that some of these aspects are lacking in germany . tv is essentially escapist , and germany still has a fascination with the us .
might german tv writers be fighting a losing battle , because their audiences are actually quite happy not to have home-grown shows ? my guess is that germans would respond really well to a terrific home-grown show .
it 's only logical .
i used to live in saratoga springs in upstate new york and i would always be intrigued by any novel set there .
i 'm jewish , so i always enjoy jewish novels .
if a story is somehow close to me i 'll be interested … .
i have two children and i 'm always interested in a story about a dad with kids .
so i can only imagine that if i were german i would want to watch shows in german , i would think : " hey , we germans can put out good shows too . "
i 'd feel proud . a lot of good series in the us are made by cable network hbo , so they don ’ t need mass appeal .
in germany , tv series need to work across the board .
is it easier for writers to maintain high standards when they know they only need to reach a certain audience ? yes , but it depends on your idea .
there are good network shows that do have mass appeal , and that does n't have to be a bad thing .
a lot of the shows i love are on hbo and it 's great to have these outlets .
shows like " the sopranos " and " nip / tuck " really push the envelope and that probably has the effect of making the broadcast networks better generally because it raises the bar .
germany could probably benefit from an equivalent .
it would be great if german tv writers did n't feel they had to get 50 million viewers . is there a risk that projects like the " writer ’ s room " might result in very homogenous shows ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the unlucky clara the structures and strategies we 're introducing to german writers and executives have nothing to do with content .
they will just lead to better shows .
if the german writers have exciting ideas that are uniquely german , then projects like the " writer 's room " will just help them realize these ideas more fully .

given that viewers loved " ally mcbeal " and " sex and the city , " they should have devoured a home-grown series about a 20-something city girl juggling work and relationships .
but no one was crazy about clara at all , and this enormously expensive series was shunted off into a late-night slot after just two episodes . but while viewers ca n't switch off german shows fast enough , they 're more addicted than ever to us imports , with most prime-time slots filled with the likes of " desperate housewives , " " medical investigation " and " er . "
the networks are realizing it 's time for a re-think - and are sending for the marines . organized by media consultancy mediaxchange , the third " writer 's room " recently took place in germany .
its goal is to bring together experienced us writers to work with their local counterparts in developing ideas for drama series to be sold to local channels and the international market .
guest of honor at january 's session was writer and producer matt witten - whose credits include " house m.d. , " " csi : miami " and " law & order . " dw-world.de asked him how it went . matt witten : it went well !
the german writers were talented and interesting and it was very productive .
we came up with some terrific ideas for shows and also i think it gave the german writers a good idea of how us tv shows run . did you see any german tv shows ? i saw " alarm für cobra 11 " and " lasko " -lrb- two series made by german production company " action concept , " which co-organized the event -rrb- .
one thing i noticed was that the action sequences were fabulous , probably better than anything i 've ever seen on american television .
you might see that kind of action in the movies but never on television .
the first episode i saw of " cobra 11 " had a 400 car pile-up !
" action concept " manages to do these incredible things on relatively small budgets , significantly less than those of american shows . so is us tv as good as it is often simply because of economies of scale ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " csi : miami " shows the way because we have more money to put into it ?
yes .
but we 've also been making tv in the us since 1950 .
we have a longer history - we 've been developing our tv for 50 years , so there might be some catch-up to do for german television .
but are americans inherently better writers than germans ?
no , of course not ! when you talked to the german participants in the writer 's room , did you get the impression that they need help to create good tv ? american shows tend to be pretty fast-paced and vigorously structured , and the way we structure the action and the conflict for our main characters has been thought through in ways that are fresh for german writers , they have n't necessarily heard it described in these terms .
so it gives them a new way of looking at the writing they 're doing .
they were also intrigued by the fact that in america we have staff writers who meet every day , and we have a head writer responsible for the consistency of the show - " the show-runner . "
these concepts are new in germany , where there is no cohesion of writing staff .
instead , episodes are written by freelancers who turn in maybe just two a year .
another thing in american tv is that directors do n't have the power to change the script without talking to the writer .
it makes sense that the writers are in charge because after all , they will be involved with all thirteen episodes in the series whereas a director is only involved with three or four . does that mean that german shows never quite rival american ones because of structures - because germany doesn ’ t have the same efficient systems in place that the us has ?
should germany focus more on this aspect of tv production ? i would agree with that .
when you have a good infrastructure the writers will also get better because of it - by being with the production for all 13 or 24 episodes , being around the other writers on set , working with the actors and the directors , getting involved with the editing .
better writing is an inevitable by-product .
" action concept " ceo hermann joha for one is very keen to run all his shows more according to this model .
he specifically wants to establish this kind of infrastructure and to introduce this way of working in germany . what germany has right now is a lot of shows billed as the german " sex and the city , " the german " law & order " etc .
but somehow they don ’ t really work .
what ’ s missing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans loved " sex and the city " for myself as a writer i feel that if you 're passionate about your show it has a good chance of becoming a success .
but you also need the infrastructure to carry that passion forward and make it workable for a 13 or 24 episode season , and i guess there 's a possibility that some of these aspects are lacking in germany . tv is essentially escapist , and germany still has a fascination with the us .
might german tv writers be fighting a losing battle , because their audiences are actually quite happy not to have home-grown shows ? my guess is that germans would respond really well to a terrific home-grown show .
it 's only logical .
i used to live in saratoga springs in upstate new york and i would always be intrigued by any novel set there .
i 'm jewish , so i always enjoy jewish novels .
if a story is somehow close to me i 'll be interested … .
i have two children and i 'm always interested in a story about a dad with kids .
so i can only imagine that if i were german i would want to watch shows in german , i would think : " hey , we germans can put out good shows too . "
i 'd feel proud . a lot of good series in the us are made by cable network hbo , so they don ’ t need mass appeal .
in germany , tv series need to work across the board .
is it easier for writers to maintain high standards when they know they only need to reach a certain audience ? yes , but it depends on your idea .
there are good network shows that do have mass appeal , and that does n't have to be a bad thing .
a lot of the shows i love are on hbo and it 's great to have these outlets .
shows like " the sopranos " and " nip / tuck " really push the envelope and that probably has the effect of making the broadcast networks better generally because it raises the bar .
germany could probably benefit from an equivalent .
it would be great if german tv writers did n't feel they had to get 50 million viewers . is there a risk that projects like the " writer ’ s room " might result in very homogenous shows ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the unlucky clara the structures and strategies we 're introducing to german writers and executives have nothing to do with content .
they will just lead to better shows .
if the german writers have exciting ideas that are uniquely german , then projects like the " writer 's room " will just help them realize these ideas more fully .
we 're not pushing any content on them . jane paulick interviewed matt witten send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " this was just the beginning " benjamin heisenberg and nicolas wackerbarth belong to the avant-garde of young german cinema .

she 's now under police protection after members received death threats . earlier this month , iran-born human rights activist mina ahadi founded the central council of ex-muslims , in the western-german city of cologne .
ahadi told the german news magazine focus : " i happened to be born in a muslim family , and i have decided not to be a muslim . "
that was the motivation for forming the group , whose members consists of some three dozen people who have turned their back on the religion .
ahadi 's decision to form the group is a controversial one considering that in most strictly islamic countries such as iran , saudi arabia , afghanistan , pakistan , sudan und mauritania , a muslim who rejects his or her religion faces the death sentence in accordance with the sharia law . other countries may not try apostates in a court of law , but they may be ostracized instead .
the topic is also sensitive in europe . an official renunciation of islam is almost unheard of .
death threats on the internet the name of ahadi 's group is also a play on the central council of muslims -lrb- zmd -rrb- , one of germany 's best-known umbrella muslim groups , also based in cologne .
the zmd is said to have around 800,00 members according to its own estimates .
ahadi , an exiled iranian living in germany , decided it was time to shine a light on the subject of born-muslims living in europe who do not want to be part of islam .
the aim of her organization , ahadi said , is to offer former muslims a voice in a country that is not represented by official muslim organizations , she told focus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green mp deligöz wanted to get rid of headscarves - and wound up with police protection but since the group 's formation , she told the magazine , she has been " terrorized . "
members of the group have gotten death threats via the internet .
about a week ago , the police approached ahadi and offered her protection .
the affair has echoes of another recent case in germany where green party politician ekin deligöz , who in october called for muslim women and girls to stop wearing head scarves , was also placed under police protection after receiving threats . at the same time ahadi is well aware of the taboos she is breaking with the founding of her group .
she said she could imagine " that there would be calls for a fatwa against us .
our project may also be discussed in the arab world . " in the coming week , members of the central council of ex-muslims have said they plan to hold a press conference to introduce the group to the public at large .
their slogan : " we have renounced . " defense for the secular ahadi told focus she is hoping the group can offer oppressed women a way to freedom , and defend secular people who live in germany and are integrated in the society here . " we want to improve society , to make it possible for us to get along better .
i hope for more peace , " the magazine quoted her as saying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european mp özdemir : looking for diverse images of islam in germany cem özdemir , a green politician fom germany with turkish roots at the european parliament told der spiegel magazine that ahadi 's project and the greens had something in common : both are hoping to expand the variety of images of islam in germany .

oslo considers un talks on the issue last year a failure and hopes to launch efforts for an international ban backed by germany . representatives from over 40 countries and international organizations are gathering in oslo on thursday and friday to discuss ways to outlaw cluster bombs .
norway and other nations in favor of a ban are being hampered by nations that oppose one . the scandinavian country hopes the two-day meeting , which will be attended by senior ministry officials from around the world , will be the start of a process that will ultimately lead to the adoption of an international ban - even without the support of some key countries , such as opponents britain and the united states . " it is better that the like-minded -lrb- pro-ban -rrb- nations work in the same direction , " said raymond johansen , norway 's state secretary of foreign affairs .
he said that an international accord would put pressure on anti-ban nations to eventually comply . the pro-ban countries expected to be represented include norway , sweden , germany , mozambique and angola .
on the other side , britain , canada , france , china , india and russia belong to those opposed .
the united states , which is also opposed , will not be in attendance . several un organizations will also attend , as well as the cluster munition coalition -lrb- cmc -rrb- , the umbrella organization grouping non-governmental organizations campaigning for a ban . " it 's a double whammy . " a cluster bomb consists of a container holding up to hundreds of smaller so-called bomblets .
it opens in mid-air and disperses these grenades over a large area .
cluster munitions are stockpiled by most countries ' armies and have often been used in the past 40 years , most recently during the war in lebanon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demining unexploded cluster bombs in lebanon is dangerous work opponents of cluster munitions consider these weapons an unacceptable danger to civilians . " it 's a double whammy , " said cmc 's co-chairman steve goose .
" at the time of the attack , the bomblets spread over a large area and they can not be guided .
a large number of them do not explode upon impact , and so they can kill years later . "
he said that cluster bombs disproportionately target civilians . " cluster munitions caused more civilian casualties during the -lrb- last -rrb- iraq war and in kosovo than any other type of weapon , " goose said . proponents of a ban argue that a prohibition is achievable .
they point to the 1997 mine ban treaty that banned the production , stockpiling and use of anti-personnel landmines - also the result of a norwegian initiative . " the landmine treaty created a powerful standard , " goose said .
" we think the same can happen with cluster munitions . " can a ban influence the right countries ? some experts remain cautious about a ban , though . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unexploded cluster munitions threaten civilians even after a conflict is over " the worry is that , with cluster munitions , it will be a treaty binding those who are already in agreement , but wo n't touch those countries that are affected by them , or manufacture them , " said nicholas sims , an expert on arms limitation at the london school of economics and political science . that fear is compounded by the fact that the united states , russia , china , britain and france - the five permanent members of the un security council - are against an international ban on cluster munitions . another source of concern touches the scope of the ban .
non-governmental organizations are calling for a comprehensive ban on the production , stockpiling and use of all types of cluster munitions .
however , even a pro-ban nation like norway has suggested that a ban could exclude certain types of cluster munitions , such as those that self-destruct on impact . the norwegian government decided to host the conference , as it considered the latest un talks on the issue , held in geneva in november , a failure . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court considers national accountability in foreign missions a kosovo man whose son was killed by a nato cluster bomb took france to europe 's top human rights court wednesday over the boy 's death .

norway and other nations in favor of a ban are being hampered by nations that oppose one . the scandinavian country hopes the two-day meeting , which will be attended by senior ministry officials from around the world , will be the start of a process that will ultimately lead to the adoption of an international ban - even without the support of some key countries , such as opponents britain and the united states . " it is better that the like-minded -lrb- pro-ban -rrb- nations work in the same direction , " said raymond johansen , norway 's state secretary of foreign affairs .
he said that an international accord would put pressure on anti-ban nations to eventually comply . the pro-ban countries expected to be represented include norway , sweden , germany , mozambique and angola .
on the other side , britain , canada , france , china , india and russia belong to those opposed .
the united states , which is also opposed , will not be in attendance . several un organizations will also attend , as well as the cluster munition coalition -lrb- cmc -rrb- , the umbrella organization grouping non-governmental organizations campaigning for a ban . " it 's a double whammy . " a cluster bomb consists of a container holding up to hundreds of smaller so-called bomblets .

cluster munitions are stockpiled by most countries ' armies and have often been used in the past 40 years , most recently during the war in lebanon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demining unexploded cluster bombs in lebanon is dangerous work opponents of cluster munitions consider these weapons an unacceptable danger to civilians . " it 's a double whammy , " said cmc 's co-chairman steve goose .
" at the time of the attack , the bomblets spread over a large area and they can not be guided .
a large number of them do not explode upon impact , and so they can kill years later . "
he said that cluster bombs disproportionately target civilians . " cluster munitions caused more civilian casualties during the -lrb- last -rrb- iraq war and in kosovo than any other type of weapon , " goose said . proponents of a ban argue that a prohibition is achievable .
they point to the 1997 mine ban treaty that banned the production , stockpiling and use of anti-personnel landmines - also the result of a norwegian initiative . " the landmine treaty created a powerful standard , " goose said .
" we think the same can happen with cluster munitions .

non-governmental organizations are calling for a comprehensive ban on the production , stockpiling and use of all types of cluster munitions .
however , even a pro-ban nation like norway has suggested that a ban could exclude certain types of cluster munitions , such as those that self-destruct on impact . the norwegian government decided to host the conference , as it considered the latest un talks on the issue , held in geneva in november , a failure . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court considers national accountability in foreign missions a kosovo man whose son was killed by a nato cluster bomb took france to europe 's top human rights court wednesday over the boy 's death .

oslo considers un talks on the issue last year a failure and hopes to launch efforts for an international ban backed by germany . representatives from over 40 countries and international organizations are gathering in oslo on thursday and friday to discuss ways to outlaw cluster bombs .
norway and other nations in favor of a ban are being hampered by nations that oppose one . the scandinavian country hopes the two-day meeting , which will be attended by senior ministry officials from around the world , will be the start of a process that will ultimately lead to the adoption of an international ban - even without the support of some key countries , such as opponents britain and the united states . " it is better that the like-minded -lrb- pro-ban -rrb- nations work in the same direction , " said raymond johansen , norway 's state secretary of foreign affairs .
he said that an international accord would put pressure on anti-ban nations to eventually comply . the pro-ban countries expected to be represented include norway , sweden , germany , mozambique and angola .
on the other side , britain , canada , france , china , india and russia belong to those opposed .
the united states , which is also opposed , will not be in attendance . several un organizations will also attend , as well as the cluster munition coalition -lrb- cmc -rrb- , the umbrella organization grouping non-governmental organizations campaigning for a ban . " it 's a double whammy . " a cluster bomb consists of a container holding up to hundreds of smaller so-called bomblets .
it opens in mid-air and disperses these grenades over a large area .
cluster munitions are stockpiled by most countries ' armies and have often been used in the past 40 years , most recently during the war in lebanon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demining unexploded cluster bombs in lebanon is dangerous work opponents of cluster munitions consider these weapons an unacceptable danger to civilians . " it 's a double whammy , " said cmc 's co-chairman steve goose .
" at the time of the attack , the bomblets spread over a large area and they can not be guided .
a large number of them do not explode upon impact , and so they can kill years later . "
he said that cluster bombs disproportionately target civilians . " cluster munitions caused more civilian casualties during the -lrb- last -rrb- iraq war and in kosovo than any other type of weapon , " goose said . proponents of a ban argue that a prohibition is achievable .
they point to the 1997 mine ban treaty that banned the production , stockpiling and use of anti-personnel landmines - also the result of a norwegian initiative . " the landmine treaty created a powerful standard , " goose said .
" we think the same can happen with cluster munitions . " can a ban influence the right countries ? some experts remain cautious about a ban , though . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unexploded cluster munitions threaten civilians even after a conflict is over " the worry is that , with cluster munitions , it will be a treaty binding those who are already in agreement , but wo n't touch those countries that are affected by them , or manufacture them , " said nicholas sims , an expert on arms limitation at the london school of economics and political science . that fear is compounded by the fact that the united states , russia , china , britain and france - the five permanent members of the un security council - are against an international ban on cluster munitions . another source of concern touches the scope of the ban .

she 's now under police protection after members received death threats . earlier this month , iran-born human rights activist mina ahadi founded the central council of ex-muslims , in the western-german city of cologne .
ahadi told the german news magazine focus : " i happened to be born in a muslim family , and i have decided not to be a muslim . "
that was the motivation for forming the group , whose members consists of some three dozen people who have turned their back on the religion .
ahadi 's decision to form the group is a controversial one considering that in most strictly islamic countries such as iran , saudi arabia , afghanistan , pakistan , sudan und mauritania , a muslim who rejects his or her religion faces the death sentence in accordance with the sharia law . other countries may not try apostates in a court of law , but they may be ostracized instead .
the topic is also sensitive in europe . an official renunciation of islam is almost unheard of .
death threats on the internet the name of ahadi 's group is also a play on the central council of muslims -lrb- zmd -rrb- , one of germany 's best-known umbrella muslim groups , also based in cologne .
the zmd is said to have around 800,00 members according to its own estimates .
ahadi , an exiled iranian living in germany , decided it was time to shine a light on the subject of born-muslims living in europe who do not want to be part of islam .
the aim of her organization , ahadi said , is to offer former muslims a voice in a country that is not represented by official muslim organizations , she told focus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green mp deligöz wanted to get rid of headscarves - and wound up with police protection but since the group 's formation , she told the magazine , she has been " terrorized . "
members of the group have gotten death threats via the internet .
about a week ago , the police approached ahadi and offered her protection .
the affair has echoes of another recent case in germany where green party politician ekin deligöz , who in october called for muslim women and girls to stop wearing head scarves , was also placed under police protection after receiving threats . at the same time ahadi is well aware of the taboos she is breaking with the founding of her group .
she said she could imagine " that there would be calls for a fatwa against us .
our project may also be discussed in the arab world . " in the coming week , members of the central council of ex-muslims have said they plan to hold a press conference to introduce the group to the public at large .
their slogan : " we have renounced . " defense for the secular ahadi told focus she is hoping the group can offer oppressed women a way to freedom , and defend secular people who live in germany and are integrated in the society here . " we want to improve society , to make it possible for us to get along better .
i hope for more peace , " the magazine quoted her as saying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european mp özdemir : looking for diverse images of islam in germany cem özdemir , a green politician fom germany with turkish roots at the european parliament told der spiegel magazine that ahadi 's project and the greens had something in common : both are hoping to expand the variety of images of islam in germany . " we have to understand , and deal with , the fact that 3.5 million muslims in germany are extremely heterogeneous .
some of them don ’ t have anything to do with religion , and do n't identify themselves as muslim , even if they were born to muslim families . still , özdemir told the magazine he did n't think the new group would attract many adherents . " openly admitting atheism is rather unusual among muslims , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " ' it is okay to be both turkish and german " ekin deligöz made waves when she called for turkish women to take off their headscarves .

the meeting , to be chaired by federal minister for health , ulla schmidt and consumer affairs minister , horst seehofer will be used to further discuss whether smoking in schools , public buildings and most restaurants should be banned by germany 's 16 federal states .
the decision to hand the responsibility for approving the ban to the individual states came after germany 's ruling coalition rescinded the original ban proposal on constitutional grounds in december last year .
the government said an outright federal ban could infringe on individual states ' rights , many of which can not be overridden by berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the states are responsible for issuing bans in public places it is the 16 states , not the federal government , which have power over local government facilities such as schools and hospitals , as well as places such as bars and restaurants - those places where the smoking ban was proposed .
pro-smoking lobbyists pulling the strings ?
the decision was also seen as another example of the german government 's unwillingness to confront the country 's powerful pro-smoking lobby which opposition politicians and anti-smoking campaigners believe holds too much influence over the ruling coalition of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
germany has been slow to follow the lead of those eu states which have already agreed and have implemented their own smoking bans .
france , italy and england have already passed laws that ban smoking in bars and restaurants , as well as public buildings , putting germany out of step with many of its european counterparts .
pressure from the anti-smoking lobby is suspected as being the reason why germany continues to lag behind .
but does the pro- lobby really have that amount of power , that the german government would defy european union directives to satisfy its wishes ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lobbyists are accused of pressuring the government " the pro-smoker lobby is stronger in germany than in any other european country , " siggi ermer , the chairman of pro rauchfrei , the german lobby for non-smokers said .

the german tobacco industry association -lrb- vdc -rrb- was unavailable for comment on its involvement in any parliamentary decisions or the extent of its influence over the government .
wolfgang hainer , head of the powerful vdc , who represents the interests of philip morris , british american tobacco , reemtsma and four other tobacco companies in germany recently told german weekly die zeit , " we collect information , channel the opinions of our members and then present the facts to the politicians .

the decision to hand the responsibility for approving the ban to the individual states came after germany 's ruling coalition rescinded the original ban proposal on constitutional grounds in december last year .

the decision was also seen as another example of the german government 's unwillingness to confront the country 's powerful pro-smoking lobby which opposition politicians and anti-smoking campaigners believe holds too much influence over the ruling coalition of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .

wolfgang hainer , head of the powerful vdc , who represents the interests of philip morris , british american tobacco , reemtsma and four other tobacco companies in germany recently told german weekly die zeit , " we collect information , channel the opinions of our members and then present the facts to the politicians . " the vdc is also said to organize regular parties at its headquarters in berlin which usually pulls in younger employees from the german ministries and the offices of parliamentarians . no such thing as a free lunch in lobbyists ' eyes germany is an important battleground for the pro-smoking lobby .
it is europe 's biggest tobacco market with about 22 million smokers , which is 27 percent of the population , according to the federal statistics office .
and with more and more eu countries cracking down on smokers , the hearts , minds and lungs of german smokers have become more valuable to the tobacco companies .
for the pro-smoking lobby to retain its advantage , alliances have to be formed with those in power .
" in germany , the tobacco lobby has a strong influence on the politicians , " pro rauchfrei 's ermer says .
" that begins with regular gifts directly to the desks of the delegates , and goes as far as direct payments for local government events and party meetings . "
" beyond that the delegates are invited regularly to meetings of the tobacco industry , the agendas of which are disguised by social topics .
until 2006 , the total of direct payments paid to the federal government by the tobacco industry amounts to 11.2 million euros . "
inaction and stalling can not stop ban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hopes of the anti- lobby regularly get trodden on ermer states that there is a network of pro-smoking sympathizers within the political arena in germany and that smokers within the government have an obvious agenda .
" whole parliamentary committees , such as the tourism committee , have been infiltrated by the tobacco lobby , " he added " in addition , the health minister ulla schmidt avoids making clear decisions .
unlike in other european countries , the german health minister doesn ’ t take the leadership in the ban discussion and leaves the demagogues to take the lead . "
despite the power wielded by the pro-lobby , ermer believes that the move towards a smoke-free europe is an irreversible one .
" while the influence in germany is large , the german pro-smoker lobby has only a small influence on europe , " ermer concludes .
" on a european scale , germany is isolated , as the judgment of the european court of justice pointed out with the tobacco advertising ban in 2005 .
only germany complained and lost , " he said .
" the european way into a smokeless future can not be stopped , it can only be slowed down by germany .

she 's now under police protection after members received death threats . earlier this month , iran-born human rights activist mina ahadi founded the central council of ex-muslims , in the western-german city of cologne .
ahadi told the german news magazine focus : " i happened to be born in a muslim family , and i have decided not to be a muslim . "
that was the motivation for forming the group , whose members consists of some three dozen people who have turned their back on the religion .
ahadi 's decision to form the group is a controversial one considering that in most strictly islamic countries such as iran , saudi arabia , afghanistan , pakistan , sudan und mauritania , a muslim who rejects his or her religion faces the death sentence in accordance with the sharia law . other countries may not try apostates in a court of law , but they may be ostracized instead .
the topic is also sensitive in europe . an official renunciation of islam is almost unheard of .
death threats on the internet the name of ahadi 's group is also a play on the central council of muslims -lrb- zmd -rrb- , one of germany 's best-known umbrella muslim groups , also based in cologne .
the zmd is said to have around 800,00 members according to its own estimates .
ahadi , an exiled iranian living in germany , decided it was time to shine a light on the subject of born-muslims living in europe who do not want to be part of islam .
the aim of her organization , ahadi said , is to offer former muslims a voice in a country that is not represented by official muslim organizations , she told focus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green mp deligöz wanted to get rid of headscarves - and wound up with police protection but since the group 's formation , she told the magazine , she has been " terrorized . "
members of the group have gotten death threats via the internet .
about a week ago , the police approached ahadi and offered her protection .
the affair has echoes of another recent case in germany where green party politician ekin deligöz , who in october called for muslim women and girls to stop wearing head scarves , was also placed under police protection after receiving threats . at the same time ahadi is well aware of the taboos she is breaking with the founding of her group .
she said she could imagine " that there would be calls for a fatwa against us .
our project may also be discussed in the arab world . " in the coming week , members of the central council of ex-muslims have said they plan to hold a press conference to introduce the group to the public at large .
their slogan : " we have renounced . " defense for the secular ahadi told focus she is hoping the group can offer oppressed women a way to freedom , and defend secular people who live in germany and are integrated in the society here . " we want to improve society , to make it possible for us to get along better .

it stops short of granting full independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un envoy martti ahtisaari under the envoy 's plan , kosovo 's government would be overseen by a new european union-led mission which would take over from the un , which has administered the province since the end of the kosovo war in 1999 . as a final round of talks , expected to last into march , got underway in vienna on the un blueprint , dw-world.de spoke with fatmir sejdiu , president of kosovo , about the fate of the region . dw-world.de : mr. president , violence has increased in kosovo this month .
two people were killed on february 10 during outbreaks . this week , there was a bomb attack on united nations vehicles in pristina .
are the negotiations failing ? fatmir sejdiu : these developments are not helping the situation in kosovo - it 's been a dark day for kosovo since the outbursts occurred .
they have been violent protests and it was absolutely unnecessary for those two people to die . not only do the deaths mean a major loss for the families .
the severity of the attacks has a very negative effect on kosovo 's prospects .
it damages the political processes . of course , everyone has the right to protest and express his or her opinions , but it 's essential that this occurs within the framework of the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo president fatmir sejdiu i believe kosovo 's negotiating group has done its job .
we have clearly represented kosovo 's interests at all of the meetings in vienna , and it 's true that we have reached a consensus in all of our decisions .
this shows that we have represented the absolute majority of kosovo 's population and its institutions . before the talks in vienna began , kosovo 's negotiating group presented a list of contentious points .
do you believe that un special envoy ahtisaari 's scheme can still be altered during the negotiations ? perhaps .
there surely wo n't be any more major changes , but it could be that arguments we have presented will be integrated in some way .
we 'll have to wait and see .
however , we do not want to start debating ahtisaari 's recommendations all over again .
that would just mean an endless round of discussions which would n't go anywhere , other than putting kosovo at further risk .
it would jeopardize its future . i would like to point out that it 's essential that the un security council keep track of this process ; it 's that group which will hear the recommendations for the future of kosovo .
the political formulations and kosovo 's independence are central here . the serbian negotiating delegation has demanded that ahtisaari 's plan be divided into technical and political sections .
what 's your opinion on that ? i think belgrade 's interest during the discussions in vienna is prolonging them as much as possible , thereby discrediting them .
that would increase the tensions in kosovo - with the aim of trying to show that kosovo is not yet ready for independence , that it 's unstable , that it offers no prospects for its citizens , and especially , for its serbian citizens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were also demonstrations in pristina in november 2006 ahtisaari himself said two-thirds of his recommendations address the safety of serbs in kosovo alone .
serbs in kosovo , for their part , say ahtisaari 's plan is unfair because it treats all minorities in the region alike .
that would mean that the serbs - the largest minority in kosovo - should have more rights than , say , the roma or ashkali groups . it certainly is a major boost for the serbian minority in kosovo that ahtisaari has addressed the situation of their equality to such an extent .
of course , other minorities have also demanded the same rights as the serbian minority , although kosovo 's institutions have integrated these into their democratic processes .
that is why those parts of the plan addressing the safety of the serbian minority are based on international norms and standards .
there are even aspects which go well beyond normal international standards . bekim shehu interviewed fatmir sejdiu -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de serbia rejects un plan for kosovo serbia 's newly elected parliament has overwhelmingly voted against a un plan on the future of its breakaway province of kosovo as a violation of the country 's territorial integrity .

two people were killed on february 10 during outbreaks . this week , there was a bomb attack on united nations vehicles in pristina .
are the negotiations failing ? fatmir sejdiu : these developments are not helping the situation in kosovo - it 's been a dark day for kosovo since the outbursts occurred .
they have been violent protests and it was absolutely unnecessary for those two people to die . not only do the deaths mean a major loss for the families .
the severity of the attacks has a very negative effect on kosovo 's prospects .
it damages the political processes . of course , everyone has the right to protest and express his or her opinions , but it 's essential that this occurs within the framework of the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo president fatmir sejdiu i believe kosovo 's negotiating group has done its job .
we have clearly represented kosovo 's interests at all of the meetings in vienna , and it 's true that we have reached a consensus in all of our decisions .
this shows that we have represented the absolute majority of kosovo 's population and its institutions . before the talks in vienna began , kosovo 's negotiating group presented a list of contentious points .
do you believe that un special envoy ahtisaari 's scheme can still be altered during the negotiations ? perhaps .
there surely wo n't be any more major changes , but it could be that arguments we have presented will be integrated in some way .
we 'll have to wait and see .
however , we do not want to start debating ahtisaari 's recommendations all over again .
that would just mean an endless round of discussions which would n't go anywhere , other than putting kosovo at further risk .
it would jeopardize its future . i would like to point out that it 's essential that the un security council keep track of this process ; it 's that group which will hear the recommendations for the future of kosovo .
the political formulations and kosovo 's independence are central here . the serbian negotiating delegation has demanded that ahtisaari 's plan be divided into technical and political sections .
what 's your opinion on that ? i think belgrade 's interest during the discussions in vienna is prolonging them as much as possible , thereby discrediting them .
that would increase the tensions in kosovo - with the aim of trying to show that kosovo is not yet ready for independence , that it 's unstable , that it offers no prospects for its citizens , and especially , for its serbian citizens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were also demonstrations in pristina in november 2006 ahtisaari himself said two-thirds of his recommendations address the safety of serbs in kosovo alone .
serbs in kosovo , for their part , say ahtisaari 's plan is unfair because it treats all minorities in the region alike .
that would mean that the serbs - the largest minority in kosovo - should have more rights than , say , the roma or ashkali groups . it certainly is a major boost for the serbian minority in kosovo that ahtisaari has addressed the situation of their equality to such an extent .
of course , other minorities have also demanded the same rights as the serbian minority , although kosovo 's institutions have integrated these into their democratic processes .
that is why those parts of the plan addressing the safety of the serbian minority are based on international norms and standards .

now , german chancellor angela merkel also boasts one , 60 miles north of berlin . a magnificent 1738-built baroque-style property called schloss meseberg -lrb- castle meseberg -rrb- is situated in the eastern state of brandenburg encircling berlin . on friday , german chancellor angela merkel will play host at the castle for the first time to french president jacques chirac , during one of their regular german-franco consultations . under a deal reached with the messerschmidt foundation - a privately-owned organization that bought the castle in the mid-nineties - the government will be allowed to use the property as its guesthouse for high-ranking officials over a 20-year period at a rent of just one euro a year . the government for its part has in the past year spent 13 million euros -lrb- $ 17 million -rrb- modernizing its kitchen and heating facilities and by ensuring its security and technical facilities are also state-of-the-art . mixed feelings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jacques chirac will be merkel 's first guest at meseberg while there is general satisfaction in brandenburg that a worthy role has been found for the magnificently-restored property , feelings in meseberg -lrb- population 135 -rrb- are mixed . the decision to renew the 1.7 kilometer-long -lrb- 1 mile -rrb- approach road to the castle has raised eyebrows in the village even though community officials say the rough-surfaced , pot-holed road , was in dire need of repair . the main cost will be borne by the german government and brandenburg state , but villagers with properties along the route are also being called on to make contributions , ranging from 2,000 to 15,000 euros . where were they before ? evelyn briesmeister , 65 , a village resident , is furious . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the castle has been meticulously restored to its past splendor " the state of the road did n't bother a soul in earlier times , " briesmeister said .
" now , because government officials will be driving cars along it to the schloss the whole village is made poor . " her husband , horst briesemeister , 70 , agrees .
both have signed a citizen 's petition in protest . frank stege , 45 , the district 's head official claims the decision to renew the approach road at a cost of 1.2 million euros was taken in december 2005 . " we aim to make the payments socially tolerable for the villagers , " he said . transfer of power in the old federal republic during the years of division , the government 's official guesthouse was to be found atop a hill overlooking the rhine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meseberg is probably the cheapest castle in the world : the german government will be renting it for 1 euro per year nick-named the " rotunde " -lrb- rotunda -rrb- with its 23 conference rooms , it played host to a whole list of world leaders in the post-war years , ranging from leonid breschnev to bill clinton , the shah of persia to queen elizabeth of england . but after german reunification and the controversial political " power transfer " from bonn to berlin in 1999 , it was clear a new government guesthouse would have to be found closer to the old-new capital . schloss meseberg received little consideration at the time .
situated in the former gdr -lrb- east germany -rrb- , it was just one of a series of decaying country retreats which had fallen on hard times during the communist era . then , the munich-based messerschmidt foundation , a private organization that renovates dilapidated monuments across germany , acquired the castle in the mid-1990s , and spent 25 million euros over the next 10 years restoring it . footing the bill the brandenburg state government , it was thought , would find a role for the castle and was miffed when matthias platzeck , the state 's premier , ultimately rejected the idea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last summer , merkel welcomed george w. bush in her constituency in stralsund but platzeck did toss the idea to then german chancellor gerhard schröder who was seeking a suitable venue for summer government conclaves and a place for putting up high-ranking foreign visitors . his dilemma was spotlighted in early 2005 when president bush arrived for a visit .
concern about his safety led to a planned berlin stop-over being moved to mainz , near frankfurt . late last month , german chancellory minister thomas de maiziere was handed a symbolic key to schloss meseberg . referring to the castle as a government venue for international conferences and foreign guests making overnight stays , de maiziere predicted that " history would be written in the meseberg meetings of the future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 22.02.2007 italian president looks for post-prodi direction großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's government is in free fall for the time being italy 's president was to consult with party and government leaders on the future of the government thursday , following the resignation of prime minister romano prodi wednesday . after italian prime minister romano prodi handed in his resignation wednesday , italy 's president giorgio napolitano was to hold consultations with party leaders on the future of the government thursday . the talks were scheduled to begin with the speakers of the two branches of parliament and former presidents of the republic , followed by meetings with party whips . options for new government napolitano faces a number of options .
he could reject prodi 's resignation and ask him to seek a vote of confidence in parliament , or give him a mandate to form a new government . alternatively , he could give the mandate to a different center-left leader or an institutional figure .
a final option , seen as less likely at present , would be to call fresh elections that would take place in the spring . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi 's government lost a key vote over foreign policy in a drama reminiscent of italian politics of the 1980s and 1990s when governments sometimes lasted less than a week , prodi stepped down on wednesday , just nine months after assuming office , after he lost a key vote in parliament 's upper house over his government 's foreign policy .
the center-left government was forced onto the defensive over the deployment of 2,000 troops in afghanistan and the enlargement of a us military base in northern italy . both are policies most opposed by far-left parties within prodi 's coalition . opposition called for prodi 's resignation but it is the conservative opposition , led by silvio berlusconi , who was narrowly forced out of the prime minister 's office by prodi in an election last april , who led calls for prodi to go . right wing senators shouted " resign ! resign ! " after the result of the vote in the italian senate was announced .
prodi should " tender his resignation immediately , " declared berlusconi . the government needed 160 votes in the senate debate to get a formal motion of support .
but only 158 senators voted in favor and 136 opposed the government .
several left-wing senators were reportedly absent from the upper chamber . though it was not a formal vote of confidence , foreign minister massimo d 'alema said tuesday that the government would " go home " if it lost . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tide of public opinion can turn quickly , and brutally " it is a grave , serious and worrying fact to not obtain a majority for the speech of a foreign minister , " acknowledged vannino chiti , the minister for relations with parliament . immediately after , prodi held a crisis meeting with d 'alema , defence minister arturo parisi and deputy prime minister francesco rutelli . he then tendered his resignation to the president .
napolitano , who rushed back to rome from a visit to the provinces , said in a statement that he " reserves his decision " on the future of the government . under pressure over afghanistan d 'alema had to defend italy 's military mission in afghanistan to senators before the vote .
italy currently has around 2,000 troops deployed in the country as part of a nato-led peacekeeping mission . " it 's not a nato mission , but a united nations mission in which nato has an important military function , " d 'alema told the parliament . " it is a political and civil mission . "
the afghanistan deployment and the enlargement of the us base at vicenza in northern italy are both strongly opposed by the greens and communists who are part of a ruling coalition which also includes liberal and roman catholic parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters at a demonstration against the expansion of a us military base in vicenza more than 80,000 people took part in a rally last saturday in vicenza against the base enlargement . d 'alema said that to go back on the approval for the base that the prime minister gave last month for the base enlargement would be a " hostile act " toward the united states . no stranger to controversy prodi 's union coalition narrowly won an election in april last year that ended berlusconi 's five year-old government - one of the longest in recent italian political history . prodi is no stranger to the dangers of running italian governments . he resigned as prime minister in 1997 and 1998 when leading governments .
the first time he won a vote of confidence from parliament .
the second time he had to let d 'alema take over .

he could reject prodi 's resignation and ask him to seek a vote of confidence in parliament , or give him a mandate to form a new government . alternatively , he could give the mandate to a different center-left leader or an institutional figure .
a final option , seen as less likely at present , would be to call fresh elections that would take place in the spring . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi 's government lost a key vote over foreign policy in a drama reminiscent of italian politics of the 1980s and 1990s when governments sometimes lasted less than a week , prodi stepped down on wednesday , just nine months after assuming office , after he lost a key vote in parliament 's upper house over his government 's foreign policy .
the center-left government was forced onto the defensive over the deployment of 2,000 troops in afghanistan and the enlargement of a us military base in northern italy . both are policies most opposed by far-left parties within prodi 's coalition . opposition called for prodi 's resignation but it is the conservative opposition , led by silvio berlusconi , who was narrowly forced out of the prime minister 's office by prodi in an election last april , who led calls for prodi to go . right wing senators shouted " resign ! resign ! " after the result of the vote in the italian senate was announced .
prodi should " tender his resignation immediately , " declared berlusconi . the government needed 160 votes in the senate debate to get a formal motion of support .
but only 158 senators voted in favor and 136 opposed the government .
several left-wing senators were reportedly absent from the upper chamber . though it was not a formal vote of confidence , foreign minister massimo d 'alema said tuesday that the government would " go home " if it lost . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tide of public opinion can turn quickly , and brutally " it is a grave , serious and worrying fact to not obtain a majority for the speech of a foreign minister , " acknowledged vannino chiti , the minister for relations with parliament . immediately after , prodi held a crisis meeting with d 'alema , defence minister arturo parisi and deputy prime minister francesco rutelli . he then tendered his resignation to the president .
napolitano , who rushed back to rome from a visit to the provinces , said in a statement that he " reserves his decision " on the future of the government . under pressure over afghanistan d 'alema had to defend italy 's military mission in afghanistan to senators before the vote .
italy currently has around 2,000 troops deployed in the country as part of a nato-led peacekeeping mission . " it 's not a nato mission , but a united nations mission in which nato has an important military function , " d 'alema told the parliament . " it is a political and civil mission . "

for bavarian leader , it 's same difference großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a german tradition : mixing politics with beer in his last grand speech as bavarian premier , edmund stoiber got a little confused .
or did he ?
after 30 years in politics and countless slips of the tongue , maybe he finally knew what he was doing . jan .
18 , 2007 , will go down in history as germany thought it had gone seriously hard of hearing .
millions of german television viewers cranked up the volume on their tv sets as their jaws dropped collectively in the most unifying moment of national self-awareness since the world cup .
there are unconfirmed reports that bavarian maternity hospitals went practically silent as thousands of babies - inexplicably sensing that something big was happening - stopped crying . on that solemn day , premier of bavaria and chairman of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , edmund stoiber announced he was going to step down in september - after his own party decided that enough was enough . to an outsider , this may not seem like such a big deal .
politicians come and go .
in most parts of the world - with the exception , perhaps , of north korea , where presidents remain in power even after they 've gone to the communist version of heaven - the news of a politician stepping down is no more extraordinary than reports of paula abdul being drunk on american idol , again . bavaria , however , is a unique gem in the german federal system and stoiber , an exceptional personality on the german political scene . life after stoiber - is it possible ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bye-bye , eddie !
you 'll be missed !
edmund stoiber has been the alpha and omega of bavarian politics for so long that his supporters and his critics began to see in him something more than a politician : a symbol of constancy and a monument to the bavarian way of life . many a german politician would sell their mother to get the kind of popularity that stoiber has enjoyed in his neck of the woods - the most pious but also the most beer-drinking of all german states , a folksy dream come true . so everybody was , understandably , emotional about stoiber 's speech at a post-carnival , beer-bash on wednesday , most likely , the last grand speech in his political career .
mixing wishful thinking with political blindness , stoiber told his followers not to worry - and warned his opponents not to get their hopes up - by sounding totally convinced that nothing would change in bavaria after his departure , that everything would stay the same .
everybody cheered . what 's in a name ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leonid brezhnev probably never thought he could be mistaken for a us president the gentleman that he is , stoiber was going to compliment german chancellor merkel on her tough stance against us president george w. bush .
but that 's where things got a little complicated . " i found it refreshing , " stoiber said , " that the chancelor criticized guantanamo in front of us president brezhnev . " us president brezhnev ?
hello , bavaria , this is earth speaking !
what was edmund stoiber thinking when he mixed up bush - himself a master of the freudian slip - and brezhnev - a man who loved vodka as much as communism ? he 's done it before stoiber is known for not always saying the right thing .
the country is laughing to this day about the time he addressed sabine christiansen - the people 's princess of german political talk shows - as " frau merkel . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel is friendly but tough with the real us president admittedly , not all of his faux pas were equally entertaining .
the entire population of eastern germany , for instance , was not in the least amused when stoiber - during the 2005 election run-up - called them " the frustrated ones " and said he was not leaving the country 's fate to them . stoiber has raised his inability to form complete sentences to the level of rhetorical bravado .
one of his speeches about the transrapid railway system , for example , has inspired numerous music geeks to remix his staccato gobbledygook into a musical and poetic firework that became an instant success on the german-speaking internet . very few politicians get to have their speeches set to cheap techno or german rap .
but stoiber is not like other politicians .
he could easily make the transition from herr prime minister to mc kool dawg eddie and land a contract with a major record label , without even trying . a new career in sight ? various theories are circulating about his latest slip of the tongue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no , it 's not brezhnev in the background .
it 's theo waigel unlike former chancellor schröder - who , by general agreement , must have had a little too much to drink on the night of the 2005 elections , which made him sound overoptimistic and belligerent on tv that night - stoiber seemed as sober as the uncrowned king of bavaria could possibly be . some claim that it was the sight of another fellow conservative , politician theo waigel in the audience that triggered the confusion .
weigel - the owner of the most impressive unibrow on the german political scene - could be said to resemble leonid brezhnev , at least as far as excess hair between their eyebrows is concerned . but what if this was not a slip of the tongue at all ?
what if stoiber - by consciously comparing us president bush to a soviet communist dictator - was simply preparing himself for a career in the exciting business of human rights ?
everybody 's criticizing bush these days , so why not ?
or was stoiber preparing to enter the world of stand-up comedy ? is stoiber going the heide simonis way ? just like heide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heide simonis , left , did not make a smooth transition to entertainment simonis was a social democratic politician and prime minister of schleswig-holstein .
after her own election debacle in 2005 -lrb- when members of her own party refused to elect her in four consecutive ballots in the state parliament -rrb- , she became head of the german unicef . in the weirdest pr miscalculation of the year , simonis , with her stiff posture and absolute lack of any sense of humor , became the laughing stock of the entire nation with her consistently horrifying performance in the tv contest " let 's dance " last year . stoiber would probably never do such a thing - prance around with celebrities and ballroom dancing stars .
but he may consider a political comedy show .

for bavarian leader , it 's same difference großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a german tradition : mixing politics with beer in his last grand speech as bavarian premier , edmund stoiber got a little confused .
or did he ?
after 30 years in politics and countless slips of the tongue , maybe he finally knew what he was doing . jan .
18 , 2007 , will go down in history as germany thought it had gone seriously hard of hearing .
millions of german television viewers cranked up the volume on their tv sets as their jaws dropped collectively in the most unifying moment of national self-awareness since the world cup .
there are unconfirmed reports that bavarian maternity hospitals went practically silent as thousands of babies - inexplicably sensing that something big was happening - stopped crying . on that solemn day , premier of bavaria and chairman of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , edmund stoiber announced he was going to step down in september - after his own party decided that enough was enough . to an outsider , this may not seem like such a big deal .
politicians come and go .
in most parts of the world - with the exception , perhaps , of north korea , where presidents remain in power even after they 've gone to the communist version of heaven - the news of a politician stepping down is no more extraordinary than reports of paula abdul being drunk on american idol , again . bavaria , however , is a unique gem in the german federal system and stoiber , an exceptional personality on the german political scene . life after stoiber - is it possible ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bye-bye , eddie !
you 'll be missed !
edmund stoiber has been the alpha and omega of bavarian politics for so long that his supporters and his critics began to see in him something more than a politician : a symbol of constancy and a monument to the bavarian way of life . many a german politician would sell their mother to get the kind of popularity that stoiber has enjoyed in his neck of the woods - the most pious but also the most beer-drinking of all german states , a folksy dream come true . so everybody was , understandably , emotional about stoiber 's speech at a post-carnival , beer-bash on wednesday , most likely , the last grand speech in his political career .
mixing wishful thinking with political blindness , stoiber told his followers not to worry - and warned his opponents not to get their hopes up - by sounding totally convinced that nothing would change in bavaria after his departure , that everything would stay the same .
everybody cheered . what 's in a name ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leonid brezhnev probably never thought he could be mistaken for a us president the gentleman that he is , stoiber was going to compliment german chancellor merkel on her tough stance against us president george w. bush .
but that 's where things got a little complicated . " i found it refreshing , " stoiber said , " that the chancelor criticized guantanamo in front of us president brezhnev . " us president brezhnev ?
hello , bavaria , this is earth speaking !
what was edmund stoiber thinking when he mixed up bush - himself a master of the freudian slip - and brezhnev - a man who loved vodka as much as communism ? he 's done it before stoiber is known for not always saying the right thing .
the country is laughing to this day about the time he addressed sabine christiansen - the people 's princess of german political talk shows - as " frau merkel . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel is friendly but tough with the real us president admittedly , not all of his faux pas were equally entertaining .
the entire population of eastern germany , for instance , was not in the least amused when stoiber - during the 2005 election run-up - called them " the frustrated ones " and said he was not leaving the country 's fate to them . stoiber has raised his inability to form complete sentences to the level of rhetorical bravado .
one of his speeches about the transrapid railway system , for example , has inspired numerous music geeks to remix his staccato gobbledygook into a musical and poetic firework that became an instant success on the german-speaking internet . very few politicians get to have their speeches set to cheap techno or german rap .
but stoiber is not like other politicians .
he could easily make the transition from herr prime minister to mc kool dawg eddie and land a contract with a major record label , without even trying . a new career in sight ? various theories are circulating about his latest slip of the tongue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no , it 's not brezhnev in the background .
it 's theo waigel unlike former chancellor schröder - who , by general agreement , must have had a little too much to drink on the night of the 2005 elections , which made him sound overoptimistic and belligerent on tv that night - stoiber seemed as sober as the uncrowned king of bavaria could possibly be . some claim that it was the sight of another fellow conservative , politician theo waigel in the audience that triggered the confusion .

everybody 's criticizing bush these days , so why not ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 22.02.2007 the power behind the german smoking ban stalemate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's smoke-filled bars and cafes are almost a rarity in western europe as a crucial meeting on protecting non-smokers opens in germany friday , a look at the country 's powerful tobacco lobby offers some clues as to why germany has successfully resisted an outright smoking ban so far . the struggle in germany to agree on a smoking ban continues this week when government ministers convene in hanover on friday to discuss the issue of protection for non-smokers before a state premiers ' debate on march 22 .
the meeting , to be chaired by federal minister for health , ulla schmidt and consumer affairs minister , horst seehofer will be used to further discuss whether smoking in schools , public buildings and most restaurants should be banned by germany 's 16 federal states .
the decision to hand the responsibility for approving the ban to the individual states came after germany 's ruling coalition rescinded the original ban proposal on constitutional grounds in december last year .
the government said an outright federal ban could infringe on individual states ' rights , many of which can not be overridden by berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the states are responsible for issuing bans in public places it is the 16 states , not the federal government , which have power over local government facilities such as schools and hospitals , as well as places such as bars and restaurants - those places where the smoking ban was proposed .
pro-smoking lobbyists pulling the strings ?
the decision was also seen as another example of the german government 's unwillingness to confront the country 's powerful pro-smoking lobby which opposition politicians and anti-smoking campaigners believe holds too much influence over the ruling coalition of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
germany has been slow to follow the lead of those eu states which have already agreed and have implemented their own smoking bans .
france , italy and england have already passed laws that ban smoking in bars and restaurants , as well as public buildings , putting germany out of step with many of its european counterparts .
pressure from the anti-smoking lobby is suspected as being the reason why germany continues to lag behind .
but does the pro- lobby really have that amount of power , that the german government would defy european union directives to satisfy its wishes ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lobbyists are accused of pressuring the government " the pro-smoker lobby is stronger in germany than in any other european country , " siggi ermer , the chairman of pro rauchfrei , the german lobby for non-smokers said . " even the tobacco companies are proud of that fact .
its influence is so strong that pro rauchfrei talks about a tobacco dictatorship in a democratic state .
-lrb- the pro- lobby -rrb- has affected the legislation for decades and crucially has steered the politicians .
" it is so powerful that in the current discussions , the cdu / csu parliamentary group brought in a regulation paper from the german tobacco industry association -lrb- vdc -rrb- and presented it word for word as their own proposal for the negotiations . "
the german tobacco industry association -lrb- vdc -rrb- was unavailable for comment on its involvement in any parliamentary decisions or the extent of its influence over the government .
wolfgang hainer , head of the powerful vdc , who represents the interests of philip morris , british american tobacco , reemtsma and four other tobacco companies in germany recently told german weekly die zeit , " we collect information , channel the opinions of our members and then present the facts to the politicians . " the vdc is also said to organize regular parties at its headquarters in berlin which usually pulls in younger employees from the german ministries and the offices of parliamentarians . no such thing as a free lunch in lobbyists ' eyes germany is an important battleground for the pro-smoking lobby .
it is europe 's biggest tobacco market with about 22 million smokers , which is 27 percent of the population , according to the federal statistics office .
and with more and more eu countries cracking down on smokers , the hearts , minds and lungs of german smokers have become more valuable to the tobacco companies .
for the pro-smoking lobby to retain its advantage , alliances have to be formed with those in power .
" in germany , the tobacco lobby has a strong influence on the politicians , " pro rauchfrei 's ermer says .
" that begins with regular gifts directly to the desks of the delegates , and goes as far as direct payments for local government events and party meetings . "
" beyond that the delegates are invited regularly to meetings of the tobacco industry , the agendas of which are disguised by social topics .
until 2006 , the total of direct payments paid to the federal government by the tobacco industry amounts to 11.2 million euros . "
inaction and stalling can not stop ban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hopes of the anti- lobby regularly get trodden on ermer states that there is a network of pro-smoking sympathizers within the political arena in germany and that smokers within the government have an obvious agenda .
" whole parliamentary committees , such as the tourism committee , have been infiltrated by the tobacco lobby , " he added " in addition , the health minister ulla schmidt avoids making clear decisions .
unlike in other european countries , the german health minister doesn ’ t take the leadership in the ban discussion and leaves the demagogues to take the lead . "
despite the power wielded by the pro-lobby , ermer believes that the move towards a smoke-free europe is an irreversible one .
" while the influence in germany is large , the german pro-smoker lobby has only a small influence on europe , " ermer concludes .
" on a european scale , germany is isolated , as the judgment of the european court of justice pointed out with the tobacco advertising ban in 2005 .
only germany complained and lost , " he said .
" the european way into a smokeless future can not be stopped , it can only be slowed down by germany .

she 's now under police protection after members received death threats . earlier this month , iran-born human rights activist mina ahadi founded the central council of ex-muslims , in the western-german city of cologne .
ahadi told the german news magazine focus : " i happened to be born in a muslim family , and i have decided not to be a muslim . "
that was the motivation for forming the group , whose members consists of some three dozen people who have turned their back on the religion .
ahadi 's decision to form the group is a controversial one considering that in most strictly islamic countries such as iran , saudi arabia , afghanistan , pakistan , sudan und mauritania , a muslim who rejects his or her religion faces the death sentence in accordance with the sharia law . other countries may not try apostates in a court of law , but they may be ostracized instead .
the topic is also sensitive in europe . an official renunciation of islam is almost unheard of .
death threats on the internet the name of ahadi 's group is also a play on the central council of muslims -lrb- zmd -rrb- , one of germany 's best-known umbrella muslim groups , also based in cologne .
the zmd is said to have around 800,00 members according to its own estimates .
ahadi , an exiled iranian living in germany , decided it was time to shine a light on the subject of born-muslims living in europe who do not want to be part of islam .
the aim of her organization , ahadi said , is to offer former muslims a voice in a country that is not represented by official muslim organizations , she told focus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green mp deligöz wanted to get rid of headscarves - and wound up with police protection but since the group 's formation , she told the magazine , she has been " terrorized . "
members of the group have gotten death threats via the internet .
about a week ago , the police approached ahadi and offered her protection .
the affair has echoes of another recent case in germany where green party politician ekin deligöz , who in october called for muslim women and girls to stop wearing head scarves , was also placed under police protection after receiving threats . at the same time ahadi is well aware of the taboos she is breaking with the founding of her group .
she said she could imagine " that there would be calls for a fatwa against us .
our project may also be discussed in the arab world . " in the coming week , members of the central council of ex-muslims have said they plan to hold a press conference to introduce the group to the public at large .
their slogan : " we have renounced .

the meeting , to be chaired by federal minister for health , ulla schmidt and consumer affairs minister , horst seehofer will be used to further discuss whether smoking in schools , public buildings and most restaurants should be banned by germany 's 16 federal states .
the decision to hand the responsibility for approving the ban to the individual states came after germany 's ruling coalition rescinded the original ban proposal on constitutional grounds in december last year .
the government said an outright federal ban could infringe on individual states ' rights , many of which can not be overridden by berlin .

pro-smoking lobbyists pulling the strings ?
the decision was also seen as another example of the german government 's unwillingness to confront the country 's powerful pro-smoking lobby which opposition politicians and anti-smoking campaigners believe holds too much influence over the ruling coalition of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
germany has been slow to follow the lead of those eu states which have already agreed and have implemented their own smoking bans .

napolitano 's flurry of meetings thursday were to continue friday , consulting with the speakers of the two houses of parliament , the heads of parliamentary groups and the presidents who preceded him . prodi , head of italy 's 61st government since world war ii , was also prime minister for two years and five months in 1996-98 , falling when communists withdrew their support . possible reinstatement napolitano is widely expected to rename prodi as prime minister .

for bavarian leader , it 's same difference großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a german tradition : mixing politics with beer in his last grand speech as bavarian premier , edmund stoiber got a little confused .
or did he ?
after 30 years in politics and countless slips of the tongue , maybe he finally knew what he was doing . jan .
18 , 2007 , will go down in history as germany thought it had gone seriously hard of hearing .
millions of german television viewers cranked up the volume on their tv sets as their jaws dropped collectively in the most unifying moment of national self-awareness since the world cup .
there are unconfirmed reports that bavarian maternity hospitals went practically silent as thousands of babies - inexplicably sensing that something big was happening - stopped crying . on that solemn day , premier of bavaria and chairman of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , edmund stoiber announced he was going to step down in september - after his own party decided that enough was enough . to an outsider , this may not seem like such a big deal .
politicians come and go .
in most parts of the world - with the exception , perhaps , of north korea , where presidents remain in power even after they 've gone to the communist version of heaven - the news of a politician stepping down is no more extraordinary than reports of paula abdul being drunk on american idol , again . bavaria , however , is a unique gem in the german federal system and stoiber , an exceptional personality on the german political scene . life after stoiber - is it possible ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bye-bye , eddie !
you 'll be missed !
edmund stoiber has been the alpha and omega of bavarian politics for so long that his supporters and his critics began to see in him something more than a politician : a symbol of constancy and a monument to the bavarian way of life . many a german politician would sell their mother to get the kind of popularity that stoiber has enjoyed in his neck of the woods - the most pious but also the most beer-drinking of all german states , a folksy dream come true . so everybody was , understandably , emotional about stoiber 's speech at a post-carnival , beer-bash on wednesday , most likely , the last grand speech in his political career .
mixing wishful thinking with political blindness , stoiber told his followers not to worry - and warned his opponents not to get their hopes up - by sounding totally convinced that nothing would change in bavaria after his departure , that everything would stay the same .
everybody cheered . what 's in a name ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leonid brezhnev probably never thought he could be mistaken for a us president the gentleman that he is , stoiber was going to compliment german chancellor merkel on her tough stance against us president george w. bush .
but that 's where things got a little complicated . " i found it refreshing , " stoiber said , " that the chancelor criticized guantanamo in front of us president brezhnev . " us president brezhnev ?
hello , bavaria , this is earth speaking !

for bavarian leader , it 's same difference großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a german tradition : mixing politics with beer in his last grand speech as bavarian premier , edmund stoiber got a little confused .
or did he ?
after 30 years in politics and countless slips of the tongue , maybe he finally knew what he was doing . jan .
18 , 2007 , will go down in history as germany thought it had gone seriously hard of hearing .
millions of german television viewers cranked up the volume on their tv sets as their jaws dropped collectively in the most unifying moment of national self-awareness since the world cup .
there are unconfirmed reports that bavarian maternity hospitals went practically silent as thousands of babies - inexplicably sensing that something big was happening - stopped crying . on that solemn day , premier of bavaria and chairman of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , edmund stoiber announced he was going to step down in september - after his own party decided that enough was enough . to an outsider , this may not seem like such a big deal .
politicians come and go .
in most parts of the world - with the exception , perhaps , of north korea , where presidents remain in power even after they 've gone to the communist version of heaven - the news of a politician stepping down is no more extraordinary than reports of paula abdul being drunk on american idol , again . bavaria , however , is a unique gem in the german federal system and stoiber , an exceptional personality on the german political scene . life after stoiber - is it possible ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bye-bye , eddie !
you 'll be missed !
edmund stoiber has been the alpha and omega of bavarian politics for so long that his supporters and his critics began to see in him something more than a politician : a symbol of constancy and a monument to the bavarian way of life . many a german politician would sell their mother to get the kind of popularity that stoiber has enjoyed in his neck of the woods - the most pious but also the most beer-drinking of all german states , a folksy dream come true . so everybody was , understandably , emotional about stoiber 's speech at a post-carnival , beer-bash on wednesday , most likely , the last grand speech in his political career .
mixing wishful thinking with political blindness , stoiber told his followers not to worry - and warned his opponents not to get their hopes up - by sounding totally convinced that nothing would change in bavaria after his departure , that everything would stay the same .
everybody cheered . what 's in a name ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leonid brezhnev probably never thought he could be mistaken for a us president the gentleman that he is , stoiber was going to compliment german chancellor merkel on her tough stance against us president george w. bush .
but that 's where things got a little complicated . " i found it refreshing , " stoiber said , " that the chancelor criticized guantanamo in front of us president brezhnev . " us president brezhnev ?
hello , bavaria , this is earth speaking !
what was edmund stoiber thinking when he mixed up bush - himself a master of the freudian slip - and brezhnev - a man who loved vodka as much as communism ? he 's done it before stoiber is known for not always saying the right thing .
the country is laughing to this day about the time he addressed sabine christiansen - the people 's princess of german political talk shows - as " frau merkel . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel is friendly but tough with the real us president admittedly , not all of his faux pas were equally entertaining .
the entire population of eastern germany , for instance , was not in the least amused when stoiber - during the 2005 election run-up - called them " the frustrated ones " and said he was not leaving the country 's fate to them . stoiber has raised his inability to form complete sentences to the level of rhetorical bravado .
one of his speeches about the transrapid railway system , for example , has inspired numerous music geeks to remix his staccato gobbledygook into a musical and poetic firework that became an instant success on the german-speaking internet . very few politicians get to have their speeches set to cheap techno or german rap .
but stoiber is not like other politicians .
he could easily make the transition from herr prime minister to mc kool dawg eddie and land a contract with a major record label , without even trying . a new career in sight ? various theories are circulating about his latest slip of the tongue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no , it 's not brezhnev in the background .
it 's theo waigel unlike former chancellor schröder - who , by general agreement , must have had a little too much to drink on the night of the 2005 elections , which made him sound overoptimistic and belligerent on tv that night - stoiber seemed as sober as the uncrowned king of bavaria could possibly be . some claim that it was the sight of another fellow conservative , politician theo waigel in the audience that triggered the confusion .
weigel - the owner of the most impressive unibrow on the german political scene - could be said to resemble leonid brezhnev , at least as far as excess hair between their eyebrows is concerned . but what if this was not a slip of the tongue at all ?
what if stoiber - by consciously comparing us president bush to a soviet communist dictator - was simply preparing himself for a career in the exciting business of human rights ?
everybody 's criticizing bush these days , so why not ?
or was stoiber preparing to enter the world of stand-up comedy ? is stoiber going the heide simonis way ? just like heide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heide simonis , left , did not make a smooth transition to entertainment simonis was a social democratic politician and prime minister of schleswig-holstein .
after her own election debacle in 2005 -lrb- when members of her own party refused to elect her in four consecutive ballots in the state parliament -rrb- , she became head of the german unicef . in the weirdest pr miscalculation of the year , simonis , with her stiff posture and absolute lack of any sense of humor , became the laughing stock of the entire nation with her consistently horrifying performance in the tv contest " let 's dance " last year . stoiber would probably never do such a thing - prance around with celebrities and ballroom dancing stars .
but he may consider a political comedy show .
" late night with eddie - the other side of politics " or " laughing with eddie - unplugged and unscripted . " if only germany were that lucky . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " germany is certainly facing serious problems , but it 's also important not to forget to laugh once in a while .
read up on a selection on recent articles about funny events in germany .
-lrb- 09.02.2007 -rrb- of politicians , passports and popes germans are known as serious and hard-working people , but the country 's unruly politicians are habitually letting passions and intrigues run rampant .

we entered the home , laid the keys down on a table in the entranceway and began to look around .
all of the ladies decided to go out into the backyard and i went out front to begin to bring in the luggage .
the doors closed behind us and we did n't realize that they locked automatically .
five minutes after getting to the house , we were locked out .
we then spent the next one half hour trying to explain to the older gentleman from whom we had gotten the first set of keys that the americans had quickly locked themselves out of their own home and needed another key to get in .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 22.02.2007 the power behind the german smoking ban stalemate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's smoke-filled bars and cafes are almost a rarity in western europe as a crucial meeting on protecting non-smokers opens in germany friday , a look at the country 's powerful tobacco lobby offers some clues as to why germany has successfully resisted an outright smoking ban so far . the struggle in germany to agree on a smoking ban continues this week when government ministers convene in hanover on friday to discuss the issue of protection for non-smokers before a state premiers ' debate on march 22 .
the meeting , to be chaired by federal minister for health , ulla schmidt and consumer affairs minister , horst seehofer will be used to further discuss whether smoking in schools , public buildings and most restaurants should be banned by germany 's 16 federal states .
the decision to hand the responsibility for approving the ban to the individual states came after germany 's ruling coalition rescinded the original ban proposal on constitutional grounds in december last year .
the government said an outright federal ban could infringe on individual states ' rights , many of which can not be overridden by berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the states are responsible for issuing bans in public places it is the 16 states , not the federal government , which have power over local government facilities such as schools and hospitals , as well as places such as bars and restaurants - those places where the smoking ban was proposed .
pro-smoking lobbyists pulling the strings ?
the decision was also seen as another example of the german government 's unwillingness to confront the country 's powerful pro-smoking lobby which opposition politicians and anti-smoking campaigners believe holds too much influence over the ruling coalition of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
germany has been slow to follow the lead of those eu states which have already agreed and have implemented their own smoking bans .
france , italy and england have already passed laws that ban smoking in bars and restaurants , as well as public buildings , putting germany out of step with many of its european counterparts .
pressure from the anti-smoking lobby is suspected as being the reason why germany continues to lag behind .
but does the pro- lobby really have that amount of power , that the german government would defy european union directives to satisfy its wishes ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lobbyists are accused of pressuring the government " the pro-smoker lobby is stronger in germany than in any other european country , " siggi ermer , the chairman of pro rauchfrei , the german lobby for non-smokers said . " even the tobacco companies are proud of that fact .
its influence is so strong that pro rauchfrei talks about a tobacco dictatorship in a democratic state .
-lrb- the pro- lobby -rrb- has affected the legislation for decades and crucially has steered the politicians .
" it is so powerful that in the current discussions , the cdu / csu parliamentary group brought in a regulation paper from the german tobacco industry association -lrb- vdc -rrb- and presented it word for word as their own proposal for the negotiations . "
the german tobacco industry association -lrb- vdc -rrb- was unavailable for comment on its involvement in any parliamentary decisions or the extent of its influence over the government .
wolfgang hainer , head of the powerful vdc , who represents the interests of philip morris , british american tobacco , reemtsma and four other tobacco companies in germany recently told german weekly die zeit , " we collect information , channel the opinions of our members and then present the facts to the politicians . " the vdc is also said to organize regular parties at its headquarters in berlin which usually pulls in younger employees from the german ministries and the offices of parliamentarians . no such thing as a free lunch in lobbyists ' eyes germany is an important battleground for the pro-smoking lobby .
it is europe 's biggest tobacco market with about 22 million smokers , which is 27 percent of the population , according to the federal statistics office .
and with more and more eu countries cracking down on smokers , the hearts , minds and lungs of german smokers have become more valuable to the tobacco companies .
for the pro-smoking lobby to retain its advantage , alliances have to be formed with those in power .
" in germany , the tobacco lobby has a strong influence on the politicians , " pro rauchfrei 's ermer says .
" that begins with regular gifts directly to the desks of the delegates , and goes as far as direct payments for local government events and party meetings . "
" beyond that the delegates are invited regularly to meetings of the tobacco industry , the agendas of which are disguised by social topics .
until 2006 , the total of direct payments paid to the federal government by the tobacco industry amounts to 11.2 million euros . "
inaction and stalling can not stop ban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hopes of the anti- lobby regularly get trodden on ermer states that there is a network of pro-smoking sympathizers within the political arena in germany and that smokers within the government have an obvious agenda .
" whole parliamentary committees , such as the tourism committee , have been infiltrated by the tobacco lobby , " he added " in addition , the health minister ulla schmidt avoids making clear decisions .
unlike in other european countries , the german health minister doesn ’ t take the leadership in the ban discussion and leaves the demagogues to take the lead . "
despite the power wielded by the pro-lobby , ermer believes that the move towards a smoke-free europe is an irreversible one .
" while the influence in germany is large , the german pro-smoker lobby has only a small influence on europe , " ermer concludes .
" on a european scale , germany is isolated , as the judgment of the european court of justice pointed out with the tobacco advertising ban in 2005 .
only germany complained and lost , " he said .
" the european way into a smokeless future can not be stopped , it can only be slowed down by germany . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no butts about it , eu breaks non-smoking vow apparently , kicking the nicotine habit was too much for the eurocrats .

she 's now under police protection after members received death threats . earlier this month , iran-born human rights activist mina ahadi founded the central council of ex-muslims , in the western-german city of cologne .
ahadi told the german news magazine focus : " i happened to be born in a muslim family , and i have decided not to be a muslim . "
that was the motivation for forming the group , whose members consists of some three dozen people who have turned their back on the religion .
ahadi 's decision to form the group is a controversial one considering that in most strictly islamic countries such as iran , saudi arabia , afghanistan , pakistan , sudan und mauritania , a muslim who rejects his or her religion faces the death sentence in accordance with the sharia law . other countries may not try apostates in a court of law , but they may be ostracized instead .
the topic is also sensitive in europe . an official renunciation of islam is almost unheard of .
death threats on the internet the name of ahadi 's group is also a play on the central council of muslims -lrb- zmd -rrb- , one of germany 's best-known umbrella muslim groups , also based in cologne .
the zmd is said to have around 800,00 members according to its own estimates .
ahadi , an exiled iranian living in germany , decided it was time to shine a light on the subject of born-muslims living in europe who do not want to be part of islam .
the aim of her organization , ahadi said , is to offer former muslims a voice in a country that is not represented by official muslim organizations , she told focus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green mp deligöz wanted to get rid of headscarves - and wound up with police protection but since the group 's formation , she told the magazine , she has been " terrorized . "
members of the group have gotten death threats via the internet .
about a week ago , the police approached ahadi and offered her protection .
the affair has echoes of another recent case in germany where green party politician ekin deligöz , who in october called for muslim women and girls to stop wearing head scarves , was also placed under police protection after receiving threats . at the same time ahadi is well aware of the taboos she is breaking with the founding of her group .
she said she could imagine " that there would be calls for a fatwa against us .
our project may also be discussed in the arab world . " in the coming week , members of the central council of ex-muslims have said they plan to hold a press conference to introduce the group to the public at large .
their slogan : " we have renounced . " defense for the secular ahadi told focus she is hoping the group can offer oppressed women a way to freedom , and defend secular people who live in germany and are integrated in the society here . " we want to improve society , to make it possible for us to get along better .
i hope for more peace , " the magazine quoted her as saying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european mp özdemir : looking for diverse images of islam in germany cem özdemir , a green politician fom germany with turkish roots at the european parliament told der spiegel magazine that ahadi 's project and the greens had something in common : both are hoping to expand the variety of images of islam in germany . " we have to understand , and deal with , the fact that 3.5 million muslims in germany are extremely heterogeneous .
some of them don ’ t have anything to do with religion , and do n't identify themselves as muslim , even if they were born to muslim families . still , özdemir told the magazine he did n't think the new group would attract many adherents . " openly admitting atheism is rather unusual among muslims , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " ' it is okay to be both turkish and german " ekin deligöz made waves when she called for turkish women to take off their headscarves .

she 's now under police protection after members received death threats . earlier this month , iran-born human rights activist mina ahadi founded the central council of ex-muslims , in the western-german city of cologne .
ahadi told the german news magazine focus : " i happened to be born in a muslim family , and i have decided not to be a muslim . "
that was the motivation for forming the group , whose members consists of some three dozen people who have turned their back on the religion .
ahadi 's decision to form the group is a controversial one considering that in most strictly islamic countries such as iran , saudi arabia , afghanistan , pakistan , sudan und mauritania , a muslim who rejects his or her religion faces the death sentence in accordance with the sharia law . other countries may not try apostates in a court of law , but they may be ostracized instead .
the topic is also sensitive in europe . an official renunciation of islam is almost unheard of .
death threats on the internet the name of ahadi 's group is also a play on the central council of muslims -lrb- zmd -rrb- , one of germany 's best-known umbrella muslim groups , also based in cologne .
the zmd is said to have around 800,00 members according to its own estimates .
ahadi , an exiled iranian living in germany , decided it was time to shine a light on the subject of born-muslims living in europe who do not want to be part of islam .
the aim of her organization , ahadi said , is to offer former muslims a voice in a country that is not represented by official muslim organizations , she told focus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green mp deligöz wanted to get rid of headscarves - and wound up with police protection but since the group 's formation , she told the magazine , she has been " terrorized . "
members of the group have gotten death threats via the internet .
about a week ago , the police approached ahadi and offered her protection .
the affair has echoes of another recent case in germany where green party politician ekin deligöz , who in october called for muslim women and girls to stop wearing head scarves , was also placed under police protection after receiving threats . at the same time ahadi is well aware of the taboos she is breaking with the founding of her group .
she said she could imagine " that there would be calls for a fatwa against us .
our project may also be discussed in the arab world . " in the coming week , members of the central council of ex-muslims have said they plan to hold a press conference to introduce the group to the public at large .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 22.02.2007 the power behind the german smoking ban stalemate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's smoke-filled bars and cafes are almost a rarity in western europe as a crucial meeting on protecting non-smokers opens in germany friday , a look at the country 's powerful tobacco lobby offers some clues as to why germany has successfully resisted an outright smoking ban so far . the struggle in germany to agree on a smoking ban continues this week when government ministers convene in hanover on friday to discuss the issue of protection for non-smokers before a state premiers ' debate on march 22 .
the meeting , to be chaired by federal minister for health , ulla schmidt and consumer affairs minister , horst seehofer will be used to further discuss whether smoking in schools , public buildings and most restaurants should be banned by germany 's 16 federal states .
the decision to hand the responsibility for approving the ban to the individual states came after germany 's ruling coalition rescinded the original ban proposal on constitutional grounds in december last year .
the government said an outright federal ban could infringe on individual states ' rights , many of which can not be overridden by berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the states are responsible for issuing bans in public places it is the 16 states , not the federal government , which have power over local government facilities such as schools and hospitals , as well as places such as bars and restaurants - those places where the smoking ban was proposed .
pro-smoking lobbyists pulling the strings ?
the decision was also seen as another example of the german government 's unwillingness to confront the country 's powerful pro-smoking lobby which opposition politicians and anti-smoking campaigners believe holds too much influence over the ruling coalition of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
germany has been slow to follow the lead of those eu states which have already agreed and have implemented their own smoking bans .
france , italy and england have already passed laws that ban smoking in bars and restaurants , as well as public buildings , putting germany out of step with many of its european counterparts .
pressure from the anti-smoking lobby is suspected as being the reason why germany continues to lag behind .
but does the pro- lobby really have that amount of power , that the german government would defy european union directives to satisfy its wishes ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lobbyists are accused of pressuring the government " the pro-smoker lobby is stronger in germany than in any other european country , " siggi ermer , the chairman of pro rauchfrei , the german lobby for non-smokers said . " even the tobacco companies are proud of that fact .
its influence is so strong that pro rauchfrei talks about a tobacco dictatorship in a democratic state .
-lrb- the pro- lobby -rrb- has affected the legislation for decades and crucially has steered the politicians .
" it is so powerful that in the current discussions , the cdu / csu parliamentary group brought in a regulation paper from the german tobacco industry association -lrb- vdc -rrb- and presented it word for word as their own proposal for the negotiations . "
the german tobacco industry association -lrb- vdc -rrb- was unavailable for comment on its involvement in any parliamentary decisions or the extent of its influence over the government .
wolfgang hainer , head of the powerful vdc , who represents the interests of philip morris , british american tobacco , reemtsma and four other tobacco companies in germany recently told german weekly die zeit , " we collect information , channel the opinions of our members and then present the facts to the politicians . " the vdc is also said to organize regular parties at its headquarters in berlin which usually pulls in younger employees from the german ministries and the offices of parliamentarians . no such thing as a free lunch in lobbyists ' eyes germany is an important battleground for the pro-smoking lobby .
it is europe 's biggest tobacco market with about 22 million smokers , which is 27 percent of the population , according to the federal statistics office .
and with more and more eu countries cracking down on smokers , the hearts , minds and lungs of german smokers have become more valuable to the tobacco companies .
for the pro-smoking lobby to retain its advantage , alliances have to be formed with those in power .
" in germany , the tobacco lobby has a strong influence on the politicians , " pro rauchfrei 's ermer says .
" that begins with regular gifts directly to the desks of the delegates , and goes as far as direct payments for local government events and party meetings . "
" beyond that the delegates are invited regularly to meetings of the tobacco industry , the agendas of which are disguised by social topics .
until 2006 , the total of direct payments paid to the federal government by the tobacco industry amounts to 11.2 million euros . "
inaction and stalling can not stop ban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hopes of the anti- lobby regularly get trodden on ermer states that there is a network of pro-smoking sympathizers within the political arena in germany and that smokers within the government have an obvious agenda .
" whole parliamentary committees , such as the tourism committee , have been infiltrated by the tobacco lobby , " he added " in addition , the health minister ulla schmidt avoids making clear decisions .
unlike in other european countries , the german health minister doesn ’ t take the leadership in the ban discussion and leaves the demagogues to take the lead . "
despite the power wielded by the pro-lobby , ermer believes that the move towards a smoke-free europe is an irreversible one .
" while the influence in germany is large , the german pro-smoker lobby has only a small influence on europe , " ermer concludes .
" on a european scale , germany is isolated , as the judgment of the european court of justice pointed out with the tobacco advertising ban in 2005 .
only germany complained and lost , " he said .
" the european way into a smokeless future can not be stopped , it can only be slowed down by germany .

napolitano 's flurry of meetings thursday were to continue friday , consulting with the speakers of the two houses of parliament , the heads of parliamentary groups and the presidents who preceded him . prodi , head of italy 's 61st government since world war ii , was also prime minister for two years and five months in 1996-98 , falling when communists withdrew their support . possible reinstatement napolitano is widely expected to rename prodi as prime minister .
but he also has the option of choosing a new government leader from the center-left coalition , appointing a technocrat government or dissolving parliament and calling new elections . while fresh elections are considered unlikely , the economic daily il sole 24 ore warned thursday against prodi 's simple reinstatement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's president giorgio napolitano is scrambling for a new government " experience shows that -lrb- such -rrb- governments are always mediocre , especially when the differences that brought about the crisis are not resolved , " it said in an editorial . and franco pavoncello of rome 's john cabot university said it was " highly improbable " that napolitano would call an election after the current round of consultations . foreign policy trip-up " i do n't think it will happen , " he told german news agency dpa .
" italy needs to change its electoral system first and ensure that the new law produces more stable governments in the future , " pavoncello said . gianfranco pasquino of john hopkins university told sky italia television he expected the president would ask prodi to stay on , but only after ensuring " he has a workable majority " in the senate . prodi stepped down on wednesday , just nine months after he assumed office , after losing a key vote in parliament 's upper house over his government 's foreign policy . a government-sponsored motion received just 158 votes in favor , two short of the required majority of 160 .
a total of 136 lawmakers voted against and 24 , including two far-left dissidents , abstained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's foreign policy proved prodi 's undoing the two communist senators in prodi 's coalition , who are staunchly opposed to the planned enlargement of a us military base in northern italy , tipped the balance with their crucial " no " votes . giovanni sartori , one of italy 's leading constitutional experts , said the president could decide to form an " institutional " or " technocrat " government backed by an enlarged majority . " the last thing to do would be to go to the polls , " sartori told sky italia . berlusconi law prodi assumed office in may of last year after defeating silvio berlusconi in april 's general election , the closest in modern italian history . a convoluted electoral law approved by berlusconi in the final weeks of the past legislature ensured that a future government would be guaranteed a comfortable majority in the chamber of deputies , but not in the senate . prodi had been commanding a wafer-thin majority in the upper house and lost wednesday 's vote because two far-left dissident lawmakers refused to back it in disagreement at italy 's peacekeeping mission in afghanistan . napolitano began his round of consultations by meeting the presidents of the two branches of parliament , fausto bertinotti and franco marini , ahead of talks with former italian presidents and party leaders friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did prodi 's departure open the door for berlusconi , again ?
berlusconi , who leads prodi in latest opinion polls , wednesday called for fresh elections . searching for alternatives but many of his center-right allies were thursday conceding that napolitano would explore alternative solutions to the crisis first . " we would like elections , but our alternative is to find a transitional solution to solve the big problems facing the country , " said renato schifani , a whip in berlusconi 's forza italia party . the catholic udc , a small but influential opposition party that has been distancing itself from berlusconi since last year 's election defeat , has said it may decide to join a new government , but only if there is " discontinuity " with the previous administration . all of the nine center-left ruling parties have indicated that they want prodi to stay on as premier . napolitano was expected to make a decision on prodi 's future on friday evening or saturday at the latest . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italian president looks for post-prodi direction italy 's president was to consult with party and government leaders on the future of the government thursday , following the resignation of prime minister romano prodi wednesday .

next time i go , i 'll get more money changed at the airport before ever stepping on the plane .
thank goodness i had the sense to change $ 200 dollars for euros in denver .

all of the ladies decided to go out into the backyard and i went out front to begin to bring in the luggage .
the doors closed behind us and we did n't realize that they locked automatically .
five minutes after getting to the house , we were locked out .
we then spent the next one half hour trying to explain to the older gentleman from whom we had gotten the first set of keys that the americans had quickly locked themselves out of their own home and needed another key to get in .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de intercultural dialogue -pipe- 22.02.2007 founder of ex-muslims group gets police protection großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mina ahadi say she hopes for more peace with her project an iranian human rights activist living in exile in germany has founded a group called the central council of ex-muslims .
she 's now under police protection after members received death threats . earlier this month , iran-born human rights activist mina ahadi founded the central council of ex-muslims , in the western-german city of cologne .
ahadi told the german news magazine focus : " i happened to be born in a muslim family , and i have decided not to be a muslim . "
that was the motivation for forming the group , whose members consists of some three dozen people who have turned their back on the religion .
ahadi 's decision to form the group is a controversial one considering that in most strictly islamic countries such as iran , saudi arabia , afghanistan , pakistan , sudan und mauritania , a muslim who rejects his or her religion faces the death sentence in accordance with the sharia law . other countries may not try apostates in a court of law , but they may be ostracized instead .
the topic is also sensitive in europe . an official renunciation of islam is almost unheard of .
death threats on the internet the name of ahadi 's group is also a play on the central council of muslims -lrb- zmd -rrb- , one of germany 's best-known umbrella muslim groups , also based in cologne .
the zmd is said to have around 800,00 members according to its own estimates .
ahadi , an exiled iranian living in germany , decided it was time to shine a light on the subject of born-muslims living in europe who do not want to be part of islam .
the aim of her organization , ahadi said , is to offer former muslims a voice in a country that is not represented by official muslim organizations , she told focus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green mp deligöz wanted to get rid of headscarves - and wound up with police protection but since the group 's formation , she told the magazine , she has been " terrorized . "
members of the group have gotten death threats via the internet .
about a week ago , the police approached ahadi and offered her protection .
the affair has echoes of another recent case in germany where green party politician ekin deligöz , who in october called for muslim women and girls to stop wearing head scarves , was also placed under police protection after receiving threats . at the same time ahadi is well aware of the taboos she is breaking with the founding of her group .
she said she could imagine " that there would be calls for a fatwa against us .
our project may also be discussed in the arab world . " in the coming week , members of the central council of ex-muslims have said they plan to hold a press conference to introduce the group to the public at large .
their slogan : " we have renounced . " defense for the secular ahadi told focus she is hoping the group can offer oppressed women a way to freedom , and defend secular people who live in germany and are integrated in the society here . " we want to improve society , to make it possible for us to get along better .
i hope for more peace , " the magazine quoted her as saying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european mp özdemir : looking for diverse images of islam in germany cem özdemir , a green politician fom germany with turkish roots at the european parliament told der spiegel magazine that ahadi 's project and the greens had something in common : both are hoping to expand the variety of images of islam in germany . " we have to understand , and deal with , the fact that 3.5 million muslims in germany are extremely heterogeneous .
some of them don ’ t have anything to do with religion , and do n't identify themselves as muslim , even if they were born to muslim families . still , özdemir told the magazine he did n't think the new group would attract many adherents . " openly admitting atheism is rather unusual among muslims , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " ' it is okay to be both turkish and german " ekin deligöz made waves when she called for turkish women to take off their headscarves .

he could reject prodi 's resignation and ask him to seek a vote of confidence in parliament , or give him a mandate to form a new government . alternatively , he could give the mandate to a different center-left leader or an institutional figure .
a final option , seen as less likely at present , would be to call fresh elections that would take place in the spring . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi 's government lost a key vote over foreign policy in a drama reminiscent of italian politics of the 1980s and 1990s when governments sometimes lasted less than a week , prodi stepped down on wednesday , just nine months after assuming office , after he lost a key vote in parliament 's upper house over his government 's foreign policy .
the center-left government was forced onto the defensive over the deployment of 2,000 troops in afghanistan and the enlargement of a us military base in northern italy . both are policies most opposed by far-left parties within prodi 's coalition . opposition called for prodi 's resignation but it is the conservative opposition , led by silvio berlusconi , who was narrowly forced out of the prime minister 's office by prodi in an election last april , who led calls for prodi to go . right wing senators shouted " resign ! resign ! " after the result of the vote in the italian senate was announced .
prodi should " tender his resignation immediately , " declared berlusconi . the government needed 160 votes in the senate debate to get a formal motion of support .
but only 158 senators voted in favor and 136 opposed the government .

napolitano , who rushed back to rome from a visit to the provinces , said in a statement that he " reserves his decision " on the future of the government . under pressure over afghanistan d 'alema had to defend italy 's military mission in afghanistan to senators before the vote .
italy currently has around 2,000 troops deployed in the country as part of a nato-led peacekeeping mission . " it 's not a nato mission , but a united nations mission in which nato has an important military function , " d 'alema told the parliament . " it is a political and civil mission . "
the afghanistan deployment and the enlargement of the us base at vicenza in northern italy are both strongly opposed by the greens and communists who are part of a ruling coalition which also includes liberal and roman catholic parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters at a demonstration against the expansion of a us military base in vicenza more than 80,000 people took part in a rally last saturday in vicenza against the base enlargement . d 'alema said that to go back on the approval for the base that the prime minister gave last month for the base enlargement would be a " hostile act " toward the united states . no stranger to controversy prodi 's union coalition narrowly won an election in april last year that ended berlusconi 's five year-old government - one of the longest in recent italian political history . prodi is no stranger to the dangers of running italian governments . he resigned as prime minister in 1997 and 1998 when leading governments .

napolitano , who rushed back to rome from a visit to the provinces , said in a statement that he " reserves his decision " on the future of the government . under pressure over afghanistan d 'alema had to defend italy 's military mission in afghanistan to senators before the vote .
italy currently has around 2,000 troops deployed in the country as part of a nato-led peacekeeping mission . " it 's not a nato mission , but a united nations mission in which nato has an important military function , " d 'alema told the parliament . " it is a political and civil mission . "
the afghanistan deployment and the enlargement of the us base at vicenza in northern italy are both strongly opposed by the greens and communists who are part of a ruling coalition which also includes liberal and roman catholic parties . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters at a demonstration against the expansion of a us military base in vicenza more than 80,000 people took part in a rally last saturday in vicenza against the base enlargement . d 'alema said that to go back on the approval for the base that the prime minister gave last month for the base enlargement would be a " hostile act " toward the united states . no stranger to controversy prodi 's union coalition narrowly won an election in april last year that ended berlusconi 's five year-old government - one of the longest in recent italian political history . prodi is no stranger to the dangers of running italian governments . he resigned as prime minister in 1997 and 1998 when leading governments .

' shocked and stunned ' for the february issue of youth and lifestyle glossy u _ mag , writer volker sievert sat down to chat with up-and-coming starlet hannah herzsprung .
but after providing the actress with the agreed-upon transcript of the interview , he said he was " shocked and stunned " when her final version came back . so much of the text had been excised that it looked more like it had been attacked by wartime censors than simply vetted for errors or slips of the tongue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the editors of u _ mag decided to show readers how modern media works " i really felt like i had been censored , " sievert wrote in an e-mail .
" i could n't understand this massive interference in the least . " as a result of herzsprung 's changes , sievert wrote , the interview was " almost grotesquely disfigured . "
the end result is " something that resembles a self-promotional text more than a lively , vital interview , " he added . cozy relationship u _ mag 's response ?
print the interview in full - heavily blacked-out sections included . " we felt used , " sievert said .
" we decided to print the interview with the crossed out sections , to give our readers a look into the modern media landscape . " the event caused a stir in the german media and awoke a sleeping discussion on what some say is an overly-cozy relationship between the german press and public figures . " journalists are not legally required to have interview partners authorize their statements . … but unfortunately in germany , that has almost become common practice , " said hendrik zörner , spokesman for the german journalists ' association -lrb- djv -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der spiegel is known for letting subjects alter interviews , one commentator said big-name papers tend to " follow clearer journalistic practices , " while the smaller , local outlets that make up the majority of papers in the country , " might have to deal with certain interview partners more frequently , " and so are more likely to allow sources to sign off on interviews , zörner said . " this leads to the practice that looks a little like mutual back-scratching , " he added . good for everyone ? but ingrid kolb , director of the henri nannen school for journalism in hamburg , said some of the country 's biggest media outlets - for instance , renowned news magazines der spiegel and stern - are noted for the practice . " the long interviews that der spiegel publishes with famous public figures , their so-called talks , are known for this , " kolb said .
" they can go back and forth a dozen times , with each side bringing their argument a bit more to the point , refining it , improving it .
in a best-case scenario , it serves the interests of both sides . " if anything , the controversy certainly makes plain the mutual give-and-take relationship between public figures and the media : the one side in need of a platform to promote themselves and their ideas , the other constantly looking for interesting material to fill an ever expanding news hole . still , in the us , britain or australia , the idea of a journalist giving an interview subject a whack at editing his or her own comments after the fact would be grounds for derision , if not dismissal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the us , anything said " on the record " goes in the paper " i 'm aware that there is a big difference on this subject between the anglo-saxon world and the german world , " kolb said .
" but in germany it has become a custom to get a longer interview or quotes authorized . … in general the interview partner tells the journalist that he expects it . " ' scorched earth ' action according to kolb , printing an interview with the blacked out parts shown , like u _ mag did , is " essentially a scorched-earth kind of act .
this person will never have something to do with the publication again . " according to the journalists ' association 's zörner , the practice represents " a real weakness in german journalism ; journalists are much too ready to allow interview authorization . " " interviews are meant to serve an informative and explanatory function .
but if interviews are changed after the fact , they are no longer interviews .
they are pr texts , " he said . prior occurrence the hannah herzsprung case is n't the first time the issue of journalistic integrity has made headlines here .
the last time was in 2003 , when the press went on the attack against the government 's supposed " control mania . " back then , a group of the country 's heavyweight newspapers , including the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , die welt , süddeutsche zeitung and the financial times deutschland , all printed commentaries and articles deploring the practice of interview approval . most memorable was the move by leftist newspaper tageszeitung .
in an apparent bid to point up the notion that newsmakers need the press just as much as the press needs them , the paper printed a censored interview with the then secretary general of the social democrats - with all his responses blacked out in protest . ' no danger to democracy ' germany 's fourth estate has other , worse weaknesses , djv 's zörner notes .
a recent report by reporters without borders ranked the country a low 23nd in terms of press freedoms , based mostly on controversial government searches of newspaper offices . but " despite all the problems and dangers , " zörner said , overall , german journalism is " qualitatively very good . " " you ca n't say that -lrb- the practice of allowing interview revisions -rrb- poses a danger to democracy , " he said .
and after all , he pointed out , interviews are not the only tool reporters have . " there are reports , opinion pieces - there are many other forms of journalism available .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 22.02.2007 " there is no cohesion of tv writing staff in germany " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the boys from " alarm für cobra 11 " give good lead german tv networks are taking their cues state-side in a bid to create better drama series .
dw-world.de caught up with la-based screenwriter matt witten to find out how projects like the " writer 's room " can help . the recent berlin film festival proved that german cinema is in fine fettle . but television is looking a lot less robust .
a record number of new shows are tanking spectacularly - take private station pro 7 's latest disaster , the much-hyped " crazy about clara . "
given that viewers loved " ally mcbeal " and " sex and the city , " they should have devoured a home-grown series about a 20-something city girl juggling work and relationships .
but no one was crazy about clara at all , and this enormously expensive series was shunted off into a late-night slot after just two episodes . but while viewers ca n't switch off german shows fast enough , they 're more addicted than ever to us imports , with most prime-time slots filled with the likes of " desperate housewives , " " medical investigation " and " er . "
the networks are realizing it 's time for a re-think - and are sending for the marines . organized by media consultancy mediaxchange , the third " writer 's room " recently took place in germany .
its goal is to bring together experienced us writers to work with their local counterparts in developing ideas for drama series to be sold to local channels and the international market .
guest of honor at january 's session was writer and producer matt witten - whose credits include " house m.d. , " " csi : miami " and " law & order . " dw-world.de asked him how it went . matt witten : it went well !
the german writers were talented and interesting and it was very productive .
we came up with some terrific ideas for shows and also i think it gave the german writers a good idea of how us tv shows run . did you see any german tv shows ? i saw " alarm für cobra 11 " and " lasko " -lrb- two series made by german production company " action concept , " which co-organized the event -rrb- .
one thing i noticed was that the action sequences were fabulous , probably better than anything i 've ever seen on american television .
you might see that kind of action in the movies but never on television .
the first episode i saw of " cobra 11 " had a 400 car pile-up !
" action concept " manages to do these incredible things on relatively small budgets , significantly less than those of american shows . so is us tv as good as it is often simply because of economies of scale ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " csi : miami " shows the way because we have more money to put into it ?
yes .
but we 've also been making tv in the us since 1950 .
we have a longer history - we 've been developing our tv for 50 years , so there might be some catch-up to do for german television .
but are americans inherently better writers than germans ?
no , of course not ! when you talked to the german participants in the writer 's room , did you get the impression that they need help to create good tv ? american shows tend to be pretty fast-paced and vigorously structured , and the way we structure the action and the conflict for our main characters has been thought through in ways that are fresh for german writers , they have n't necessarily heard it described in these terms .
so it gives them a new way of looking at the writing they 're doing .
they were also intrigued by the fact that in america we have staff writers who meet every day , and we have a head writer responsible for the consistency of the show - " the show-runner . "
these concepts are new in germany , where there is no cohesion of writing staff .
instead , episodes are written by freelancers who turn in maybe just two a year .
another thing in american tv is that directors do n't have the power to change the script without talking to the writer .
it makes sense that the writers are in charge because after all , they will be involved with all thirteen episodes in the series whereas a director is only involved with three or four . does that mean that german shows never quite rival american ones because of structures - because germany doesn ’ t have the same efficient systems in place that the us has ?
should germany focus more on this aspect of tv production ? i would agree with that .
when you have a good infrastructure the writers will also get better because of it - by being with the production for all 13 or 24 episodes , being around the other writers on set , working with the actors and the directors , getting involved with the editing .
better writing is an inevitable by-product .
" action concept " ceo hermann joha for one is very keen to run all his shows more according to this model .
he specifically wants to establish this kind of infrastructure and to introduce this way of working in germany . what germany has right now is a lot of shows billed as the german " sex and the city , " the german " law & order " etc .
but somehow they don ’ t really work .
what ’ s missing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans loved " sex and the city " for myself as a writer i feel that if you 're passionate about your show it has a good chance of becoming a success .
but you also need the infrastructure to carry that passion forward and make it workable for a 13 or 24 episode season , and i guess there 's a possibility that some of these aspects are lacking in germany . tv is essentially escapist , and germany still has a fascination with the us .
might german tv writers be fighting a losing battle , because their audiences are actually quite happy not to have home-grown shows ? my guess is that germans would respond really well to a terrific home-grown show .
it 's only logical .
i used to live in saratoga springs in upstate new york and i would always be intrigued by any novel set there .
i 'm jewish , so i always enjoy jewish novels .
if a story is somehow close to me i 'll be interested … .
i have two children and i 'm always interested in a story about a dad with kids .
so i can only imagine that if i were german i would want to watch shows in german , i would think : " hey , we germans can put out good shows too . "
i 'd feel proud . a lot of good series in the us are made by cable network hbo , so they don ’ t need mass appeal .
in germany , tv series need to work across the board .
is it easier for writers to maintain high standards when they know they only need to reach a certain audience ? yes , but it depends on your idea .
there are good network shows that do have mass appeal , and that does n't have to be a bad thing .
a lot of the shows i love are on hbo and it 's great to have these outlets .
shows like " the sopranos " and " nip / tuck " really push the envelope and that probably has the effect of making the broadcast networks better generally because it raises the bar .
germany could probably benefit from an equivalent .
it would be great if german tv writers did n't feel they had to get 50 million viewers . is there a risk that projects like the " writer ’ s room " might result in very homogenous shows ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the unlucky clara the structures and strategies we 're introducing to german writers and executives have nothing to do with content .
they will just lead to better shows .
if the german writers have exciting ideas that are uniquely german , then projects like the " writer 's room " will just help them realize these ideas more fully .

the meeting , to be chaired by federal minister for health , ulla schmidt and consumer affairs minister , horst seehofer will be used to further discuss whether smoking in schools , public buildings and most restaurants should be banned by germany 's 16 federal states .
the decision to hand the responsibility for approving the ban to the individual states came after germany 's ruling coalition rescinded the original ban proposal on constitutional grounds in december last year .
the government said an outright federal ban could infringe on individual states ' rights , many of which can not be overridden by berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the states are responsible for issuing bans in public places it is the 16 states , not the federal government , which have power over local government facilities such as schools and hospitals , as well as places such as bars and restaurants - those places where the smoking ban was proposed .
pro-smoking lobbyists pulling the strings ?
the decision was also seen as another example of the german government 's unwillingness to confront the country 's powerful pro-smoking lobby which opposition politicians and anti-smoking campaigners believe holds too much influence over the ruling coalition of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
germany has been slow to follow the lead of those eu states which have already agreed and have implemented their own smoking bans .
france , italy and england have already passed laws that ban smoking in bars and restaurants , as well as public buildings , putting germany out of step with many of its european counterparts .
pressure from the anti-smoking lobby is suspected as being the reason why germany continues to lag behind .
but does the pro- lobby really have that amount of power , that the german government would defy european union directives to satisfy its wishes ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lobbyists are accused of pressuring the government " the pro-smoker lobby is stronger in germany than in any other european country , " siggi ermer , the chairman of pro rauchfrei , the german lobby for non-smokers said . " even the tobacco companies are proud of that fact .
its influence is so strong that pro rauchfrei talks about a tobacco dictatorship in a democratic state .
-lrb- the pro- lobby -rrb- has affected the legislation for decades and crucially has steered the politicians .
" it is so powerful that in the current discussions , the cdu / csu parliamentary group brought in a regulation paper from the german tobacco industry association -lrb- vdc -rrb- and presented it word for word as their own proposal for the negotiations . "
the german tobacco industry association -lrb- vdc -rrb- was unavailable for comment on its involvement in any parliamentary decisions or the extent of its influence over the government .
wolfgang hainer , head of the powerful vdc , who represents the interests of philip morris , british american tobacco , reemtsma and four other tobacco companies in germany recently told german weekly die zeit , " we collect information , channel the opinions of our members and then present the facts to the politicians . " the vdc is also said to organize regular parties at its headquarters in berlin which usually pulls in younger employees from the german ministries and the offices of parliamentarians . no such thing as a free lunch in lobbyists ' eyes germany is an important battleground for the pro-smoking lobby .
it is europe 's biggest tobacco market with about 22 million smokers , which is 27 percent of the population , according to the federal statistics office .
and with more and more eu countries cracking down on smokers , the hearts , minds and lungs of german smokers have become more valuable to the tobacco companies .
for the pro-smoking lobby to retain its advantage , alliances have to be formed with those in power .
" in germany , the tobacco lobby has a strong influence on the politicians , " pro rauchfrei 's ermer says .
" that begins with regular gifts directly to the desks of the delegates , and goes as far as direct payments for local government events and party meetings . "
" beyond that the delegates are invited regularly to meetings of the tobacco industry , the agendas of which are disguised by social topics .
until 2006 , the total of direct payments paid to the federal government by the tobacco industry amounts to 11.2 million euros . "
inaction and stalling can not stop ban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hopes of the anti- lobby regularly get trodden on ermer states that there is a network of pro-smoking sympathizers within the political arena in germany and that smokers within the government have an obvious agenda .
" whole parliamentary committees , such as the tourism committee , have been infiltrated by the tobacco lobby , " he added " in addition , the health minister ulla schmidt avoids making clear decisions .
unlike in other european countries , the german health minister doesn ’ t take the leadership in the ban discussion and leaves the demagogues to take the lead . "
despite the power wielded by the pro-lobby , ermer believes that the move towards a smoke-free europe is an irreversible one .
" while the influence in germany is large , the german pro-smoker lobby has only a small influence on europe , " ermer concludes .
" on a european scale , germany is isolated , as the judgment of the european court of justice pointed out with the tobacco advertising ban in 2005 .
only germany complained and lost , " he said .
" the european way into a smokeless future can not be stopped , it can only be slowed down by germany .

funding worth £ 2.8bn was intended to help the poorest parts of wales match the uk average for wealth .
the cardiff university report found west wales and the valleys are slipping behind regions such as merseyside and cornwall and the isles of scilly .
but it was also found employment and incomes were raised by objective one .
the study , conducted by the school of city and regional planning at cardiff university , showed positive signs in terms of the number of jobs created . "
this report shows the very considerable progress we have made in west wales and the valleys " economic development minister andrew davies in objective one areas , income has been raised and employment increased .
the original target when the project began in 1999 was that around 43,500 jobs would be created by objective one funding .
monitoring data from the wales european office shows that target has been more than met with a total investment of around £ 2.8bn into the economy of west wales and the valleys .
the measure of wealth or income used in the cardiff university report , known as gross value added -lrb- gva -rrb- , found that in the year 2000 , west wales and the valleys ' gva was at 66 % of the uk 's wealth average .
but four years later - the most recent statistics - the region stood at 65 % of the uk average , a drop of 1 % .
in contrast , other uk regions which have also received objective one funding over this period have seen their relative wealth rise .
cornwall and the isles of scilly 's gva figures have risen from 62 % to 65 % of the uk average over the same period , while merseyside has risen from 72 % to 73 % of the uk average - although merseyside has received objective one funding over a longer period .
the report says : " comparing gva in west wales and the valleys with other uk objective one areas does not reflect as kindly on the region .
" looking back five years before the inception of the objective one programme , up to the most recent data -lrb- 2004 -rrb- , gva in west wales and the valleys has fallen relative to the uk average whereas income in the other objective one regions appears to have rallied .
" if income performance does not pick up considerably within the next few years , then there will clearly be some serious issues still to be resolved . "
' learnt lessons ' professor kevin morgan , one of the team who wrote the report , said : " on the jobs front , wales has made encouraging progress , but on the issue of the relative wealth of the region it is a much more worrying picture .
" we are not doing as well as cornwall or merseyside .
we need to improve our performance . "
the report also shows that the average weekly wage in west wales and the valleys has risen between 2000 and 2006 by 26.5 % to £ 456.50 .
but the gap has increased between the wage in the region and the uk average from £ 64 in 2000 to £ 80 in 2006 .
welsh economic development minister andrew davies said : " this report shows the very considerable progress we have made in west wales and the valleys .
" we have achieved a big fall in unemployment and the fall in economic inactivity has been faster in west wales and the valleys .
" we have learnt a lot of lessons but this bbc report says there has been very substantial progress in bridging the gap between wales and the rest of the uk . "
' high growth ' plaid cymru am helen mary jones said : " there is some good news , but the main target was around the gva figures and we are concerned it has not been met .
" there is a lot of complacency with the assembly government . "
the report highlights techniums - specialist facilities for hi-tech , creative and knowledge-based businesses - which are promoting hi-tech jobs around wales using objective one money .
so far , around 500 jobs have been created by the techniums at a cost of £ 84,000 per job .
but simon bowen , chairman of the technium steering group in wales , says the techniums have proved to be good value for money .
he said : " techniums are crucial to the knowledge-based economy in wales - providing small businesses with high growth and supported by business and academics . "
the cardiff university report concludes that objective one has not had a major impact on levels of prosperity in west wales and the valleys , but may well have helped towards getting people back into the labour market .

funding worth £ 2.8bn was intended to help the poorest parts of wales match the uk average for wealth .
the cardiff university report found west wales and the valleys are slipping behind regions such as merseyside and cornwall and the isles of scilly .
but it was also found employment and incomes were raised by objective one .
the study , conducted by the school of city and regional planning at cardiff university , showed positive signs in terms of the number of jobs created .
this report shows the very considerable progress we have made in west wales and the valleys economic development minister andrew davies in objective one areas , income has been raised and employment increased .
the original target when the project began in 1999 was that around 43,500 jobs would be created by objective one funding .
monitoring data from the wales european office shows that target has been more than met with a total investment of around £ 2.8bn into the economy of west wales and the valleys .
the measure of wealth or income used in the cardiff university report , known as gross value added -lrb- gva -rrb- , found that in the year 2000 , west wales and the valleys ' gva was at 66 % of the uk 's wealth average .
but four years later - the most recent statistics - the region stood at 65 % of the uk average , a drop of 1 % .
andrew davies said progress had been made in contrast , other uk regions which have also received objective one funding over this period have seen their relative wealth rise .
cornwall and the isles of scilly 's gva figures have risen from 62 % to 65 % of the uk average over the same period , while merseyside has risen from 72 % to 73 % of the uk average - although merseyside has received objective one funding over a longer period .
the report says : " comparing gva in west wales and the valleys with other uk objective one areas does not reflect as kindly on the region .
" looking back five years before the inception of the objective one programme , up to the most recent data -lrb- 2004 -rrb- , gva in west wales and the valleys has fallen relative to the uk average whereas income in the other objective one regions appears to have rallied .
" if income performance does not pick up considerably within the next few years , then there will clearly be some serious issues still to be resolved . "
' learnt lessons ' professor kevin morgan , one of the team who wrote the report , said : " on the jobs front , wales has made encouraging progress , but on the issue of the relative wealth of the region it is a much more worrying picture .
" we are not doing as well as cornwall or merseyside .
we need to improve our performance . "
the report also shows that the average weekly wage in west wales and the valleys has risen between 2000 and 2006 by 26.5 % to £ 456.50 .
but the gap has increased between the wage in the region and the uk average from £ 64 in 2000 to £ 80 in 2006 .
welsh economic development minister andrew davies said : " this report shows the very considerable progress we have made in west wales and the valleys .
" we have achieved a big fall in unemployment and the fall in economic inactivity has been faster in west wales and the valleys .
" we have learnt a lot of lessons but this bbc report says there has been very substantial progress in bridging the gap between wales and the rest of the uk . "
' high growth ' plaid cymru am helen mary jones said : " there is some good news , but the main target was around the gva figures and we are concerned it has not been met .
" there is a lot of complacency with the assembly government . "
the report highlights techniums - specialist facilities for hi-tech , creative and knowledge-based businesses - which are promoting hi-tech jobs around wales using objective one money .
so far , around 500 jobs have been created by the techniums at a cost of £ 84,000 per job .
but simon bowen , chairman of the technium steering group in wales , says the techniums have proved to be good value for money .
he said : " techniums are crucial to the knowledge-based economy in wales - providing small businesses with high growth and supported by business and academics . "
the cardiff university report concludes that objective one has not had a major impact on levels of prosperity in west wales and the valleys , but may well have helped towards getting people back into the labour market .

at a time when the ministry of defence -lrb- mod -rrb- has major plans for new aircraft carriers , submarines , planes and other major replacement programmes - and ongoing commitments in iraq and afghanistan - analysts warn that something will have to give without a major increase in funds .
charles heyman , director of r & f international defence & security consultancy , says that the ministry of defence needs at least another £ 10bn a year on top of its current £ 33.4bn for 2007/08 .
the problem is that senior civil servants in the treasury do n't have to go to war and get shot defence analyst paul beaver " the uk 's level of military spending is just not in balance with our current operational commitments , and our service men and women are being dreadfully let down , " he says .
' war on terror ' while the main uk defence budget has continued to increase in strict financial terms , from £ 29.7bn in 2004/05 to £ 33.4bn for the forthcoming financial year , the defence analysts focus on the fact that as a proportion of the uk 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , it has fallen steadily under the labour government .
back in 1998/99 , uk defence spending totalled 2.7 % of gdp , compared with 2.2 % for 2005/06 .
by contrast , the us increased its defence spending over the same time period from 3.1 % to 4 % .
experts say the comparison is valid , because the uk is america 's main partner in the so-called " war on terror " , and the current uk government has sent more troops into conflict than any other administration since world war ii .
and with the mod aiming to replace or upgrade so many different items , such as two new aircraft carriers , 120 new joint combat aircraft , and six new destroyer ships , analysts say the funds are currently just not there to pay for everything .
the navy aims to get two new aircraft carriers " the problem is that while funds have been squeezed , unit costs for defence projects are still rising at cold war trends , such is the cost of new technology , " says defence analyst professor keith hartley , director of the centre for defence economics at the university of york .
" not getting significant new funds will cause major problems for our forces , which are already underfunded . "
sustained real growth while a treasury spokeswoman would only say that any discussions about future defence spending would be considered as part of this summer 's comprehensive spending review , the mod points out that uk defence spending as a proportion of gdp is above the nato european average .
it further says that the uk spends about the same proportion as france , and more than italy and germany .
the government says the increase in defence funds from 2004 to 2008 amounts " to the longest period of sustained real terms growth in planned defence spending " .
it is also important to stress that the day-to-day funds for iraq and afghanistan - such as increased wages , munitions and fuel costs - do not come from the main defence budget .
instead , this money - which currently totals £ 4bn for iraq and £ 844m for afghanistan - comes from the treasury 's contingency fund , a separate pool of funds used for one-off expenditures , typically everything from coping with the bse crisis , to funds for the 2012 olympic games .
yet defence analyst paul beaver of beaver westminster says the concern is that the treasury will eventually seek to recover this money from future mod budgets .
" there are two areas here , " he says .
" one is the equipment programme , the other is the resource funding for the things the forces need today .
" there is no doubt that the uk armed forces do not have sufficient cash and as a result there are severe shortfalls in current capabilities .
" the problem is that senior civil servants in the treasury do n't have to go to war and get shot . "
' less nuclear spending ' kate hudson , chair of the campaign for nuclear disarmament -lrb- cnd -rrb- , said the money the uk spends on its nuclear deterrent could be much better used elsewhere in our armed forces .
" we 'd certainly prefer funds to be lowered on the uk 's nuclear weapons spending , " she says .
" the clear question is whether there will be massive spending on a trident replacement .
" the estimates for this range from £ 20bn to £ 25bn initially , up to £ 76bn over its lifetime . "

the problem is that senior civil servants in the treasury do n't have to go to war and get shot " defence analyst paul beaver " the uk 's level of military spending is just not in balance with our current operational commitments , and our service men and women are being dreadfully let down , " he says .
' war on terror ' while the main uk defence budget has continued to increase in strict financial terms , from £ 29.7bn in 2004/05 to £ 33.4bn for the forthcoming financial year , the defence analysts focus on the fact that as a proportion of the uk 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , it has fallen steadily under the labour government .
back in 1998/99 , uk defence spending totalled 2.7 % of gdp , compared with 2.2 % for 2005/06 .
by contrast , the us increased its defence spending over the same time period from 3.1 % to 4 % .
experts say the comparison is valid , because the uk is america 's main partner in the so-called " war on terror " , and the current uk government has sent more troops into conflict than any other administration since world war ii .
and with the mod aiming to replace or upgrade so many different items , such as two new aircraft carriers , 120 new joint combat aircraft , and six new destroyer ships , analysts say the funds are currently just not there to pay for everything .
" the problem is that while funds have been squeezed , unit costs for defence projects are still rising at cold war trends , such is the cost of new technology , " says defence analyst professor keith hartley , director of the centre for defence economics at the university of york .
" not getting significant new funds will cause major problems for our forces , which are already underfunded . "
sustained real growth while a treasury spokeswoman would only say that any discussions about future defence spending would be considered as part of this summer 's comprehensive spending review , the mod points out that uk defence spending as a proportion of gdp is above the nato european average .
it further says that the uk spends about the same proportion as france , and more than italy and germany .
the government says the increase in defence funds from 2004 to 2008 amounts " to the longest period of sustained real terms growth in planned defence spending " .
it is also important to stress that the day-to-day funds for iraq and afghanistan - such as increased wages , munitions and fuel costs - do not come from the main defence budget .
instead , this money - which currently totals £ 4bn for iraq and £ 844m for afghanistan - comes from the treasury 's contingency fund , a separate pool of funds used for one-off expenditures , typically everything from coping with the bse crisis , to funds for the 2012 olympic games .
yet defence analyst paul beaver of beaver westminster says the concern is that the treasury will eventually seek to recover this money from future mod budgets .
" there are two areas here , " he says .
" one is the equipment programme , the other is the resource funding for the things the forces need today .
" there is no doubt that the uk armed forces do not have sufficient cash and as a result there are severe shortfalls in current capabilities .
" the problem is that senior civil servants in the treasury do n't have to go to war and get shot . "
' less nuclear spending ' kate hudson , chair of the campaign for nuclear disarmament -lrb- cnd -rrb- , said the money the uk spends on its nuclear deterrent could be much better used elsewhere in our armed forces .
" we 'd certainly prefer funds to be lowered on the uk 's nuclear weapons spending , " she says .
" the clear question is whether there will be massive spending on a trident replacement .
" the estimates for this range from £ 20bn to £ 25bn initially , up to £ 76bn over its lifetime . "

fisheries minister jim anderton said the squid , weighing an estimated 450kg -lrb- 990lb -rrb- , took two hours to land in antarctic waters .
local news said the mesonychoteuthis hamiltoni was about 10m -lrb- 33ft -rrb- long , and was the first adult colossal squid landed intact .
one expert said calamari rings made from it would be like tractor tyres .
" i can assure you that this is going to draw phenomenal interest .
it is truly amazing , " steve o 'shea from auckland 's university of technology told local media .
colossal squid , which are found deep in antarctic waters , are thought to be about the same length as giant squid -lrb- architeutis dux -rrb- but are much heavier .
the species was first identified in 1925 , but very few specimens have been found .
the first specimen recovered intact , a 150kg -lrb- 330lb -rrb- immature female , was caught on the surface in the ross sea near the antarctic coast in april 2003 .
' nearly dead ' mr anderton said the fishermen had been fishing for patagonian toothfish in deep antarctic waters when the squid - which was eating a toothfish - was caught .
size comparison " the squid was almost dead when it reached the surface , and the careful work of the crew was paramount in getting this specimen aboard in good condition , " he said .
the squid was frozen in the ship 's hull and brought back to new zealand for scientific examination .
" the colossal squid has just arrived in new zealand and it is likely that it is the first intact adult male colossal squid to ever be successfully landed , " mr anderton said .

investing in start-up firms and the use of online data were the key talking points of the future of web applications conference .
futuristic , bass-and-synth heavy music , apple macbooks , thin smartphones and dslr cameras were out in force - the chicest geeks of the web had arrived in london .
bloggers booed the conference planner when he announced that wi-fi would n't be free .
and again when the paid-for connection buckled under the stress of their use .
this year 's future of web applications conference was the second time developers had gathered in london to discuss the future of their trade - one that 's rapidly growing by all accounts .
web applications are interactive pieces of software that run inside of web browsers and save data back to the servers they run on .
this makes them available from any internet-connected computer .
major software makers like microsoft and google now make web applications , but the market has always had a strong independent culture , with start-ups going big - like the $ 1.6bn -lrb- £ 820.3m -rrb- buyout of video sharing site youtube by google - or dying out all the time .
though smaller start-ups had a harder time attracting money after the dot com bust , according to mike arrington - who runs techcrunch , a prominent blog on web applications - they are once again finding investment money .
" last year we saw $ 600m -lrb- £ 307.6m -rrb- , at least , invested in web 2.0 start-ups , " he said .
" that 's a lot of money , particularly since most of these start-ups can be created for $ 100,000 -lrb- £ 51 , 268 -rrb- or $ 200,000 -lrb- £ 102,537 -rrb- at most . "
spying on yourself attention curator we 're basically allowing every flickr user to become a curator or editor , whether they know it or not .
bradley horowitz yahoo vice president a common theme throughout many of the presentations was how web applications are putting so-called attention data to use .
attention data are bits of information about how human beings choose to interact with software , be it on the net or not .
" when you pay attention to something , or when you skip it , data is created , " matthew ogle , of social music site last.fm said .
his site collects attention data from its users on what songs they listen to , and just as importantly which ones they do n't , to make new music recommendations .
though people usually have an aversion to spyware - programs that track what they do and send it to a company - mr ogle said people are willing to use attention trackers , " myware , " to spy on themselves because combining the attention data of many users is beneficial .
usually , recommendation sites require users to enter the music they like .
attention gathering software tracks preferences transparently , meaning more data is created , thus improving the quality of recommendations for all users .
" with attention data , someone can be sitting back and listening to a bunch of cds and they 're basically passive producers , " he said .
this is critical for the success of most web applications , as community and social interactions between users are often key features .
defining ' interestingness ' flickr , a photo sharing service owned by yahoo , uses attention data to determine what pictures are more interesting to users by measuring " organic activity in the system , " said bradley horowitz , the vice president of yahoo 's advanced development division .
your attention data is yours , how you interact with digg , that 's all your own information kevin rose digg.com founder " we looked at how many times was a photo commented on , viewed , blogged about , and saved as a favourite , " he said .
" we 're basically allowing every flickr user to become a curator or editor , whether they know it or not . "
mr horowitz also said this is a good way of measuring the quality of a picture because these heuristics are accurate ; it 's very hard to con an attention-based system .
" there was no , ' come vote for my photo and i 'll vote for your photo , ' there was no spam trying to trick people into going to a photo , " he said .
" pretty much , people did what they always did in flickr , they moved around and looked at things and shared things with each other . "
' plays well with others ' as more web sites collect and use attention data , savvy users are looking for ways to move that information from one service to another .
kevin rose , the founder of digg , a site that lets users vote for or against -lrb- " digg " or " bury " -rrb- news stories of interest , said his company is tracking attention data to make users more aware of other people with similar interests .
" we want to show users as they shift their interest from one story to another because there are these whole streams of individuals who gather around stories , that do n't know they 're moving their interest together , but they are , " he said .
mr rose added that one of the things his company believes in is that it has to " play well with others . "
thus , he says , making users attention data exportable to other services is key .
" your attention data is yours , how you interact with digg , that 's all your own information , " he said .
" we will eventually provide a tool that allows you to export all that and take it with you . "

" there was no , ' come vote for my photo and i 'll vote for your photo , ' there was no spam trying to trick people into going to a photo , " he said .
" pretty much , people did what they always did in flickr , they moved around and looked at things and shared things with each other . "
' plays well with others ' as more web sites collect and use attention data , savvy users are looking for ways to move that information from one service to another .
kevin rose , the founder of digg , a site that lets users vote for or against -lrb- " digg " or " bury " -rrb- news stories of interest , said his company is tracking attention data to make users more aware of other people with similar interests .
" we want to show users as they shift their interest from one story to another because there are these whole streams of individuals who gather around stories , that do n't know they 're moving their interest together , but they are , " he said .
mr rose added that one of the things his company believes in is that it has to " play well with others . "
thus , he says , making users attention data exportable to other services is key .
" your attention data is yours , how you interact with digg , that 's all your own information , " he said .
" we will eventually provide a tool that allows you to export all that and take it with you . "

investing in start-up firms and the use of online data were the key talking points of the future of web applications conference .
futuristic , bass-and-synth heavy music , apple macbooks , thin smartphones and dslr cameras were out in force - the chicest geeks of the web had arrived in london .
bloggers booed the conference planner when he announced that wi-fi would n't be free .
and again when the paid-for connection buckled under the stress of their use .
this year 's future of web applications conference was the second time developers had gathered in london to discuss the future of their trade - one that 's rapidly growing by all accounts .
web applications are interactive pieces of software that run inside of web browsers and save data back to the servers they run on .
this makes them available from any internet-connected computer .
major software makers like microsoft and google now make web applications , but the market has always had a strong independent culture , with start-ups going big - like the $ 1.6bn -lrb- £ 820.3m -rrb- buyout of video sharing site youtube by google - or dying out all the time .
though smaller start-ups had a harder time attracting money after the dot com bust , according to mike arrington - who runs techcrunch , a prominent blog on web applications - they are once again finding investment money .
" last year we saw $ 600m -lrb- £ 307.6m -rrb- , at least , invested in web 2.0 start-ups , " he said .
" that 's a lot of money , particularly since most of these start-ups can be created for $ 100,000 -lrb- £ 51 , 268 -rrb- or $ 200,000 -lrb- £ 102,537 -rrb- at most . "
spying on yourself attention curator we 're basically allowing every flickr user to become a curator or editor , whether they know it or not .
bradley horowitz yahoo vice president a common theme throughout many of the presentations was how web applications are putting so-called attention data to use .
attention data are bits of information about how human beings choose to interact with software , be it on the net or not .
" when you pay attention to something , or when you skip it , data is created , " matthew ogle , of social music site last.fm said .
his site collects attention data from its users on what songs they listen to , and just as importantly which ones they do n't , to make new music recommendations .
though people usually have an aversion to spyware - programs that track what they do and send it to a company - mr ogle said people are willing to use attention trackers , " myware , " to spy on themselves because combining the attention data of many users is beneficial .
usually , recommendation sites require users to enter the music they like .
attention gathering software tracks preferences transparently , meaning more data is created , thus improving the quality of recommendations for all users .
" with attention data , someone can be sitting back and listening to a bunch of cds and they 're basically passive producers , " he said .
this is critical for the success of most web applications , as community and social interactions between users are often key features .
defining ' interestingness ' flickr , a photo sharing service owned by yahoo , uses attention data to determine what pictures are more interesting to users by measuring " organic activity in the system , " said bradley horowitz , the vice president of yahoo 's advanced development division .
your attention data is yours , how you interact with digg , that 's all your own information kevin rose digg.com founder " we looked at how many times was a photo commented on , viewed , blogged about , and saved as a favourite , " he said .

this year 's future of web applications conference was the second time developers had gathered in london to discuss the future of their trade - one that 's rapidly growing by all accounts .
web applications are interactive pieces of software that run inside of web browsers and save data back to the servers they run on .
this makes them available from any internet-connected computer .
major software makers like microsoft and google now make web applications , but the market has always had a strong independent culture , with start-ups going big - like the $ 1.6bn -lrb- £ 820.3m -rrb- buyout of video sharing site youtube by google - or dying out all the time .
though smaller start-ups had a harder time attracting money after the dot com bust , according to mike arrington - who runs techcrunch , a prominent blog on web applications - they are once again finding investment money .
" last year we saw $ 600m -lrb- £ 307.6m -rrb- , at least , invested in web 2.0 start-ups , " he said .
" that 's a lot of money , particularly since most of these start-ups can be created for $ 100,000 -lrb- £ 51 , 268 -rrb- or $ 200,000 -lrb- £ 102,537 -rrb- at most . "
spying on yourself attention curator we 're basically allowing every flickr user to become a curator or editor , whether they know it or not .
bradley horowitz yahoo vice president a common theme throughout many of the presentations was how web applications are putting so-called attention data to use .
attention data are bits of information about how human beings choose to interact with software , be it on the net or not .
" when you pay attention to something , or when you skip it , data is created , " matthew ogle , of social music site last.fm said .
his site collects attention data from its users on what songs they listen to , and just as importantly which ones they do n't , to make new music recommendations .
though people usually have an aversion to spyware - programs that track what they do and send it to a company - mr ogle said people are willing to use attention trackers , " myware , " to spy on themselves because combining the attention data of many users is beneficial .
usually , recommendation sites require users to enter the music they like .
attention gathering software tracks preferences transparently , meaning more data is created , thus improving the quality of recommendations for all users .
" with attention data , someone can be sitting back and listening to a bunch of cds and they 're basically passive producers , " he said .
this is critical for the success of most web applications , as community and social interactions between users are often key features .
defining ' interestingness ' flickr , a photo sharing service owned by yahoo , uses attention data to determine what pictures are more interesting to users by measuring " organic activity in the system , " said bradley horowitz , the vice president of yahoo 's advanced development division .
your attention data is yours , how you interact with digg , that 's all your own information kevin rose digg.com founder " we looked at how many times was a photo commented on , viewed , blogged about , and saved as a favourite , " he said .
" we 're basically allowing every flickr user to become a curator or editor , whether they know it or not . "
mr horowitz also said this is a good way of measuring the quality of a picture because these heuristics are accurate ; it 's very hard to con an attention-based system .
" there was no , ' come vote for my photo and i 'll vote for your photo , ' there was no spam trying to trick people into going to a photo , " he said .
" pretty much , people did what they always did in flickr , they moved around and looked at things and shared things with each other . "
' plays well with others ' as more web sites collect and use attention data , savvy users are looking for ways to move that information from one service to another .
kevin rose , the founder of digg , a site that lets users vote for or against -lrb- " digg " or " bury " -rrb- news stories of interest , said his company is tracking attention data to make users more aware of other people with similar interests .
" we want to show users as they shift their interest from one story to another because there are these whole streams of individuals who gather around stories , that do n't know they 're moving their interest together , but they are , " he said .
mr rose added that one of the things his company believes in is that it has to " play well with others . "
thus , he says , making users attention data exportable to other services is key .
" your attention data is yours , how you interact with digg , that 's all your own information , " he said .
" we will eventually provide a tool that allows you to export all that and take it with you . "

last week , it was announced that robbie williams had been admitted to a us clinic on his 33rd birthday " for a dependency on prescription drugs " .
in january , jade goody entered rehab and escaped the public backlash after being accused of racism on channel 4 show celebrity big brother .
and actress lindsay lohan sought treatment after christmas for " personal health " after concerns grew over her rapid weight loss and heavy partying .

journalist and author nick foulkes spent five weeks in a us rehab clinic to treat his aggressive mood swings and unhappiness . "
it was definitely an upsetting thing to go and do and it was not a decision i took lightly - but i 'm glad i did it " journalist nick foulkes on why he went to rehab speaking to bbc five live , he likened the venue to a farm and said he was put in a dormitory with three other men .
once there , his bag was searched and he was forced to hand over magazines , chocolates and his mobile phone .
" i was kept busy from literally dawn until way past dusk , " he said .
that involved group therapy , lectures and lots of written homework - and he said the experience was " harrowing , scary and peaceful " .

psychologist michael cohen has worked at a variety of clinics , where he specialises in treating drug and alcohol abuse .
" generally , people who have an addiction are experts in plate spinning , and eventually they ca n't keep all the plates up in the air , " he says .
he thinks people who seek treatment generally " benefit " from going into rehab - but believes some only do it for family or friends , which are the " wrong reasons " .
but what about the celebrity clientele - is everyone treated the same once they walk through the door ?
" well they should be , " cohen says .
" but i do n't think they are sometimes .
i think it varies on the clinic . "
some believe health may not be the only factor when it comes to celebrities checking into rehab , especially when negative publicity plays a part .
heat magazine news editor hannah perry remembers when supermodel kate moss underwent treatment after being photographed allegedly taking drugs .
" for kate moss , it was the only thing she could do , " she says .
" you could argue it was a publicity stunt and going into rehab was the way she told the world she was sorry .
" the public love someone who holds their hand up and says sorry .
she knew exactly what she was doing and she has turned her career around . "
with goody , ms perry thinks she may have gone to rehab after big brother to get away from the controversy and death threats .
" i think with jade , everybody could see what a state she was in , " she says .
" it 's one of the only places you can go to get away from the prying eye , and in there she was safe .
" i do n't think britney has gone in for a publicity stunt either .

mr prodi tendered his resignation after his centre-left coalition suffered a damaging parliamentary defeat .
mr napolitano is now expected to hold a round of meetings at which he will test the level of support for a new prodi government .
after the high drama of wednesday 's senate vote , which saw the government defeated on its foreign policy , the smart money is on a much-weakened mr prodi being offered a new mandate to govern .
failing that , the president may feel obliged to construct a temporary government of technocrats to hold the fort - and push through urgent measures like pensions reform and the next year 's budget .
however , the consensus among political pundits seems to be that , in the short term at least , italy is more likely to see a second , weaker , prodi government than any return to a centre-right government , or swift elections .
political irony in the longer term , some political pundits are suggesting that mr prodi , himself a committed catholic , may be tempted to recruit some moderate catholic elements from the centre-right coalition led by the former prime minister , silvio berlusconi .
this recasting of the political landscape would rid him of the need to rely on the hard-line , unreformed communists who have proved so troublesome in his government , experts say .
the irony of all this will not be lost on mr napolitano .
a former communist himself , he now finds himself picking up the pieces left by the refusal of some of his former fellow-believers to accept the deployment of italian troops to afghanistan , and the expansion of a big us military base in vicenza , northern italy .
deaf ears italy has never punched its weight on the international stage , so mr prodi could be forgiven for having thought that foreign policy was a safe playground for his feistier left-wing partners .
he will not make that mistake again .
what has happened over the past couple of weeks is a reminder of the power of the piazza in italy - the ability of popular protest to change the political landscape .
last weekend 's huge demonstrations in vicenza against the expansion of the us base there underlined the scale of mr prodi 's miscalculation .
his foreign minister massimo d 'alema , himself a former communist and viewed by some as one of the shrewdest political operators in the land , had warned that the government would have to resign if it lost wednesday 's vote .
the warnings fell on deaf ears .
mr prodi may survive for the time being , if given a new mandate to lead after a re-jig of his government team .
but his already questionable authority will undoubtedly be further weakened .

mr prodi tendered his resignation after his centre-left coalition suffered a damaging parliamentary defeat .
mr napolitano is now expected to hold a round of meetings at which he will test the level of support for a new prodi government .
after the high drama of wednesday 's senate vote , which saw the government defeated on its foreign policy , the smart money is on a much-weakened mr prodi being offered a new mandate to govern .
failing that , the president may feel obliged to construct a temporary government of technocrats to hold the fort - and push through urgent measures like pensions reform and the next year 's budget .
however , the consensus among political pundits seems to be that , in the short term at least , italy is more likely to see a second , weaker , prodi government than any return to a centre-right government , or swift elections .
political irony in the longer term , some political pundits are suggesting that mr prodi , himself a committed catholic , may be tempted to recruit some moderate catholic elements from the centre-right coalition led by the former prime minister , silvio berlusconi .

jaron lanier , who popularised the virtual reality concept in the early 1980s , said that in rush to forge a new age of collectivism , we risk losing individual identities and dumbing down our understanding of the world .
he told bbc world service 's culture shock that his main problem is that in places like the blogosphere or the online encyclopaedia wikipedia , people no longer treat or respect each other as individuals .
" we have these designs on the internet where a whole bunch of people work together anonymously - a mob , in my opinion - in order to do something , " he said .
" they actually take on the emotional quality of a mob - they become mean , they tend to insult each other a lot more than they would if they knew who each other were .
in my opinion , this is an example of a design that is n't so great . "
mass opinions lanier is among a small group leading a backlash against web 2.0 - the term coined to describe the latest internet era , in which collective ideas and participation take over from individual authorship .
lanier singled out wikipedia for particular criticism , saying that because those who participate do so anonymously , " you have no idea what knowledge any of them have " .
" essentially they lose themselves ; they become a mob , " he added .
he coined the term " digital maoism " in a recent article , and explained that it was not meant entirely as an insult , but a reference to the notion that individual variations between people are negative and that " somehow , the masses of people will always be right " .
and he said that there is currently an " avalanche " of new companies being funded by investors in silicon valley that are designed to harvest the wisdom of the collective .
he criticised in particular news aggregator sites , in which millions anonymously review a newspaper article , and a newspaper is created on the basis of the mass opinions of these people .
" the problem with that is that if you look at the result , you end up with trivial but amusing news stories as the headlines , " he said .
" for instance , a college student winning an ice cream-eating contest and getting a horrible headache and having to go to the hospital .
" but some of the more important headlines , about politics or science , are either missing or obscure .
this is a natural reaction , because of course people want to be amused , but i think the more valuable source of news brings them news that is n't always the best . "
web 3.0 but trend expert lauren parijs , director of the flanders district of creativity in brussels , said that while lanier 's view an " anti-movement gaining momentum , " it remains very small .
" it 's natural - every new medium has its opposition , " he added .
and he countered that while there is a sense of individuality being lost in some areas , other sites are attempting to counter this .
" you also see a lot of initiatives springing up on the web that actually combine the two things , letting people contribute but also meet up , " he said .
" there is a networking initiative called e-academy , and what they do is let people connect projects on the net that do the same thing , but also arrange for people to meet face to face within their community .
" so you see this blend taking place - and i think that 's where web 3.0 will head towards . "
