in 1978 , the magazine also broke a taboo by reporting on sexual abuse , and in the early 1980s it was the first to push the topic of eating disorders out of the home and into the headlines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : images of women in the media have long been a topic for emma in 2000 , the magazine , which had long agitated for equal rights in the military , celebrated the first woman bundeswehr soldier . in the last election cycle , emma threw its weight behind conservative candidate angela merkel - not for her politics , but for her gender .

in 1978 , the magazine also broke a taboo by reporting on sexual abuse , and in the early 1980s it was the first to push the topic of eating disorders out of the home and into the headlines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : images of women in the media have long been a topic for emma in 2000 , the magazine , which had long agitated for equal rights in the military , celebrated the first woman bundeswehr soldier . in the last election cycle , emma threw its weight behind conservative candidate angela merkel - not for her politics , but for her gender .
germany now has its first madam chancellor . " from the very beginning , we promoted the notion of role models , " schwarzer said . after 30 years of publishing , what does the future hold for emma ?
schwarzer aims to continue , and there has been joking talk of finding a replacement editor .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 25.01.2007 faced with generics threat , pfizer makes drastic cutbacks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pfizer has n't produced a single hit since its 1998 viagra pill hurt by the loss of patent protection and setbacks in developing new drugs , the world 's biggest pharmaceuticals firm , pfizer , is laying off workers and closing production sites in the us as well as europe . new york-based pfizer said this week it will cut at least 10,000 jobs and close several manufacturing and research sites in a cost-cutting drive aimed at bolstering earnings reeling from strong competition by makers of generic drugs . the layoffs , which amount to about 10 percent of pfizer 's total workforce , will take place by the end of 2008 , it said .
the company will also close production sites in the us and germany - reducing its manufacturing plants from 93 to 48 - as well as shut down research centers in japan and france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pfizer 's under pressure pfizer chief executive jeffrey kindler said the company needed to cut costs because it expected its profits to stagnate over the next two years and be roughly comparable to the $ 48.4 billion -lrb- 37 billion euros -rrb- it reported for 2006 .
analysts predict that profits will drop by almost 40 percent . " we are facing significant challenges in a profoundly changing business environment , " kindler said in a statement .
" i believe we must fundamentally change the way we run our company to meet these challenges . " boom time over for pfizer ? things were n't always this way for pfizer .
the drug giant can look back on an illustrious past .
the company has long been considered a shining model of a successful multinational . founded by german chemist karl pfizer in new york in 1849 , the company became the world leader , especially in " blockbuster " drugs , which refers to medicines that rake in earnings worth over a billion dollars a year . in its heyday , the company 's product palette was largely associated with superlatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pfizer created a sensation with viagra pfizer created the world 's most famous pill , the erectile dysfunction drug viagra .
its number one drug , lipitor , which is used to lower blood cholesterol , is the world 's most lucrative pill . in 2004 , pfizer had a yearly turnover of $ 52.52 billion , the world 's biggest research and development budget and a 38,000-strong sales army . no new blockbuster drugs in sight but that golden age is past .
over the next few years , patent protection for a number of its drugs - which once earned pfizer billions - is set to expire .
that means that pfizer will then lose its monopoly , usually set for a period of 20 years , over producing those drugs - much to the joy of makers of generic medicines . pfizer has been suffering from the loss of patent protection on key drugs like the antidepressant zoloft and the antibiotic zithromax .
sales of both drugs plunged more than 70 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006 , the company said . the company 's problems are compounded by the fact that pfizer 's labs have not produced a single hit despite an annual research budget of $ 7 billion . even viagra , pfizer 's last big success , is almost a decade old .
in december , pfizer had to stop development of torcetrapib , a promising cardiovascular drug , because of dangerous side-effects .
torcetrapib was meant to bring pfizer $ 10 billion yearly . cut-throat competition pfizer 's problems are n't new in the pharmaceutical industry .
competition from makers of generic drugs remains a problem for most big drug companies .
but streamlining operations does n't seem to hold all the answers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : generic drugs are putting the squeeze on firms like pfizer pfizer 's current belt-tightening is the second time in two years that the drug giant has embarked on a serious cost-cutting strategy . many experts forecast a takeover war in the pharmaceutical industry , with big players forgoing producing new drugs and instead looking to buy innovative biotechnology competitors who could develop new medicines . markus preissner , head of the research division for drug distribution at the university of cologne , said that competition between the producers of original drugs and those of generic drugs was absolutely cut-throat . " if there are copycat products , the original drug is much more difficult to sell , " preissner said . compromising on quality preissner warned that the bargain-hunting mentality of consumers did n't augur well for the quality of future drugs . " when drugs do n't cost much , they ca n't be of high quality , " he said . tido von schön-angerer from the german chapter of aid organization doctors without borders said that hugely expensive product marketing was largely responsible for the high costs of original drugs .
thus , research and development often falls by the wayside as in the case of pfizer , von schön-angerer pointed out . " even patent protection is no guarantee for urgently needed innovation , " he said , adding that it was particularly true when it came to developing drugs for diseases in poor countries . andreas leixnering -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de second time around for discount pharmacy chain docmorris , the dutch discount pharmacy chain , has found a loophole to get around germany 's powerful lobby of pharmacists .

analysts predict that profits will drop by almost 40 percent . " we are facing significant challenges in a profoundly changing business environment , " kindler said in a statement .
" i believe we must fundamentally change the way we run our company to meet these challenges . " boom time over for pfizer ? things were n't always this way for pfizer .
the drug giant can look back on an illustrious past .

over the next few years , patent protection for a number of its drugs - which once earned pfizer billions - is set to expire .
that means that pfizer will then lose its monopoly , usually set for a period of 20 years , over producing those drugs - much to the joy of makers of generic medicines . pfizer has been suffering from the loss of patent protection on key drugs like the antidepressant zoloft and the antibiotic zithromax .
sales of both drugs plunged more than 70 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006 , the company said . the company 's problems are compounded by the fact that pfizer 's labs have not produced a single hit despite an annual research budget of $ 7 billion . even viagra , pfizer 's last big success , is almost a decade old .

the company will also close production sites in the us and germany - reducing its manufacturing plants from 93 to 48 - as well as shut down research centers in japan and france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pfizer 's under pressure pfizer chief executive jeffrey kindler said the company needed to cut costs because it expected its profits to stagnate over the next two years and be roughly comparable to the $ 48.4 billion -lrb- 37 billion euros -rrb- it reported for 2006 .
analysts predict that profits will drop by almost 40 percent . " we are facing significant challenges in a profoundly changing business environment , " kindler said in a statement .
" i believe we must fundamentally change the way we run our company to meet these challenges . " boom time over for pfizer ? things were n't always this way for pfizer .
the drug giant can look back on an illustrious past .
the company has long been considered a shining model of a successful multinational . founded by german chemist karl pfizer in new york in 1849 , the company became the world leader , especially in " blockbuster " drugs , which refers to medicines that rake in earnings worth over a billion dollars a year . in its heyday , the company 's product palette was largely associated with superlatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pfizer created a sensation with viagra pfizer created the world 's most famous pill , the erectile dysfunction drug viagra .
its number one drug , lipitor , which is used to lower blood cholesterol , is the world 's most lucrative pill . in 2004 , pfizer had a yearly turnover of $ 52.52 billion , the world 's biggest research and development budget and a 38,000-strong sales army . no new blockbuster drugs in sight but that golden age is past .
over the next few years , patent protection for a number of its drugs - which once earned pfizer billions - is set to expire .
that means that pfizer will then lose its monopoly , usually set for a period of 20 years , over producing those drugs - much to the joy of makers of generic medicines . pfizer has been suffering from the loss of patent protection on key drugs like the antidepressant zoloft and the antibiotic zithromax .
sales of both drugs plunged more than 70 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006 , the company said . the company 's problems are compounded by the fact that pfizer 's labs have not produced a single hit despite an annual research budget of $ 7 billion . even viagra , pfizer 's last big success , is almost a decade old .
in december , pfizer had to stop development of torcetrapib , a promising cardiovascular drug , because of dangerous side-effects .
torcetrapib was meant to bring pfizer $ 10 billion yearly . cut-throat competition pfizer 's problems are n't new in the pharmaceutical industry .
competition from makers of generic drugs remains a problem for most big drug companies .
but streamlining operations does n't seem to hold all the answers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : generic drugs are putting the squeeze on firms like pfizer pfizer 's current belt-tightening is the second time in two years that the drug giant has embarked on a serious cost-cutting strategy . many experts forecast a takeover war in the pharmaceutical industry , with big players forgoing producing new drugs and instead looking to buy innovative biotechnology competitors who could develop new medicines . markus preissner , head of the research division for drug distribution at the university of cologne , said that competition between the producers of original drugs and those of generic drugs was absolutely cut-throat . " if there are copycat products , the original drug is much more difficult to sell , " preissner said . compromising on quality preissner warned that the bargain-hunting mentality of consumers did n't augur well for the quality of future drugs . " when drugs do n't cost much , they ca n't be of high quality , " he said . tido von schön-angerer from the german chapter of aid organization doctors without borders said that hugely expensive product marketing was largely responsible for the high costs of original drugs .
thus , research and development often falls by the wayside as in the case of pfizer , von schön-angerer pointed out . " even patent protection is no guarantee for urgently needed innovation , " he said , adding that it was particularly true when it came to developing drugs for diseases in poor countries . andreas leixnering -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de second time around for discount pharmacy chain docmorris , the dutch discount pharmacy chain , has found a loophole to get around germany 's powerful lobby of pharmacists .

" the widely predicted deterioration in the consumer climate at the start of the new year has kicked in , " gfk found . " the tax shock and the anticipatory purchases in december had led to a drastic decline in consumers ' willingness to spend this month , " it explained . putting the breaks on household spending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the effects of the vat hike are beginning to be felt all over germany the german government raised sales tax by three full percentage points to 19 percent with effect from jan .

analysts had been penciling in a steady to slightly higher reading in january . but even after the decline , business confidence in germany remains at its second-highest level since january 1991 and the current upturn is not in jeopardy , ifo president hans-werner sinn said . " companies still reported a very positive current business situation , even if it was not quite so favorable as in the previous month , " sinn said . a good outlook bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup last summer gave an important boost to germany 's economic revival furthermore , companies were more confident with regard to the outlook for the next six months . " this indicates that after a brief pause , the cyclical recovery will continue in the coming months , " sinn said . gfk similarly predicted that the dip in consumer sentiment this month would prove only temporary .
income expectations were less pessimistic and economic expectations were continuing to develop positively , gfk noted . the government insisted that the fundamental upwards trend in the german economy was still intact . " the dampening effects on private consumption will be overcome quickly , " the economy ministry said in a statement .
" household spending would pick up again during the course of the year and contribute to overall growth . " an unbroken uptrend bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer confidence fell sharply in january analysts , too , insisted that the uptrend in both the german and eurozone economies remained unbroken . " the -lrb- ifo -rrb- index remains well above the long-term average and is still pointing to above trend growth in the eurozone , " said bank of america economist matthew sharratt . " the january decline only represents a modest correction .
the data are consistent with our expectation that the german economic upswing is likely to take a breather in the first quarter of 2007 but will return to above-trend growth in the second half , " sharratt said . raising interest rates ? ixis economist sylvain broyer said the latest ifo and gfk confidence data , coupled with steady business confidence in france , pointed to a " marked air pocket in activity during the first half of this year , re-accelerating somewhat in the second half .

" the lives of others " is an intense look at a committed east german secret police officer who gradually becomes disillusioned with the system he has worked to uphold , until he finally switches sides and tries to protect a woman he was assigned to spy on . the film was nominated for best foreign film at this year 's academy awards .
on wednesday , dw-world spoke with its director , florian henckel von donnersmarck . dw-world : congratulations on your film .
what was it like , hearing that you had been nominated for an oscar ? florian henckel von donnersmarck : i was very relieved , because i knew a lot of people were expecting it and hoping for it .
of course , the nomination was no longer dependent on me .
the battle that i am now getting recognition for is a battle i won two years ago .
but still , you naturally think you would have disappointed people if you were n't nominated . i 'm in france right now .
-lrb- on tuesday -rrb- i introduced my film at its premiere in toulouse .
and so of course the french opened up a big bottle of champagne , and immediately gave the printers instructions to make new posters with the words " nominated for the oscar , 2007 " on it . bildunterschrift : ulrich mühe plays a stasi agent whose life takes a surprising turn how has your film been received in france ? very well .
the french known an astonishing amount about the whole topic .
and they are putting a lot of energy behind the film ; there are 120 copies .
proportionally , that is approximately about as many as in germany , and of course i am very pleased , because the french are the opinion makers when it comes to international cinema .
for example when the french discovered the -lrb- austrian -rrb- director michael haneke , he suddenly became a very important director for us in germany . do german movies work well abroad ? even the most successful german films overseas are limited successes , compared with american movies .
for example , das boot -lrb- the boat -rrb- is the most successful german film in the usa .
it took in around 11 million dollars -lrb- xxxx -rrb- .
for an american film – even the littlest independent production – that would be considered a huge flop .
considering that , you ca n't really get your expectations too high .
but you reach a certain elite few who are open to culture , and that 's a good thing . but does your film work in terms of content ?
i mean , you have to know the historical background surrounding the story . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : florian henckel von donnersmarck you don ’ t really need to know german history so well in order to undsertand the film .
if so , i would have done something wrong , and the film would only be good for showing at universities .
i actually got the feeling that the americans are glad this film does n't just depict things in black and white .
i think right now the americans have the feeling that the current government 's painting everything black and white – like hwen it talks about the " axis of evil " – has n't been very helpful .
on the contrary .
and i think my film is a help , and that americans are more open for political-moral questions than they were five years ago or so . why is your film so successful ? my film talks about things that viewers around the world know and recognize .
along with the stasi -lrb- east german secret police -rrb- and the intelligence services , it is about overarching human questions : how does it feel when your private sphere is violated ?
how does it feel to deal with absolute power ?
how does it feel to be afraid ?
these are things that interest and touch everyone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mühe won best european actor 2006 for his role in the film how are you getting prepared for the oscars , which take place on feb .
25 ? of course , i 'm really excited , but i try to keep in mind that it is really out of my control , whether or not i win .
it depends on whether , and how , other people see my film , and i ca n't influence that .
people say it depends on propaganda , and how you campaign for it .
but that is n't true .
there are so many successful and important filmmakers on the panel , and they are n't influenced by who ran a bigger ad , or whether you gave an elegant speech somewhere .
they care about which films move them , and so i am just trying not to get too uptight about it . of course , it is totally clear to me that it would mean a big change in my life , if i won the oscar .
ask volker schlöndorff how it affected his life to win such a gigantic prize as the oscar so early in his career , for the 1980 filming of the tin drum .
this is really an unbelievably powerful statute . ina rottscheidt spoke with florian henckel von donnersmarck -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jewish filmmaker breaks taboos with hitler send-up both german and jewish sensitivities are to face a severe test next month with the launch of a comedy movie in german that turns nazi dictator adolf hitler into a clown with 90 minutes of juvenile jokes .

dw 's reporter marco vollmar spoke to one of its participants , german steel magnate jürgen großman . " the spirit of davos does n't just float around , " said german steel baron jürgen großmann .
" you have to look for it in the conversations . " jürgen großmann is one of the 2,500 participants in the davos world economic forum , together with 800 corporate chief executives or chairmen , 24 heads of state or government and 85 cabinet ministers .
großman , who is the managing partner of georgsmarienhütte holding - a global producer of high-grade structural steel - knows that networking and personal contacts are essential for doing business .
that is why he has been attending the economic forum in the swiss skiing resort for 15 years . " there are indian entrepreneurs in my field who are buying shares in german forges and foundries , " großmann said .
" you get to know them here , you start talking to them and you ask them what it is that they really want : are interested in acquiring a production line in germany or do they just want to pull out the know-how and do everything in india ? " " you get to know these things much better after you 've met the people , " großmann said . rubbing shoulders with the leaders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel opened the five-day brainstorming session of political and economic leaders after german chancellor angela merkel officially opened the davos forum on wednesday , großmann met her unofficially , behind the scenes .
they spoke about energy supplies - a topic which is on everybody 's lips at davos . " the environmentally friendly production of renewable energy is always right , " said großmann .
" but what about the international consensus on nuclear energy ?
germany seems to be willing to go its own way there .
i strongly doubt that that would be appropriate for our basic industry . " the coalition of german socialist democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party under former chancellor gerhard schröder reached a ground-breaking agreement that all of germany 's nuclear power plants would be shut down by 2020 . " we 're happy , of course , about having access to cheap electricity through german nuclear power plants .
it would be sad , i think , if we could only get cheap electricity from abroad in the near future , " großmann said . bildunterschrift : davos is an ideal setting for high-level networking no fear of globalization with 9,000 employees , großmann 's steel empire made a turnover of 2,2 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.9 billion -rrb- and cashed in hefty profits in 2006 - all that in a field known for its fierce competition worldwide , massive mergers and rapid technological progress . in the face of globalization and new players from india and china , großmann remains confident . " we 've been the globalization champion and main winner of globalization for more than 40 years , " großmann said .
" we ca n't now , all of a sudden , when others are getting strong , say that we do n't want this anymore . " " furthermore , we 're interested in wealthy clients .
the richer our client countries are , the more stuff we sell them , especially cars and machines that germany makes lots of . " marco vollmar -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de at davos kick-off , merkel says no to protectionism in a wide-ranging speech at the world economic forum , german chancellor angela merkel on wednesday staunchly rejected protectionism as a solution to the economic and social challenges of globalization .

" i find it personally extremely disturbing that these efforts were not sufficiently successful , " pierer said . with regard to the mobile phones business , which siemens sold to taiwan-based benq and which has subsequently collapsed , von pierer insisted that the german company had done everything that could be expected for the activities . the role of siemens in the collapse of benq mobile has been criticised , with critics saying the german company did not do enough to save the business . unlawful practice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens ' klaus kleinfeld wants to have the bribery scandal investigated and cleared up referring to the bribery scandal that has rocked the german engineering and electronics giant , von pierer 's successor , klaus kleinfeld , told around 9,000 shareholders that he was dismayed when he found out that a group of former and present employees had acted unlawfully .
" when i first heard of it , i was speechless , " kleinfeld said . at the heart of the bribery allegations are questionable payments totaling about 418 million euros -lrb- $ 543 million -rrb- , which are at present the subject of investigation launched by the munich-based siemens . " we are doing everything we can to get to the bottom of this incident , " kleinfeld said .
" there is no place for dubious business practices in our company . " claims about bribery at the company triggered police raids in november on company office and the homes of several former and present employees . on wednesday , the eu commission in brussels had slapped a 418-million-euro fine on siemens and its austrian subsidiary for alleged price-fixing by its power generation division .
siemens is appealing against the fine , but must nevertheless pay it initially . first-quarter results affected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu fine put a noticeable dent in siemens ' profits siemens ' annual shareholders meeting on thursday coincided with the publication of the group 's first-quarter results , which showed its bottom-line profits hit by the european commission fine . siemens , which runs its business from october to september , said in a statement that its net profit amounted to 788 million euros in the three months to december , down 16 percent from the year-earlier period . analysts had been penciling in net profit of around 973 million euros for the three-month period , but those forecasts did not take into account a one-off charge of 418 million euros booked at the last minute . a strong start , nonetheless bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens ' reputation may be tarnished by the bribery scandal underlying earnings improved in the october-december period , however , with operating profit jumping by 51 percent to 1.631 billion euros , boosted by the strong performances of the medical technology and automation divisions . first-quarter sales were up six percent at 19.068 billion euros and incoming orders rose by four percent to 24.582 billion euros . " in terms of our underlying performance , the first quarter got the fiscal year off to a strong start , " kleinfeld said . " while it is disappointing to see our net income growth reversed by an impact from events in the past , we are moving on with our operations tremendously improved year-over-year , " he said . looking ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens shareholders want to know the full story overnight , siemens announced that it had agreed to buy us software maker ugs for 3.5 billion dollars including debt . in addition , siemens would float its automotive supply business , siemens vdo automotive -lrb- sv -rrb- , on the stock exchange , with the parent company to hold on to a majority stake . " this move will give sv the necessary financial resources and greater entrepreneurial flexibility for ensuring further sustainable and profitable growth , " the company said in a statement . looking ahead , the group predicted that all divisions would attain the profitability targets they had set themselves for the second quarter , after some of the divisions failed to meet those targets in the first quarter . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu commission slaps huge fine on siemens for price fixing the eu has fined power equipment manufacturers for their roles in a price-fixing scheme .

" the widely predicted deterioration in the consumer climate at the start of the new year has kicked in , " gfk found .

" this indicates that after a brief pause , the cyclical recovery will continue in the coming months , " sinn said . gfk similarly predicted that the dip in consumer sentiment this month would prove only temporary .
income expectations were less pessimistic and economic expectations were continuing to develop positively , gfk noted . the government insisted that the fundamental upwards trend in the german economy was still intact . " the dampening effects on private consumption will be overcome quickly , " the economy ministry said in a statement .
" household spending would pick up again during the course of the year and contribute to overall growth .

" the -lrb- ifo -rrb- index remains well above the long-term average and is still pointing to above trend growth in the eurozone , " said bank of america economist matthew sharratt . " the january decline only represents a modest correction .
the data are consistent with our expectation that the german economic upswing is likely to take a breather in the first quarter of 2007 but will return to above-trend growth in the second half , " sharratt said . raising interest rates ? ixis economist sylvain broyer said the latest ifo and gfk confidence data , coupled with steady business confidence in france , pointed to a " marked air pocket in activity during the first half of this year , re-accelerating somewhat in the second half .

dw 's reporter marco vollmar spoke to one of its participants , german steel magnate jürgen großman . " the spirit of davos does n't just float around , " said german steel baron jürgen großmann .
" you have to look for it in the conversations . " jürgen großmann is one of the 2,500 participants in the davos world economic forum , together with 800 corporate chief executives or chairmen , 24 heads of state or government and 85 cabinet ministers .
großman , who is the managing partner of georgsmarienhütte holding - a global producer of high-grade structural steel - knows that networking and personal contacts are essential for doing business .
that is why he has been attending the economic forum in the swiss skiing resort for 15 years . " there are indian entrepreneurs in my field who are buying shares in german forges and foundries , " großmann said .
" you get to know them here , you start talking to them and you ask them what it is that they really want : are interested in acquiring a production line in germany or do they just want to pull out the know-how and do everything in india ? " " you get to know these things much better after you 've met the people , " großmann said . rubbing shoulders with the leaders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel opened the five-day brainstorming session of political and economic leaders after german chancellor angela merkel officially opened the davos forum on wednesday , großmann met her unofficially , behind the scenes .

" but what about the international consensus on nuclear energy ?
germany seems to be willing to go its own way there .
i strongly doubt that that would be appropriate for our basic industry .

" the widely predicted deterioration in the consumer climate at the start of the new year has kicked in , " gfk found . " the tax shock and the anticipatory purchases in december had led to a drastic decline in consumers ' willingness to spend this month , " it explained . putting the breaks on household spending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the effects of the vat hike are beginning to be felt all over germany the german government raised sales tax by three full percentage points to 19 percent with effect from jan .
1 , in a move experts said would put the brakes on household spending and therefore on the economy as a whole . the sharp vat hike is now also hitting business confidence , the more important ifo business climate index showed . after topping a 16-year high in december , index fell surprisingly this month .
analysts had been penciling in a steady to slightly higher reading in january . but even after the decline , business confidence in germany remains at its second-highest level since january 1991 and the current upturn is not in jeopardy , ifo president hans-werner sinn said . " companies still reported a very positive current business situation , even if it was not quite so favorable as in the previous month , " sinn said . a good outlook bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup last summer gave an important boost to germany 's economic revival furthermore , companies were more confident with regard to the outlook for the next six months . " this indicates that after a brief pause , the cyclical recovery will continue in the coming months , " sinn said . gfk similarly predicted that the dip in consumer sentiment this month would prove only temporary .
income expectations were less pessimistic and economic expectations were continuing to develop positively , gfk noted . the government insisted that the fundamental upwards trend in the german economy was still intact . " the dampening effects on private consumption will be overcome quickly , " the economy ministry said in a statement .
" household spending would pick up again during the course of the year and contribute to overall growth . " an unbroken uptrend bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer confidence fell sharply in january analysts , too , insisted that the uptrend in both the german and eurozone economies remained unbroken . " the -lrb- ifo -rrb- index remains well above the long-term average and is still pointing to above trend growth in the eurozone , " said bank of america economist matthew sharratt . " the january decline only represents a modest correction .
the data are consistent with our expectation that the german economic upswing is likely to take a breather in the first quarter of 2007 but will return to above-trend growth in the second half , " sharratt said . raising interest rates ? ixis economist sylvain broyer said the latest ifo and gfk confidence data , coupled with steady business confidence in france , pointed to a " marked air pocket in activity during the first half of this year , re-accelerating somewhat in the second half . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the europan central bank may increase its key interest rates with inflationary dangers still not completely banished , the european central bank will , according to broyer , " remain hawkish for a while . " nordlb analyst tobias basse similarly predicted that the ecb would " stick to its guns and raise its key interest rates by a quarter of percentage point in march .

" i find it personally extremely disturbing that these efforts were not sufficiently successful , " pierer said . with regard to the mobile phones business , which siemens sold to taiwan-based benq and which has subsequently collapsed , von pierer insisted that the german company had done everything that could be expected for the activities . the role of siemens in the collapse of benq mobile has been criticised , with critics saying the german company did not do enough to save the business . unlawful practice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens ' klaus kleinfeld wants to have the bribery scandal investigated and cleared up referring to the bribery scandal that has rocked the german engineering and electronics giant , von pierer 's successor , klaus kleinfeld , told around 9,000 shareholders that he was dismayed when he found out that a group of former and present employees had acted unlawfully .
" when i first heard of it , i was speechless , " kleinfeld said . at the heart of the bribery allegations are questionable payments totaling about 418 million euros -lrb- $ 543 million -rrb- , which are at present the subject of investigation launched by the munich-based siemens . " we are doing everything we can to get to the bottom of this incident , " kleinfeld said .
" there is no place for dubious business practices in our company . " claims about bribery at the company triggered police raids in november on company office and the homes of several former and present employees . on wednesday , the eu commission in brussels had slapped a 418-million-euro fine on siemens and its austrian subsidiary for alleged price-fixing by its power generation division .
siemens is appealing against the fine , but must nevertheless pay it initially . first-quarter results affected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu fine put a noticeable dent in siemens ' profits siemens ' annual shareholders meeting on thursday coincided with the publication of the group 's first-quarter results , which showed its bottom-line profits hit by the european commission fine . siemens , which runs its business from october to september , said in a statement that its net profit amounted to 788 million euros in the three months to december , down 16 percent from the year-earlier period . analysts had been penciling in net profit of around 973 million euros for the three-month period , but those forecasts did not take into account a one-off charge of 418 million euros booked at the last minute . a strong start , nonetheless bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens ' reputation may be tarnished by the bribery scandal underlying earnings improved in the october-december period , however , with operating profit jumping by 51 percent to 1.631 billion euros , boosted by the strong performances of the medical technology and automation divisions . first-quarter sales were up six percent at 19.068 billion euros and incoming orders rose by four percent to 24.582 billion euros .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 25.01.2007 faced with generics threat , pfizer makes drastic cutbacks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pfizer has n't produced a single hit since its 1998 viagra pill hurt by the loss of patent protection and setbacks in developing new drugs , the world 's biggest pharmaceuticals firm , pfizer , is laying off workers and closing production sites in the us as well as europe . new york-based pfizer said this week it will cut at least 10,000 jobs and close several manufacturing and research sites in a cost-cutting drive aimed at bolstering earnings reeling from strong competition by makers of generic drugs . the layoffs , which amount to about 10 percent of pfizer 's total workforce , will take place by the end of 2008 , it said .
the company will also close production sites in the us and germany - reducing its manufacturing plants from 93 to 48 - as well as shut down research centers in japan and france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pfizer 's under pressure pfizer chief executive jeffrey kindler said the company needed to cut costs because it expected its profits to stagnate over the next two years and be roughly comparable to the $ 48.4 billion -lrb- 37 billion euros -rrb- it reported for 2006 .
analysts predict that profits will drop by almost 40 percent . " we are facing significant challenges in a profoundly changing business environment , " kindler said in a statement .
" i believe we must fundamentally change the way we run our company to meet these challenges . " boom time over for pfizer ? things were n't always this way for pfizer .
the drug giant can look back on an illustrious past .
the company has long been considered a shining model of a successful multinational . founded by german chemist karl pfizer in new york in 1849 , the company became the world leader , especially in " blockbuster " drugs , which refers to medicines that rake in earnings worth over a billion dollars a year . in its heyday , the company 's product palette was largely associated with superlatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pfizer created a sensation with viagra pfizer created the world 's most famous pill , the erectile dysfunction drug viagra .
its number one drug , lipitor , which is used to lower blood cholesterol , is the world 's most lucrative pill . in 2004 , pfizer had a yearly turnover of $ 52.52 billion , the world 's biggest research and development budget and a 38,000-strong sales army . no new blockbuster drugs in sight but that golden age is past .
over the next few years , patent protection for a number of its drugs - which once earned pfizer billions - is set to expire .
that means that pfizer will then lose its monopoly , usually set for a period of 20 years , over producing those drugs - much to the joy of makers of generic medicines . pfizer has been suffering from the loss of patent protection on key drugs like the antidepressant zoloft and the antibiotic zithromax .
sales of both drugs plunged more than 70 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006 , the company said . the company 's problems are compounded by the fact that pfizer 's labs have not produced a single hit despite an annual research budget of $ 7 billion . even viagra , pfizer 's last big success , is almost a decade old .
in december , pfizer had to stop development of torcetrapib , a promising cardiovascular drug , because of dangerous side-effects .
torcetrapib was meant to bring pfizer $ 10 billion yearly . cut-throat competition pfizer 's problems are n't new in the pharmaceutical industry .
competition from makers of generic drugs remains a problem for most big drug companies .
but streamlining operations does n't seem to hold all the answers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : generic drugs are putting the squeeze on firms like pfizer pfizer 's current belt-tightening is the second time in two years that the drug giant has embarked on a serious cost-cutting strategy . many experts forecast a takeover war in the pharmaceutical industry , with big players forgoing producing new drugs and instead looking to buy innovative biotechnology competitors who could develop new medicines . markus preissner , head of the research division for drug distribution at the university of cologne , said that competition between the producers of original drugs and those of generic drugs was absolutely cut-throat . " if there are copycat products , the original drug is much more difficult to sell , " preissner said . compromising on quality preissner warned that the bargain-hunting mentality of consumers did n't augur well for the quality of future drugs . " when drugs do n't cost much , they ca n't be of high quality , " he said . tido von schön-angerer from the german chapter of aid organization doctors without borders said that hugely expensive product marketing was largely responsible for the high costs of original drugs .
thus , research and development often falls by the wayside as in the case of pfizer , von schön-angerer pointed out . " even patent protection is no guarantee for urgently needed innovation , " he said , adding that it was particularly true when it came to developing drugs for diseases in poor countries . andreas leixnering -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de second time around for discount pharmacy chain docmorris , the dutch discount pharmacy chain , has found a loophole to get around germany 's powerful lobby of pharmacists .

" the widely predicted deterioration in the consumer climate at the start of the new year has kicked in , " gfk found . " the tax shock and the anticipatory purchases in december had led to a drastic decline in consumers ' willingness to spend this month , " it explained . putting the breaks on household spending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the effects of the vat hike are beginning to be felt all over germany the german government raised sales tax by three full percentage points to 19 percent with effect from jan .
1 , in a move experts said would put the brakes on household spending and therefore on the economy as a whole . the sharp vat hike is now also hitting business confidence , the more important ifo business climate index showed . after topping a 16-year high in december , index fell surprisingly this month .
analysts had been penciling in a steady to slightly higher reading in january . but even after the decline , business confidence in germany remains at its second-highest level since january 1991 and the current upturn is not in jeopardy , ifo president hans-werner sinn said . " companies still reported a very positive current business situation , even if it was not quite so favorable as in the previous month , " sinn said . a good outlook bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup last summer gave an important boost to germany 's economic revival furthermore , companies were more confident with regard to the outlook for the next six months . " this indicates that after a brief pause , the cyclical recovery will continue in the coming months , " sinn said . gfk similarly predicted that the dip in consumer sentiment this month would prove only temporary .
income expectations were less pessimistic and economic expectations were continuing to develop positively , gfk noted . the government insisted that the fundamental upwards trend in the german economy was still intact . " the dampening effects on private consumption will be overcome quickly , " the economy ministry said in a statement .
" household spending would pick up again during the course of the year and contribute to overall growth . " an unbroken uptrend bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer confidence fell sharply in january analysts , too , insisted that the uptrend in both the german and eurozone economies remained unbroken . " the -lrb- ifo -rrb- index remains well above the long-term average and is still pointing to above trend growth in the eurozone , " said bank of america economist matthew sharratt . " the january decline only represents a modest correction .
the data are consistent with our expectation that the german economic upswing is likely to take a breather in the first quarter of 2007 but will return to above-trend growth in the second half , " sharratt said . raising interest rates ? ixis economist sylvain broyer said the latest ifo and gfk confidence data , coupled with steady business confidence in france , pointed to a " marked air pocket in activity during the first half of this year , re-accelerating somewhat in the second half . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the europan central bank may increase its key interest rates with inflationary dangers still not completely banished , the european central bank will , according to broyer , " remain hawkish for a while . " nordlb analyst tobias basse similarly predicted that the ecb would " stick to its guns and raise its key interest rates by a quarter of percentage point in march . " the guardian of the euro last raised its benchmark " refi " refinancing rate to a five-year high of 3.50 percent in december , and is expected to continue tightening monetary conditions in the 13 countries that share the euro in the coming months . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wood could be german answer to soaring energy prices germany is one of europe 's most densely forested countries , and soaring oil and gas prices are leading more households to switch to modern wood-burning heating systems , germany 's forest owners ' association says .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 25.01.2007 faced with generics threat , pfizer makes drastic cutbacks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pfizer has n't produced a single hit since its 1998 viagra pill hurt by the loss of patent protection and setbacks in developing new drugs , the world 's biggest pharmaceuticals firm , pfizer , is laying off workers and closing production sites in the us as well as europe . new york-based pfizer said this week it will cut at least 10,000 jobs and close several manufacturing and research sites in a cost-cutting drive aimed at bolstering earnings reeling from strong competition by makers of generic drugs . the layoffs , which amount to about 10 percent of pfizer 's total workforce , will take place by the end of 2008 , it said .
the company will also close production sites in the us and germany - reducing its manufacturing plants from 93 to 48 - as well as shut down research centers in japan and france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pfizer 's under pressure pfizer chief executive jeffrey kindler said the company needed to cut costs because it expected its profits to stagnate over the next two years and be roughly comparable to the $ 48.4 billion -lrb- 37 billion euros -rrb- it reported for 2006 .
analysts predict that profits will drop by almost 40 percent . " we are facing significant challenges in a profoundly changing business environment , " kindler said in a statement .
" i believe we must fundamentally change the way we run our company to meet these challenges . " boom time over for pfizer ? things were n't always this way for pfizer .
the drug giant can look back on an illustrious past .
the company has long been considered a shining model of a successful multinational . founded by german chemist karl pfizer in new york in 1849 , the company became the world leader , especially in " blockbuster " drugs , which refers to medicines that rake in earnings worth over a billion dollars a year . in its heyday , the company 's product palette was largely associated with superlatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pfizer created a sensation with viagra pfizer created the world 's most famous pill , the erectile dysfunction drug viagra .
its number one drug , lipitor , which is used to lower blood cholesterol , is the world 's most lucrative pill . in 2004 , pfizer had a yearly turnover of $ 52.52 billion , the world 's biggest research and development budget and a 38,000-strong sales army . no new blockbuster drugs in sight but that golden age is past .
over the next few years , patent protection for a number of its drugs - which once earned pfizer billions - is set to expire .
that means that pfizer will then lose its monopoly , usually set for a period of 20 years , over producing those drugs - much to the joy of makers of generic medicines . pfizer has been suffering from the loss of patent protection on key drugs like the antidepressant zoloft and the antibiotic zithromax .
sales of both drugs plunged more than 70 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006 , the company said . the company 's problems are compounded by the fact that pfizer 's labs have not produced a single hit despite an annual research budget of $ 7 billion . even viagra , pfizer 's last big success , is almost a decade old .
in december , pfizer had to stop development of torcetrapib , a promising cardiovascular drug , because of dangerous side-effects .
torcetrapib was meant to bring pfizer $ 10 billion yearly . cut-throat competition pfizer 's problems are n't new in the pharmaceutical industry .
competition from makers of generic drugs remains a problem for most big drug companies .
but streamlining operations does n't seem to hold all the answers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : generic drugs are putting the squeeze on firms like pfizer pfizer 's current belt-tightening is the second time in two years that the drug giant has embarked on a serious cost-cutting strategy . many experts forecast a takeover war in the pharmaceutical industry , with big players forgoing producing new drugs and instead looking to buy innovative biotechnology competitors who could develop new medicines . markus preissner , head of the research division for drug distribution at the university of cologne , said that competition between the producers of original drugs and those of generic drugs was absolutely cut-throat . " if there are copycat products , the original drug is much more difficult to sell , " preissner said . compromising on quality preissner warned that the bargain-hunting mentality of consumers did n't augur well for the quality of future drugs . " when drugs do n't cost much , they ca n't be of high quality , " he said . tido von schön-angerer from the german chapter of aid organization doctors without borders said that hugely expensive product marketing was largely responsible for the high costs of original drugs .
thus , research and development often falls by the wayside as in the case of pfizer , von schön-angerer pointed out . " even patent protection is no guarantee for urgently needed innovation , " he said , adding that it was particularly true when it came to developing drugs for diseases in poor countries . andreas leixnering -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de second time around for discount pharmacy chain docmorris , the dutch discount pharmacy chain , has found a loophole to get around germany 's powerful lobby of pharmacists .

the company will also close production sites in the us and germany - reducing its manufacturing plants from 93 to 48 - as well as shut down research centers in japan and france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pfizer 's under pressure pfizer chief executive jeffrey kindler said the company needed to cut costs because it expected its profits to stagnate over the next two years and be roughly comparable to the $ 48.4 billion -lrb- 37 billion euros -rrb- it reported for 2006 .
analysts predict that profits will drop by almost 40 percent . " we are facing significant challenges in a profoundly changing business environment , " kindler said in a statement .
" i believe we must fundamentally change the way we run our company to meet these challenges . " boom time over for pfizer ? things were n't always this way for pfizer .
the drug giant can look back on an illustrious past .
the company has long been considered a shining model of a successful multinational . founded by german chemist karl pfizer in new york in 1849 , the company became the world leader , especially in " blockbuster " drugs , which refers to medicines that rake in earnings worth over a billion dollars a year . in its heyday , the company 's product palette was largely associated with superlatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pfizer created a sensation with viagra pfizer created the world 's most famous pill , the erectile dysfunction drug viagra .
its number one drug , lipitor , which is used to lower blood cholesterol , is the world 's most lucrative pill . in 2004 , pfizer had a yearly turnover of $ 52.52 billion , the world 's biggest research and development budget and a 38,000-strong sales army . no new blockbuster drugs in sight but that golden age is past .
over the next few years , patent protection for a number of its drugs - which once earned pfizer billions - is set to expire .
that means that pfizer will then lose its monopoly , usually set for a period of 20 years , over producing those drugs - much to the joy of makers of generic medicines . pfizer has been suffering from the loss of patent protection on key drugs like the antidepressant zoloft and the antibiotic zithromax .
sales of both drugs plunged more than 70 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006 , the company said . the company 's problems are compounded by the fact that pfizer 's labs have not produced a single hit despite an annual research budget of $ 7 billion . even viagra , pfizer 's last big success , is almost a decade old .
in december , pfizer had to stop development of torcetrapib , a promising cardiovascular drug , because of dangerous side-effects .
torcetrapib was meant to bring pfizer $ 10 billion yearly . cut-throat competition pfizer 's problems are n't new in the pharmaceutical industry .
competition from makers of generic drugs remains a problem for most big drug companies .
but streamlining operations does n't seem to hold all the answers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : generic drugs are putting the squeeze on firms like pfizer pfizer 's current belt-tightening is the second time in two years that the drug giant has embarked on a serious cost-cutting strategy . many experts forecast a takeover war in the pharmaceutical industry , with big players forgoing producing new drugs and instead looking to buy innovative biotechnology competitors who could develop new medicines . markus preissner , head of the research division for drug distribution at the university of cologne , said that competition between the producers of original drugs and those of generic drugs was absolutely cut-throat . " if there are copycat products , the original drug is much more difficult to sell , " preissner said . compromising on quality preissner warned that the bargain-hunting mentality of consumers did n't augur well for the quality of future drugs . " when drugs do n't cost much , they ca n't be of high quality , " he said . tido von schön-angerer from the german chapter of aid organization doctors without borders said that hugely expensive product marketing was largely responsible for the high costs of original drugs .
thus , research and development often falls by the wayside as in the case of pfizer , von schön-angerer pointed out . " even patent protection is no guarantee for urgently needed innovation , " he said , adding that it was particularly true when it came to developing drugs for diseases in poor countries . andreas leixnering -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de second time around for discount pharmacy chain docmorris , the dutch discount pharmacy chain , has found a loophole to get around germany 's powerful lobby of pharmacists .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 25.01.2007 happy birthday , emma : german feminist magazine turns 30 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwarzer : master of publicity , fighter for a cause germany 's feminist flagship magazine , emma , will turn 30 this weekend .
over the years , both the magazine and its mediagenic founder , alice schwarzer , have spent a fair share of time in the spotlight . the first issue of emma went on sale at newsstands on jan .
26 , 1977 .
the magazine , written " by women , for women , " is inextricably tied to the name and image of alice schwarzer , germany 's best-known feminist . by founding emma - to german ears , the name unmistakably evokes the word of " emancipation " - the well-known journalist provided a nation in the throes of feminist activism with a popular forum for discussing staple women 's issues .
abortion , equal rights , pornography and prostitution were all early fodder for the monthly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the magazine supported angela merkel in her run for office " emma was born in the classic political agitation of the 1970s , " schwarzer said , " … and it has managed to develop in a lively and open fashion over the past 30 years . " key to success : schwarzer " lively and open " may be putting it mildly .
exploiting an uncanny knack for publicity , schwarzer - the magazine 's publisher , editor and driving force - has seen to it that the magazine and its topics have never strayed far from the german media spotlight . " alice schwarzer was already germany 's best-known women 's rights activists before she began publishing emma , " said dr. alexandra kühte , who published her dissertation on the image of women in emma two years ago . " the magazine allowed her to take these topics from the women 's movement to a broad public .
but the importance of emma is completely tied to its founder .
if she was n't so prominent , the magazine would n't be so successful , " kühte said . high impact but despite - or perhaps because of - its being so fully tied to one prominent person , emma 's influence on german society has been widely felt over the years .
some of the hotter topics of the late 1970s - women 's rights , women 's status in the catholic church - have cooled down , to be replaced by issues like eating disorders , genital mutilation and islam 's treatment of women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first issue of emma , in 1977 others issues , like prostitution and pornography -lrb- the magazine led a famed " porno " campaign for years , -rrb- remain " constant topics " according to kühte . anyone seeking objective journalism would do well to stay away from emma .
the magazine avoids dry , theoretical discussion and instead infuses its articles with an opinionated , and decidedly activist , stance . of sex abuse , " porno " and equal pay emma has kept women 's issues at the center of debate because it " was always provocative , it did n't try to fit in with social norms , " kühte said .
" it took on emotionally important and polarizing themes and was very dogmatic about it . " indeed , both schwarzer and her magazine have made headlines over the years .
in 1978 , she and nine other women sued the weekly magazine stern for its sexist cover shots -lrb- she lost -rrb- .
in 1978 , the magazine also broke a taboo by reporting on sexual abuse , and in the early 1980s it was the first to push the topic of eating disorders out of the home and into the headlines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : images of women in the media have long been a topic for emma in 2000 , the magazine , which had long agitated for equal rights in the military , celebrated the first woman bundeswehr soldier . in the last election cycle , emma threw its weight behind conservative candidate angela merkel - not for her politics , but for her gender .
germany now has its first madam chancellor . " from the very beginning , we promoted the notion of role models , " schwarzer said . after 30 years of publishing , what does the future hold for emma ?
schwarzer aims to continue , and there has been joking talk of finding a replacement editor .
but many people in germany share the opinion of kühte , who says : " emma without alice schwarzer is unimaginable .

over the years , both the magazine and its mediagenic founder , alice schwarzer , have spent a fair share of time in the spotlight . the first issue of emma went on sale at newsstands on jan .
26 , 1977 .
the magazine , written " by women , for women , " is inextricably tied to the name and image of alice schwarzer , germany 's best-known feminist . by founding emma - to german ears , the name unmistakably evokes the word of " emancipation " - the well-known journalist provided a nation in the throes of feminist activism with a popular forum for discussing staple women 's issues .
abortion , equal rights , pornography and prostitution were all early fodder for the monthly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the magazine supported angela merkel in her run for office " emma was born in the classic political agitation of the 1970s , " schwarzer said , " … and it has managed to develop in a lively and open fashion over the past 30 years . " key to success : schwarzer " lively and open " may be putting it mildly .
exploiting an uncanny knack for publicity , schwarzer - the magazine 's publisher , editor and driving force - has seen to it that the magazine and its topics have never strayed far from the german media spotlight . " alice schwarzer was already germany 's best-known women 's rights activists before she began publishing emma , " said dr. alexandra kühte , who published her dissertation on the image of women in emma two years ago .

if she was n't so prominent , the magazine would n't be so successful , " kühte said . high impact but despite - or perhaps because of - its being so fully tied to one prominent person , emma 's influence on german society has been widely felt over the years .
some of the hotter topics of the late 1970s - women 's rights , women 's status in the catholic church - have cooled down , to be replaced by issues like eating disorders , genital mutilation and islam 's treatment of women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first issue of emma , in 1977 others issues , like prostitution and pornography -lrb- the magazine led a famed " porno " campaign for years , -rrb- remain " constant topics " according to kühte . anyone seeking objective journalism would do well to stay away from emma .
the magazine avoids dry , theoretical discussion and instead infuses its articles with an opinionated , and decidedly activist , stance . of sex abuse , " porno " and equal pay emma has kept women 's issues at the center of debate because it " was always provocative , it did n't try to fit in with social norms , " kühte said .
" it took on emotionally important and polarizing themes and was very dogmatic about it . " indeed , both schwarzer and her magazine have made headlines over the years .
in 1978 , she and nine other women sued the weekly magazine stern for its sexist cover shots -lrb- she lost -rrb- .
in 1978 , the magazine also broke a taboo by reporting on sexual abuse , and in the early 1980s it was the first to push the topic of eating disorders out of the home and into the headlines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : images of women in the media have long been a topic for emma in 2000 , the magazine , which had long agitated for equal rights in the military , celebrated the first woman bundeswehr soldier . in the last election cycle , emma threw its weight behind conservative candidate angela merkel - not for her politics , but for her gender .
germany now has its first madam chancellor . " from the very beginning , we promoted the notion of role models , " schwarzer said . after 30 years of publishing , what does the future hold for emma ?

over the years , both the magazine and its mediagenic founder , alice schwarzer , have spent a fair share of time in the spotlight . the first issue of emma went on sale at newsstands on jan .
26 , 1977 .
the magazine , written " by women , for women , " is inextricably tied to the name and image of alice schwarzer , germany 's best-known feminist . by founding emma - to german ears , the name unmistakably evokes the word of " emancipation " - the well-known journalist provided a nation in the throes of feminist activism with a popular forum for discussing staple women 's issues .
abortion , equal rights , pornography and prostitution were all early fodder for the monthly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the magazine supported angela merkel in her run for office " emma was born in the classic political agitation of the 1970s , " schwarzer said , " … and it has managed to develop in a lively and open fashion over the past 30 years . " key to success : schwarzer " lively and open " may be putting it mildly .
exploiting an uncanny knack for publicity , schwarzer - the magazine 's publisher , editor and driving force - has seen to it that the magazine and its topics have never strayed far from the german media spotlight . " alice schwarzer was already germany 's best-known women 's rights activists before she began publishing emma , " said dr. alexandra kühte , who published her dissertation on the image of women in emma two years ago . " the magazine allowed her to take these topics from the women 's movement to a broad public .
but the importance of emma is completely tied to its founder .
if she was n't so prominent , the magazine would n't be so successful , " kühte said . high impact but despite - or perhaps because of - its being so fully tied to one prominent person , emma 's influence on german society has been widely felt over the years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 25.01.2007 " the oscar is an unbelievably powerful statue " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the director of the lives of others was ' relieved ' to be nominated for the oscar dw-world spoke with florian henckel von donnersmarck about how it feels to be nominated for an oscar for " the lives of others , " his film about an east german spy . " the lives of others " is an intense look at a committed east german secret police officer who gradually becomes disillusioned with the system he has worked to uphold , until he finally switches sides and tries to protect a woman he was assigned to spy on . the film was nominated for best foreign film at this year 's academy awards .
on wednesday , dw-world spoke with its director , florian henckel von donnersmarck . dw-world : congratulations on your film .
what was it like , hearing that you had been nominated for an oscar ? florian henckel von donnersmarck : i was very relieved , because i knew a lot of people were expecting it and hoping for it .
of course , the nomination was no longer dependent on me .
the battle that i am now getting recognition for is a battle i won two years ago .
but still , you naturally think you would have disappointed people if you were n't nominated . i 'm in france right now .
-lrb- on tuesday -rrb- i introduced my film at its premiere in toulouse .
and so of course the french opened up a big bottle of champagne , and immediately gave the printers instructions to make new posters with the words " nominated for the oscar , 2007 " on it . bildunterschrift : ulrich mühe plays a stasi agent whose life takes a surprising turn how has your film been received in france ? very well .
the french known an astonishing amount about the whole topic .
and they are putting a lot of energy behind the film ; there are 120 copies .
proportionally , that is approximately about as many as in germany , and of course i am very pleased , because the french are the opinion makers when it comes to international cinema .
for example when the french discovered the -lrb- austrian -rrb- director michael haneke , he suddenly became a very important director for us in germany . do german movies work well abroad ? even the most successful german films overseas are limited successes , compared with american movies .
for example , das boot -lrb- the boat -rrb- is the most successful german film in the usa .

dw 's reporter marco vollmar spoke to one of its participants , german steel magnate jürgen großman . " the spirit of davos does n't just float around , " said german steel baron jürgen großmann .
" you have to look for it in the conversations . " jürgen großmann is one of the 2,500 participants in the davos world economic forum , together with 800 corporate chief executives or chairmen , 24 heads of state or government and 85 cabinet ministers .
großman , who is the managing partner of georgsmarienhütte holding - a global producer of high-grade structural steel - knows that networking and personal contacts are essential for doing business .
that is why he has been attending the economic forum in the swiss skiing resort for 15 years . " there are indian entrepreneurs in my field who are buying shares in german forges and foundries , " großmann said .
" you get to know them here , you start talking to them and you ask them what it is that they really want : are interested in acquiring a production line in germany or do they just want to pull out the know-how and do everything in india ? " " you get to know these things much better after you 've met the people , " großmann said . rubbing shoulders with the leaders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel opened the five-day brainstorming session of political and economic leaders after german chancellor angela merkel officially opened the davos forum on wednesday , großmann met her unofficially , behind the scenes .
they spoke about energy supplies - a topic which is on everybody 's lips at davos . " the environmentally friendly production of renewable energy is always right , " said großmann .
" but what about the international consensus on nuclear energy ?
germany seems to be willing to go its own way there .
i strongly doubt that that would be appropriate for our basic industry . " the coalition of german socialist democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party under former chancellor gerhard schröder reached a ground-breaking agreement that all of germany 's nuclear power plants would be shut down by 2020 . " we 're happy , of course , about having access to cheap electricity through german nuclear power plants .
it would be sad , i think , if we could only get cheap electricity from abroad in the near future , " großmann said . bildunterschrift : davos is an ideal setting for high-level networking no fear of globalization with 9,000 employees , großmann 's steel empire made a turnover of 2,2 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.9 billion -rrb- and cashed in hefty profits in 2006 - all that in a field known for its fierce competition worldwide , massive mergers and rapid technological progress . in the face of globalization and new players from india and china , großmann remains confident . " we 've been the globalization champion and main winner of globalization for more than 40 years , " großmann said .
" we ca n't now , all of a sudden , when others are getting strong , say that we do n't want this anymore . " " furthermore , we 're interested in wealthy clients .
the richer our client countries are , the more stuff we sell them , especially cars and machines that germany makes lots of . " marco vollmar -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de at davos kick-off , merkel says no to protectionism in a wide-ranging speech at the world economic forum , german chancellor angela merkel on wednesday staunchly rejected protectionism as a solution to the economic and social challenges of globalization .

the company will also close production sites in the us and germany - reducing its manufacturing plants from 93 to 48 - as well as shut down research centers in japan and france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pfizer 's under pressure pfizer chief executive jeffrey kindler said the company needed to cut costs because it expected its profits to stagnate over the next two years and be roughly comparable to the $ 48.4 billion -lrb- 37 billion euros -rrb- it reported for 2006 .
analysts predict that profits will drop by almost 40 percent . " we are facing significant challenges in a profoundly changing business environment , " kindler said in a statement .
" i believe we must fundamentally change the way we run our company to meet these challenges . " boom time over for pfizer ? things were n't always this way for pfizer .
the drug giant can look back on an illustrious past .
the company has long been considered a shining model of a successful multinational . founded by german chemist karl pfizer in new york in 1849 , the company became the world leader , especially in " blockbuster " drugs , which refers to medicines that rake in earnings worth over a billion dollars a year . in its heyday , the company 's product palette was largely associated with superlatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pfizer created a sensation with viagra pfizer created the world 's most famous pill , the erectile dysfunction drug viagra .

over the next few years , patent protection for a number of its drugs - which once earned pfizer billions - is set to expire .
that means that pfizer will then lose its monopoly , usually set for a period of 20 years , over producing those drugs - much to the joy of makers of generic medicines . pfizer has been suffering from the loss of patent protection on key drugs like the antidepressant zoloft and the antibiotic zithromax .
sales of both drugs plunged more than 70 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006 , the company said . the company 's problems are compounded by the fact that pfizer 's labs have not produced a single hit despite an annual research budget of $ 7 billion . even viagra , pfizer 's last big success , is almost a decade old .

" the widely predicted deterioration in the consumer climate at the start of the new year has kicked in , " gfk found . " the tax shock and the anticipatory purchases in december had led to a drastic decline in consumers ' willingness to spend this month , " it explained . putting the breaks on household spending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the effects of the vat hike are beginning to be felt all over germany the german government raised sales tax by three full percentage points to 19 percent with effect from jan .
1 , in a move experts said would put the brakes on household spending and therefore on the economy as a whole . the sharp vat hike is now also hitting business confidence , the more important ifo business climate index showed . after topping a 16-year high in december , index fell surprisingly this month .
analysts had been penciling in a steady to slightly higher reading in january . but even after the decline , business confidence in germany remains at its second-highest level since january 1991 and the current upturn is not in jeopardy , ifo president hans-werner sinn said . " companies still reported a very positive current business situation , even if it was not quite so favorable as in the previous month , " sinn said . a good outlook bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup last summer gave an important boost to germany 's economic revival furthermore , companies were more confident with regard to the outlook for the next six months . " this indicates that after a brief pause , the cyclical recovery will continue in the coming months , " sinn said . gfk similarly predicted that the dip in consumer sentiment this month would prove only temporary .
income expectations were less pessimistic and economic expectations were continuing to develop positively , gfk noted . the government insisted that the fundamental upwards trend in the german economy was still intact . " the dampening effects on private consumption will be overcome quickly , " the economy ministry said in a statement .
" household spending would pick up again during the course of the year and contribute to overall growth . " an unbroken uptrend bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer confidence fell sharply in january analysts , too , insisted that the uptrend in both the german and eurozone economies remained unbroken . " the -lrb- ifo -rrb- index remains well above the long-term average and is still pointing to above trend growth in the eurozone , " said bank of america economist matthew sharratt . " the january decline only represents a modest correction .
the data are consistent with our expectation that the german economic upswing is likely to take a breather in the first quarter of 2007 but will return to above-trend growth in the second half , " sharratt said . raising interest rates ? ixis economist sylvain broyer said the latest ifo and gfk confidence data , coupled with steady business confidence in france , pointed to a " marked air pocket in activity during the first half of this year , re-accelerating somewhat in the second half . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the europan central bank may increase its key interest rates with inflationary dangers still not completely banished , the european central bank will , according to broyer , " remain hawkish for a while . " nordlb analyst tobias basse similarly predicted that the ecb would " stick to its guns and raise its key interest rates by a quarter of percentage point in march . " the guardian of the euro last raised its benchmark " refi " refinancing rate to a five-year high of 3.50 percent in december , and is expected to continue tightening monetary conditions in the 13 countries that share the euro in the coming months . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wood could be german answer to soaring energy prices germany is one of europe 's most densely forested countries , and soaring oil and gas prices are leading more households to switch to modern wood-burning heating systems , germany 's forest owners ' association says .

" the widely predicted deterioration in the consumer climate at the start of the new year has kicked in , " gfk found . " the tax shock and the anticipatory purchases in december had led to a drastic decline in consumers ' willingness to spend this month , " it explained . putting the breaks on household spending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the effects of the vat hike are beginning to be felt all over germany the german government raised sales tax by three full percentage points to 19 percent with effect from jan .
1 , in a move experts said would put the brakes on household spending and therefore on the economy as a whole . the sharp vat hike is now also hitting business confidence , the more important ifo business climate index showed . after topping a 16-year high in december , index fell surprisingly this month .
analysts had been penciling in a steady to slightly higher reading in january . but even after the decline , business confidence in germany remains at its second-highest level since january 1991 and the current upturn is not in jeopardy , ifo president hans-werner sinn said . " companies still reported a very positive current business situation , even if it was not quite so favorable as in the previous month , " sinn said . a good outlook bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup last summer gave an important boost to germany 's economic revival furthermore , companies were more confident with regard to the outlook for the next six months . " this indicates that after a brief pause , the cyclical recovery will continue in the coming months , " sinn said . gfk similarly predicted that the dip in consumer sentiment this month would prove only temporary .
income expectations were less pessimistic and economic expectations were continuing to develop positively , gfk noted . the government insisted that the fundamental upwards trend in the german economy was still intact . " the dampening effects on private consumption will be overcome quickly , " the economy ministry said in a statement .
" household spending would pick up again during the course of the year and contribute to overall growth . " an unbroken uptrend bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer confidence fell sharply in january analysts , too , insisted that the uptrend in both the german and eurozone economies remained unbroken . " the -lrb- ifo -rrb- index remains well above the long-term average and is still pointing to above trend growth in the eurozone , " said bank of america economist matthew sharratt . " the january decline only represents a modest correction .
the data are consistent with our expectation that the german economic upswing is likely to take a breather in the first quarter of 2007 but will return to above-trend growth in the second half , " sharratt said . raising interest rates ? ixis economist sylvain broyer said the latest ifo and gfk confidence data , coupled with steady business confidence in france , pointed to a " marked air pocket in activity during the first half of this year , re-accelerating somewhat in the second half . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the europan central bank may increase its key interest rates with inflationary dangers still not completely banished , the european central bank will , according to broyer , " remain hawkish for a while . " nordlb analyst tobias basse similarly predicted that the ecb would " stick to its guns and raise its key interest rates by a quarter of percentage point in march . " the guardian of the euro last raised its benchmark " refi " refinancing rate to a five-year high of 3.50 percent in december , and is expected to continue tightening monetary conditions in the 13 countries that share the euro in the coming months . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wood could be german answer to soaring energy prices germany is one of europe 's most densely forested countries , and soaring oil and gas prices are leading more households to switch to modern wood-burning heating systems , germany 's forest owners ' association says .

" i find it personally extremely disturbing that these efforts were not sufficiently successful , " pierer said . with regard to the mobile phones business , which siemens sold to taiwan-based benq and which has subsequently collapsed , von pierer insisted that the german company had done everything that could be expected for the activities . the role of siemens in the collapse of benq mobile has been criticised , with critics saying the german company did not do enough to save the business . unlawful practice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens ' klaus kleinfeld wants to have the bribery scandal investigated and cleared up referring to the bribery scandal that has rocked the german engineering and electronics giant , von pierer 's successor , klaus kleinfeld , told around 9,000 shareholders that he was dismayed when he found out that a group of former and present employees had acted unlawfully .
" when i first heard of it , i was speechless , " kleinfeld said . at the heart of the bribery allegations are questionable payments totaling about 418 million euros -lrb- $ 543 million -rrb- , which are at present the subject of investigation launched by the munich-based siemens . " we are doing everything we can to get to the bottom of this incident , " kleinfeld said .
" there is no place for dubious business practices in our company . " claims about bribery at the company triggered police raids in november on company office and the homes of several former and present employees . on wednesday , the eu commission in brussels had slapped a 418-million-euro fine on siemens and its austrian subsidiary for alleged price-fixing by its power generation division .
siemens is appealing against the fine , but must nevertheless pay it initially . first-quarter results affected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu fine put a noticeable dent in siemens ' profits siemens ' annual shareholders meeting on thursday coincided with the publication of the group 's first-quarter results , which showed its bottom-line profits hit by the european commission fine . siemens , which runs its business from october to september , said in a statement that its net profit amounted to 788 million euros in the three months to december , down 16 percent from the year-earlier period . analysts had been penciling in net profit of around 973 million euros for the three-month period , but those forecasts did not take into account a one-off charge of 418 million euros booked at the last minute . a strong start , nonetheless bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens ' reputation may be tarnished by the bribery scandal underlying earnings improved in the october-december period , however , with operating profit jumping by 51 percent to 1.631 billion euros , boosted by the strong performances of the medical technology and automation divisions . first-quarter sales were up six percent at 19.068 billion euros and incoming orders rose by four percent to 24.582 billion euros . " in terms of our underlying performance , the first quarter got the fiscal year off to a strong start , " kleinfeld said . " while it is disappointing to see our net income growth reversed by an impact from events in the past , we are moving on with our operations tremendously improved year-over-year , " he said . looking ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens shareholders want to know the full story overnight , siemens announced that it had agreed to buy us software maker ugs for 3.5 billion dollars including debt . in addition , siemens would float its automotive supply business , siemens vdo automotive -lrb- sv -rrb- , on the stock exchange , with the parent company to hold on to a majority stake . " this move will give sv the necessary financial resources and greater entrepreneurial flexibility for ensuring further sustainable and profitable growth , " the company said in a statement . looking ahead , the group predicted that all divisions would attain the profitability targets they had set themselves for the second quarter , after some of the divisions failed to meet those targets in the first quarter . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu commission slaps huge fine on siemens for price fixing the eu has fined power equipment manufacturers for their roles in a price-fixing scheme .

" the lives of others " is an intense look at a committed east german secret police officer who gradually becomes disillusioned with the system he has worked to uphold , until he finally switches sides and tries to protect a woman he was assigned to spy on . the film was nominated for best foreign film at this year 's academy awards .
on wednesday , dw-world spoke with its director , florian henckel von donnersmarck . dw-world : congratulations on your film .
what was it like , hearing that you had been nominated for an oscar ? florian henckel von donnersmarck : i was very relieved , because i knew a lot of people were expecting it and hoping for it .
of course , the nomination was no longer dependent on me .
the battle that i am now getting recognition for is a battle i won two years ago .
but still , you naturally think you would have disappointed people if you were n't nominated . i 'm in france right now .
-lrb- on tuesday -rrb- i introduced my film at its premiere in toulouse .
and so of course the french opened up a big bottle of champagne , and immediately gave the printers instructions to make new posters with the words " nominated for the oscar , 2007 " on it . bildunterschrift : ulrich mühe plays a stasi agent whose life takes a surprising turn how has your film been received in france ? very well .
the french known an astonishing amount about the whole topic .
and they are putting a lot of energy behind the film ; there are 120 copies .
proportionally , that is approximately about as many as in germany , and of course i am very pleased , because the french are the opinion makers when it comes to international cinema .
for example when the french discovered the -lrb- austrian -rrb- director michael haneke , he suddenly became a very important director for us in germany . do german movies work well abroad ? even the most successful german films overseas are limited successes , compared with american movies .
for example , das boot -lrb- the boat -rrb- is the most successful german film in the usa .
it took in around 11 million dollars -lrb- xxxx -rrb- .
for an american film – even the littlest independent production – that would be considered a huge flop .
considering that , you ca n't really get your expectations too high .
but you reach a certain elite few who are open to culture , and that 's a good thing . but does your film work in terms of content ?
i mean , you have to know the historical background surrounding the story . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : florian henckel von donnersmarck you don ’ t really need to know german history so well in order to undsertand the film .
if so , i would have done something wrong , and the film would only be good for showing at universities .
i actually got the feeling that the americans are glad this film does n't just depict things in black and white .
i think right now the americans have the feeling that the current government 's painting everything black and white – like hwen it talks about the " axis of evil " – has n't been very helpful .
on the contrary .
and i think my film is a help , and that americans are more open for political-moral questions than they were five years ago or so . why is your film so successful ? my film talks about things that viewers around the world know and recognize .
along with the stasi -lrb- east german secret police -rrb- and the intelligence services , it is about overarching human questions : how does it feel when your private sphere is violated ?
how does it feel to deal with absolute power ?
how does it feel to be afraid ?
these are things that interest and touch everyone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mühe won best european actor 2006 for his role in the film how are you getting prepared for the oscars , which take place on feb .
25 ? of course , i 'm really excited , but i try to keep in mind that it is really out of my control , whether or not i win .
it depends on whether , and how , other people see my film , and i ca n't influence that .
people say it depends on propaganda , and how you campaign for it .
but that is n't true .
there are so many successful and important filmmakers on the panel , and they are n't influenced by who ran a bigger ad , or whether you gave an elegant speech somewhere .
they care about which films move them , and so i am just trying not to get too uptight about it . of course , it is totally clear to me that it would mean a big change in my life , if i won the oscar .
ask volker schlöndorff how it affected his life to win such a gigantic prize as the oscar so early in his career , for the 1980 filming of the tin drum .
this is really an unbelievably powerful statute . ina rottscheidt spoke with florian henckel von donnersmarck -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jewish filmmaker breaks taboos with hitler send-up both german and jewish sensitivities are to face a severe test next month with the launch of a comedy movie in german that turns nazi dictator adolf hitler into a clown with 90 minutes of juvenile jokes .

chirac opened the meeting with an appeal to help lebanon where " terrible confrontations have brought death and destruction . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aid given at the paris conference was at the high end of expectations " a very substantial and immediate financial support from the international community is absolutely indispensable , " he added . siniora also appealed for the international community 's help in solidifying lebanon 's economy after the summer 's war between hezbollah and israel .

" i find it personally extremely disturbing that these efforts were not sufficiently successful , " pierer said . with regard to the mobile phones business , which siemens sold to taiwan-based benq and which has subsequently collapsed , von pierer insisted that the german company had done everything that could be expected for the activities . the role of siemens in the collapse of benq mobile has been criticised , with critics saying the german company did not do enough to save the business . unlawful practice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens ' klaus kleinfeld wants to have the bribery scandal investigated and cleared up referring to the bribery scandal that has rocked the german engineering and electronics giant , von pierer 's successor , klaus kleinfeld , told around 9,000 shareholders that he was dismayed when he found out that a group of former and present employees had acted unlawfully .
" when i first heard of it , i was speechless , " kleinfeld said . at the heart of the bribery allegations are questionable payments totaling about 418 million euros -lrb- $ 543 million -rrb- , which are at present the subject of investigation launched by the munich-based siemens . " we are doing everything we can to get to the bottom of this incident , " kleinfeld said .
" there is no place for dubious business practices in our company . " claims about bribery at the company triggered police raids in november on company office and the homes of several former and present employees . on wednesday , the eu commission in brussels had slapped a 418-million-euro fine on siemens and its austrian subsidiary for alleged price-fixing by its power generation division .

" i find it personally extremely disturbing that these efforts were not sufficiently successful , " pierer said . with regard to the mobile phones business , which siemens sold to taiwan-based benq and which has subsequently collapsed , von pierer insisted that the german company had done everything that could be expected for the activities . the role of siemens in the collapse of benq mobile has been criticised , with critics saying the german company did not do enough to save the business . unlawful practice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens ' klaus kleinfeld wants to have the bribery scandal investigated and cleared up referring to the bribery scandal that has rocked the german engineering and electronics giant , von pierer 's successor , klaus kleinfeld , told around 9,000 shareholders that he was dismayed when he found out that a group of former and present employees had acted unlawfully .
" when i first heard of it , i was speechless , " kleinfeld said . at the heart of the bribery allegations are questionable payments totaling about 418 million euros -lrb- $ 543 million -rrb- , which are at present the subject of investigation launched by the munich-based siemens . " we are doing everything we can to get to the bottom of this incident , " kleinfeld said .
" there is no place for dubious business practices in our company . " claims about bribery at the company triggered police raids in november on company office and the homes of several former and present employees . on wednesday , the eu commission in brussels had slapped a 418-million-euro fine on siemens and its austrian subsidiary for alleged price-fixing by its power generation division .
siemens is appealing against the fine , but must nevertheless pay it initially . first-quarter results affected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu fine put a noticeable dent in siemens ' profits siemens ' annual shareholders meeting on thursday coincided with the publication of the group 's first-quarter results , which showed its bottom-line profits hit by the european commission fine . siemens , which runs its business from october to september , said in a statement that its net profit amounted to 788 million euros in the three months to december , down 16 percent from the year-earlier period . analysts had been penciling in net profit of around 973 million euros for the three-month period , but those forecasts did not take into account a one-off charge of 418 million euros booked at the last minute . a strong start , nonetheless bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens ' reputation may be tarnished by the bribery scandal underlying earnings improved in the october-december period , however , with operating profit jumping by 51 percent to 1.631 billion euros , boosted by the strong performances of the medical technology and automation divisions . first-quarter sales were up six percent at 19.068 billion euros and incoming orders rose by four percent to 24.582 billion euros . " in terms of our underlying performance , the first quarter got the fiscal year off to a strong start , " kleinfeld said . " while it is disappointing to see our net income growth reversed by an impact from events in the past , we are moving on with our operations tremendously improved year-over-year , " he said . looking ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens shareholders want to know the full story overnight , siemens announced that it had agreed to buy us software maker ugs for 3.5 billion dollars including debt . in addition , siemens would float its automotive supply business , siemens vdo automotive -lrb- sv -rrb- , on the stock exchange , with the parent company to hold on to a majority stake . " this move will give sv the necessary financial resources and greater entrepreneurial flexibility for ensuring further sustainable and profitable growth , " the company said in a statement . looking ahead , the group predicted that all divisions would attain the profitability targets they had set themselves for the second quarter , after some of the divisions failed to meet those targets in the first quarter . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu commission slaps huge fine on siemens for price fixing the eu has fined power equipment manufacturers for their roles in a price-fixing scheme .

" the lives of others " is an intense look at a committed east german secret police officer who gradually becomes disillusioned with the system he has worked to uphold , until he finally switches sides and tries to protect a woman he was assigned to spy on . the film was nominated for best foreign film at this year 's academy awards .
on wednesday , dw-world spoke with its director , florian henckel von donnersmarck . dw-world : congratulations on your film .
what was it like , hearing that you had been nominated for an oscar ? florian henckel von donnersmarck : i was very relieved , because i knew a lot of people were expecting it and hoping for it .
of course , the nomination was no longer dependent on me .
the battle that i am now getting recognition for is a battle i won two years ago .
but still , you naturally think you would have disappointed people if you were n't nominated . i 'm in france right now .
-lrb- on tuesday -rrb- i introduced my film at its premiere in toulouse .
and so of course the french opened up a big bottle of champagne , and immediately gave the printers instructions to make new posters with the words " nominated for the oscar , 2007 " on it . bildunterschrift : ulrich mühe plays a stasi agent whose life takes a surprising turn how has your film been received in france ? very well .
the french known an astonishing amount about the whole topic .
and they are putting a lot of energy behind the film ; there are 120 copies .
proportionally , that is approximately about as many as in germany , and of course i am very pleased , because the french are the opinion makers when it comes to international cinema .
for example when the french discovered the -lrb- austrian -rrb- director michael haneke , he suddenly became a very important director for us in germany . do german movies work well abroad ? even the most successful german films overseas are limited successes , compared with american movies .
for example , das boot -lrb- the boat -rrb- is the most successful german film in the usa .
it took in around 11 million dollars -lrb- xxxx -rrb- .
for an american film – even the littlest independent production – that would be considered a huge flop .
considering that , you ca n't really get your expectations too high .
but you reach a certain elite few who are open to culture , and that 's a good thing . but does your film work in terms of content ?
i mean , you have to know the historical background surrounding the story . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : florian henckel von donnersmarck you don ’ t really need to know german history so well in order to undsertand the film .
if so , i would have done something wrong , and the film would only be good for showing at universities .
i actually got the feeling that the americans are glad this film does n't just depict things in black and white .
i think right now the americans have the feeling that the current government 's painting everything black and white – like hwen it talks about the " axis of evil " – has n't been very helpful .
on the contrary .
and i think my film is a help , and that americans are more open for political-moral questions than they were five years ago or so . why is your film so successful ? my film talks about things that viewers around the world know and recognize .
along with the stasi -lrb- east german secret police -rrb- and the intelligence services , it is about overarching human questions : how does it feel when your private sphere is violated ?
how does it feel to deal with absolute power ?
how does it feel to be afraid ?
these are things that interest and touch everyone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mühe won best european actor 2006 for his role in the film how are you getting prepared for the oscars , which take place on feb .
25 ? of course , i 'm really excited , but i try to keep in mind that it is really out of my control , whether or not i win .
it depends on whether , and how , other people see my film , and i ca n't influence that .
people say it depends on propaganda , and how you campaign for it .
but that is n't true .
there are so many successful and important filmmakers on the panel , and they are n't influenced by who ran a bigger ad , or whether you gave an elegant speech somewhere .
they care about which films move them , and so i am just trying not to get too uptight about it . of course , it is totally clear to me that it would mean a big change in my life , if i won the oscar .
ask volker schlöndorff how it affected his life to win such a gigantic prize as the oscar so early in his career , for the 1980 filming of the tin drum .
this is really an unbelievably powerful statute . ina rottscheidt spoke with florian henckel von donnersmarck -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jewish filmmaker breaks taboos with hitler send-up both german and jewish sensitivities are to face a severe test next month with the launch of a comedy movie in german that turns nazi dictator adolf hitler into a clown with 90 minutes of juvenile jokes .

she said that abbas had welcomed the fact that the so-called mideast quartet of the us , russia , the un and the eu was to revive its efforts . merkel said her meeting with the palestinian leader would be followed by talks scheduled in early february in egypt and saudi arabia .
she said abbas had said he hope the peace process would now go forward again , one linked with a time frame . " we consider ourselves obliged to lead in a supportive manner , " merkel commented and said that the eu would support abbas ' aim to establish a government of national unity .

" the time has come for us ... to make peace a reality , " abbas said .
" the middle east is in dire need of peace .
it is up to us to trace the beginning and end of the peace process , the road map is there . " " we are ready , as of now , to start serious negotiations with our israeli neighbors , " he said during a discussion in which he and livni shared a stage with israeli deputy prime minister shimon peres .

the company will also close production sites in the us and germany - reducing its manufacturing plants from 93 to 48 - as well as shut down research centers in japan and france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pfizer 's under pressure pfizer chief executive jeffrey kindler said the company needed to cut costs because it expected its profits to stagnate over the next two years and be roughly comparable to the $ 48.4 billion -lrb- 37 billion euros -rrb- it reported for 2006 .
analysts predict that profits will drop by almost 40 percent . " we are facing significant challenges in a profoundly changing business environment , " kindler said in a statement .
" i believe we must fundamentally change the way we run our company to meet these challenges . " boom time over for pfizer ? things were n't always this way for pfizer .
the drug giant can look back on an illustrious past .
the company has long been considered a shining model of a successful multinational . founded by german chemist karl pfizer in new york in 1849 , the company became the world leader , especially in " blockbuster " drugs , which refers to medicines that rake in earnings worth over a billion dollars a year . in its heyday , the company 's product palette was largely associated with superlatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pfizer created a sensation with viagra pfizer created the world 's most famous pill , the erectile dysfunction drug viagra .
its number one drug , lipitor , which is used to lower blood cholesterol , is the world 's most lucrative pill . in 2004 , pfizer had a yearly turnover of $ 52.52 billion , the world 's biggest research and development budget and a 38,000-strong sales army . no new blockbuster drugs in sight but that golden age is past .
over the next few years , patent protection for a number of its drugs - which once earned pfizer billions - is set to expire .
that means that pfizer will then lose its monopoly , usually set for a period of 20 years , over producing those drugs - much to the joy of makers of generic medicines . pfizer has been suffering from the loss of patent protection on key drugs like the antidepressant zoloft and the antibiotic zithromax .
sales of both drugs plunged more than 70 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006 , the company said . the company 's problems are compounded by the fact that pfizer 's labs have not produced a single hit despite an annual research budget of $ 7 billion . even viagra , pfizer 's last big success , is almost a decade old .
in december , pfizer had to stop development of torcetrapib , a promising cardiovascular drug , because of dangerous side-effects .
torcetrapib was meant to bring pfizer $ 10 billion yearly . cut-throat competition pfizer 's problems are n't new in the pharmaceutical industry .
competition from makers of generic drugs remains a problem for most big drug companies .
but streamlining operations does n't seem to hold all the answers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : generic drugs are putting the squeeze on firms like pfizer pfizer 's current belt-tightening is the second time in two years that the drug giant has embarked on a serious cost-cutting strategy . many experts forecast a takeover war in the pharmaceutical industry , with big players forgoing producing new drugs and instead looking to buy innovative biotechnology competitors who could develop new medicines . markus preissner , head of the research division for drug distribution at the university of cologne , said that competition between the producers of original drugs and those of generic drugs was absolutely cut-throat . " if there are copycat products , the original drug is much more difficult to sell , " preissner said . compromising on quality preissner warned that the bargain-hunting mentality of consumers did n't augur well for the quality of future drugs . " when drugs do n't cost much , they ca n't be of high quality , " he said . tido von schön-angerer from the german chapter of aid organization doctors without borders said that hugely expensive product marketing was largely responsible for the high costs of original drugs .
thus , research and development often falls by the wayside as in the case of pfizer , von schön-angerer pointed out . " even patent protection is no guarantee for urgently needed innovation , " he said , adding that it was particularly true when it came to developing drugs for diseases in poor countries . andreas leixnering -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de second time around for discount pharmacy chain docmorris , the dutch discount pharmacy chain , has found a loophole to get around germany 's powerful lobby of pharmacists .

" he said that stepping up transparency on the one hand and introducing regulators to referee disputes on the other would create a " double system that should allow for fee costs to be moderate . " the european commission presented draft legislation to make airport charges more transparent and non-discriminatory . " everything we 've done here is designed to bring down the costs of airport fees and , hence , the costs of travelling by air for passengers , " transport commissioner jacques barrot told a news conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt 's airport fees are among the highest in europe the airport fees , which make up four to eight percent of airlines ' operating costs , are paid for take-offs and landings , parking , security and passenger handling .
the costs are passed on to passengers in fees that are added on to ticket prices . according to the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- , 15 of the 25 most expensive airports are in europe , with frankfurt and athens airports among the top .
paris ' charles de gaulle airport was singled out as being the worst offender for increasing its charges by 26.5 percent over five years . airlines are angry that airport fees have taken off in recent years while they have struggled to cut costs . independent regulator barrot said the independent regulator system was already in place and working in britain and that governments should not be handed the role because they " sometimes favor one company or might want to privatize an airport ... and to boost its revenues " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tickets might seem cheap , but beware the hidden charges the commission came up with its proposals only after " extremely thorough talks " with airport authorities and airlines , barrot stressed . the airlines argued that many european airports had substantially increased their charges in recent years , and while they themselves had continued to offer low cost flights in a cut-throat industry . the airports argue that the rising charges are forced on them by the need to adapt to accommodate increasing air traffic and meet new security requirements in the wake of the sept .

" he said that stepping up transparency on the one hand and introducing regulators to referee disputes on the other would create a " double system that should allow for fee costs to be moderate . " the european commission presented draft legislation to make airport charges more transparent and non-discriminatory . " everything we 've done here is designed to bring down the costs of airport fees and , hence , the costs of travelling by air for passengers , " transport commissioner jacques barrot told a news conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt 's airport fees are among the highest in europe the airport fees , which make up four to eight percent of airlines ' operating costs , are paid for take-offs and landings , parking , security and passenger handling .
the costs are passed on to passengers in fees that are added on to ticket prices . according to the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- , 15 of the 25 most expensive airports are in europe , with frankfurt and athens airports among the top .
paris ' charles de gaulle airport was singled out as being the worst offender for increasing its charges by 26.5 percent over five years . airlines are angry that airport fees have taken off in recent years while they have struggled to cut costs . independent regulator barrot said the independent regulator system was already in place and working in britain and that governments should not be handed the role because they " sometimes favor one company or might want to privatize an airport ... and to boost its revenues " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tickets might seem cheap , but beware the hidden charges the commission came up with its proposals only after " extremely thorough talks " with airport authorities and airlines , barrot stressed . the airlines argued that many european airports had substantially increased their charges in recent years , and while they themselves had continued to offer low cost flights in a cut-throat industry . the airports argue that the rising charges are forced on them by the need to adapt to accommodate increasing air traffic and meet new security requirements in the wake of the sept .

the company will also close production sites in the us and germany - reducing its manufacturing plants from 93 to 48 - as well as shut down research centers in japan and france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pfizer 's under pressure pfizer chief executive jeffrey kindler said the company needed to cut costs because it expected its profits to stagnate over the next two years and be roughly comparable to the $ 48.4 billion -lrb- 37 billion euros -rrb- it reported for 2006 .
analysts predict that profits will drop by almost 40 percent . " we are facing significant challenges in a profoundly changing business environment , " kindler said in a statement .
" i believe we must fundamentally change the way we run our company to meet these challenges . " boom time over for pfizer ? things were n't always this way for pfizer .
the drug giant can look back on an illustrious past .
the company has long been considered a shining model of a successful multinational . founded by german chemist karl pfizer in new york in 1849 , the company became the world leader , especially in " blockbuster " drugs , which refers to medicines that rake in earnings worth over a billion dollars a year . in its heyday , the company 's product palette was largely associated with superlatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pfizer created a sensation with viagra pfizer created the world 's most famous pill , the erectile dysfunction drug viagra .
its number one drug , lipitor , which is used to lower blood cholesterol , is the world 's most lucrative pill . in 2004 , pfizer had a yearly turnover of $ 52.52 billion , the world 's biggest research and development budget and a 38,000-strong sales army . no new blockbuster drugs in sight but that golden age is past .
over the next few years , patent protection for a number of its drugs - which once earned pfizer billions - is set to expire .
that means that pfizer will then lose its monopoly , usually set for a period of 20 years , over producing those drugs - much to the joy of makers of generic medicines . pfizer has been suffering from the loss of patent protection on key drugs like the antidepressant zoloft and the antibiotic zithromax .
sales of both drugs plunged more than 70 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006 , the company said . the company 's problems are compounded by the fact that pfizer 's labs have not produced a single hit despite an annual research budget of $ 7 billion . even viagra , pfizer 's last big success , is almost a decade old .
in december , pfizer had to stop development of torcetrapib , a promising cardiovascular drug , because of dangerous side-effects .
torcetrapib was meant to bring pfizer $ 10 billion yearly . cut-throat competition pfizer 's problems are n't new in the pharmaceutical industry .
competition from makers of generic drugs remains a problem for most big drug companies .
but streamlining operations does n't seem to hold all the answers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : generic drugs are putting the squeeze on firms like pfizer pfizer 's current belt-tightening is the second time in two years that the drug giant has embarked on a serious cost-cutting strategy . many experts forecast a takeover war in the pharmaceutical industry , with big players forgoing producing new drugs and instead looking to buy innovative biotechnology competitors who could develop new medicines . markus preissner , head of the research division for drug distribution at the university of cologne , said that competition between the producers of original drugs and those of generic drugs was absolutely cut-throat . " if there are copycat products , the original drug is much more difficult to sell , " preissner said . compromising on quality preissner warned that the bargain-hunting mentality of consumers did n't augur well for the quality of future drugs . " when drugs do n't cost much , they ca n't be of high quality , " he said . tido von schön-angerer from the german chapter of aid organization doctors without borders said that hugely expensive product marketing was largely responsible for the high costs of original drugs .
thus , research and development often falls by the wayside as in the case of pfizer , von schön-angerer pointed out . " even patent protection is no guarantee for urgently needed innovation , " he said , adding that it was particularly true when it came to developing drugs for diseases in poor countries . andreas leixnering -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de second time around for discount pharmacy chain docmorris , the dutch discount pharmacy chain , has found a loophole to get around germany 's powerful lobby of pharmacists .

the company will also close production sites in the us and germany - reducing its manufacturing plants from 93 to 48 - as well as shut down research centers in japan and france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pfizer 's under pressure pfizer chief executive jeffrey kindler said the company needed to cut costs because it expected its profits to stagnate over the next two years and be roughly comparable to the $ 48.4 billion -lrb- 37 billion euros -rrb- it reported for 2006 .
analysts predict that profits will drop by almost 40 percent . " we are facing significant challenges in a profoundly changing business environment , " kindler said in a statement .
" i believe we must fundamentally change the way we run our company to meet these challenges . " boom time over for pfizer ? things were n't always this way for pfizer .
the drug giant can look back on an illustrious past .
the company has long been considered a shining model of a successful multinational . founded by german chemist karl pfizer in new york in 1849 , the company became the world leader , especially in " blockbuster " drugs , which refers to medicines that rake in earnings worth over a billion dollars a year . in its heyday , the company 's product palette was largely associated with superlatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pfizer created a sensation with viagra pfizer created the world 's most famous pill , the erectile dysfunction drug viagra .
its number one drug , lipitor , which is used to lower blood cholesterol , is the world 's most lucrative pill . in 2004 , pfizer had a yearly turnover of $ 52.52 billion , the world 's biggest research and development budget and a 38,000-strong sales army . no new blockbuster drugs in sight but that golden age is past .
over the next few years , patent protection for a number of its drugs - which once earned pfizer billions - is set to expire .
that means that pfizer will then lose its monopoly , usually set for a period of 20 years , over producing those drugs - much to the joy of makers of generic medicines . pfizer has been suffering from the loss of patent protection on key drugs like the antidepressant zoloft and the antibiotic zithromax .
sales of both drugs plunged more than 70 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006 , the company said . the company 's problems are compounded by the fact that pfizer 's labs have not produced a single hit despite an annual research budget of $ 7 billion . even viagra , pfizer 's last big success , is almost a decade old .
in december , pfizer had to stop development of torcetrapib , a promising cardiovascular drug , because of dangerous side-effects .
torcetrapib was meant to bring pfizer $ 10 billion yearly . cut-throat competition pfizer 's problems are n't new in the pharmaceutical industry .
competition from makers of generic drugs remains a problem for most big drug companies .

" if there are copycat products , the original drug is much more difficult to sell , " preissner said . compromising on quality preissner warned that the bargain-hunting mentality of consumers did n't augur well for the quality of future drugs . " when drugs do n't cost much , they ca n't be of high quality , " he said . tido von schön-angerer from the german chapter of aid organization doctors without borders said that hugely expensive product marketing was largely responsible for the high costs of original drugs .
thus , research and development often falls by the wayside as in the case of pfizer , von schön-angerer pointed out .

the company will also close production sites in the us and germany - reducing its manufacturing plants from 93 to 48 - as well as shut down research centers in japan and france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pfizer 's under pressure pfizer chief executive jeffrey kindler said the company needed to cut costs because it expected its profits to stagnate over the next two years and be roughly comparable to the $ 48.4 billion -lrb- 37 billion euros -rrb- it reported for 2006 .
analysts predict that profits will drop by almost 40 percent . " we are facing significant challenges in a profoundly changing business environment , " kindler said in a statement .
" i believe we must fundamentally change the way we run our company to meet these challenges . " boom time over for pfizer ? things were n't always this way for pfizer .
the drug giant can look back on an illustrious past .
the company has long been considered a shining model of a successful multinational . founded by german chemist karl pfizer in new york in 1849 , the company became the world leader , especially in " blockbuster " drugs , which refers to medicines that rake in earnings worth over a billion dollars a year . in its heyday , the company 's product palette was largely associated with superlatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pfizer created a sensation with viagra pfizer created the world 's most famous pill , the erectile dysfunction drug viagra .
its number one drug , lipitor , which is used to lower blood cholesterol , is the world 's most lucrative pill . in 2004 , pfizer had a yearly turnover of $ 52.52 billion , the world 's biggest research and development budget and a 38,000-strong sales army . no new blockbuster drugs in sight but that golden age is past .
over the next few years , patent protection for a number of its drugs - which once earned pfizer billions - is set to expire .
that means that pfizer will then lose its monopoly , usually set for a period of 20 years , over producing those drugs - much to the joy of makers of generic medicines . pfizer has been suffering from the loss of patent protection on key drugs like the antidepressant zoloft and the antibiotic zithromax .
sales of both drugs plunged more than 70 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006 , the company said . the company 's problems are compounded by the fact that pfizer 's labs have not produced a single hit despite an annual research budget of $ 7 billion . even viagra , pfizer 's last big success , is almost a decade old .
in december , pfizer had to stop development of torcetrapib , a promising cardiovascular drug , because of dangerous side-effects .
torcetrapib was meant to bring pfizer $ 10 billion yearly . cut-throat competition pfizer 's problems are n't new in the pharmaceutical industry .
competition from makers of generic drugs remains a problem for most big drug companies .
but streamlining operations does n't seem to hold all the answers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : generic drugs are putting the squeeze on firms like pfizer pfizer 's current belt-tightening is the second time in two years that the drug giant has embarked on a serious cost-cutting strategy . many experts forecast a takeover war in the pharmaceutical industry , with big players forgoing producing new drugs and instead looking to buy innovative biotechnology competitors who could develop new medicines . markus preissner , head of the research division for drug distribution at the university of cologne , said that competition between the producers of original drugs and those of generic drugs was absolutely cut-throat . " if there are copycat products , the original drug is much more difficult to sell , " preissner said . compromising on quality preissner warned that the bargain-hunting mentality of consumers did n't augur well for the quality of future drugs . " when drugs do n't cost much , they ca n't be of high quality , " he said . tido von schön-angerer from the german chapter of aid organization doctors without borders said that hugely expensive product marketing was largely responsible for the high costs of original drugs .
thus , research and development often falls by the wayside as in the case of pfizer , von schön-angerer pointed out . " even patent protection is no guarantee for urgently needed innovation , " he said , adding that it was particularly true when it came to developing drugs for diseases in poor countries . andreas leixnering -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de second time around for discount pharmacy chain docmorris , the dutch discount pharmacy chain , has found a loophole to get around germany 's powerful lobby of pharmacists .

over the years , both the magazine and its mediagenic founder , alice schwarzer , have spent a fair share of time in the spotlight . the first issue of emma went on sale at newsstands on jan .
26 , 1977 .
the magazine , written " by women , for women , " is inextricably tied to the name and image of alice schwarzer , germany 's best-known feminist . by founding emma - to german ears , the name unmistakably evokes the word of " emancipation " - the well-known journalist provided a nation in the throes of feminist activism with a popular forum for discussing staple women 's issues .

" key to success : schwarzer " lively and open " may be putting it mildly .
exploiting an uncanny knack for publicity , schwarzer - the magazine 's publisher , editor and driving force - has seen to it that the magazine and its topics have never strayed far from the german media spotlight . " alice schwarzer was already germany 's best-known women 's rights activists before she began publishing emma , " said dr. alexandra kühte , who published her dissertation on the image of women in emma two years ago .

" it took on emotionally important and polarizing themes and was very dogmatic about it . " indeed , both schwarzer and her magazine have made headlines over the years .
in 1978 , she and nine other women sued the weekly magazine stern for its sexist cover shots -lrb- she lost -rrb- .
in 1978 , the magazine also broke a taboo by reporting on sexual abuse , and in the early 1980s it was the first to push the topic of eating disorders out of the home and into the headlines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : images of women in the media have long been a topic for emma in 2000 , the magazine , which had long agitated for equal rights in the military , celebrated the first woman bundeswehr soldier . in the last election cycle , emma threw its weight behind conservative candidate angela merkel - not for her politics , but for her gender .
germany now has its first madam chancellor . " from the very beginning , we promoted the notion of role models , " schwarzer said . after 30 years of publishing , what does the future hold for emma ?

over the years , both the magazine and its mediagenic founder , alice schwarzer , have spent a fair share of time in the spotlight . the first issue of emma went on sale at newsstands on jan .
26 , 1977 .
the magazine , written " by women , for women , " is inextricably tied to the name and image of alice schwarzer , germany 's best-known feminist . by founding emma - to german ears , the name unmistakably evokes the word of " emancipation " - the well-known journalist provided a nation in the throes of feminist activism with a popular forum for discussing staple women 's issues .
abortion , equal rights , pornography and prostitution were all early fodder for the monthly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the magazine supported angela merkel in her run for office " emma was born in the classic political agitation of the 1970s , " schwarzer said , " … and it has managed to develop in a lively and open fashion over the past 30 years . " key to success : schwarzer " lively and open " may be putting it mildly .
exploiting an uncanny knack for publicity , schwarzer - the magazine 's publisher , editor and driving force - has seen to it that the magazine and its topics have never strayed far from the german media spotlight . " alice schwarzer was already germany 's best-known women 's rights activists before she began publishing emma , " said dr. alexandra kühte , who published her dissertation on the image of women in emma two years ago . " the magazine allowed her to take these topics from the women 's movement to a broad public .
but the importance of emma is completely tied to its founder .
if she was n't so prominent , the magazine would n't be so successful , " kühte said . high impact but despite - or perhaps because of - its being so fully tied to one prominent person , emma 's influence on german society has been widely felt over the years .
some of the hotter topics of the late 1970s - women 's rights , women 's status in the catholic church - have cooled down , to be replaced by issues like eating disorders , genital mutilation and islam 's treatment of women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first issue of emma , in 1977 others issues , like prostitution and pornography -lrb- the magazine led a famed " porno " campaign for years , -rrb- remain " constant topics " according to kühte . anyone seeking objective journalism would do well to stay away from emma .
the magazine avoids dry , theoretical discussion and instead infuses its articles with an opinionated , and decidedly activist , stance . of sex abuse , " porno " and equal pay emma has kept women 's issues at the center of debate because it " was always provocative , it did n't try to fit in with social norms , " kühte said .
" it took on emotionally important and polarizing themes and was very dogmatic about it . " indeed , both schwarzer and her magazine have made headlines over the years .
in 1978 , she and nine other women sued the weekly magazine stern for its sexist cover shots -lrb- she lost -rrb- .
in 1978 , the magazine also broke a taboo by reporting on sexual abuse , and in the early 1980s it was the first to push the topic of eating disorders out of the home and into the headlines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : images of women in the media have long been a topic for emma in 2000 , the magazine , which had long agitated for equal rights in the military , celebrated the first woman bundeswehr soldier . in the last election cycle , emma threw its weight behind conservative candidate angela merkel - not for her politics , but for her gender .
germany now has its first madam chancellor . " from the very beginning , we promoted the notion of role models , " schwarzer said . after 30 years of publishing , what does the future hold for emma ?
schwarzer aims to continue , and there has been joking talk of finding a replacement editor .
but many people in germany share the opinion of kühte , who says : " emma without alice schwarzer is unimaginable .

" the widely predicted deterioration in the consumer climate at the start of the new year has kicked in , " gfk found . " the tax shock and the anticipatory purchases in december had led to a drastic decline in consumers ' willingness to spend this month , " it explained . putting the breaks on household spending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the effects of the vat hike are beginning to be felt all over germany the german government raised sales tax by three full percentage points to 19 percent with effect from jan .
1 , in a move experts said would put the brakes on household spending and therefore on the economy as a whole . the sharp vat hike is now also hitting business confidence , the more important ifo business climate index showed . after topping a 16-year high in december , index fell surprisingly this month .
analysts had been penciling in a steady to slightly higher reading in january . but even after the decline , business confidence in germany remains at its second-highest level since january 1991 and the current upturn is not in jeopardy , ifo president hans-werner sinn said . " companies still reported a very positive current business situation , even if it was not quite so favorable as in the previous month , " sinn said . a good outlook bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup last summer gave an important boost to germany 's economic revival furthermore , companies were more confident with regard to the outlook for the next six months . " this indicates that after a brief pause , the cyclical recovery will continue in the coming months , " sinn said . gfk similarly predicted that the dip in consumer sentiment this month would prove only temporary .
income expectations were less pessimistic and economic expectations were continuing to develop positively , gfk noted . the government insisted that the fundamental upwards trend in the german economy was still intact . " the dampening effects on private consumption will be overcome quickly , " the economy ministry said in a statement .
" household spending would pick up again during the course of the year and contribute to overall growth . " an unbroken uptrend bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer confidence fell sharply in january analysts , too , insisted that the uptrend in both the german and eurozone economies remained unbroken . " the -lrb- ifo -rrb- index remains well above the long-term average and is still pointing to above trend growth in the eurozone , " said bank of america economist matthew sharratt . " the january decline only represents a modest correction .
the data are consistent with our expectation that the german economic upswing is likely to take a breather in the first quarter of 2007 but will return to above-trend growth in the second half , " sharratt said . raising interest rates ? ixis economist sylvain broyer said the latest ifo and gfk confidence data , coupled with steady business confidence in france , pointed to a " marked air pocket in activity during the first half of this year , re-accelerating somewhat in the second half . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the europan central bank may increase its key interest rates with inflationary dangers still not completely banished , the european central bank will , according to broyer , " remain hawkish for a while . " nordlb analyst tobias basse similarly predicted that the ecb would " stick to its guns and raise its key interest rates by a quarter of percentage point in march .

" the lives of others " is an intense look at a committed east german secret police officer who gradually becomes disillusioned with the system he has worked to uphold , until he finally switches sides and tries to protect a woman he was assigned to spy on . the film was nominated for best foreign film at this year 's academy awards .
on wednesday , dw-world spoke with its director , florian henckel von donnersmarck . dw-world : congratulations on your film .
what was it like , hearing that you had been nominated for an oscar ? florian henckel von donnersmarck : i was very relieved , because i knew a lot of people were expecting it and hoping for it .
of course , the nomination was no longer dependent on me .
the battle that i am now getting recognition for is a battle i won two years ago .
but still , you naturally think you would have disappointed people if you were n't nominated . i 'm in france right now .
-lrb- on tuesday -rrb- i introduced my film at its premiere in toulouse .
and so of course the french opened up a big bottle of champagne , and immediately gave the printers instructions to make new posters with the words " nominated for the oscar , 2007 " on it . bildunterschrift : ulrich mühe plays a stasi agent whose life takes a surprising turn how has your film been received in france ? very well .
the french known an astonishing amount about the whole topic .
and they are putting a lot of energy behind the film ; there are 120 copies .
proportionally , that is approximately about as many as in germany , and of course i am very pleased , because the french are the opinion makers when it comes to international cinema .
for example when the french discovered the -lrb- austrian -rrb- director michael haneke , he suddenly became a very important director for us in germany . do german movies work well abroad ? even the most successful german films overseas are limited successes , compared with american movies .
for example , das boot -lrb- the boat -rrb- is the most successful german film in the usa .
it took in around 11 million dollars -lrb- xxxx -rrb- .
for an american film – even the littlest independent production – that would be considered a huge flop .
considering that , you ca n't really get your expectations too high .
but you reach a certain elite few who are open to culture , and that 's a good thing . but does your film work in terms of content ?
i mean , you have to know the historical background surrounding the story . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : florian henckel von donnersmarck you don ’ t really need to know german history so well in order to undsertand the film .
if so , i would have done something wrong , and the film would only be good for showing at universities .
i actually got the feeling that the americans are glad this film does n't just depict things in black and white .
i think right now the americans have the feeling that the current government 's painting everything black and white – like hwen it talks about the " axis of evil " – has n't been very helpful .
on the contrary .
and i think my film is a help , and that americans are more open for political-moral questions than they were five years ago or so . why is your film so successful ? my film talks about things that viewers around the world know and recognize .
along with the stasi -lrb- east german secret police -rrb- and the intelligence services , it is about overarching human questions : how does it feel when your private sphere is violated ?
how does it feel to deal with absolute power ?
how does it feel to be afraid ?
these are things that interest and touch everyone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mühe won best european actor 2006 for his role in the film how are you getting prepared for the oscars , which take place on feb .
25 ? of course , i 'm really excited , but i try to keep in mind that it is really out of my control , whether or not i win .
it depends on whether , and how , other people see my film , and i ca n't influence that .
people say it depends on propaganda , and how you campaign for it .
but that is n't true .
there are so many successful and important filmmakers on the panel , and they are n't influenced by who ran a bigger ad , or whether you gave an elegant speech somewhere .
they care about which films move them , and so i am just trying not to get too uptight about it . of course , it is totally clear to me that it would mean a big change in my life , if i won the oscar .
ask volker schlöndorff how it affected his life to win such a gigantic prize as the oscar so early in his career , for the 1980 filming of the tin drum .
this is really an unbelievably powerful statute . ina rottscheidt spoke with florian henckel von donnersmarck -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jewish filmmaker breaks taboos with hitler send-up both german and jewish sensitivities are to face a severe test next month with the launch of a comedy movie in german that turns nazi dictator adolf hitler into a clown with 90 minutes of juvenile jokes .

" this is our signal of commitment to lebanon and to the peace process in the middle east , " barroso told a news conference . the commission said that the eu package included 300 million euros in assistance for socio-economic and political reforms , the economic recovery of lebanon , de-mining activities and palestinian refugees in lebanon .
an additional 100 million euros will be given to lebanon in grants and loans , commission officials said . the eu aid package is designed to cover the period until 2010 and will concentrate on help for fiscal reform and public finance management , better conditions for private business , job creation and social development . help to recover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parts of beirut were severely damaged during the war the commission said the eu wanted to help lebanon cover the costs of last summer 's war between lebanese shiite militia group hezbollah and israel , which crippled the economy . however , the eu was also seeking to lay the groundwork for a longer term recovery through support for crucial political and economic reforms .

dw 's reporter marco vollmar spoke to one of its participants , german steel magnate jürgen großman . " the spirit of davos does n't just float around , " said german steel baron jürgen großmann .
" you have to look for it in the conversations . " jürgen großmann is one of the 2,500 participants in the davos world economic forum , together with 800 corporate chief executives or chairmen , 24 heads of state or government and 85 cabinet ministers .
großman , who is the managing partner of georgsmarienhütte holding - a global producer of high-grade structural steel - knows that networking and personal contacts are essential for doing business .
that is why he has been attending the economic forum in the swiss skiing resort for 15 years . " there are indian entrepreneurs in my field who are buying shares in german forges and foundries , " großmann said .
" you get to know them here , you start talking to them and you ask them what it is that they really want : are interested in acquiring a production line in germany or do they just want to pull out the know-how and do everything in india ? " " you get to know these things much better after you 've met the people , " großmann said . rubbing shoulders with the leaders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel opened the five-day brainstorming session of political and economic leaders after german chancellor angela merkel officially opened the davos forum on wednesday , großmann met her unofficially , behind the scenes .
they spoke about energy supplies - a topic which is on everybody 's lips at davos . " the environmentally friendly production of renewable energy is always right , " said großmann .
" but what about the international consensus on nuclear energy ?
germany seems to be willing to go its own way there .
i strongly doubt that that would be appropriate for our basic industry . " the coalition of german socialist democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party under former chancellor gerhard schröder reached a ground-breaking agreement that all of germany 's nuclear power plants would be shut down by 2020 . " we 're happy , of course , about having access to cheap electricity through german nuclear power plants .
it would be sad , i think , if we could only get cheap electricity from abroad in the near future , " großmann said . bildunterschrift : davos is an ideal setting for high-level networking no fear of globalization with 9,000 employees , großmann 's steel empire made a turnover of 2,2 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.9 billion -rrb- and cashed in hefty profits in 2006 - all that in a field known for its fierce competition worldwide , massive mergers and rapid technological progress . in the face of globalization and new players from india and china , großmann remains confident . " we 've been the globalization champion and main winner of globalization for more than 40 years , " großmann said .
" we ca n't now , all of a sudden , when others are getting strong , say that we do n't want this anymore . " " furthermore , we 're interested in wealthy clients .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 25.01.2007 happy birthday , emma : german feminist magazine turns 30 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwarzer : master of publicity , fighter for a cause germany 's feminist flagship magazine , emma , will turn 30 this weekend .
over the years , both the magazine and its mediagenic founder , alice schwarzer , have spent a fair share of time in the spotlight . the first issue of emma went on sale at newsstands on jan .
26 , 1977 .
the magazine , written " by women , for women , " is inextricably tied to the name and image of alice schwarzer , germany 's best-known feminist . by founding emma - to german ears , the name unmistakably evokes the word of " emancipation " - the well-known journalist provided a nation in the throes of feminist activism with a popular forum for discussing staple women 's issues .
abortion , equal rights , pornography and prostitution were all early fodder for the monthly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the magazine supported angela merkel in her run for office " emma was born in the classic political agitation of the 1970s , " schwarzer said , " … and it has managed to develop in a lively and open fashion over the past 30 years . " key to success : schwarzer " lively and open " may be putting it mildly .
exploiting an uncanny knack for publicity , schwarzer - the magazine 's publisher , editor and driving force - has seen to it that the magazine and its topics have never strayed far from the german media spotlight . " alice schwarzer was already germany 's best-known women 's rights activists before she began publishing emma , " said dr. alexandra kühte , who published her dissertation on the image of women in emma two years ago . " the magazine allowed her to take these topics from the women 's movement to a broad public .
but the importance of emma is completely tied to its founder .
if she was n't so prominent , the magazine would n't be so successful , " kühte said . high impact but despite - or perhaps because of - its being so fully tied to one prominent person , emma 's influence on german society has been widely felt over the years .
some of the hotter topics of the late 1970s - women 's rights , women 's status in the catholic church - have cooled down , to be replaced by issues like eating disorders , genital mutilation and islam 's treatment of women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first issue of emma , in 1977 others issues , like prostitution and pornography -lrb- the magazine led a famed " porno " campaign for years , -rrb- remain " constant topics " according to kühte . anyone seeking objective journalism would do well to stay away from emma .
the magazine avoids dry , theoretical discussion and instead infuses its articles with an opinionated , and decidedly activist , stance . of sex abuse , " porno " and equal pay emma has kept women 's issues at the center of debate because it " was always provocative , it did n't try to fit in with social norms , " kühte said .
" it took on emotionally important and polarizing themes and was very dogmatic about it . " indeed , both schwarzer and her magazine have made headlines over the years .
in 1978 , she and nine other women sued the weekly magazine stern for its sexist cover shots -lrb- she lost -rrb- .
in 1978 , the magazine also broke a taboo by reporting on sexual abuse , and in the early 1980s it was the first to push the topic of eating disorders out of the home and into the headlines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : images of women in the media have long been a topic for emma in 2000 , the magazine , which had long agitated for equal rights in the military , celebrated the first woman bundeswehr soldier . in the last election cycle , emma threw its weight behind conservative candidate angela merkel - not for her politics , but for her gender .
germany now has its first madam chancellor . " from the very beginning , we promoted the notion of role models , " schwarzer said . after 30 years of publishing , what does the future hold for emma ?

over the years , both the magazine and its mediagenic founder , alice schwarzer , have spent a fair share of time in the spotlight . the first issue of emma went on sale at newsstands on jan .
26 , 1977 .
the magazine , written " by women , for women , " is inextricably tied to the name and image of alice schwarzer , germany 's best-known feminist . by founding emma - to german ears , the name unmistakably evokes the word of " emancipation " - the well-known journalist provided a nation in the throes of feminist activism with a popular forum for discussing staple women 's issues .
abortion , equal rights , pornography and prostitution were all early fodder for the monthly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the magazine supported angela merkel in her run for office " emma was born in the classic political agitation of the 1970s , " schwarzer said , " … and it has managed to develop in a lively and open fashion over the past 30 years . " key to success : schwarzer " lively and open " may be putting it mildly .
exploiting an uncanny knack for publicity , schwarzer - the magazine 's publisher , editor and driving force - has seen to it that the magazine and its topics have never strayed far from the german media spotlight . " alice schwarzer was already germany 's best-known women 's rights activists before she began publishing emma , " said dr. alexandra kühte , who published her dissertation on the image of women in emma two years ago . " the magazine allowed her to take these topics from the women 's movement to a broad public .
but the importance of emma is completely tied to its founder .
if she was n't so prominent , the magazine would n't be so successful , " kühte said . high impact but despite - or perhaps because of - its being so fully tied to one prominent person , emma 's influence on german society has been widely felt over the years .
some of the hotter topics of the late 1970s - women 's rights , women 's status in the catholic church - have cooled down , to be replaced by issues like eating disorders , genital mutilation and islam 's treatment of women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first issue of emma , in 1977 others issues , like prostitution and pornography -lrb- the magazine led a famed " porno " campaign for years , -rrb- remain " constant topics " according to kühte . anyone seeking objective journalism would do well to stay away from emma .
the magazine avoids dry , theoretical discussion and instead infuses its articles with an opinionated , and decidedly activist , stance . of sex abuse , " porno " and equal pay emma has kept women 's issues at the center of debate because it " was always provocative , it did n't try to fit in with social norms , " kühte said .
" it took on emotionally important and polarizing themes and was very dogmatic about it . " indeed , both schwarzer and her magazine have made headlines over the years .
in 1978 , she and nine other women sued the weekly magazine stern for its sexist cover shots -lrb- she lost -rrb- .
in 1978 , the magazine also broke a taboo by reporting on sexual abuse , and in the early 1980s it was the first to push the topic of eating disorders out of the home and into the headlines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : images of women in the media have long been a topic for emma in 2000 , the magazine , which had long agitated for equal rights in the military , celebrated the first woman bundeswehr soldier . in the last election cycle , emma threw its weight behind conservative candidate angela merkel - not for her politics , but for her gender .

" the lives of others " is an intense look at a committed east german secret police officer who gradually becomes disillusioned with the system he has worked to uphold , until he finally switches sides and tries to protect a woman he was assigned to spy on . the film was nominated for best foreign film at this year 's academy awards .
on wednesday , dw-world spoke with its director , florian henckel von donnersmarck . dw-world : congratulations on your film .
what was it like , hearing that you had been nominated for an oscar ? florian henckel von donnersmarck : i was very relieved , because i knew a lot of people were expecting it and hoping for it .
of course , the nomination was no longer dependent on me .
the battle that i am now getting recognition for is a battle i won two years ago .
but still , you naturally think you would have disappointed people if you were n't nominated . i 'm in france right now .
-lrb- on tuesday -rrb- i introduced my film at its premiere in toulouse .
and so of course the french opened up a big bottle of champagne , and immediately gave the printers instructions to make new posters with the words " nominated for the oscar , 2007 " on it . bildunterschrift : ulrich mühe plays a stasi agent whose life takes a surprising turn how has your film been received in france ? very well .
the french known an astonishing amount about the whole topic .
and they are putting a lot of energy behind the film ; there are 120 copies .
proportionally , that is approximately about as many as in germany , and of course i am very pleased , because the french are the opinion makers when it comes to international cinema .
for example when the french discovered the -lrb- austrian -rrb- director michael haneke , he suddenly became a very important director for us in germany . do german movies work well abroad ? even the most successful german films overseas are limited successes , compared with american movies .
for example , das boot -lrb- the boat -rrb- is the most successful german film in the usa .
it took in around 11 million dollars -lrb- xxxx -rrb- .
for an american film – even the littlest independent production – that would be considered a huge flop .
considering that , you ca n't really get your expectations too high .
but you reach a certain elite few who are open to culture , and that 's a good thing . but does your film work in terms of content ?
i mean , you have to know the historical background surrounding the story . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : florian henckel von donnersmarck you don ’ t really need to know german history so well in order to undsertand the film .
if so , i would have done something wrong , and the film would only be good for showing at universities .
i actually got the feeling that the americans are glad this film does n't just depict things in black and white .
i think right now the americans have the feeling that the current government 's painting everything black and white – like hwen it talks about the " axis of evil " – has n't been very helpful .
on the contrary .
and i think my film is a help , and that americans are more open for political-moral questions than they were five years ago or so . why is your film so successful ? my film talks about things that viewers around the world know and recognize .
along with the stasi -lrb- east german secret police -rrb- and the intelligence services , it is about overarching human questions : how does it feel when your private sphere is violated ?
how does it feel to deal with absolute power ?
how does it feel to be afraid ?
these are things that interest and touch everyone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mühe won best european actor 2006 for his role in the film how are you getting prepared for the oscars , which take place on feb .
25 ? of course , i 'm really excited , but i try to keep in mind that it is really out of my control , whether or not i win .
it depends on whether , and how , other people see my film , and i ca n't influence that .
people say it depends on propaganda , and how you campaign for it .
but that is n't true .
there are so many successful and important filmmakers on the panel , and they are n't influenced by who ran a bigger ad , or whether you gave an elegant speech somewhere .
they care about which films move them , and so i am just trying not to get too uptight about it . of course , it is totally clear to me that it would mean a big change in my life , if i won the oscar .
ask volker schlöndorff how it affected his life to win such a gigantic prize as the oscar so early in his career , for the 1980 filming of the tin drum .
this is really an unbelievably powerful statute . ina rottscheidt spoke with florian henckel von donnersmarck -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jewish filmmaker breaks taboos with hitler send-up both german and jewish sensitivities are to face a severe test next month with the launch of a comedy movie in german that turns nazi dictator adolf hitler into a clown with 90 minutes of juvenile jokes .

" the widely predicted deterioration in the consumer climate at the start of the new year has kicked in , " gfk found . " the tax shock and the anticipatory purchases in december had led to a drastic decline in consumers ' willingness to spend this month , " it explained . putting the breaks on household spending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the effects of the vat hike are beginning to be felt all over germany the german government raised sales tax by three full percentage points to 19 percent with effect from jan .
1 , in a move experts said would put the brakes on household spending and therefore on the economy as a whole . the sharp vat hike is now also hitting business confidence , the more important ifo business climate index showed . after topping a 16-year high in december , index fell surprisingly this month .
analysts had been penciling in a steady to slightly higher reading in january . but even after the decline , business confidence in germany remains at its second-highest level since january 1991 and the current upturn is not in jeopardy , ifo president hans-werner sinn said . " companies still reported a very positive current business situation , even if it was not quite so favorable as in the previous month , " sinn said . a good outlook bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup last summer gave an important boost to germany 's economic revival furthermore , companies were more confident with regard to the outlook for the next six months . " this indicates that after a brief pause , the cyclical recovery will continue in the coming months , " sinn said . gfk similarly predicted that the dip in consumer sentiment this month would prove only temporary .
income expectations were less pessimistic and economic expectations were continuing to develop positively , gfk noted . the government insisted that the fundamental upwards trend in the german economy was still intact . " the dampening effects on private consumption will be overcome quickly , " the economy ministry said in a statement .

" he said that stepping up transparency on the one hand and introducing regulators to referee disputes on the other would create a " double system that should allow for fee costs to be moderate . " the european commission presented draft legislation to make airport charges more transparent and non-discriminatory . " everything we 've done here is designed to bring down the costs of airport fees and , hence , the costs of travelling by air for passengers , " transport commissioner jacques barrot told a news conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt 's airport fees are among the highest in europe the airport fees , which make up four to eight percent of airlines ' operating costs , are paid for take-offs and landings , parking , security and passenger handling .
the costs are passed on to passengers in fees that are added on to ticket prices . according to the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- , 15 of the 25 most expensive airports are in europe , with frankfurt and athens airports among the top .
paris ' charles de gaulle airport was singled out as being the worst offender for increasing its charges by 26.5 percent over five years . airlines are angry that airport fees have taken off in recent years while they have struggled to cut costs . independent regulator barrot said the independent regulator system was already in place and working in britain and that governments should not be handed the role because they " sometimes favor one company or might want to privatize an airport ... and to boost its revenues " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tickets might seem cheap , but beware the hidden charges the commission came up with its proposals only after " extremely thorough talks " with airport authorities and airlines , barrot stressed . the airlines argued that many european airports had substantially increased their charges in recent years , and while they themselves had continued to offer low cost flights in a cut-throat industry . the airports argue that the rising charges are forced on them by the need to adapt to accommodate increasing air traffic and meet new security requirements in the wake of the sept .

" voluntary curbs by the industry have failed , " gabriel said .
" now we need clear and legally binding targets , " said gabriel , a member of the social democratic party who is in the german coalition headed by the conservative chancellor angela merkel . gabriel 's statement increases pressure on barroso to heal a damaging public rift in his executive team over the best way of fighting car emissions pollution . commissioners at loggerheads bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stavros dimas ' plans have been put on hold officials said that while eu environment chief stavros dimas wanted the new co2 limits to be legally binding for car manufacturers , the bloc 's industry commissioner , günter verheugen , preferred a wider-ranging policy which did not hit the automobile sector alone . verheugen - who like gabriel is a member of germany 's social democratic party - is believed to want better traffic management rules and a greater focus on encouraging state-of-the-art technology to reach the 120 grams per kilometer co2 target that the commission is expected to propose . a commission spokeswoman told reporters barroso was hoping to forge a consensus on the issue in the coming weeks .
" the proposals have been postponed because they were not yet ready for debate and adoption , " said pia ahrenkilde , adding that barroso needed more time to ensure " full coherence " on the issue . she said that barroso believed there was a need for legislation to meet the 120 grams-per-kilometer target by 2012 . car makers under increased eu pressure # b # auto manufacturers have come under increased pressure from the commission in recent months to step up efforts to slash co2 emissions as part of a wider eu drive to combat global warming . dimas - backed by the german eu presidency - has argued that since the car industry has failed to meet current voluntary standards for cutting emissions to 140 grams per kilometer in 2008 , from 160 grams today , it is time to introduce legally-binding rules . the embarrassing eu rift comes only days after chancellor merkel and barroso identified the fight against climate change as the bloc 's biggest challenge . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans at odds over eu 's emissons plans for car industry germans are divided over european union 's plan to impose new limits on carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions for the entire car industry in the 27-member bloc .

an additional 100 million euros will be given to lebanon in grants and loans , commission officials said . the eu aid package is designed to cover the period until 2010 and will concentrate on help for fiscal reform and public finance management , better conditions for private business , job creation and social development . help to recover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parts of beirut were severely damaged during the war the commission said the eu wanted to help lebanon cover the costs of last summer 's war between lebanese shiite militia group hezbollah and israel , which crippled the economy . however , the eu was also seeking to lay the groundwork for a longer term recovery through support for crucial political and economic reforms . " now it is time to move ahead and to tackle the political and economic reforms necessary , " barroso said in a statement .

" in terms of our underlying performance , the first quarter got the fiscal year off to a strong start , " kleinfeld said .

the company will also close production sites in the us and germany - reducing its manufacturing plants from 93 to 48 - as well as shut down research centers in japan and france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pfizer 's under pressure pfizer chief executive jeffrey kindler said the company needed to cut costs because it expected its profits to stagnate over the next two years and be roughly comparable to the $ 48.4 billion -lrb- 37 billion euros -rrb- it reported for 2006 .
analysts predict that profits will drop by almost 40 percent . " we are facing significant challenges in a profoundly changing business environment , " kindler said in a statement .
" i believe we must fundamentally change the way we run our company to meet these challenges . " boom time over for pfizer ? things were n't always this way for pfizer .
the drug giant can look back on an illustrious past .
the company has long been considered a shining model of a successful multinational . founded by german chemist karl pfizer in new york in 1849 , the company became the world leader , especially in " blockbuster " drugs , which refers to medicines that rake in earnings worth over a billion dollars a year . in its heyday , the company 's product palette was largely associated with superlatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pfizer created a sensation with viagra pfizer created the world 's most famous pill , the erectile dysfunction drug viagra .
its number one drug , lipitor , which is used to lower blood cholesterol , is the world 's most lucrative pill . in 2004 , pfizer had a yearly turnover of $ 52.52 billion , the world 's biggest research and development budget and a 38,000-strong sales army . no new blockbuster drugs in sight but that golden age is past .
over the next few years , patent protection for a number of its drugs - which once earned pfizer billions - is set to expire .
that means that pfizer will then lose its monopoly , usually set for a period of 20 years , over producing those drugs - much to the joy of makers of generic medicines . pfizer has been suffering from the loss of patent protection on key drugs like the antidepressant zoloft and the antibiotic zithromax .
sales of both drugs plunged more than 70 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006 , the company said . the company 's problems are compounded by the fact that pfizer 's labs have not produced a single hit despite an annual research budget of $ 7 billion . even viagra , pfizer 's last big success , is almost a decade old .
in december , pfizer had to stop development of torcetrapib , a promising cardiovascular drug , because of dangerous side-effects .
torcetrapib was meant to bring pfizer $ 10 billion yearly . cut-throat competition pfizer 's problems are n't new in the pharmaceutical industry .
competition from makers of generic drugs remains a problem for most big drug companies .
but streamlining operations does n't seem to hold all the answers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : generic drugs are putting the squeeze on firms like pfizer pfizer 's current belt-tightening is the second time in two years that the drug giant has embarked on a serious cost-cutting strategy . many experts forecast a takeover war in the pharmaceutical industry , with big players forgoing producing new drugs and instead looking to buy innovative biotechnology competitors who could develop new medicines . markus preissner , head of the research division for drug distribution at the university of cologne , said that competition between the producers of original drugs and those of generic drugs was absolutely cut-throat . " if there are copycat products , the original drug is much more difficult to sell , " preissner said . compromising on quality preissner warned that the bargain-hunting mentality of consumers did n't augur well for the quality of future drugs . " when drugs do n't cost much , they ca n't be of high quality , " he said . tido von schön-angerer from the german chapter of aid organization doctors without borders said that hugely expensive product marketing was largely responsible for the high costs of original drugs .
thus , research and development often falls by the wayside as in the case of pfizer , von schön-angerer pointed out . " even patent protection is no guarantee for urgently needed innovation , " he said , adding that it was particularly true when it came to developing drugs for diseases in poor countries . andreas leixnering -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de second time around for discount pharmacy chain docmorris , the dutch discount pharmacy chain , has found a loophole to get around germany 's powerful lobby of pharmacists .

" he said that stepping up transparency on the one hand and introducing regulators to referee disputes on the other would create a " double system that should allow for fee costs to be moderate . " the european commission presented draft legislation to make airport charges more transparent and non-discriminatory . " everything we 've done here is designed to bring down the costs of airport fees and , hence , the costs of travelling by air for passengers , " transport commissioner jacques barrot told a news conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt 's airport fees are among the highest in europe the airport fees , which make up four to eight percent of airlines ' operating costs , are paid for take-offs and landings , parking , security and passenger handling .
the costs are passed on to passengers in fees that are added on to ticket prices . according to the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- , 15 of the 25 most expensive airports are in europe , with frankfurt and athens airports among the top .
paris ' charles de gaulle airport was singled out as being the worst offender for increasing its charges by 26.5 percent over five years . airlines are angry that airport fees have taken off in recent years while they have struggled to cut costs . independent regulator barrot said the independent regulator system was already in place and working in britain and that governments should not be handed the role because they " sometimes favor one company or might want to privatize an airport ... and to boost its revenues " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tickets might seem cheap , but beware the hidden charges the commission came up with its proposals only after " extremely thorough talks " with airport authorities and airlines , barrot stressed . the airlines argued that many european airports had substantially increased their charges in recent years , and while they themselves had continued to offer low cost flights in a cut-throat industry . the airports argue that the rising charges are forced on them by the need to adapt to accommodate increasing air traffic and meet new security requirements in the wake of the sept .

that is why he has been attending the economic forum in the swiss skiing resort for 15 years . " there are indian entrepreneurs in my field who are buying shares in german forges and foundries , " großmann said .
" you get to know them here , you start talking to them and you ask them what it is that they really want : are interested in acquiring a production line in germany or do they just want to pull out the know-how and do everything in india ? " " you get to know these things much better after you 've met the people , " großmann said . rubbing shoulders with the leaders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel opened the five-day brainstorming session of political and economic leaders after german chancellor angela merkel officially opened the davos forum on wednesday , großmann met her unofficially , behind the scenes .
they spoke about energy supplies - a topic which is on everybody 's lips at davos . " the environmentally friendly production of renewable energy is always right , " said großmann .
" but what about the international consensus on nuclear energy ?
germany seems to be willing to go its own way there .
i strongly doubt that that would be appropriate for our basic industry . " the coalition of german socialist democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party under former chancellor gerhard schröder reached a ground-breaking agreement that all of germany 's nuclear power plants would be shut down by 2020 . " we 're happy , of course , about having access to cheap electricity through german nuclear power plants .
it would be sad , i think , if we could only get cheap electricity from abroad in the near future , " großmann said . bildunterschrift : davos is an ideal setting for high-level networking no fear of globalization with 9,000 employees , großmann 's steel empire made a turnover of 2,2 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.9 billion -rrb- and cashed in hefty profits in 2006 - all that in a field known for its fierce competition worldwide , massive mergers and rapid technological progress . in the face of globalization and new players from india and china , großmann remains confident . " we 've been the globalization champion and main winner of globalization for more than 40 years , " großmann said .
" we ca n't now , all of a sudden , when others are getting strong , say that we do n't want this anymore . " " furthermore , we 're interested in wealthy clients .
the richer our client countries are , the more stuff we sell them , especially cars and machines that germany makes lots of . " marco vollmar -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de at davos kick-off , merkel says no to protectionism in a wide-ranging speech at the world economic forum , german chancellor angela merkel on wednesday staunchly rejected protectionism as a solution to the economic and social challenges of globalization .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 25.01.2007 faced with generics threat , pfizer makes drastic cutbacks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pfizer has n't produced a single hit since its 1998 viagra pill hurt by the loss of patent protection and setbacks in developing new drugs , the world 's biggest pharmaceuticals firm , pfizer , is laying off workers and closing production sites in the us as well as europe . new york-based pfizer said this week it will cut at least 10,000 jobs and close several manufacturing and research sites in a cost-cutting drive aimed at bolstering earnings reeling from strong competition by makers of generic drugs . the layoffs , which amount to about 10 percent of pfizer 's total workforce , will take place by the end of 2008 , it said .
the company will also close production sites in the us and germany - reducing its manufacturing plants from 93 to 48 - as well as shut down research centers in japan and france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pfizer 's under pressure pfizer chief executive jeffrey kindler said the company needed to cut costs because it expected its profits to stagnate over the next two years and be roughly comparable to the $ 48.4 billion -lrb- 37 billion euros -rrb- it reported for 2006 .
analysts predict that profits will drop by almost 40 percent . " we are facing significant challenges in a profoundly changing business environment , " kindler said in a statement .
" i believe we must fundamentally change the way we run our company to meet these challenges . " boom time over for pfizer ? things were n't always this way for pfizer .
the drug giant can look back on an illustrious past .
the company has long been considered a shining model of a successful multinational . founded by german chemist karl pfizer in new york in 1849 , the company became the world leader , especially in " blockbuster " drugs , which refers to medicines that rake in earnings worth over a billion dollars a year . in its heyday , the company 's product palette was largely associated with superlatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pfizer created a sensation with viagra pfizer created the world 's most famous pill , the erectile dysfunction drug viagra .
its number one drug , lipitor , which is used to lower blood cholesterol , is the world 's most lucrative pill . in 2004 , pfizer had a yearly turnover of $ 52.52 billion , the world 's biggest research and development budget and a 38,000-strong sales army . no new blockbuster drugs in sight but that golden age is past .
over the next few years , patent protection for a number of its drugs - which once earned pfizer billions - is set to expire .
that means that pfizer will then lose its monopoly , usually set for a period of 20 years , over producing those drugs - much to the joy of makers of generic medicines . pfizer has been suffering from the loss of patent protection on key drugs like the antidepressant zoloft and the antibiotic zithromax .
sales of both drugs plunged more than 70 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006 , the company said . the company 's problems are compounded by the fact that pfizer 's labs have not produced a single hit despite an annual research budget of $ 7 billion . even viagra , pfizer 's last big success , is almost a decade old .
in december , pfizer had to stop development of torcetrapib , a promising cardiovascular drug , because of dangerous side-effects .
torcetrapib was meant to bring pfizer $ 10 billion yearly . cut-throat competition pfizer 's problems are n't new in the pharmaceutical industry .

the company will also close production sites in the us and germany - reducing its manufacturing plants from 93 to 48 - as well as shut down research centers in japan and france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pfizer 's under pressure pfizer chief executive jeffrey kindler said the company needed to cut costs because it expected its profits to stagnate over the next two years and be roughly comparable to the $ 48.4 billion -lrb- 37 billion euros -rrb- it reported for 2006 .
analysts predict that profits will drop by almost 40 percent . " we are facing significant challenges in a profoundly changing business environment , " kindler said in a statement .
" i believe we must fundamentally change the way we run our company to meet these challenges . " boom time over for pfizer ? things were n't always this way for pfizer .
the drug giant can look back on an illustrious past .

over the next few years , patent protection for a number of its drugs - which once earned pfizer billions - is set to expire .
that means that pfizer will then lose its monopoly , usually set for a period of 20 years , over producing those drugs - much to the joy of makers of generic medicines . pfizer has been suffering from the loss of patent protection on key drugs like the antidepressant zoloft and the antibiotic zithromax .
sales of both drugs plunged more than 70 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006 , the company said . the company 's problems are compounded by the fact that pfizer 's labs have not produced a single hit despite an annual research budget of $ 7 billion . even viagra , pfizer 's last big success , is almost a decade old .
in december , pfizer had to stop development of torcetrapib , a promising cardiovascular drug , because of dangerous side-effects .

she said that abbas had welcomed the fact that the so-called mideast quartet of the us , russia , the un and the eu was to revive its efforts . merkel said her meeting with the palestinian leader would be followed by talks scheduled in early february in egypt and saudi arabia .
she said abbas had said he hope the peace process would now go forward again , one linked with a time frame . " we consider ourselves obliged to lead in a supportive manner , " merkel commented and said that the eu would support abbas ' aim to establish a government of national unity .

" the time has come for us ... to make peace a reality , " abbas said .
" the middle east is in dire need of peace .
it is up to us to trace the beginning and end of the peace process , the road map is there . " " we are ready , as of now , to start serious negotiations with our israeli neighbors , " he said during a discussion in which he and livni shared a stage with israeli deputy prime minister shimon peres .

" the establishment of a palestinian state and homeland for the palestinians is the answer , the national answer to the palestinians wherever they are .

" voluntary curbs by the industry have failed , " gabriel said .
" now we need clear and legally binding targets , " said gabriel , a member of the social democratic party who is in the german coalition headed by the conservative chancellor angela merkel . gabriel 's statement increases pressure on barroso to heal a damaging public rift in his executive team over the best way of fighting car emissions pollution . commissioners at loggerheads bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stavros dimas ' plans have been put on hold officials said that while eu environment chief stavros dimas wanted the new co2 limits to be legally binding for car manufacturers , the bloc 's industry commissioner , günter verheugen , preferred a wider-ranging policy which did not hit the automobile sector alone . verheugen - who like gabriel is a member of germany 's social democratic party - is believed to want better traffic management rules and a greater focus on encouraging state-of-the-art technology to reach the 120 grams per kilometer co2 target that the commission is expected to propose . a commission spokeswoman told reporters barroso was hoping to forge a consensus on the issue in the coming weeks .
" the proposals have been postponed because they were not yet ready for debate and adoption , " said pia ahrenkilde , adding that barroso needed more time to ensure " full coherence " on the issue . she said that barroso believed there was a need for legislation to meet the 120 grams-per-kilometer target by 2012 . car makers under increased eu pressure # b # auto manufacturers have come under increased pressure from the commission in recent months to step up efforts to slash co2 emissions as part of a wider eu drive to combat global warming . dimas - backed by the german eu presidency - has argued that since the car industry has failed to meet current voluntary standards for cutting emissions to 140 grams per kilometer in 2008 , from 160 grams today , it is time to introduce legally-binding rules . the embarrassing eu rift comes only days after chancellor merkel and barroso identified the fight against climate change as the bloc 's biggest challenge . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans at odds over eu 's emissons plans for car industry germans are divided over european union 's plan to impose new limits on carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions for the entire car industry in the 27-member bloc .

that is why he has been attending the economic forum in the swiss skiing resort for 15 years . " there are indian entrepreneurs in my field who are buying shares in german forges and foundries , " großmann said .

" the lives of others " is an intense look at a committed east german secret police officer who gradually becomes disillusioned with the system he has worked to uphold , until he finally switches sides and tries to protect a woman he was assigned to spy on . the film was nominated for best foreign film at this year 's academy awards .
on wednesday , dw-world spoke with its director , florian henckel von donnersmarck . dw-world : congratulations on your film .
what was it like , hearing that you had been nominated for an oscar ? florian henckel von donnersmarck : i was very relieved , because i knew a lot of people were expecting it and hoping for it .
of course , the nomination was no longer dependent on me .
the battle that i am now getting recognition for is a battle i won two years ago .
but still , you naturally think you would have disappointed people if you were n't nominated . i 'm in france right now .
-lrb- on tuesday -rrb- i introduced my film at its premiere in toulouse .
and so of course the french opened up a big bottle of champagne , and immediately gave the printers instructions to make new posters with the words " nominated for the oscar , 2007 " on it . bildunterschrift : ulrich mühe plays a stasi agent whose life takes a surprising turn how has your film been received in france ? very well .
the french known an astonishing amount about the whole topic .
and they are putting a lot of energy behind the film ; there are 120 copies .
proportionally , that is approximately about as many as in germany , and of course i am very pleased , because the french are the opinion makers when it comes to international cinema .
for example when the french discovered the -lrb- austrian -rrb- director michael haneke , he suddenly became a very important director for us in germany . do german movies work well abroad ? even the most successful german films overseas are limited successes , compared with american movies .
for example , das boot -lrb- the boat -rrb- is the most successful german film in the usa .
it took in around 11 million dollars -lrb- xxxx -rrb- .
for an american film – even the littlest independent production – that would be considered a huge flop .
considering that , you ca n't really get your expectations too high .
but you reach a certain elite few who are open to culture , and that 's a good thing . but does your film work in terms of content ?
i mean , you have to know the historical background surrounding the story . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : florian henckel von donnersmarck you don ’ t really need to know german history so well in order to undsertand the film .
if so , i would have done something wrong , and the film would only be good for showing at universities .
i actually got the feeling that the americans are glad this film does n't just depict things in black and white .
i think right now the americans have the feeling that the current government 's painting everything black and white – like hwen it talks about the " axis of evil " – has n't been very helpful .
on the contrary .
and i think my film is a help , and that americans are more open for political-moral questions than they were five years ago or so . why is your film so successful ? my film talks about things that viewers around the world know and recognize .
along with the stasi -lrb- east german secret police -rrb- and the intelligence services , it is about overarching human questions : how does it feel when your private sphere is violated ?

the company will also close production sites in the us and germany - reducing its manufacturing plants from 93 to 48 - as well as shut down research centers in japan and france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pfizer 's under pressure pfizer chief executive jeffrey kindler said the company needed to cut costs because it expected its profits to stagnate over the next two years and be roughly comparable to the $ 48.4 billion -lrb- 37 billion euros -rrb- it reported for 2006 .
analysts predict that profits will drop by almost 40 percent . " we are facing significant challenges in a profoundly changing business environment , " kindler said in a statement .
" i believe we must fundamentally change the way we run our company to meet these challenges . " boom time over for pfizer ? things were n't always this way for pfizer .
the drug giant can look back on an illustrious past .
the company has long been considered a shining model of a successful multinational . founded by german chemist karl pfizer in new york in 1849 , the company became the world leader , especially in " blockbuster " drugs , which refers to medicines that rake in earnings worth over a billion dollars a year . in its heyday , the company 's product palette was largely associated with superlatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pfizer created a sensation with viagra pfizer created the world 's most famous pill , the erectile dysfunction drug viagra .
its number one drug , lipitor , which is used to lower blood cholesterol , is the world 's most lucrative pill . in 2004 , pfizer had a yearly turnover of $ 52.52 billion , the world 's biggest research and development budget and a 38,000-strong sales army . no new blockbuster drugs in sight but that golden age is past .
over the next few years , patent protection for a number of its drugs - which once earned pfizer billions - is set to expire .
that means that pfizer will then lose its monopoly , usually set for a period of 20 years , over producing those drugs - much to the joy of makers of generic medicines . pfizer has been suffering from the loss of patent protection on key drugs like the antidepressant zoloft and the antibiotic zithromax .
sales of both drugs plunged more than 70 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006 , the company said . the company 's problems are compounded by the fact that pfizer 's labs have not produced a single hit despite an annual research budget of $ 7 billion . even viagra , pfizer 's last big success , is almost a decade old .
in december , pfizer had to stop development of torcetrapib , a promising cardiovascular drug , because of dangerous side-effects .
torcetrapib was meant to bring pfizer $ 10 billion yearly . cut-throat competition pfizer 's problems are n't new in the pharmaceutical industry .
competition from makers of generic drugs remains a problem for most big drug companies .
but streamlining operations does n't seem to hold all the answers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : generic drugs are putting the squeeze on firms like pfizer pfizer 's current belt-tightening is the second time in two years that the drug giant has embarked on a serious cost-cutting strategy . many experts forecast a takeover war in the pharmaceutical industry , with big players forgoing producing new drugs and instead looking to buy innovative biotechnology competitors who could develop new medicines . markus preissner , head of the research division for drug distribution at the university of cologne , said that competition between the producers of original drugs and those of generic drugs was absolutely cut-throat . " if there are copycat products , the original drug is much more difficult to sell , " preissner said . compromising on quality preissner warned that the bargain-hunting mentality of consumers did n't augur well for the quality of future drugs . " when drugs do n't cost much , they ca n't be of high quality , " he said . tido von schön-angerer from the german chapter of aid organization doctors without borders said that hugely expensive product marketing was largely responsible for the high costs of original drugs .
thus , research and development often falls by the wayside as in the case of pfizer , von schön-angerer pointed out . " even patent protection is no guarantee for urgently needed innovation , " he said , adding that it was particularly true when it came to developing drugs for diseases in poor countries . andreas leixnering -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de second time around for discount pharmacy chain docmorris , the dutch discount pharmacy chain , has found a loophole to get around germany 's powerful lobby of pharmacists .

dw 's reporter marco vollmar spoke to one of its participants , german steel magnate jürgen großman . " the spirit of davos does n't just float around , " said german steel baron jürgen großmann .
" you have to look for it in the conversations . " jürgen großmann is one of the 2,500 participants in the davos world economic forum , together with 800 corporate chief executives or chairmen , 24 heads of state or government and 85 cabinet ministers .
großman , who is the managing partner of georgsmarienhütte holding - a global producer of high-grade structural steel - knows that networking and personal contacts are essential for doing business .
that is why he has been attending the economic forum in the swiss skiing resort for 15 years . " there are indian entrepreneurs in my field who are buying shares in german forges and foundries , " großmann said .
" you get to know them here , you start talking to them and you ask them what it is that they really want : are interested in acquiring a production line in germany or do they just want to pull out the know-how and do everything in india ? " " you get to know these things much better after you 've met the people , " großmann said . rubbing shoulders with the leaders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel opened the five-day brainstorming session of political and economic leaders after german chancellor angela merkel officially opened the davos forum on wednesday , großmann met her unofficially , behind the scenes .
they spoke about energy supplies - a topic which is on everybody 's lips at davos . " the environmentally friendly production of renewable energy is always right , " said großmann .
" but what about the international consensus on nuclear energy ?

dw 's reporter marco vollmar spoke to one of its participants , german steel magnate jürgen großman . " the spirit of davos does n't just float around , " said german steel baron jürgen großmann .
" you have to look for it in the conversations . " jürgen großmann is one of the 2,500 participants in the davos world economic forum , together with 800 corporate chief executives or chairmen , 24 heads of state or government and 85 cabinet ministers .
großman , who is the managing partner of georgsmarienhütte holding - a global producer of high-grade structural steel - knows that networking and personal contacts are essential for doing business .
that is why he has been attending the economic forum in the swiss skiing resort for 15 years . " there are indian entrepreneurs in my field who are buying shares in german forges and foundries , " großmann said .
" you get to know them here , you start talking to them and you ask them what it is that they really want : are interested in acquiring a production line in germany or do they just want to pull out the know-how and do everything in india ?

the company will also close production sites in the us and germany - reducing its manufacturing plants from 93 to 48 - as well as shut down research centers in japan and france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pfizer 's under pressure pfizer chief executive jeffrey kindler said the company needed to cut costs because it expected its profits to stagnate over the next two years and be roughly comparable to the $ 48.4 billion -lrb- 37 billion euros -rrb- it reported for 2006 .
analysts predict that profits will drop by almost 40 percent . " we are facing significant challenges in a profoundly changing business environment , " kindler said in a statement .
" i believe we must fundamentally change the way we run our company to meet these challenges . " boom time over for pfizer ? things were n't always this way for pfizer .
the drug giant can look back on an illustrious past .
the company has long been considered a shining model of a successful multinational . founded by german chemist karl pfizer in new york in 1849 , the company became the world leader , especially in " blockbuster " drugs , which refers to medicines that rake in earnings worth over a billion dollars a year . in its heyday , the company 's product palette was largely associated with superlatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pfizer created a sensation with viagra pfizer created the world 's most famous pill , the erectile dysfunction drug viagra .
its number one drug , lipitor , which is used to lower blood cholesterol , is the world 's most lucrative pill . in 2004 , pfizer had a yearly turnover of $ 52.52 billion , the world 's biggest research and development budget and a 38,000-strong sales army . no new blockbuster drugs in sight but that golden age is past .
over the next few years , patent protection for a number of its drugs - which once earned pfizer billions - is set to expire .
that means that pfizer will then lose its monopoly , usually set for a period of 20 years , over producing those drugs - much to the joy of makers of generic medicines . pfizer has been suffering from the loss of patent protection on key drugs like the antidepressant zoloft and the antibiotic zithromax .
sales of both drugs plunged more than 70 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006 , the company said . the company 's problems are compounded by the fact that pfizer 's labs have not produced a single hit despite an annual research budget of $ 7 billion . even viagra , pfizer 's last big success , is almost a decade old .
in december , pfizer had to stop development of torcetrapib , a promising cardiovascular drug , because of dangerous side-effects .
torcetrapib was meant to bring pfizer $ 10 billion yearly . cut-throat competition pfizer 's problems are n't new in the pharmaceutical industry .
competition from makers of generic drugs remains a problem for most big drug companies .
but streamlining operations does n't seem to hold all the answers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : generic drugs are putting the squeeze on firms like pfizer pfizer 's current belt-tightening is the second time in two years that the drug giant has embarked on a serious cost-cutting strategy . many experts forecast a takeover war in the pharmaceutical industry , with big players forgoing producing new drugs and instead looking to buy innovative biotechnology competitors who could develop new medicines . markus preissner , head of the research division for drug distribution at the university of cologne , said that competition between the producers of original drugs and those of generic drugs was absolutely cut-throat . " if there are copycat products , the original drug is much more difficult to sell , " preissner said . compromising on quality preissner warned that the bargain-hunting mentality of consumers did n't augur well for the quality of future drugs . " when drugs do n't cost much , they ca n't be of high quality , " he said . tido von schön-angerer from the german chapter of aid organization doctors without borders said that hugely expensive product marketing was largely responsible for the high costs of original drugs .
thus , research and development often falls by the wayside as in the case of pfizer , von schön-angerer pointed out . " even patent protection is no guarantee for urgently needed innovation , " he said , adding that it was particularly true when it came to developing drugs for diseases in poor countries . andreas leixnering -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de second time around for discount pharmacy chain docmorris , the dutch discount pharmacy chain , has found a loophole to get around germany 's powerful lobby of pharmacists .

" the lives of others " is an intense look at a committed east german secret police officer who gradually becomes disillusioned with the system he has worked to uphold , until he finally switches sides and tries to protect a woman he was assigned to spy on . the film was nominated for best foreign film at this year 's academy awards .
on wednesday , dw-world spoke with its director , florian henckel von donnersmarck . dw-world : congratulations on your film .
what was it like , hearing that you had been nominated for an oscar ? florian henckel von donnersmarck : i was very relieved , because i knew a lot of people were expecting it and hoping for it .
of course , the nomination was no longer dependent on me .
the battle that i am now getting recognition for is a battle i won two years ago .
but still , you naturally think you would have disappointed people if you were n't nominated . i 'm in france right now .
-lrb- on tuesday -rrb- i introduced my film at its premiere in toulouse .
and so of course the french opened up a big bottle of champagne , and immediately gave the printers instructions to make new posters with the words " nominated for the oscar , 2007 " on it . bildunterschrift : ulrich mühe plays a stasi agent whose life takes a surprising turn how has your film been received in france ? very well .
the french known an astonishing amount about the whole topic .
and they are putting a lot of energy behind the film ; there are 120 copies .
proportionally , that is approximately about as many as in germany , and of course i am very pleased , because the french are the opinion makers when it comes to international cinema .
for example when the french discovered the -lrb- austrian -rrb- director michael haneke , he suddenly became a very important director for us in germany . do german movies work well abroad ? even the most successful german films overseas are limited successes , compared with american movies .
for example , das boot -lrb- the boat -rrb- is the most successful german film in the usa .
it took in around 11 million dollars -lrb- xxxx -rrb- .
for an american film – even the littlest independent production – that would be considered a huge flop .
considering that , you ca n't really get your expectations too high .
but you reach a certain elite few who are open to culture , and that 's a good thing . but does your film work in terms of content ?
i mean , you have to know the historical background surrounding the story . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : florian henckel von donnersmarck you don ’ t really need to know german history so well in order to undsertand the film .
if so , i would have done something wrong , and the film would only be good for showing at universities .
i actually got the feeling that the americans are glad this film does n't just depict things in black and white .
i think right now the americans have the feeling that the current government 's painting everything black and white – like hwen it talks about the " axis of evil " – has n't been very helpful .
on the contrary .
and i think my film is a help , and that americans are more open for political-moral questions than they were five years ago or so . why is your film so successful ? my film talks about things that viewers around the world know and recognize .
along with the stasi -lrb- east german secret police -rrb- and the intelligence services , it is about overarching human questions : how does it feel when your private sphere is violated ?
how does it feel to deal with absolute power ?
how does it feel to be afraid ?
these are things that interest and touch everyone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mühe won best european actor 2006 for his role in the film how are you getting prepared for the oscars , which take place on feb .
25 ? of course , i 'm really excited , but i try to keep in mind that it is really out of my control , whether or not i win .
it depends on whether , and how , other people see my film , and i ca n't influence that .
people say it depends on propaganda , and how you campaign for it .
but that is n't true .
there are so many successful and important filmmakers on the panel , and they are n't influenced by who ran a bigger ad , or whether you gave an elegant speech somewhere .
they care about which films move them , and so i am just trying not to get too uptight about it . of course , it is totally clear to me that it would mean a big change in my life , if i won the oscar .
ask volker schlöndorff how it affected his life to win such a gigantic prize as the oscar so early in his career , for the 1980 filming of the tin drum .
this is really an unbelievably powerful statute . ina rottscheidt spoke with florian henckel von donnersmarck -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jewish filmmaker breaks taboos with hitler send-up both german and jewish sensitivities are to face a severe test next month with the launch of a comedy movie in german that turns nazi dictator adolf hitler into a clown with 90 minutes of juvenile jokes .

an additional 100 million euros will be given to lebanon in grants and loans , commission officials said . the eu aid package is designed to cover the period until 2010 and will concentrate on help for fiscal reform and public finance management , better conditions for private business , job creation and social development . help to recover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parts of beirut were severely damaged during the war the commission said the eu wanted to help lebanon cover the costs of last summer 's war between lebanese shiite militia group hezbollah and israel , which crippled the economy . however , the eu was also seeking to lay the groundwork for a longer term recovery through support for crucial political and economic reforms .

" voluntary curbs by the industry have failed , " gabriel said .
" now we need clear and legally binding targets , " said gabriel , a member of the social democratic party who is in the german coalition headed by the conservative chancellor angela merkel . gabriel 's statement increases pressure on barroso to heal a damaging public rift in his executive team over the best way of fighting car emissions pollution . commissioners at loggerheads bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stavros dimas ' plans have been put on hold officials said that while eu environment chief stavros dimas wanted the new co2 limits to be legally binding for car manufacturers , the bloc 's industry commissioner , günter verheugen , preferred a wider-ranging policy which did not hit the automobile sector alone . verheugen - who like gabriel is a member of germany 's social democratic party - is believed to want better traffic management rules and a greater focus on encouraging state-of-the-art technology to reach the 120 grams per kilometer co2 target that the commission is expected to propose . a commission spokeswoman told reporters barroso was hoping to forge a consensus on the issue in the coming weeks .
" the proposals have been postponed because they were not yet ready for debate and adoption , " said pia ahrenkilde , adding that barroso needed more time to ensure " full coherence " on the issue . she said that barroso believed there was a need for legislation to meet the 120 grams-per-kilometer target by 2012 . car makers under increased eu pressure # b # auto manufacturers have come under increased pressure from the commission in recent months to step up efforts to slash co2 emissions as part of a wider eu drive to combat global warming . dimas - backed by the german eu presidency - has argued that since the car industry has failed to meet current voluntary standards for cutting emissions to 140 grams per kilometer in 2008 , from 160 grams today , it is time to introduce legally-binding rules . the embarrassing eu rift comes only days after chancellor merkel and barroso identified the fight against climate change as the bloc 's biggest challenge . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans at odds over eu 's emissons plans for car industry germans are divided over european union 's plan to impose new limits on carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions for the entire car industry in the 27-member bloc .

" the lives of others " is an intense look at a committed east german secret police officer who gradually becomes disillusioned with the system he has worked to uphold , until he finally switches sides and tries to protect a woman he was assigned to spy on . the film was nominated for best foreign film at this year 's academy awards .
on wednesday , dw-world spoke with its director , florian henckel von donnersmarck . dw-world : congratulations on your film .
what was it like , hearing that you had been nominated for an oscar ? florian henckel von donnersmarck : i was very relieved , because i knew a lot of people were expecting it and hoping for it .
of course , the nomination was no longer dependent on me .
the battle that i am now getting recognition for is a battle i won two years ago .
but still , you naturally think you would have disappointed people if you were n't nominated . i 'm in france right now .
-lrb- on tuesday -rrb- i introduced my film at its premiere in toulouse .
and so of course the french opened up a big bottle of champagne , and immediately gave the printers instructions to make new posters with the words " nominated for the oscar , 2007 " on it . bildunterschrift : ulrich mühe plays a stasi agent whose life takes a surprising turn how has your film been received in france ? very well .
the french known an astonishing amount about the whole topic .
and they are putting a lot of energy behind the film ; there are 120 copies .
proportionally , that is approximately about as many as in germany , and of course i am very pleased , because the french are the opinion makers when it comes to international cinema .
for example when the french discovered the -lrb- austrian -rrb- director michael haneke , he suddenly became a very important director for us in germany . do german movies work well abroad ? even the most successful german films overseas are limited successes , compared with american movies .
for example , das boot -lrb- the boat -rrb- is the most successful german film in the usa .
it took in around 11 million dollars -lrb- xxxx -rrb- .
for an american film – even the littlest independent production – that would be considered a huge flop .
considering that , you ca n't really get your expectations too high .
but you reach a certain elite few who are open to culture , and that 's a good thing . but does your film work in terms of content ?
i mean , you have to know the historical background surrounding the story . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : florian henckel von donnersmarck you don ’ t really need to know german history so well in order to undsertand the film .
if so , i would have done something wrong , and the film would only be good for showing at universities .
i actually got the feeling that the americans are glad this film does n't just depict things in black and white .
i think right now the americans have the feeling that the current government 's painting everything black and white – like hwen it talks about the " axis of evil " – has n't been very helpful .
on the contrary .
and i think my film is a help , and that americans are more open for political-moral questions than they were five years ago or so . why is your film so successful ? my film talks about things that viewers around the world know and recognize .
along with the stasi -lrb- east german secret police -rrb- and the intelligence services , it is about overarching human questions : how does it feel when your private sphere is violated ?
how does it feel to deal with absolute power ?
how does it feel to be afraid ?
these are things that interest and touch everyone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mühe won best european actor 2006 for his role in the film how are you getting prepared for the oscars , which take place on feb .
25 ? of course , i 'm really excited , but i try to keep in mind that it is really out of my control , whether or not i win .
it depends on whether , and how , other people see my film , and i ca n't influence that .
people say it depends on propaganda , and how you campaign for it .
but that is n't true .
there are so many successful and important filmmakers on the panel , and they are n't influenced by who ran a bigger ad , or whether you gave an elegant speech somewhere .
they care about which films move them , and so i am just trying not to get too uptight about it . of course , it is totally clear to me that it would mean a big change in my life , if i won the oscar .
ask volker schlöndorff how it affected his life to win such a gigantic prize as the oscar so early in his career , for the 1980 filming of the tin drum .
this is really an unbelievably powerful statute . ina rottscheidt spoke with florian henckel von donnersmarck -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jewish filmmaker breaks taboos with hitler send-up both german and jewish sensitivities are to face a severe test next month with the launch of a comedy movie in german that turns nazi dictator adolf hitler into a clown with 90 minutes of juvenile jokes .

-lrb- 03.12.2006 -rrb- film takes uncompromising look at gdr police state a debut film by a young german director about east germany 's secret police has critics raving and awards piling up .

1 , in a move experts said would put the brakes on household spending and therefore on the economy as a whole . the sharp vat hike is now also hitting business confidence , the more important ifo business climate index showed . after topping a 16-year high in december , index fell surprisingly this month .
analysts had been penciling in a steady to slightly higher reading in january . but even after the decline , business confidence in germany remains at its second-highest level since january 1991 and the current upturn is not in jeopardy , ifo president hans-werner sinn said . " companies still reported a very positive current business situation , even if it was not quite so favorable as in the previous month , " sinn said . a good outlook bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup last summer gave an important boost to germany 's economic revival furthermore , companies were more confident with regard to the outlook for the next six months . " this indicates that after a brief pause , the cyclical recovery will continue in the coming months , " sinn said . gfk similarly predicted that the dip in consumer sentiment this month would prove only temporary .
income expectations were less pessimistic and economic expectations were continuing to develop positively , gfk noted . the government insisted that the fundamental upwards trend in the german economy was still intact . " the dampening effects on private consumption will be overcome quickly , " the economy ministry said in a statement .
" household spending would pick up again during the course of the year and contribute to overall growth . " an unbroken uptrend bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer confidence fell sharply in january analysts , too , insisted that the uptrend in both the german and eurozone economies remained unbroken . " the -lrb- ifo -rrb- index remains well above the long-term average and is still pointing to above trend growth in the eurozone , " said bank of america economist matthew sharratt . " the january decline only represents a modest correction .
the data are consistent with our expectation that the german economic upswing is likely to take a breather in the first quarter of 2007 but will return to above-trend growth in the second half , " sharratt said . raising interest rates ? ixis economist sylvain broyer said the latest ifo and gfk confidence data , coupled with steady business confidence in france , pointed to a " marked air pocket in activity during the first half of this year , re-accelerating somewhat in the second half . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the europan central bank may increase its key interest rates with inflationary dangers still not completely banished , the european central bank will , according to broyer , " remain hawkish for a while . " nordlb analyst tobias basse similarly predicted that the ecb would " stick to its guns and raise its key interest rates by a quarter of percentage point in march . " the guardian of the euro last raised its benchmark " refi " refinancing rate to a five-year high of 3.50 percent in december , and is expected to continue tightening monetary conditions in the 13 countries that share the euro in the coming months . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wood could be german answer to soaring energy prices germany is one of europe 's most densely forested countries , and soaring oil and gas prices are leading more households to switch to modern wood-burning heating systems , germany 's forest owners ' association says .

abbas then met with israel 's tzipi livni and shimon peres . talks between chancellor angela merkel and palestinian president mahmoud abbas on the sidelines of the world economic forum in davos thursday concluded with german leader pledging stronger european union efforts in the middle east peace process under germany 's current eu presidency . " europe will put itself into the picture , but it wo n't be overestimating its role , " merkel told a press conference after her talks with abbas .
she said that abbas had welcomed the fact that the so-called mideast quartet of the us , russia , the un and the eu was to revive its efforts . merkel said her meeting with the palestinian leader would be followed by talks scheduled in early february in egypt and saudi arabia .
she said abbas had said he hope the peace process would now go forward again , one linked with a time frame . " we consider ourselves obliged to lead in a supportive manner , " merkel commented and said that the eu would support abbas ' aim to establish a government of national unity .
at the same time , she insisted that the firing of rockets against israel had to be stopped . abbas expects much from germany , eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president abbas sees germany as a major player " germany is the head of the eu , so we expect a lot from germany , especially unilaterally and as chairman of the eu , " abbas said as he arrived for his hour-long meeting with merkel . the palestinian president then went on to meet with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni who expressed shared hopes for peace , with abbas calling for talks to begin straight away .
" the time has come for us ... to make peace a reality , " abbas said .
" the middle east is in dire need of peace .
it is up to us to trace the beginning and end of the peace process , the road map is there . " " we are ready , as of now , to start serious negotiations with our israeli neighbors , " he said during a discussion in which he and livni shared a stage with israeli deputy prime minister shimon peres .

" the establishment of a palestinian state and homeland for the palestinians is the answer , the national answer to the palestinians wherever they are . " at the same time , livni stressed that israel would never " allow " a palestinian state that was " ruled by a terrorist organization .

" this indicates that after a brief pause , the cyclical recovery will continue in the coming months , " sinn said . gfk similarly predicted that the dip in consumer sentiment this month would prove only temporary .
income expectations were less pessimistic and economic expectations were continuing to develop positively , gfk noted . the government insisted that the fundamental upwards trend in the german economy was still intact . " the dampening effects on private consumption will be overcome quickly , " the economy ministry said in a statement .
" household spending would pick up again during the course of the year and contribute to overall growth . " an unbroken uptrend bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer confidence fell sharply in january analysts , too , insisted that the uptrend in both the german and eurozone economies remained unbroken . " the -lrb- ifo -rrb- index remains well above the long-term average and is still pointing to above trend growth in the eurozone , " said bank of america economist matthew sharratt .

the data are consistent with our expectation that the german economic upswing is likely to take a breather in the first quarter of 2007 but will return to above-trend growth in the second half , " sharratt said . raising interest rates ? ixis economist sylvain broyer said the latest ifo and gfk confidence data , coupled with steady business confidence in france , pointed to a " marked air pocket in activity during the first half of this year , re-accelerating somewhat in the second half .

" the lives of others " is an intense look at a committed east german secret police officer who gradually becomes disillusioned with the system he has worked to uphold , until he finally switches sides and tries to protect a woman he was assigned to spy on . the film was nominated for best foreign film at this year 's academy awards .
on wednesday , dw-world spoke with its director , florian henckel von donnersmarck . dw-world : congratulations on your film .
what was it like , hearing that you had been nominated for an oscar ? florian henckel von donnersmarck : i was very relieved , because i knew a lot of people were expecting it and hoping for it .
of course , the nomination was no longer dependent on me .
the battle that i am now getting recognition for is a battle i won two years ago .
but still , you naturally think you would have disappointed people if you were n't nominated . i 'm in france right now .
-lrb- on tuesday -rrb- i introduced my film at its premiere in toulouse .
and so of course the french opened up a big bottle of champagne , and immediately gave the printers instructions to make new posters with the words " nominated for the oscar , 2007 " on it . bildunterschrift : ulrich mühe plays a stasi agent whose life takes a surprising turn how has your film been received in france ? very well .
the french known an astonishing amount about the whole topic .
and they are putting a lot of energy behind the film ; there are 120 copies .
proportionally , that is approximately about as many as in germany , and of course i am very pleased , because the french are the opinion makers when it comes to international cinema .
for example when the french discovered the -lrb- austrian -rrb- director michael haneke , he suddenly became a very important director for us in germany . do german movies work well abroad ? even the most successful german films overseas are limited successes , compared with american movies .
for example , das boot -lrb- the boat -rrb- is the most successful german film in the usa .
it took in around 11 million dollars -lrb- xxxx -rrb- .
for an american film – even the littlest independent production – that would be considered a huge flop .
considering that , you ca n't really get your expectations too high .
but you reach a certain elite few who are open to culture , and that 's a good thing . but does your film work in terms of content ?
i mean , you have to know the historical background surrounding the story . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : florian henckel von donnersmarck you don ’ t really need to know german history so well in order to undsertand the film .
if so , i would have done something wrong , and the film would only be good for showing at universities .
i actually got the feeling that the americans are glad this film does n't just depict things in black and white .
i think right now the americans have the feeling that the current government 's painting everything black and white – like hwen it talks about the " axis of evil " – has n't been very helpful .
on the contrary .
and i think my film is a help , and that americans are more open for political-moral questions than they were five years ago or so . why is your film so successful ? my film talks about things that viewers around the world know and recognize .
along with the stasi -lrb- east german secret police -rrb- and the intelligence services , it is about overarching human questions : how does it feel when your private sphere is violated ?
how does it feel to deal with absolute power ?
how does it feel to be afraid ?
these are things that interest and touch everyone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mühe won best european actor 2006 for his role in the film how are you getting prepared for the oscars , which take place on feb .
25 ? of course , i 'm really excited , but i try to keep in mind that it is really out of my control , whether or not i win .
it depends on whether , and how , other people see my film , and i ca n't influence that .
people say it depends on propaganda , and how you campaign for it .
but that is n't true .
there are so many successful and important filmmakers on the panel , and they are n't influenced by who ran a bigger ad , or whether you gave an elegant speech somewhere .
they care about which films move them , and so i am just trying not to get too uptight about it . of course , it is totally clear to me that it would mean a big change in my life , if i won the oscar .
ask volker schlöndorff how it affected his life to win such a gigantic prize as the oscar so early in his career , for the 1980 filming of the tin drum .
this is really an unbelievably powerful statute . ina rottscheidt spoke with florian henckel von donnersmarck -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jewish filmmaker breaks taboos with hitler send-up both german and jewish sensitivities are to face a severe test next month with the launch of a comedy movie in german that turns nazi dictator adolf hitler into a clown with 90 minutes of juvenile jokes .

" i find it personally extremely disturbing that these efforts were not sufficiently successful , " pierer said . with regard to the mobile phones business , which siemens sold to taiwan-based benq and which has subsequently collapsed , von pierer insisted that the german company had done everything that could be expected for the activities . the role of siemens in the collapse of benq mobile has been criticised , with critics saying the german company did not do enough to save the business . unlawful practice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens ' klaus kleinfeld wants to have the bribery scandal investigated and cleared up referring to the bribery scandal that has rocked the german engineering and electronics giant , von pierer 's successor , klaus kleinfeld , told around 9,000 shareholders that he was dismayed when he found out that a group of former and present employees had acted unlawfully .
" when i first heard of it , i was speechless , " kleinfeld said . at the heart of the bribery allegations are questionable payments totaling about 418 million euros -lrb- $ 543 million -rrb- , which are at present the subject of investigation launched by the munich-based siemens . " we are doing everything we can to get to the bottom of this incident , " kleinfeld said .

" in terms of our underlying performance , the first quarter got the fiscal year off to a strong start , " kleinfeld said . " while it is disappointing to see our net income growth reversed by an impact from events in the past , we are moving on with our operations tremendously improved year-over-year , " he said . looking ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens shareholders want to know the full story overnight , siemens announced that it had agreed to buy us software maker ugs for 3.5 billion dollars including debt . in addition , siemens would float its automotive supply business , siemens vdo automotive -lrb- sv -rrb- , on the stock exchange , with the parent company to hold on to a majority stake . " this move will give sv the necessary financial resources and greater entrepreneurial flexibility for ensuring further sustainable and profitable growth , " the company said in a statement . looking ahead , the group predicted that all divisions would attain the profitability targets they had set themselves for the second quarter , after some of the divisions failed to meet those targets in the first quarter . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu commission slaps huge fine on siemens for price fixing the eu has fined power equipment manufacturers for their roles in a price-fixing scheme .

dw 's reporter marco vollmar spoke to one of its participants , german steel magnate jürgen großman . " the spirit of davos does n't just float around , " said german steel baron jürgen großmann .
" you have to look for it in the conversations . " jürgen großmann is one of the 2,500 participants in the davos world economic forum , together with 800 corporate chief executives or chairmen , 24 heads of state or government and 85 cabinet ministers .
großman , who is the managing partner of georgsmarienhütte holding - a global producer of high-grade structural steel - knows that networking and personal contacts are essential for doing business .
that is why he has been attending the economic forum in the swiss skiing resort for 15 years . " there are indian entrepreneurs in my field who are buying shares in german forges and foundries , " großmann said .
" you get to know them here , you start talking to them and you ask them what it is that they really want : are interested in acquiring a production line in germany or do they just want to pull out the know-how and do everything in india ? " " you get to know these things much better after you 've met the people , " großmann said . rubbing shoulders with the leaders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel opened the five-day brainstorming session of political and economic leaders after german chancellor angela merkel officially opened the davos forum on wednesday , großmann met her unofficially , behind the scenes .

germany seems to be willing to go its own way there .
i strongly doubt that that would be appropriate for our basic industry .

it would be sad , i think , if we could only get cheap electricity from abroad in the near future , " großmann said . bildunterschrift : davos is an ideal setting for high-level networking no fear of globalization with 9,000 employees , großmann 's steel empire made a turnover of 2,2 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.9 billion -rrb- and cashed in hefty profits in 2006 - all that in a field known for its fierce competition worldwide , massive mergers and rapid technological progress . in the face of globalization and new players from india and china , großmann remains confident . " we 've been the globalization champion and main winner of globalization for more than 40 years , " großmann said .
" we ca n't now , all of a sudden , when others are getting strong , say that we do n't want this anymore . " " furthermore , we 're interested in wealthy clients .

on wednesday , dw-world spoke with its director , florian henckel von donnersmarck . dw-world : congratulations on your film .
what was it like , hearing that you had been nominated for an oscar ? florian henckel von donnersmarck : i was very relieved , because i knew a lot of people were expecting it and hoping for it .
of course , the nomination was no longer dependent on me .
the battle that i am now getting recognition for is a battle i won two years ago .
but still , you naturally think you would have disappointed people if you were n't nominated . i 'm in france right now .

and they are putting a lot of energy behind the film ; there are 120 copies .
proportionally , that is approximately about as many as in germany , and of course i am very pleased , because the french are the opinion makers when it comes to international cinema .
for example when the french discovered the -lrb- austrian -rrb- director michael haneke , he suddenly became a very important director for us in germany . do german movies work well abroad ? even the most successful german films overseas are limited successes , compared with american movies .
for example , das boot -lrb- the boat -rrb- is the most successful german film in the usa .
it took in around 11 million dollars -lrb- xxxx -rrb- .
for an american film – even the littlest independent production – that would be considered a huge flop .
considering that , you ca n't really get your expectations too high .
but you reach a certain elite few who are open to culture , and that 's a good thing . but does your film work in terms of content ?

if so , i would have done something wrong , and the film would only be good for showing at universities .
i actually got the feeling that the americans are glad this film does n't just depict things in black and white .
i think right now the americans have the feeling that the current government 's painting everything black and white – like hwen it talks about the " axis of evil " – has n't been very helpful .
on the contrary .
and i think my film is a help , and that americans are more open for political-moral questions than they were five years ago or so . why is your film so successful ? my film talks about things that viewers around the world know and recognize .
along with the stasi -lrb- east german secret police -rrb- and the intelligence services , it is about overarching human questions : how does it feel when your private sphere is violated ?
how does it feel to deal with absolute power ?
how does it feel to be afraid ?
these are things that interest and touch everyone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mühe won best european actor 2006 for his role in the film how are you getting prepared for the oscars , which take place on feb .
25 ? of course , i 'm really excited , but i try to keep in mind that it is really out of my control , whether or not i win .
it depends on whether , and how , other people see my film , and i ca n't influence that .
people say it depends on propaganda , and how you campaign for it .
but that is n't true .
there are so many successful and important filmmakers on the panel , and they are n't influenced by who ran a bigger ad , or whether you gave an elegant speech somewhere .
they care about which films move them , and so i am just trying not to get too uptight about it . of course , it is totally clear to me that it would mean a big change in my life , if i won the oscar .

" the lives of others " is an intense look at a committed east german secret police officer who gradually becomes disillusioned with the system he has worked to uphold , until he finally switches sides and tries to protect a woman he was assigned to spy on . the film was nominated for best foreign film at this year 's academy awards .
on wednesday , dw-world spoke with its director , florian henckel von donnersmarck . dw-world : congratulations on your film .
what was it like , hearing that you had been nominated for an oscar ? florian henckel von donnersmarck : i was very relieved , because i knew a lot of people were expecting it and hoping for it .
of course , the nomination was no longer dependent on me .
the battle that i am now getting recognition for is a battle i won two years ago .
but still , you naturally think you would have disappointed people if you were n't nominated . i 'm in france right now .
-lrb- on tuesday -rrb- i introduced my film at its premiere in toulouse .
and so of course the french opened up a big bottle of champagne , and immediately gave the printers instructions to make new posters with the words " nominated for the oscar , 2007 " on it . bildunterschrift : ulrich mühe plays a stasi agent whose life takes a surprising turn how has your film been received in france ? very well .
the french known an astonishing amount about the whole topic .
and they are putting a lot of energy behind the film ; there are 120 copies .
proportionally , that is approximately about as many as in germany , and of course i am very pleased , because the french are the opinion makers when it comes to international cinema .
for example when the french discovered the -lrb- austrian -rrb- director michael haneke , he suddenly became a very important director for us in germany . do german movies work well abroad ? even the most successful german films overseas are limited successes , compared with american movies .
for example , das boot -lrb- the boat -rrb- is the most successful german film in the usa .
it took in around 11 million dollars -lrb- xxxx -rrb- .
for an american film – even the littlest independent production – that would be considered a huge flop .
considering that , you ca n't really get your expectations too high .
but you reach a certain elite few who are open to culture , and that 's a good thing . but does your film work in terms of content ?
i mean , you have to know the historical background surrounding the story . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : florian henckel von donnersmarck you don ’ t really need to know german history so well in order to undsertand the film .
if so , i would have done something wrong , and the film would only be good for showing at universities .
i actually got the feeling that the americans are glad this film does n't just depict things in black and white .
i think right now the americans have the feeling that the current government 's painting everything black and white – like hwen it talks about the " axis of evil " – has n't been very helpful .

" voluntary curbs by the industry have failed , " gabriel said .
" now we need clear and legally binding targets , " said gabriel , a member of the social democratic party who is in the german coalition headed by the conservative chancellor angela merkel . gabriel 's statement increases pressure on barroso to heal a damaging public rift in his executive team over the best way of fighting car emissions pollution . commissioners at loggerheads bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stavros dimas ' plans have been put on hold officials said that while eu environment chief stavros dimas wanted the new co2 limits to be legally binding for car manufacturers , the bloc 's industry commissioner , günter verheugen , preferred a wider-ranging policy which did not hit the automobile sector alone . verheugen - who like gabriel is a member of germany 's social democratic party - is believed to want better traffic management rules and a greater focus on encouraging state-of-the-art technology to reach the 120 grams per kilometer co2 target that the commission is expected to propose . a commission spokeswoman told reporters barroso was hoping to forge a consensus on the issue in the coming weeks .
" the proposals have been postponed because they were not yet ready for debate and adoption , " said pia ahrenkilde , adding that barroso needed more time to ensure " full coherence " on the issue . she said that barroso believed there was a need for legislation to meet the 120 grams-per-kilometer target by 2012 . car makers under increased eu pressure # b # auto manufacturers have come under increased pressure from the commission in recent months to step up efforts to slash co2 emissions as part of a wider eu drive to combat global warming . dimas - backed by the german eu presidency - has argued that since the car industry has failed to meet current voluntary standards for cutting emissions to 140 grams per kilometer in 2008 , from 160 grams today , it is time to introduce legally-binding rules . the embarrassing eu rift comes only days after chancellor merkel and barroso identified the fight against climate change as the bloc 's biggest challenge . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans at odds over eu 's emissons plans for car industry germans are divided over european union 's plan to impose new limits on carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions for the entire car industry in the 27-member bloc .
-lrb- 20.01.2007 -rrb- german government under pressure over co2 policy the german government is under intense pressure from the eu over what it calls inadequate plans for cutting greenhouse gases , while warnings from four of germany 's largest energy firms hint at domestic unrest .

" he said that stepping up transparency on the one hand and introducing regulators to referee disputes on the other would create a " double system that should allow for fee costs to be moderate . " the european commission presented draft legislation to make airport charges more transparent and non-discriminatory . " everything we 've done here is designed to bring down the costs of airport fees and , hence , the costs of travelling by air for passengers , " transport commissioner jacques barrot told a news conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt 's airport fees are among the highest in europe the airport fees , which make up four to eight percent of airlines ' operating costs , are paid for take-offs and landings , parking , security and passenger handling .
the costs are passed on to passengers in fees that are added on to ticket prices . according to the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- , 15 of the 25 most expensive airports are in europe , with frankfurt and athens airports among the top .
paris ' charles de gaulle airport was singled out as being the worst offender for increasing its charges by 26.5 percent over five years . airlines are angry that airport fees have taken off in recent years while they have struggled to cut costs . independent regulator barrot said the independent regulator system was already in place and working in britain and that governments should not be handed the role because they " sometimes favor one company or might want to privatize an airport ... and to boost its revenues " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tickets might seem cheap , but beware the hidden charges the commission came up with its proposals only after " extremely thorough talks " with airport authorities and airlines , barrot stressed . the airlines argued that many european airports had substantially increased their charges in recent years , and while they themselves had continued to offer low cost flights in a cut-throat industry . the airports argue that the rising charges are forced on them by the need to adapt to accommodate increasing air traffic and meet new security requirements in the wake of the sept .

the company will also close production sites in the us and germany - reducing its manufacturing plants from 93 to 48 - as well as shut down research centers in japan and france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pfizer 's under pressure pfizer chief executive jeffrey kindler said the company needed to cut costs because it expected its profits to stagnate over the next two years and be roughly comparable to the $ 48.4 billion -lrb- 37 billion euros -rrb- it reported for 2006 .
analysts predict that profits will drop by almost 40 percent . " we are facing significant challenges in a profoundly changing business environment , " kindler said in a statement .
" i believe we must fundamentally change the way we run our company to meet these challenges . " boom time over for pfizer ? things were n't always this way for pfizer .
the drug giant can look back on an illustrious past .
the company has long been considered a shining model of a successful multinational . founded by german chemist karl pfizer in new york in 1849 , the company became the world leader , especially in " blockbuster " drugs , which refers to medicines that rake in earnings worth over a billion dollars a year . in its heyday , the company 's product palette was largely associated with superlatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pfizer created a sensation with viagra pfizer created the world 's most famous pill , the erectile dysfunction drug viagra .
its number one drug , lipitor , which is used to lower blood cholesterol , is the world 's most lucrative pill . in 2004 , pfizer had a yearly turnover of $ 52.52 billion , the world 's biggest research and development budget and a 38,000-strong sales army . no new blockbuster drugs in sight but that golden age is past .
over the next few years , patent protection for a number of its drugs - which once earned pfizer billions - is set to expire .
that means that pfizer will then lose its monopoly , usually set for a period of 20 years , over producing those drugs - much to the joy of makers of generic medicines . pfizer has been suffering from the loss of patent protection on key drugs like the antidepressant zoloft and the antibiotic zithromax .
sales of both drugs plunged more than 70 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006 , the company said . the company 's problems are compounded by the fact that pfizer 's labs have not produced a single hit despite an annual research budget of $ 7 billion . even viagra , pfizer 's last big success , is almost a decade old .
in december , pfizer had to stop development of torcetrapib , a promising cardiovascular drug , because of dangerous side-effects .
torcetrapib was meant to bring pfizer $ 10 billion yearly . cut-throat competition pfizer 's problems are n't new in the pharmaceutical industry .
competition from makers of generic drugs remains a problem for most big drug companies .
but streamlining operations does n't seem to hold all the answers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : generic drugs are putting the squeeze on firms like pfizer pfizer 's current belt-tightening is the second time in two years that the drug giant has embarked on a serious cost-cutting strategy . many experts forecast a takeover war in the pharmaceutical industry , with big players forgoing producing new drugs and instead looking to buy innovative biotechnology competitors who could develop new medicines . markus preissner , head of the research division for drug distribution at the university of cologne , said that competition between the producers of original drugs and those of generic drugs was absolutely cut-throat . " if there are copycat products , the original drug is much more difficult to sell , " preissner said . compromising on quality preissner warned that the bargain-hunting mentality of consumers did n't augur well for the quality of future drugs . " when drugs do n't cost much , they ca n't be of high quality , " he said . tido von schön-angerer from the german chapter of aid organization doctors without borders said that hugely expensive product marketing was largely responsible for the high costs of original drugs .
thus , research and development often falls by the wayside as in the case of pfizer , von schön-angerer pointed out . " even patent protection is no guarantee for urgently needed innovation , " he said , adding that it was particularly true when it came to developing drugs for diseases in poor countries . andreas leixnering -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de second time around for discount pharmacy chain docmorris , the dutch discount pharmacy chain , has found a loophole to get around germany 's powerful lobby of pharmacists .

over the years , both the magazine and its mediagenic founder , alice schwarzer , have spent a fair share of time in the spotlight . the first issue of emma went on sale at newsstands on jan .
26 , 1977 .
the magazine , written " by women , for women , " is inextricably tied to the name and image of alice schwarzer , germany 's best-known feminist . by founding emma - to german ears , the name unmistakably evokes the word of " emancipation " - the well-known journalist provided a nation in the throes of feminist activism with a popular forum for discussing staple women 's issues .
abortion , equal rights , pornography and prostitution were all early fodder for the monthly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the magazine supported angela merkel in her run for office " emma was born in the classic political agitation of the 1970s , " schwarzer said , " … and it has managed to develop in a lively and open fashion over the past 30 years . " key to success : schwarzer " lively and open " may be putting it mildly .
exploiting an uncanny knack for publicity , schwarzer - the magazine 's publisher , editor and driving force - has seen to it that the magazine and its topics have never strayed far from the german media spotlight . " alice schwarzer was already germany 's best-known women 's rights activists before she began publishing emma , " said dr. alexandra kühte , who published her dissertation on the image of women in emma two years ago .

some of the hotter topics of the late 1970s - women 's rights , women 's status in the catholic church - have cooled down , to be replaced by issues like eating disorders , genital mutilation and islam 's treatment of women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first issue of emma , in 1977 others issues , like prostitution and pornography -lrb- the magazine led a famed " porno " campaign for years , -rrb- remain " constant topics " according to kühte . anyone seeking objective journalism would do well to stay away from emma .

in 1978 , she and nine other women sued the weekly magazine stern for its sexist cover shots -lrb- she lost -rrb- .
in 1978 , the magazine also broke a taboo by reporting on sexual abuse , and in the early 1980s it was the first to push the topic of eating disorders out of the home and into the headlines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : images of women in the media have long been a topic for emma in 2000 , the magazine , which had long agitated for equal rights in the military , celebrated the first woman bundeswehr soldier . in the last election cycle , emma threw its weight behind conservative candidate angela merkel - not for her politics , but for her gender .

over the years , both the magazine and its mediagenic founder , alice schwarzer , have spent a fair share of time in the spotlight . the first issue of emma went on sale at newsstands on jan .
26 , 1977 .
the magazine , written " by women , for women , " is inextricably tied to the name and image of alice schwarzer , germany 's best-known feminist . by founding emma - to german ears , the name unmistakably evokes the word of " emancipation " - the well-known journalist provided a nation in the throes of feminist activism with a popular forum for discussing staple women 's issues .
abortion , equal rights , pornography and prostitution were all early fodder for the monthly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the magazine supported angela merkel in her run for office " emma was born in the classic political agitation of the 1970s , " schwarzer said , " … and it has managed to develop in a lively and open fashion over the past 30 years . " key to success : schwarzer " lively and open " may be putting it mildly .
exploiting an uncanny knack for publicity , schwarzer - the magazine 's publisher , editor and driving force - has seen to it that the magazine and its topics have never strayed far from the german media spotlight . " alice schwarzer was already germany 's best-known women 's rights activists before she began publishing emma , " said dr. alexandra kühte , who published her dissertation on the image of women in emma two years ago . " the magazine allowed her to take these topics from the women 's movement to a broad public .
but the importance of emma is completely tied to its founder .
if she was n't so prominent , the magazine would n't be so successful , " kühte said . high impact but despite - or perhaps because of - its being so fully tied to one prominent person , emma 's influence on german society has been widely felt over the years .
some of the hotter topics of the late 1970s - women 's rights , women 's status in the catholic church - have cooled down , to be replaced by issues like eating disorders , genital mutilation and islam 's treatment of women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first issue of emma , in 1977 others issues , like prostitution and pornography -lrb- the magazine led a famed " porno " campaign for years , -rrb- remain " constant topics " according to kühte . anyone seeking objective journalism would do well to stay away from emma .
the magazine avoids dry , theoretical discussion and instead infuses its articles with an opinionated , and decidedly activist , stance . of sex abuse , " porno " and equal pay emma has kept women 's issues at the center of debate because it " was always provocative , it did n't try to fit in with social norms , " kühte said .
" it took on emotionally important and polarizing themes and was very dogmatic about it . " indeed , both schwarzer and her magazine have made headlines over the years .

the company will also close production sites in the us and germany - reducing its manufacturing plants from 93 to 48 - as well as shut down research centers in japan and france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pfizer 's under pressure pfizer chief executive jeffrey kindler said the company needed to cut costs because it expected its profits to stagnate over the next two years and be roughly comparable to the $ 48.4 billion -lrb- 37 billion euros -rrb- it reported for 2006 .
analysts predict that profits will drop by almost 40 percent . " we are facing significant challenges in a profoundly changing business environment , " kindler said in a statement .
" i believe we must fundamentally change the way we run our company to meet these challenges . " boom time over for pfizer ? things were n't always this way for pfizer .
the drug giant can look back on an illustrious past .
the company has long been considered a shining model of a successful multinational . founded by german chemist karl pfizer in new york in 1849 , the company became the world leader , especially in " blockbuster " drugs , which refers to medicines that rake in earnings worth over a billion dollars a year . in its heyday , the company 's product palette was largely associated with superlatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pfizer created a sensation with viagra pfizer created the world 's most famous pill , the erectile dysfunction drug viagra .
its number one drug , lipitor , which is used to lower blood cholesterol , is the world 's most lucrative pill . in 2004 , pfizer had a yearly turnover of $ 52.52 billion , the world 's biggest research and development budget and a 38,000-strong sales army . no new blockbuster drugs in sight but that golden age is past .
over the next few years , patent protection for a number of its drugs - which once earned pfizer billions - is set to expire .
that means that pfizer will then lose its monopoly , usually set for a period of 20 years , over producing those drugs - much to the joy of makers of generic medicines . pfizer has been suffering from the loss of patent protection on key drugs like the antidepressant zoloft and the antibiotic zithromax .
sales of both drugs plunged more than 70 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006 , the company said . the company 's problems are compounded by the fact that pfizer 's labs have not produced a single hit despite an annual research budget of $ 7 billion . even viagra , pfizer 's last big success , is almost a decade old .
in december , pfizer had to stop development of torcetrapib , a promising cardiovascular drug , because of dangerous side-effects .
torcetrapib was meant to bring pfizer $ 10 billion yearly . cut-throat competition pfizer 's problems are n't new in the pharmaceutical industry .
competition from makers of generic drugs remains a problem for most big drug companies .

" if there are copycat products , the original drug is much more difficult to sell , " preissner said . compromising on quality preissner warned that the bargain-hunting mentality of consumers did n't augur well for the quality of future drugs . " when drugs do n't cost much , they ca n't be of high quality , " he said . tido von schön-angerer from the german chapter of aid organization doctors without borders said that hugely expensive product marketing was largely responsible for the high costs of original drugs .

the company will also close production sites in the us and germany - reducing its manufacturing plants from 93 to 48 - as well as shut down research centers in japan and france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pfizer 's under pressure pfizer chief executive jeffrey kindler said the company needed to cut costs because it expected its profits to stagnate over the next two years and be roughly comparable to the $ 48.4 billion -lrb- 37 billion euros -rrb- it reported for 2006 .
analysts predict that profits will drop by almost 40 percent . " we are facing significant challenges in a profoundly changing business environment , " kindler said in a statement .
" i believe we must fundamentally change the way we run our company to meet these challenges . " boom time over for pfizer ? things were n't always this way for pfizer .
the drug giant can look back on an illustrious past .
the company has long been considered a shining model of a successful multinational . founded by german chemist karl pfizer in new york in 1849 , the company became the world leader , especially in " blockbuster " drugs , which refers to medicines that rake in earnings worth over a billion dollars a year . in its heyday , the company 's product palette was largely associated with superlatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pfizer created a sensation with viagra pfizer created the world 's most famous pill , the erectile dysfunction drug viagra .
its number one drug , lipitor , which is used to lower blood cholesterol , is the world 's most lucrative pill . in 2004 , pfizer had a yearly turnover of $ 52.52 billion , the world 's biggest research and development budget and a 38,000-strong sales army . no new blockbuster drugs in sight but that golden age is past .
over the next few years , patent protection for a number of its drugs - which once earned pfizer billions - is set to expire .
that means that pfizer will then lose its monopoly , usually set for a period of 20 years , over producing those drugs - much to the joy of makers of generic medicines . pfizer has been suffering from the loss of patent protection on key drugs like the antidepressant zoloft and the antibiotic zithromax .
sales of both drugs plunged more than 70 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006 , the company said . the company 's problems are compounded by the fact that pfizer 's labs have not produced a single hit despite an annual research budget of $ 7 billion . even viagra , pfizer 's last big success , is almost a decade old .
in december , pfizer had to stop development of torcetrapib , a promising cardiovascular drug , because of dangerous side-effects .
torcetrapib was meant to bring pfizer $ 10 billion yearly . cut-throat competition pfizer 's problems are n't new in the pharmaceutical industry .
competition from makers of generic drugs remains a problem for most big drug companies .
but streamlining operations does n't seem to hold all the answers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : generic drugs are putting the squeeze on firms like pfizer pfizer 's current belt-tightening is the second time in two years that the drug giant has embarked on a serious cost-cutting strategy . many experts forecast a takeover war in the pharmaceutical industry , with big players forgoing producing new drugs and instead looking to buy innovative biotechnology competitors who could develop new medicines . markus preissner , head of the research division for drug distribution at the university of cologne , said that competition between the producers of original drugs and those of generic drugs was absolutely cut-throat . " if there are copycat products , the original drug is much more difficult to sell , " preissner said . compromising on quality preissner warned that the bargain-hunting mentality of consumers did n't augur well for the quality of future drugs . " when drugs do n't cost much , they ca n't be of high quality , " he said . tido von schön-angerer from the german chapter of aid organization doctors without borders said that hugely expensive product marketing was largely responsible for the high costs of original drugs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 25.01.2007 happy birthday , emma : german feminist magazine turns 30 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwarzer : master of publicity , fighter for a cause germany 's feminist flagship magazine , emma , will turn 30 this weekend .
over the years , both the magazine and its mediagenic founder , alice schwarzer , have spent a fair share of time in the spotlight . the first issue of emma went on sale at newsstands on jan .
26 , 1977 .
the magazine , written " by women , for women , " is inextricably tied to the name and image of alice schwarzer , germany 's best-known feminist . by founding emma - to german ears , the name unmistakably evokes the word of " emancipation " - the well-known journalist provided a nation in the throes of feminist activism with a popular forum for discussing staple women 's issues .
abortion , equal rights , pornography and prostitution were all early fodder for the monthly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the magazine supported angela merkel in her run for office " emma was born in the classic political agitation of the 1970s , " schwarzer said , " … and it has managed to develop in a lively and open fashion over the past 30 years . " key to success : schwarzer " lively and open " may be putting it mildly .
exploiting an uncanny knack for publicity , schwarzer - the magazine 's publisher , editor and driving force - has seen to it that the magazine and its topics have never strayed far from the german media spotlight . " alice schwarzer was already germany 's best-known women 's rights activists before she began publishing emma , " said dr. alexandra kühte , who published her dissertation on the image of women in emma two years ago . " the magazine allowed her to take these topics from the women 's movement to a broad public .
but the importance of emma is completely tied to its founder .
if she was n't so prominent , the magazine would n't be so successful , " kühte said . high impact but despite - or perhaps because of - its being so fully tied to one prominent person , emma 's influence on german society has been widely felt over the years .
some of the hotter topics of the late 1970s - women 's rights , women 's status in the catholic church - have cooled down , to be replaced by issues like eating disorders , genital mutilation and islam 's treatment of women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first issue of emma , in 1977 others issues , like prostitution and pornography -lrb- the magazine led a famed " porno " campaign for years , -rrb- remain " constant topics " according to kühte . anyone seeking objective journalism would do well to stay away from emma .
the magazine avoids dry , theoretical discussion and instead infuses its articles with an opinionated , and decidedly activist , stance . of sex abuse , " porno " and equal pay emma has kept women 's issues at the center of debate because it " was always provocative , it did n't try to fit in with social norms , " kühte said .
" it took on emotionally important and polarizing themes and was very dogmatic about it . " indeed , both schwarzer and her magazine have made headlines over the years .
in 1978 , she and nine other women sued the weekly magazine stern for its sexist cover shots -lrb- she lost -rrb- .
in 1978 , the magazine also broke a taboo by reporting on sexual abuse , and in the early 1980s it was the first to push the topic of eating disorders out of the home and into the headlines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : images of women in the media have long been a topic for emma in 2000 , the magazine , which had long agitated for equal rights in the military , celebrated the first woman bundeswehr soldier . in the last election cycle , emma threw its weight behind conservative candidate angela merkel - not for her politics , but for her gender .
germany now has its first madam chancellor . " from the very beginning , we promoted the notion of role models , " schwarzer said . after 30 years of publishing , what does the future hold for emma ?
schwarzer aims to continue , and there has been joking talk of finding a replacement editor .
but many people in germany share the opinion of kühte , who says : " emma without alice schwarzer is unimaginable .

" he said that stepping up transparency on the one hand and introducing regulators to referee disputes on the other would create a " double system that should allow for fee costs to be moderate . " the european commission presented draft legislation to make airport charges more transparent and non-discriminatory . " everything we 've done here is designed to bring down the costs of airport fees and , hence , the costs of travelling by air for passengers , " transport commissioner jacques barrot told a news conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt 's airport fees are among the highest in europe the airport fees , which make up four to eight percent of airlines ' operating costs , are paid for take-offs and landings , parking , security and passenger handling .
the costs are passed on to passengers in fees that are added on to ticket prices . according to the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- , 15 of the 25 most expensive airports are in europe , with frankfurt and athens airports among the top .
paris ' charles de gaulle airport was singled out as being the worst offender for increasing its charges by 26.5 percent over five years . airlines are angry that airport fees have taken off in recent years while they have struggled to cut costs . independent regulator barrot said the independent regulator system was already in place and working in britain and that governments should not be handed the role because they " sometimes favor one company or might want to privatize an airport ... and to boost its revenues " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tickets might seem cheap , but beware the hidden charges the commission came up with its proposals only after " extremely thorough talks " with airport authorities and airlines , barrot stressed . the airlines argued that many european airports had substantially increased their charges in recent years , and while they themselves had continued to offer low cost flights in a cut-throat industry . the airports argue that the rising charges are forced on them by the need to adapt to accommodate increasing air traffic and meet new security requirements in the wake of the sept .

the company will also close production sites in the us and germany - reducing its manufacturing plants from 93 to 48 - as well as shut down research centers in japan and france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pfizer 's under pressure pfizer chief executive jeffrey kindler said the company needed to cut costs because it expected its profits to stagnate over the next two years and be roughly comparable to the $ 48.4 billion -lrb- 37 billion euros -rrb- it reported for 2006 .
analysts predict that profits will drop by almost 40 percent . " we are facing significant challenges in a profoundly changing business environment , " kindler said in a statement .
" i believe we must fundamentally change the way we run our company to meet these challenges . " boom time over for pfizer ? things were n't always this way for pfizer .
the drug giant can look back on an illustrious past .
the company has long been considered a shining model of a successful multinational . founded by german chemist karl pfizer in new york in 1849 , the company became the world leader , especially in " blockbuster " drugs , which refers to medicines that rake in earnings worth over a billion dollars a year . in its heyday , the company 's product palette was largely associated with superlatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pfizer created a sensation with viagra pfizer created the world 's most famous pill , the erectile dysfunction drug viagra .
its number one drug , lipitor , which is used to lower blood cholesterol , is the world 's most lucrative pill . in 2004 , pfizer had a yearly turnover of $ 52.52 billion , the world 's biggest research and development budget and a 38,000-strong sales army . no new blockbuster drugs in sight but that golden age is past .
over the next few years , patent protection for a number of its drugs - which once earned pfizer billions - is set to expire .
that means that pfizer will then lose its monopoly , usually set for a period of 20 years , over producing those drugs - much to the joy of makers of generic medicines . pfizer has been suffering from the loss of patent protection on key drugs like the antidepressant zoloft and the antibiotic zithromax .
sales of both drugs plunged more than 70 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006 , the company said . the company 's problems are compounded by the fact that pfizer 's labs have not produced a single hit despite an annual research budget of $ 7 billion . even viagra , pfizer 's last big success , is almost a decade old .
in december , pfizer had to stop development of torcetrapib , a promising cardiovascular drug , because of dangerous side-effects .
torcetrapib was meant to bring pfizer $ 10 billion yearly . cut-throat competition pfizer 's problems are n't new in the pharmaceutical industry .
competition from makers of generic drugs remains a problem for most big drug companies .
but streamlining operations does n't seem to hold all the answers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : generic drugs are putting the squeeze on firms like pfizer pfizer 's current belt-tightening is the second time in two years that the drug giant has embarked on a serious cost-cutting strategy . many experts forecast a takeover war in the pharmaceutical industry , with big players forgoing producing new drugs and instead looking to buy innovative biotechnology competitors who could develop new medicines . markus preissner , head of the research division for drug distribution at the university of cologne , said that competition between the producers of original drugs and those of generic drugs was absolutely cut-throat . " if there are copycat products , the original drug is much more difficult to sell , " preissner said . compromising on quality preissner warned that the bargain-hunting mentality of consumers did n't augur well for the quality of future drugs . " when drugs do n't cost much , they ca n't be of high quality , " he said . tido von schön-angerer from the german chapter of aid organization doctors without borders said that hugely expensive product marketing was largely responsible for the high costs of original drugs .
thus , research and development often falls by the wayside as in the case of pfizer , von schön-angerer pointed out . " even patent protection is no guarantee for urgently needed innovation , " he said , adding that it was particularly true when it came to developing drugs for diseases in poor countries . andreas leixnering -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de second time around for discount pharmacy chain docmorris , the dutch discount pharmacy chain , has found a loophole to get around germany 's powerful lobby of pharmacists .

dw 's reporter marco vollmar spoke to one of its participants , german steel magnate jürgen großman . " the spirit of davos does n't just float around , " said german steel baron jürgen großmann .
" you have to look for it in the conversations . " jürgen großmann is one of the 2,500 participants in the davos world economic forum , together with 800 corporate chief executives or chairmen , 24 heads of state or government and 85 cabinet ministers .
großman , who is the managing partner of georgsmarienhütte holding - a global producer of high-grade structural steel - knows that networking and personal contacts are essential for doing business .
that is why he has been attending the economic forum in the swiss skiing resort for 15 years . " there are indian entrepreneurs in my field who are buying shares in german forges and foundries , " großmann said .
" you get to know them here , you start talking to them and you ask them what it is that they really want : are interested in acquiring a production line in germany or do they just want to pull out the know-how and do everything in india ? " " you get to know these things much better after you 've met the people , " großmann said . rubbing shoulders with the leaders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel opened the five-day brainstorming session of political and economic leaders after german chancellor angela merkel officially opened the davos forum on wednesday , großmann met her unofficially , behind the scenes .

" but what about the international consensus on nuclear energy ?
germany seems to be willing to go its own way there .
i strongly doubt that that would be appropriate for our basic industry . " the coalition of german socialist democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the green party under former chancellor gerhard schröder reached a ground-breaking agreement that all of germany 's nuclear power plants would be shut down by 2020 . " we 're happy , of course , about having access to cheap electricity through german nuclear power plants .
it would be sad , i think , if we could only get cheap electricity from abroad in the near future , " großmann said . bildunterschrift : davos is an ideal setting for high-level networking no fear of globalization with 9,000 employees , großmann 's steel empire made a turnover of 2,2 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.9 billion -rrb- and cashed in hefty profits in 2006 - all that in a field known for its fierce competition worldwide , massive mergers and rapid technological progress . in the face of globalization and new players from india and china , großmann remains confident . " we 've been the globalization champion and main winner of globalization for more than 40 years , " großmann said .
" we ca n't now , all of a sudden , when others are getting strong , say that we do n't want this anymore . " " furthermore , we 're interested in wealthy clients .
the richer our client countries are , the more stuff we sell them , especially cars and machines that germany makes lots of .

the company will also close production sites in the us and germany - reducing its manufacturing plants from 93 to 48 - as well as shut down research centers in japan and france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pfizer 's under pressure pfizer chief executive jeffrey kindler said the company needed to cut costs because it expected its profits to stagnate over the next two years and be roughly comparable to the $ 48.4 billion -lrb- 37 billion euros -rrb- it reported for 2006 .
analysts predict that profits will drop by almost 40 percent . " we are facing significant challenges in a profoundly changing business environment , " kindler said in a statement .
" i believe we must fundamentally change the way we run our company to meet these challenges . " boom time over for pfizer ? things were n't always this way for pfizer .
the drug giant can look back on an illustrious past .
the company has long been considered a shining model of a successful multinational . founded by german chemist karl pfizer in new york in 1849 , the company became the world leader , especially in " blockbuster " drugs , which refers to medicines that rake in earnings worth over a billion dollars a year . in its heyday , the company 's product palette was largely associated with superlatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pfizer created a sensation with viagra pfizer created the world 's most famous pill , the erectile dysfunction drug viagra .
its number one drug , lipitor , which is used to lower blood cholesterol , is the world 's most lucrative pill . in 2004 , pfizer had a yearly turnover of $ 52.52 billion , the world 's biggest research and development budget and a 38,000-strong sales army . no new blockbuster drugs in sight but that golden age is past .
over the next few years , patent protection for a number of its drugs - which once earned pfizer billions - is set to expire .
that means that pfizer will then lose its monopoly , usually set for a period of 20 years , over producing those drugs - much to the joy of makers of generic medicines . pfizer has been suffering from the loss of patent protection on key drugs like the antidepressant zoloft and the antibiotic zithromax .
sales of both drugs plunged more than 70 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006 , the company said . the company 's problems are compounded by the fact that pfizer 's labs have not produced a single hit despite an annual research budget of $ 7 billion . even viagra , pfizer 's last big success , is almost a decade old .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 25.01.2007 booming german economy set to take a short breather großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uptrend of the german economy is expected to remain intact the german economy looks set to ease up briefly amid its current boom in the early months of 2007 , but analysts agree that the slowdown will likely prove only short-lived and that the uptrend will continue . the widely watched business climate index , calculated each month by the munich-based economic research institute ifo , slipped to 107.9 points in january from the 16-year high of 108.7 points in december . at the same time , a monthly consumer sentiment index calculated by market research group gfk was forecast to fall to 4.8 points in february from 8.5 points in january . " the widely predicted deterioration in the consumer climate at the start of the new year has kicked in , " gfk found . " the tax shock and the anticipatory purchases in december had led to a drastic decline in consumers ' willingness to spend this month , " it explained . putting the breaks on household spending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the effects of the vat hike are beginning to be felt all over germany the german government raised sales tax by three full percentage points to 19 percent with effect from jan .
1 , in a move experts said would put the brakes on household spending and therefore on the economy as a whole . the sharp vat hike is now also hitting business confidence , the more important ifo business climate index showed . after topping a 16-year high in december , index fell surprisingly this month .
analysts had been penciling in a steady to slightly higher reading in january . but even after the decline , business confidence in germany remains at its second-highest level since january 1991 and the current upturn is not in jeopardy , ifo president hans-werner sinn said . " companies still reported a very positive current business situation , even if it was not quite so favorable as in the previous month , " sinn said . a good outlook bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup last summer gave an important boost to germany 's economic revival furthermore , companies were more confident with regard to the outlook for the next six months . " this indicates that after a brief pause , the cyclical recovery will continue in the coming months , " sinn said . gfk similarly predicted that the dip in consumer sentiment this month would prove only temporary .
income expectations were less pessimistic and economic expectations were continuing to develop positively , gfk noted . the government insisted that the fundamental upwards trend in the german economy was still intact . " the dampening effects on private consumption will be overcome quickly , " the economy ministry said in a statement .
" household spending would pick up again during the course of the year and contribute to overall growth . " an unbroken uptrend bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer confidence fell sharply in january analysts , too , insisted that the uptrend in both the german and eurozone economies remained unbroken . " the -lrb- ifo -rrb- index remains well above the long-term average and is still pointing to above trend growth in the eurozone , " said bank of america economist matthew sharratt . " the january decline only represents a modest correction .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 25.01.2007 " the oscar is an unbelievably powerful statue " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the director of the lives of others was ' relieved ' to be nominated for the oscar dw-world spoke with florian henckel von donnersmarck about how it feels to be nominated for an oscar for " the lives of others , " his film about an east german spy . " the lives of others " is an intense look at a committed east german secret police officer who gradually becomes disillusioned with the system he has worked to uphold , until he finally switches sides and tries to protect a woman he was assigned to spy on . the film was nominated for best foreign film at this year 's academy awards .
on wednesday , dw-world spoke with its director , florian henckel von donnersmarck . dw-world : congratulations on your film .
what was it like , hearing that you had been nominated for an oscar ? florian henckel von donnersmarck : i was very relieved , because i knew a lot of people were expecting it and hoping for it .
of course , the nomination was no longer dependent on me .
the battle that i am now getting recognition for is a battle i won two years ago .
but still , you naturally think you would have disappointed people if you were n't nominated . i 'm in france right now .
-lrb- on tuesday -rrb- i introduced my film at its premiere in toulouse .
and so of course the french opened up a big bottle of champagne , and immediately gave the printers instructions to make new posters with the words " nominated for the oscar , 2007 " on it . bildunterschrift : ulrich mühe plays a stasi agent whose life takes a surprising turn how has your film been received in france ? very well .
the french known an astonishing amount about the whole topic .
and they are putting a lot of energy behind the film ; there are 120 copies .
proportionally , that is approximately about as many as in germany , and of course i am very pleased , because the french are the opinion makers when it comes to international cinema .
for example when the french discovered the -lrb- austrian -rrb- director michael haneke , he suddenly became a very important director for us in germany . do german movies work well abroad ? even the most successful german films overseas are limited successes , compared with american movies .
for example , das boot -lrb- the boat -rrb- is the most successful german film in the usa .
it took in around 11 million dollars -lrb- xxxx -rrb- .
for an american film – even the littlest independent production – that would be considered a huge flop .
considering that , you ca n't really get your expectations too high .
but you reach a certain elite few who are open to culture , and that 's a good thing . but does your film work in terms of content ?
i mean , you have to know the historical background surrounding the story . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : florian henckel von donnersmarck you don ’ t really need to know german history so well in order to undsertand the film .
if so , i would have done something wrong , and the film would only be good for showing at universities .
i actually got the feeling that the americans are glad this film does n't just depict things in black and white .
i think right now the americans have the feeling that the current government 's painting everything black and white – like hwen it talks about the " axis of evil " – has n't been very helpful .
on the contrary .
and i think my film is a help , and that americans are more open for political-moral questions than they were five years ago or so . why is your film so successful ? my film talks about things that viewers around the world know and recognize .
along with the stasi -lrb- east german secret police -rrb- and the intelligence services , it is about overarching human questions : how does it feel when your private sphere is violated ?
how does it feel to deal with absolute power ?
how does it feel to be afraid ?
these are things that interest and touch everyone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mühe won best european actor 2006 for his role in the film how are you getting prepared for the oscars , which take place on feb .
25 ? of course , i 'm really excited , but i try to keep in mind that it is really out of my control , whether or not i win .
it depends on whether , and how , other people see my film , and i ca n't influence that .
people say it depends on propaganda , and how you campaign for it .
but that is n't true .
there are so many successful and important filmmakers on the panel , and they are n't influenced by who ran a bigger ad , or whether you gave an elegant speech somewhere .
they care about which films move them , and so i am just trying not to get too uptight about it . of course , it is totally clear to me that it would mean a big change in my life , if i won the oscar .
ask volker schlöndorff how it affected his life to win such a gigantic prize as the oscar so early in his career , for the 1980 filming of the tin drum .

" the lives of others " is an intense look at a committed east german secret police officer who gradually becomes disillusioned with the system he has worked to uphold , until he finally switches sides and tries to protect a woman he was assigned to spy on . the film was nominated for best foreign film at this year 's academy awards .
on wednesday , dw-world spoke with its director , florian henckel von donnersmarck . dw-world : congratulations on your film .
what was it like , hearing that you had been nominated for an oscar ? florian henckel von donnersmarck : i was very relieved , because i knew a lot of people were expecting it and hoping for it .
of course , the nomination was no longer dependent on me .
the battle that i am now getting recognition for is a battle i won two years ago .
but still , you naturally think you would have disappointed people if you were n't nominated . i 'm in france right now .
-lrb- on tuesday -rrb- i introduced my film at its premiere in toulouse .
and so of course the french opened up a big bottle of champagne , and immediately gave the printers instructions to make new posters with the words " nominated for the oscar , 2007 " on it . bildunterschrift : ulrich mühe plays a stasi agent whose life takes a surprising turn how has your film been received in france ? very well .
the french known an astonishing amount about the whole topic .
and they are putting a lot of energy behind the film ; there are 120 copies .
proportionally , that is approximately about as many as in germany , and of course i am very pleased , because the french are the opinion makers when it comes to international cinema .
for example when the french discovered the -lrb- austrian -rrb- director michael haneke , he suddenly became a very important director for us in germany . do german movies work well abroad ? even the most successful german films overseas are limited successes , compared with american movies .
for example , das boot -lrb- the boat -rrb- is the most successful german film in the usa .
it took in around 11 million dollars -lrb- xxxx -rrb- .
for an american film – even the littlest independent production – that would be considered a huge flop .
considering that , you ca n't really get your expectations too high .
but you reach a certain elite few who are open to culture , and that 's a good thing . but does your film work in terms of content ?
i mean , you have to know the historical background surrounding the story . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : florian henckel von donnersmarck you don ’ t really need to know german history so well in order to undsertand the film .
if so , i would have done something wrong , and the film would only be good for showing at universities .
i actually got the feeling that the americans are glad this film does n't just depict things in black and white .
i think right now the americans have the feeling that the current government 's painting everything black and white – like hwen it talks about the " axis of evil " – has n't been very helpful .
on the contrary .
and i think my film is a help , and that americans are more open for political-moral questions than they were five years ago or so . why is your film so successful ? my film talks about things that viewers around the world know and recognize .
along with the stasi -lrb- east german secret police -rrb- and the intelligence services , it is about overarching human questions : how does it feel when your private sphere is violated ?
how does it feel to deal with absolute power ?
how does it feel to be afraid ?
these are things that interest and touch everyone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mühe won best european actor 2006 for his role in the film how are you getting prepared for the oscars , which take place on feb .
25 ? of course , i 'm really excited , but i try to keep in mind that it is really out of my control , whether or not i win .
it depends on whether , and how , other people see my film , and i ca n't influence that .
people say it depends on propaganda , and how you campaign for it .
but that is n't true .
there are so many successful and important filmmakers on the panel , and they are n't influenced by who ran a bigger ad , or whether you gave an elegant speech somewhere .
they care about which films move them , and so i am just trying not to get too uptight about it . of course , it is totally clear to me that it would mean a big change in my life , if i won the oscar .
ask volker schlöndorff how it affected his life to win such a gigantic prize as the oscar so early in his career , for the 1980 filming of the tin drum .

" the lives of others " is an intense look at a committed east german secret police officer who gradually becomes disillusioned with the system he has worked to uphold , until he finally switches sides and tries to protect a woman he was assigned to spy on . the film was nominated for best foreign film at this year 's academy awards .
on wednesday , dw-world spoke with its director , florian henckel von donnersmarck . dw-world : congratulations on your film .
what was it like , hearing that you had been nominated for an oscar ? florian henckel von donnersmarck : i was very relieved , because i knew a lot of people were expecting it and hoping for it .
of course , the nomination was no longer dependent on me .
the battle that i am now getting recognition for is a battle i won two years ago .
but still , you naturally think you would have disappointed people if you were n't nominated . i 'm in france right now .
-lrb- on tuesday -rrb- i introduced my film at its premiere in toulouse .
and so of course the french opened up a big bottle of champagne , and immediately gave the printers instructions to make new posters with the words " nominated for the oscar , 2007 " on it . bildunterschrift : ulrich mühe plays a stasi agent whose life takes a surprising turn how has your film been received in france ? very well .
the french known an astonishing amount about the whole topic .
and they are putting a lot of energy behind the film ; there are 120 copies .
proportionally , that is approximately about as many as in germany , and of course i am very pleased , because the french are the opinion makers when it comes to international cinema .
for example when the french discovered the -lrb- austrian -rrb- director michael haneke , he suddenly became a very important director for us in germany . do german movies work well abroad ? even the most successful german films overseas are limited successes , compared with american movies .
for example , das boot -lrb- the boat -rrb- is the most successful german film in the usa .
it took in around 11 million dollars -lrb- xxxx -rrb- .
for an american film – even the littlest independent production – that would be considered a huge flop .
considering that , you ca n't really get your expectations too high .
but you reach a certain elite few who are open to culture , and that 's a good thing . but does your film work in terms of content ?
i mean , you have to know the historical background surrounding the story . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : florian henckel von donnersmarck you don ’ t really need to know german history so well in order to undsertand the film .
if so , i would have done something wrong , and the film would only be good for showing at universities .
i actually got the feeling that the americans are glad this film does n't just depict things in black and white .
i think right now the americans have the feeling that the current government 's painting everything black and white – like hwen it talks about the " axis of evil " – has n't been very helpful .
on the contrary .
and i think my film is a help , and that americans are more open for political-moral questions than they were five years ago or so . why is your film so successful ? my film talks about things that viewers around the world know and recognize .
along with the stasi -lrb- east german secret police -rrb- and the intelligence services , it is about overarching human questions : how does it feel when your private sphere is violated ?
how does it feel to deal with absolute power ?
how does it feel to be afraid ?
these are things that interest and touch everyone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mühe won best european actor 2006 for his role in the film how are you getting prepared for the oscars , which take place on feb .
25 ? of course , i 'm really excited , but i try to keep in mind that it is really out of my control , whether or not i win .
it depends on whether , and how , other people see my film , and i ca n't influence that .
people say it depends on propaganda , and how you campaign for it .
but that is n't true .
there are so many successful and important filmmakers on the panel , and they are n't influenced by who ran a bigger ad , or whether you gave an elegant speech somewhere .
they care about which films move them , and so i am just trying not to get too uptight about it . of course , it is totally clear to me that it would mean a big change in my life , if i won the oscar .
ask volker schlöndorff how it affected his life to win such a gigantic prize as the oscar so early in his career , for the 1980 filming of the tin drum .
this is really an unbelievably powerful statute . ina rottscheidt spoke with florian henckel von donnersmarck -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jewish filmmaker breaks taboos with hitler send-up both german and jewish sensitivities are to face a severe test next month with the launch of a comedy movie in german that turns nazi dictator adolf hitler into a clown with 90 minutes of juvenile jokes .

-lrb- on tuesday -rrb- i introduced my film at its premiere in toulouse .
and so of course the french opened up a big bottle of champagne , and immediately gave the printers instructions to make new posters with the words " nominated for the oscar , 2007 " on it . bildunterschrift : ulrich mühe plays a stasi agent whose life takes a surprising turn how has your film been received in france ? very well .
the french known an astonishing amount about the whole topic .
and they are putting a lot of energy behind the film ; there are 120 copies .
proportionally , that is approximately about as many as in germany , and of course i am very pleased , because the french are the opinion makers when it comes to international cinema .
for example when the french discovered the -lrb- austrian -rrb- director michael haneke , he suddenly became a very important director for us in germany . do german movies work well abroad ? even the most successful german films overseas are limited successes , compared with american movies .
for example , das boot -lrb- the boat -rrb- is the most successful german film in the usa .
it took in around 11 million dollars -lrb- xxxx -rrb- .
for an american film – even the littlest independent production – that would be considered a huge flop .
considering that , you ca n't really get your expectations too high .
but you reach a certain elite few who are open to culture , and that 's a good thing . but does your film work in terms of content ?
i mean , you have to know the historical background surrounding the story . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : florian henckel von donnersmarck you don ’ t really need to know german history so well in order to undsertand the film .
if so , i would have done something wrong , and the film would only be good for showing at universities .
i actually got the feeling that the americans are glad this film does n't just depict things in black and white .
i think right now the americans have the feeling that the current government 's painting everything black and white – like hwen it talks about the " axis of evil " – has n't been very helpful .
on the contrary .
and i think my film is a help , and that americans are more open for political-moral questions than they were five years ago or so . why is your film so successful ? my film talks about things that viewers around the world know and recognize .
along with the stasi -lrb- east german secret police -rrb- and the intelligence services , it is about overarching human questions : how does it feel when your private sphere is violated ?
how does it feel to deal with absolute power ?
how does it feel to be afraid ?
these are things that interest and touch everyone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mühe won best european actor 2006 for his role in the film how are you getting prepared for the oscars , which take place on feb .
25 ? of course , i 'm really excited , but i try to keep in mind that it is really out of my control , whether or not i win .
it depends on whether , and how , other people see my film , and i ca n't influence that .
people say it depends on propaganda , and how you campaign for it .
but that is n't true .
there are so many successful and important filmmakers on the panel , and they are n't influenced by who ran a bigger ad , or whether you gave an elegant speech somewhere .
they care about which films move them , and so i am just trying not to get too uptight about it . of course , it is totally clear to me that it would mean a big change in my life , if i won the oscar .
ask volker schlöndorff how it affected his life to win such a gigantic prize as the oscar so early in his career , for the 1980 filming of the tin drum .
this is really an unbelievably powerful statute . ina rottscheidt spoke with florian henckel von donnersmarck -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jewish filmmaker breaks taboos with hitler send-up both german and jewish sensitivities are to face a severe test next month with the launch of a comedy movie in german that turns nazi dictator adolf hitler into a clown with 90 minutes of juvenile jokes .

she said that abbas had welcomed the fact that the so-called mideast quartet of the us , russia , the un and the eu was to revive its efforts . merkel said her meeting with the palestinian leader would be followed by talks scheduled in early february in egypt and saudi arabia .
she said abbas had said he hope the peace process would now go forward again , one linked with a time frame . " we consider ourselves obliged to lead in a supportive manner , " merkel commented and said that the eu would support abbas ' aim to establish a government of national unity .

" the widely predicted deterioration in the consumer climate at the start of the new year has kicked in , " gfk found . " the tax shock and the anticipatory purchases in december had led to a drastic decline in consumers ' willingness to spend this month , " it explained . putting the breaks on household spending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the effects of the vat hike are beginning to be felt all over germany the german government raised sales tax by three full percentage points to 19 percent with effect from jan .

analysts had been penciling in a steady to slightly higher reading in january . but even after the decline , business confidence in germany remains at its second-highest level since january 1991 and the current upturn is not in jeopardy , ifo president hans-werner sinn said . " companies still reported a very positive current business situation , even if it was not quite so favorable as in the previous month , " sinn said . a good outlook bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup last summer gave an important boost to germany 's economic revival furthermore , companies were more confident with regard to the outlook for the next six months . " this indicates that after a brief pause , the cyclical recovery will continue in the coming months , " sinn said . gfk similarly predicted that the dip in consumer sentiment this month would prove only temporary .
income expectations were less pessimistic and economic expectations were continuing to develop positively , gfk noted . the government insisted that the fundamental upwards trend in the german economy was still intact . " the dampening effects on private consumption will be overcome quickly , " the economy ministry said in a statement .
" household spending would pick up again during the course of the year and contribute to overall growth . " an unbroken uptrend bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer confidence fell sharply in january analysts , too , insisted that the uptrend in both the german and eurozone economies remained unbroken . " the -lrb- ifo -rrb- index remains well above the long-term average and is still pointing to above trend growth in the eurozone , " said bank of america economist matthew sharratt . " the january decline only represents a modest correction .
the data are consistent with our expectation that the german economic upswing is likely to take a breather in the first quarter of 2007 but will return to above-trend growth in the second half , " sharratt said . raising interest rates ? ixis economist sylvain broyer said the latest ifo and gfk confidence data , coupled with steady business confidence in france , pointed to a " marked air pocket in activity during the first half of this year , re-accelerating somewhat in the second half .

over the years , both the magazine and its mediagenic founder , alice schwarzer , have spent a fair share of time in the spotlight . the first issue of emma went on sale at newsstands on jan .
26 , 1977 .
the magazine , written " by women , for women , " is inextricably tied to the name and image of alice schwarzer , germany 's best-known feminist . by founding emma - to german ears , the name unmistakably evokes the word of " emancipation " - the well-known journalist provided a nation in the throes of feminist activism with a popular forum for discussing staple women 's issues .
abortion , equal rights , pornography and prostitution were all early fodder for the monthly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the magazine supported angela merkel in her run for office " emma was born in the classic political agitation of the 1970s , " schwarzer said , " … and it has managed to develop in a lively and open fashion over the past 30 years . " key to success : schwarzer " lively and open " may be putting it mildly .
exploiting an uncanny knack for publicity , schwarzer - the magazine 's publisher , editor and driving force - has seen to it that the magazine and its topics have never strayed far from the german media spotlight . " alice schwarzer was already germany 's best-known women 's rights activists before she began publishing emma , " said dr. alexandra kühte , who published her dissertation on the image of women in emma two years ago .

" it took on emotionally important and polarizing themes and was very dogmatic about it . " indeed , both schwarzer and her magazine have made headlines over the years .
in 1978 , she and nine other women sued the weekly magazine stern for its sexist cover shots -lrb- she lost -rrb- .
in 1978 , the magazine also broke a taboo by reporting on sexual abuse , and in the early 1980s it was the first to push the topic of eating disorders out of the home and into the headlines . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : images of women in the media have long been a topic for emma in 2000 , the magazine , which had long agitated for equal rights in the military , celebrated the first woman bundeswehr soldier . in the last election cycle , emma threw its weight behind conservative candidate angela merkel - not for her politics , but for her gender .

" he said that stepping up transparency on the one hand and introducing regulators to referee disputes on the other would create a " double system that should allow for fee costs to be moderate . " the european commission presented draft legislation to make airport charges more transparent and non-discriminatory . " everything we 've done here is designed to bring down the costs of airport fees and , hence , the costs of travelling by air for passengers , " transport commissioner jacques barrot told a news conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt 's airport fees are among the highest in europe the airport fees , which make up four to eight percent of airlines ' operating costs , are paid for take-offs and landings , parking , security and passenger handling .
the costs are passed on to passengers in fees that are added on to ticket prices . according to the international air transport association -lrb- iata -rrb- , 15 of the 25 most expensive airports are in europe , with frankfurt and athens airports among the top .
paris ' charles de gaulle airport was singled out as being the worst offender for increasing its charges by 26.5 percent over five years . airlines are angry that airport fees have taken off in recent years while they have struggled to cut costs . independent regulator barrot said the independent regulator system was already in place and working in britain and that governments should not be handed the role because they " sometimes favor one company or might want to privatize an airport ... and to boost its revenues " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tickets might seem cheap , but beware the hidden charges the commission came up with its proposals only after " extremely thorough talks " with airport authorities and airlines , barrot stressed . the airlines argued that many european airports had substantially increased their charges in recent years , and while they themselves had continued to offer low cost flights in a cut-throat industry . the airports argue that the rising charges are forced on them by the need to adapt to accommodate increasing air traffic and meet new security requirements in the wake of the sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 25.01.2007 booming german economy set to take a short breather großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uptrend of the german economy is expected to remain intact the german economy looks set to ease up briefly amid its current boom in the early months of 2007 , but analysts agree that the slowdown will likely prove only short-lived and that the uptrend will continue . the widely watched business climate index , calculated each month by the munich-based economic research institute ifo , slipped to 107.9 points in january from the 16-year high of 108.7 points in december . at the same time , a monthly consumer sentiment index calculated by market research group gfk was forecast to fall to 4.8 points in february from 8.5 points in january . " the widely predicted deterioration in the consumer climate at the start of the new year has kicked in , " gfk found . " the tax shock and the anticipatory purchases in december had led to a drastic decline in consumers ' willingness to spend this month , " it explained . putting the breaks on household spending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the effects of the vat hike are beginning to be felt all over germany the german government raised sales tax by three full percentage points to 19 percent with effect from jan .
1 , in a move experts said would put the brakes on household spending and therefore on the economy as a whole . the sharp vat hike is now also hitting business confidence , the more important ifo business climate index showed . after topping a 16-year high in december , index fell surprisingly this month .
analysts had been penciling in a steady to slightly higher reading in january . but even after the decline , business confidence in germany remains at its second-highest level since january 1991 and the current upturn is not in jeopardy , ifo president hans-werner sinn said . " companies still reported a very positive current business situation , even if it was not quite so favorable as in the previous month , " sinn said . a good outlook bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup last summer gave an important boost to germany 's economic revival furthermore , companies were more confident with regard to the outlook for the next six months . " this indicates that after a brief pause , the cyclical recovery will continue in the coming months , " sinn said . gfk similarly predicted that the dip in consumer sentiment this month would prove only temporary .
income expectations were less pessimistic and economic expectations were continuing to develop positively , gfk noted . the government insisted that the fundamental upwards trend in the german economy was still intact . " the dampening effects on private consumption will be overcome quickly , " the economy ministry said in a statement .
" household spending would pick up again during the course of the year and contribute to overall growth . " an unbroken uptrend bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer confidence fell sharply in january analysts , too , insisted that the uptrend in both the german and eurozone economies remained unbroken . " the -lrb- ifo -rrb- index remains well above the long-term average and is still pointing to above trend growth in the eurozone , " said bank of america economist matthew sharratt . " the january decline only represents a modest correction .
the data are consistent with our expectation that the german economic upswing is likely to take a breather in the first quarter of 2007 but will return to above-trend growth in the second half , " sharratt said . raising interest rates ? ixis economist sylvain broyer said the latest ifo and gfk confidence data , coupled with steady business confidence in france , pointed to a " marked air pocket in activity during the first half of this year , re-accelerating somewhat in the second half . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the europan central bank may increase its key interest rates with inflationary dangers still not completely banished , the european central bank will , according to broyer , " remain hawkish for a while . " nordlb analyst tobias basse similarly predicted that the ecb would " stick to its guns and raise its key interest rates by a quarter of percentage point in march .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 25.01.2007 booming german economy set to take a short breather großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uptrend of the german economy is expected to remain intact the german economy looks set to ease up briefly amid its current boom in the early months of 2007 , but analysts agree that the slowdown will likely prove only short-lived and that the uptrend will continue . the widely watched business climate index , calculated each month by the munich-based economic research institute ifo , slipped to 107.9 points in january from the 16-year high of 108.7 points in december . at the same time , a monthly consumer sentiment index calculated by market research group gfk was forecast to fall to 4.8 points in february from 8.5 points in january . " the widely predicted deterioration in the consumer climate at the start of the new year has kicked in , " gfk found . " the tax shock and the anticipatory purchases in december had led to a drastic decline in consumers ' willingness to spend this month , " it explained . putting the breaks on household spending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the effects of the vat hike are beginning to be felt all over germany the german government raised sales tax by three full percentage points to 19 percent with effect from jan .
1 , in a move experts said would put the brakes on household spending and therefore on the economy as a whole . the sharp vat hike is now also hitting business confidence , the more important ifo business climate index showed . after topping a 16-year high in december , index fell surprisingly this month .
analysts had been penciling in a steady to slightly higher reading in january . but even after the decline , business confidence in germany remains at its second-highest level since january 1991 and the current upturn is not in jeopardy , ifo president hans-werner sinn said . " companies still reported a very positive current business situation , even if it was not quite so favorable as in the previous month , " sinn said . a good outlook bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup last summer gave an important boost to germany 's economic revival furthermore , companies were more confident with regard to the outlook for the next six months . " this indicates that after a brief pause , the cyclical recovery will continue in the coming months , " sinn said . gfk similarly predicted that the dip in consumer sentiment this month would prove only temporary .
income expectations were less pessimistic and economic expectations were continuing to develop positively , gfk noted . the government insisted that the fundamental upwards trend in the german economy was still intact . " the dampening effects on private consumption will be overcome quickly , " the economy ministry said in a statement .
" household spending would pick up again during the course of the year and contribute to overall growth . " an unbroken uptrend bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer confidence fell sharply in january analysts , too , insisted that the uptrend in both the german and eurozone economies remained unbroken . " the -lrb- ifo -rrb- index remains well above the long-term average and is still pointing to above trend growth in the eurozone , " said bank of america economist matthew sharratt . " the january decline only represents a modest correction .
the data are consistent with our expectation that the german economic upswing is likely to take a breather in the first quarter of 2007 but will return to above-trend growth in the second half , " sharratt said . raising interest rates ? ixis economist sylvain broyer said the latest ifo and gfk confidence data , coupled with steady business confidence in france , pointed to a " marked air pocket in activity during the first half of this year , re-accelerating somewhat in the second half . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the europan central bank may increase its key interest rates with inflationary dangers still not completely banished , the european central bank will , according to broyer , " remain hawkish for a while . " nordlb analyst tobias basse similarly predicted that the ecb would " stick to its guns and raise its key interest rates by a quarter of percentage point in march .

an additional 100 million euros will be given to lebanon in grants and loans , commission officials said . the eu aid package is designed to cover the period until 2010 and will concentrate on help for fiscal reform and public finance management , better conditions for private business , job creation and social development . help to recover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parts of beirut were severely damaged during the war the commission said the eu wanted to help lebanon cover the costs of last summer 's war between lebanese shiite militia group hezbollah and israel , which crippled the economy . however , the eu was also seeking to lay the groundwork for a longer term recovery through support for crucial political and economic reforms .

the company will also close production sites in the us and germany - reducing its manufacturing plants from 93 to 48 - as well as shut down research centers in japan and france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pfizer 's under pressure pfizer chief executive jeffrey kindler said the company needed to cut costs because it expected its profits to stagnate over the next two years and be roughly comparable to the $ 48.4 billion -lrb- 37 billion euros -rrb- it reported for 2006 .
analysts predict that profits will drop by almost 40 percent . " we are facing significant challenges in a profoundly changing business environment , " kindler said in a statement .
" i believe we must fundamentally change the way we run our company to meet these challenges . " boom time over for pfizer ? things were n't always this way for pfizer .
the drug giant can look back on an illustrious past .
the company has long been considered a shining model of a successful multinational . founded by german chemist karl pfizer in new york in 1849 , the company became the world leader , especially in " blockbuster " drugs , which refers to medicines that rake in earnings worth over a billion dollars a year . in its heyday , the company 's product palette was largely associated with superlatives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pfizer created a sensation with viagra pfizer created the world 's most famous pill , the erectile dysfunction drug viagra .
its number one drug , lipitor , which is used to lower blood cholesterol , is the world 's most lucrative pill . in 2004 , pfizer had a yearly turnover of $ 52.52 billion , the world 's biggest research and development budget and a 38,000-strong sales army . no new blockbuster drugs in sight but that golden age is past .
over the next few years , patent protection for a number of its drugs - which once earned pfizer billions - is set to expire .
that means that pfizer will then lose its monopoly , usually set for a period of 20 years , over producing those drugs - much to the joy of makers of generic medicines . pfizer has been suffering from the loss of patent protection on key drugs like the antidepressant zoloft and the antibiotic zithromax .
sales of both drugs plunged more than 70 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006 , the company said . the company 's problems are compounded by the fact that pfizer 's labs have not produced a single hit despite an annual research budget of $ 7 billion . even viagra , pfizer 's last big success , is almost a decade old .
in december , pfizer had to stop development of torcetrapib , a promising cardiovascular drug , because of dangerous side-effects .
torcetrapib was meant to bring pfizer $ 10 billion yearly . cut-throat competition pfizer 's problems are n't new in the pharmaceutical industry .
competition from makers of generic drugs remains a problem for most big drug companies .
but streamlining operations does n't seem to hold all the answers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : generic drugs are putting the squeeze on firms like pfizer pfizer 's current belt-tightening is the second time in two years that the drug giant has embarked on a serious cost-cutting strategy . many experts forecast a takeover war in the pharmaceutical industry , with big players forgoing producing new drugs and instead looking to buy innovative biotechnology competitors who could develop new medicines . markus preissner , head of the research division for drug distribution at the university of cologne , said that competition between the producers of original drugs and those of generic drugs was absolutely cut-throat . " if there are copycat products , the original drug is much more difficult to sell , " preissner said . compromising on quality preissner warned that the bargain-hunting mentality of consumers did n't augur well for the quality of future drugs . " when drugs do n't cost much , they ca n't be of high quality , " he said . tido von schön-angerer from the german chapter of aid organization doctors without borders said that hugely expensive product marketing was largely responsible for the high costs of original drugs .
thus , research and development often falls by the wayside as in the case of pfizer , von schön-angerer pointed out . " even patent protection is no guarantee for urgently needed innovation , " he said , adding that it was particularly true when it came to developing drugs for diseases in poor countries . andreas leixnering -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de second time around for discount pharmacy chain docmorris , the dutch discount pharmacy chain , has found a loophole to get around germany 's powerful lobby of pharmacists .

mr putin will meet prime minister manmohan singh and other indian leaders during his two-day trip .
on the eve of the visit , russia and india signed two deals on the production and joint development of aircraft and fighter plane engines .
russia is also offering to build four nuclear power reactors in india .
the two countries have had close links since soviet times , with india remaining a top buyer of russian weaponry .
however , the relationship faces new challenges , including competition from the west and the growing economic and military might of china signing new co-operation agreements with his indian counterpart on wednesday , russia 's defence minister , sergei ivanov , said a close and trusting relationship with india remained a top priority .
' strategic triangle ' russia is currently bidding to supply more than 120 fighter planes to delhi .
moscow faces stiff competition from western manufacturers , leading a top russian official to warn of " consequences " should india choose a western manufacturer .
russia and india are also rapidly deepening co-operation in the energy sector .
russia has identified india as a new market for its civilian nuclear technology , with russian engineers already building two reactors in india .
for its part , india has declared an interest in securing a stake in future russian oil and gas field developments .
future plans aside , businessmen from both countries say urgent action is needed to tackle insurmountable bureaucracy .
the bbc 's russian affairs analyst steven eke says when weapons are left out of the equation , trade between russia and india has actually fallen to its lowest level for more than two decades .
nonetheless , many russian diplomats see a special place for india , our analyst says .
they have repeatedly raised the idea of a strategic triangle , uniting russia , india and china , in an axis opposed to the global dominance of the united states .
it has been stymied by realities on the ground , including the fact that russia and india are both wary of china 's status as an emerging economic and military super-power , our analyst adds .

orchestra director david murray said : " at the moment , we occupy a studio at bbc broadcasting house in cardiff that was built 40 years ago for an orchestra half the present size .
" the move to the wales millennium centre means that , for the first time , we will have a state-of-the-art recording space with the opportunity to stage studio concerts involving the full orchestra , chorus and an audience . "
the orchestra performs dozens of live concerts each year across the uk and overseas .
it is currently on a major tour of the united states .

mr howard said water security was the country 's biggest challenge and the federal government wanted to take over the murray-darling river system .
the state governments of queensland , new south wales , south australia and victoria share its management now .
the idea , coming in an election year , could spark a political row .
mr howard 's critics says he looking for ways to improve his image on the environment , where he is best known as one of the few developed world leaders to have refused to sign the kyoto protocol on climate change .
mr howard addressed the issue in a speech on the eve of australia day .
" i regard myself as a climate-change realist .
that means looking at the evidence as it emerges and responding with policies that preserve australia 's competitiveness and play to her strengths , " he said .
' parochial differences ' the bbc 's nick bryant , in sydney , says the murray-darling river system is the country 's most precious water resource and provides supplies for most of australia 's irrigated farm land .
the four state governments which manage it are controlled by the opposition labor party , which has argued that the new proposals represent an unacceptable power grab by the prime minister .
mr howard wants the federal government to take over , in what would be the biggest reform of water management in the country 's history .
he believes that the present system of management is overly bureaucratic , a problem highlighted by the severe drought - the worst on record .
" this is our great opportunity to fix a great national problem , " he said .
" it can only be solved if we surmount our parochial differences , " he said .
the murray-darling takeover would cost a $ 3bn .
mr howard 's plan also envisages spending $ 6bn on modernising irrigation infrastructure and a $ 1.5bn on water saving for farmers .
the plan is the second indication in a week that mr howard is putting the environment at the centre of his re-election campaign .
on tuesday he announced a new environment minister , malcolm turnbull , a former merchant banker best known for his failed attempt to make australia a republic in a 1999 referendum .
mr howard is expected to call an election in the second half of the year , and his coalition currently trails labor in opinion polls .

a detailed model of sir edwin lutyens 's design for liverpool 's catholic cathedral has been restored by experts at the city 's walker art gallery .
building work did start with the crypt , which became the current cathedral after the design was never finished .
the architectural model , believed to be one of the biggest and most elaborate made , is now going on display .
restorers used a platform to complete the fine detail .

forest whitaker has already won a golden globe for his performance in the last king of scotland .
it charts the fictional relationship between amin and a young , excited scottish doctor , played by james mcavoy .
whitaker is now odds-on to follow it with the best actor oscar .
the actor went to the extent of learning swahili for the role - taking him four months to lose the ugandan accent after filming ended - as well as watching endless hours of footage of amin 's speeches .
he also hung around the market in the capital kampala , meeting people who knew the dictator .
" everyone had stories , " he told bbc world service 's on screen programme .
" many of the people i met had a dual feeling of him in the first place - some had relatives who had been killed during the regime , but there remained the feeling that he had also done certain great things for the country .
" that reconciliation was something that i needed to understand in order to play the character . "
jovial and charismatic whitaker 's performance has been particularly praised for capturing amin 's mannerisms and voice so much that he gives an utterly convincing performance despite not actually resembling the dictator very much .
" we do n't really look alike - i 'm three shades lighter than him , 40-50lbs lighter than him , my face structure is different , " he said .
" luckily , i suppose that people felt the spirit of the man came across - and that 's great . "
indeed , critics have noted at many points in the film , the man whose regime is estimated to have killed 300,000 people appears as pleasant , entertaining company .
" when i looked at the interviews and some of the documentaries that were made about him , i was struck by that ability he had to be jovial , to bring people in , to be charismatic , " whitaker said .
" that was something i borrowed from the research . "
in fact , the film 's director , kevin macdonald , has said that he feared this more jovial side might dominate , and that whitaker was not " dark-minded " enough to play amin .
the actor said that had to find " areas of paranoia , fear and , at times , anger " in his performance , and was grateful that macdonald moved production to uganda early to give him time to prepare .
whitaker added he had come to realise some of the difficulties for amin , with hostile countries around and other leaders trying to kill him , coupled with his confusion of trying to lead the country with his simple soldier background .
" you can understand how some of these things could have occurred , " he added .
meanwhile , he said that while he was very happy with the talk about a potential oscar , he did not know what to expect .
" it 's always great when people talk well about your work , " he added .
" you certainly do n't know what will happen after the nominations .
" you just try to live in the positive energy that people seem to be putting out around me and my work - and around this film , because i think that kind of talk helps the film . "

forest whitaker has already won a golden globe for his performance in the last king of scotland .
it charts the fictional relationship between amin and a young , excited scottish doctor , played by james mcavoy .
whitaker is now odds-on to follow it with the best actor oscar .
the actor went to the extent of learning swahili for the role - taking him four months to lose the ugandan accent after filming ended - as well as watching endless hours of footage of amin 's speeches .
he also hung around the market in the capital kampala , meeting people who knew the dictator .
" everyone had stories , " he told bbc world service 's on screen programme .
" many of the people i met had a dual feeling of him in the first place - some had relatives who had been killed during the regime , but there remained the feeling that he had also done certain great things for the country .
" that reconciliation was something that i needed to understand in order to play the character . "
jovial and charismatic whitaker 's performance has been particularly praised for capturing amin 's mannerisms and voice so much that he gives an utterly convincing performance despite not actually resembling the dictator very much .
" we do n't really look alike - i 'm three shades lighter than him , 40-50lbs lighter than him , my face structure is different , " he said .
the golden globes are seen as indicators for the oscars " luckily , i suppose that people felt the spirit of the man came across - and that 's great . "
indeed , critics have noted at many points in the film , the man whose regime is estimated to have killed 300,000 people appears as pleasant , entertaining company .
" when i looked at the interviews and some of the documentaries that were made about him , i was struck by that ability he had to be jovial , to bring people in , to be charismatic , " whitaker said .
" that was something i borrowed from the research . "
in fact , the film 's director , kevin macdonald , has said that he feared this more jovial side might dominate , and that whitaker was not " dark-minded " enough to play amin .
the actor said that had to find " areas of paranoia , fear and , at times , anger " in his performance , and was grateful that macdonald moved production to uganda early to give him time to prepare .
whitaker added he had come to realise some of the difficulties for amin , with hostile countries around and other leaders trying to kill him , coupled with his confusion of trying to lead the country with his simple soldier background .
" you can understand how some of these things could have occurred , " he added .
meanwhile , he said that while he was very happy with the talk about a potential oscar , he did not know what to expect .
" it 's always great when people talk well about your work , " he added .
" you certainly do n't know what will happen after the nominations .
" you just try to live in the positive energy that people seem to be putting out around me and my work - and around this film , because i think that kind of talk helps the film . "

bbc news -pipe- africa -pipe- q & a : gambian legislative elections bbc news / africa graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- thursday , 25 january 2007 , 08:45 gmt q & a : gambian legislative elections voters in the tiny west african state of gambia go to the polls on 25 january to elect new members of parliament for another five-year term .
the elections are a follow-up to the presidential poll held on 22 september 2006 which the incumbent , president yahya jammeh , won by a large margin .
what 's at stake ?
for president jammeh 's ruling alliance for patriotic reorientation and construction -lrb- aprc -rrb- , which dominates the outgoing national assembly , the elections are an opportunity to further tighten control on power .
critics have described the outgoing house as a rubber-stamp parliament for the jammeh government .
the opposition wants to use the poll to reduce the aprc 's near-monopoly on power and avoid the possibility of becoming politically irrelevant in the country .
what were the results of the last elections ?
gambia last held legislative elections on 17 january 2002 .
the ruling aprc party won 45 out of the 48 seats .
the party ran unopposed in 33 constituencies , after the main opposition united democratic party -lrb- udp -rrb- boycotted the elections , alleging malpractice and irregularities in the run-up to the poll .
how does the electoral system work ?
gambia is a republic , with legislative power vested in the country 's unicameral parliament , known as the national assembly .
the house has 53 members .
voters directly elect 48 of the members , while the president appoints the remaining five .
the elections will be overseen by the independent electoral commission -lrb- iec -rrb- , made up of five members , all of whom are presidential appointees .
the country 's supreme court has the final say on any electoral disputes .
candidates can either stand on a party platform or as independents .

the elections are a follow-up to the presidential poll held on 22 september 2006 which the incumbent , president yahya jammeh , won by a large margin .
what 's at stake ?
for president jammeh 's ruling alliance for patriotic reorientation and construction -lrb- aprc -rrb- , which dominates the outgoing national assembly , the elections are an opportunity to further tighten control on power .
critics have described the outgoing house as a rubber-stamp parliament for the jammeh government .
the opposition wants to use the poll to reduce the aprc 's near-monopoly on power and avoid the possibility of becoming politically irrelevant in the country .
what were the results of the last elections ?
gambia last held legislative elections on 17 january 2002 .
the ruling aprc party won 45 out of the 48 seats .
the party ran unopposed in 33 constituencies , after the main opposition united democratic party -lrb- udp -rrb- boycotted the elections , alleging malpractice and irregularities in the run-up to the poll .
how does the electoral system work ?
gambia is a republic , with legislative power vested in the country 's unicameral parliament , known as the national assembly .
the house has 53 members .
voters directly elect 48 of the members , while the president appoints the remaining five .
the elections will be overseen by the independent electoral commission -lrb- iec -rrb- , made up of five members , all of whom are presidential appointees .
the country 's supreme court has the final say on any electoral disputes .
candidates can either stand on a party platform or as independents .

unlike its most famous proponents , the all blacks , the youngsters are not going to war with another rugby team .
instead they use a particular combination of speech and movement to prepare their brains for the challenges of another day of learning .
but like the maoris before them , the pupils also use the dance and the words of the song to express their passion , vigour and identity not as members of a race but as oxley parkers .
' sense of belonging ' " as we are a new school in a new community in milton keynes , fostering a sense of belonging is even more important , " says head teacher cathy higgins .
" children arrive every day - so a pupil that 's been here a few weeks is classed as an older pupil , " she explains .
" we have a variety of children with different backgrounds .
" there are children who come from a large number of different schools , different education authorities , different areas and different countries .
" there are children from africa , china , america and canada whose parents have come to milton keynes for work .
they have experiences of very different education systems .
" so there is a real need to establish a sense of belonging very quickly . "
all pupils are special at oxley park primary the melting pot that is oxley park is not so different from other areas of britain that have seen high levels of immigration .
this 280-strong school welcomes all newcomers , celebrating their diversity along the way .
and there is no sense that by doing this the inherent nature of the school will be squashed or compromised by " outsiders " - as opponents of multiculturalism suggest .
school song this sense of inclusion is well expressed in the words of one of the school 's songs : " i am special , you are special , we are special ca n't you see . "
" this , " says mrs higgins , " is really all about saying it does n't matter if you are fat or thin , tall or short , black or white , we are all different and we are all special . "
the posters and photographs that dot the school 's walls , show black and white faces along with children with disabilities .
the school has strong ties with south africa but they do n't look staged like so many public service information leaflets do - they reflect what is happening in the classroom .
there are also drawings , cultural trinkets and religious statues from countries all around the world in special displays .
links with south africa especially prominent are colourful items from south africa with which the school has a particular tie following a visit there by the head-teacher and her deputy in june 2006 .
have your say there is no consensus on what constitutes britishness paul , hull send us your comments mrs higgins and her deputy worked with teachers at farm schools in the impoverished but beautiful kwena basin in mpumalanga province .
they brought with them football kits , pencils and hair ornaments bought with money raised by the oxley park pupils for their south african peers .
" things our children would put in a bin were a treasure for these children , " says mrs higgins .
the following month , nine student teachers came back to oxley park to work at the school .
student teachers from south africa stayed with oxley park pupils they stayed with pupils and were welcomed into their family and community for the duration of their stay .
georgia , 11 , remembers her special guests : " they were very , very nice and became some of my best friends .
" they told me about what language they spoke and what money they used and what it was like to live there . "
seven-year-old amy remembers being taught a special dance .
" i did n't exactly get the hang of it but it was good , " she says .
while sam , eight , remembers how the student teacher who stayed in his house helped him make a lion costume for a school event .
angela bailey , who teaches nine and 10-year-olds at oxley park , says : " my class were very interested in the background history of south africa particularly .
" they learned quite a lot about the apartheid system and they have quite a strong sense of justice . "
life in the community but it 's not all about black and white .
the youngsters are encouraged to stand up for their local community as well .
mrs higgins wants her pupils to grow into good citizens mrs bailey tells how the pupils have been encouraged to conserve water and how many are writing to the local council to urge them to hurry up and put cycle lanes in place so they can cycle to school .
practical lessons grounded in the community are all part of showing the children that with rights come responsibility making the youngsters aware of the role they can play in their local community fosters good citizenship , says mrs higgins .
she adds : " it 's the golden thread that runs through what we do .
" it 's not a curricular subject but it happens in every area .
this is just something that we do - full stop .
" the children have a commitment to do these things and it goes beyond learning . "
" and the hope is that as they grow up they become active members of society and active citizens as well . "

' sense of belonging ' " as we are a new school in a new community in milton keynes , fostering a sense of belonging is even more important , " says head teacher cathy higgins .
" children arrive every day - so a pupil that 's been here a few weeks is classed as an older pupil , " she explains .
" we have a variety of children with different backgrounds .
" there are children who come from a large number of different schools , different education authorities , different areas and different countries .
" there are children from africa , china , america and canada whose parents have come to milton keynes for work .
they have experiences of very different education systems .
" so there is a real need to establish a sense of belonging very quickly . "
all pupils are special at oxley park primary the melting pot that is oxley park is not so different from other areas of britain that have seen high levels of immigration .
this 280-strong school welcomes all newcomers , celebrating their diversity along the way .
and there is no sense that by doing this the inherent nature of the school will be squashed or compromised by " outsiders " - as opponents of multiculturalism suggest .
school song this sense of inclusion is well expressed in the words of one of the school 's songs : " i am special , you are special , we are special ca n't you see . "
" this , " says mrs higgins , " is really all about saying it does n't matter if you are fat or thin , tall or short , black or white , we are all different and we are all special . "
the posters and photographs that dot the school 's walls , show black and white faces along with children with disabilities .
the school has strong ties with south africa but they do n't look staged like so many public service information leaflets do - they reflect what is happening in the classroom .
there are also drawings , cultural trinkets and religious statues from countries all around the world in special displays .
links with south africa especially prominent are colourful items from south africa with which the school has a particular tie following a visit there by the head-teacher and her deputy in june 2006 .
have your say there is no consensus on what constitutes britishness paul , hull send us your comments mrs higgins and her deputy worked with teachers at farm schools in the impoverished but beautiful kwena basin in mpumalanga province .
they brought with them football kits , pencils and hair ornaments bought with money raised by the oxley park pupils for their south african peers .
" things our children would put in a bin were a treasure for these children , " says mrs higgins .
the following month , nine student teachers came back to oxley park to work at the school .
student teachers from south africa stayed with oxley park pupils they stayed with pupils and were welcomed into their family and community for the duration of their stay .
georgia , 11 , remembers her special guests : " they were very , very nice and became some of my best friends .
" they told me about what language they spoke and what money they used and what it was like to live there . "
seven-year-old amy remembers being taught a special dance .
" i did n't exactly get the hang of it but it was good , " she says .
while sam , eight , remembers how the student teacher who stayed in his house helped him make a lion costume for a school event .

" they learned quite a lot about the apartheid system and they have quite a strong sense of justice . "
life in the community but it 's not all about black and white .
the youngsters are encouraged to stand up for their local community as well .
mrs higgins wants her pupils to grow into good citizens mrs bailey tells how the pupils have been encouraged to conserve water and how many are writing to the local council to urge them to hurry up and put cycle lanes in place so they can cycle to school .
practical lessons grounded in the community are all part of showing the children that with rights come responsibility making the youngsters aware of the role they can play in their local community fosters good citizenship , says mrs higgins .
she adds : " it 's the golden thread that runs through what we do .
" it 's not a curricular subject but it happens in every area .
this is just something that we do - full stop .
" the children have a commitment to do these things and it goes beyond learning . "
" and the hope is that as they grow up they become active members of society and active citizens as well . "

unlike its most famous proponents , the all blacks , the youngsters are not going to war with another rugby team .
instead they use a particular combination of speech and movement to prepare their brains for the challenges of another day of learning .
but like the maoris before them , the pupils also use the dance and the words of the song to express their passion , vigour and identity not as members of a race but as oxley parkers .
' sense of belonging ' " as we are a new school in a new community in milton keynes , fostering a sense of belonging is even more important , " says head teacher cathy higgins .
" children arrive every day - so a pupil that 's been here a few weeks is classed as an older pupil , " she explains .
" we have a variety of children with different backgrounds .
" there are children who come from a large number of different schools , different education authorities , different areas and different countries .
" there are children from africa , china , america and canada whose parents have come to milton keynes for work .
they have experiences of very different education systems .
" so there is a real need to establish a sense of belonging very quickly . "
all pupils are special at oxley park primary the melting pot that is oxley park is not so different from other areas of britain that have seen high levels of immigration .
this 280-strong school welcomes all newcomers , celebrating their diversity along the way .
and there is no sense that by doing this the inherent nature of the school will be squashed or compromised by " outsiders " - as opponents of multiculturalism suggest .
school song this sense of inclusion is well expressed in the words of one of the school 's songs : " i am special , you are special , we are special ca n't you see . "
" this , " says mrs higgins , " is really all about saying it does n't matter if you are fat or thin , tall or short , black or white , we are all different and we are all special . "
the posters and photographs that dot the school 's walls , show black and white faces along with children with disabilities .
the school has strong ties with south africa but they do n't look staged like so many public service information leaflets do - they reflect what is happening in the classroom .
there are also drawings , cultural trinkets and religious statues from countries all around the world in special displays .
links with south africa especially prominent are colourful items from south africa with which the school has a particular tie following a visit there by the head-teacher and her deputy in june 2006 .
have your say there is no consensus on what constitutes britishness paul , hull send us your comments mrs higgins and her deputy worked with teachers at farm schools in the impoverished but beautiful kwena basin in mpumalanga province .
they brought with them football kits , pencils and hair ornaments bought with money raised by the oxley park pupils for their south african peers .
" things our children would put in a bin were a treasure for these children , " says mrs higgins .
the following month , nine student teachers came back to oxley park to work at the school .
student teachers from south africa stayed with oxley park pupils they stayed with pupils and were welcomed into their family and community for the duration of their stay .
georgia , 11 , remembers her special guests : " they were very , very nice and became some of my best friends .
" they told me about what language they spoke and what money they used and what it was like to live there . "
seven-year-old amy remembers being taught a special dance .
" i did n't exactly get the hang of it but it was good , " she says .
while sam , eight , remembers how the student teacher who stayed in his house helped him make a lion costume for a school event .

" they learned quite a lot about the apartheid system and they have quite a strong sense of justice . "

the youngsters are encouraged to stand up for their local community as well .
mrs higgins wants her pupils to grow into good citizens mrs bailey tells how the pupils have been encouraged to conserve water and how many are writing to the local council to urge them to hurry up and put cycle lanes in place so they can cycle to school .
practical lessons grounded in the community are all part of showing the children that with rights come responsibility making the youngsters aware of the role they can play in their local community fosters good citizenship , says mrs higgins .
she adds : " it 's the golden thread that runs through what we do .
" it 's not a curricular subject but it happens in every area .

links with south africa especially prominent are colourful items from south africa with which the school has a particular tie following a visit there by the head-teacher and her deputy in june 2006 .
have your say " there is no consensus on what constitutes britishness " paul , hull send us your comments mrs higgins and her deputy worked with teachers at farm schools in the impoverished but beautiful kwena basin in mpumalanga province .
they brought with them football kits , pencils and hair ornaments bought with money raised by the oxley park pupils for their south african peers .
" things our children would put in a bin were a treasure for these children , " says mrs higgins .
the following month , nine student teachers came back to oxley park to work at the school .
they stayed with pupils and were welcomed into their family and community for the duration of their stay .
georgia , 11 , remembers her special guests : " they were very , very nice and became some of my best friends .
" they told me about what language they spoke and what money they used and what it was like to live there . "
seven-year-old amy remembers being taught a special dance .
" i did n't exactly get the hang of it but it was good , " she says .
while sam , eight , remembers how the student teacher who stayed in his house helped him make a lion costume for a school event .
angela bailey , who teaches nine and 10-year-olds at oxley park , says : " my class were very interested in the background history of south africa particularly .
" they learned quite a lot about the apartheid system and they have quite a strong sense of justice . "
life in the community but it 's not all about black and white .
the youngsters are encouraged to stand up for their local community as well .
mrs bailey tells how the pupils have been encouraged to conserve water and how many are writing to the local council to urge them to hurry up and put cycle lanes in place so they can cycle to school .
practical lessons grounded in the community are all part of showing the children that with rights come responsibility making the youngsters aware of the role they can play in their local community fosters good citizenship , says mrs higgins .
she adds : " it 's the golden thread that runs through what we do .
" it 's not a curricular subject but it happens in every area .
this is just something that we do - full stop .
" the children have a commitment to do these things and it goes beyond learning . "
" and the hope is that as they grow up they become active members of society and active citizens as well . "

the european court of justice said that under the european union insolvency directive , the uk government pension protection regime is " inadequate " .
but the ruling fell well short of saying people should be compensated .
the case will now go back to the high court , which may rule that people who have lost out should be compensated .
paying compensation could cost hundreds of millions of pounds . "
the court appears to have given a steer that damages may not be payable , but this is now a matter for the high court to decide " department for work and pensions spokesman schemes shut the case has been brought by unions representing former employees at allied steel and wire -lrb- asw -rrb- and united engineering forgings -lrb- uef -rrb- .
both shut in 2002 with staff losing their pensions as a result .
the case rests on whether the government should have done more to protect these workers ' pensions under the terms of the eu insolvency directive , which was introduced in 1983 .
under the directive member states are required to take measures to protect the pensions of employees in the event of their employer 's insolvency .
the case has wide implications for an estimated 125,000 workers who have lost their pensions , when their companies went bust , going back as far as 1983 .
while saying that the pensions protection regime was inadequate , the european court added that it did not mean that the government had to compensate those who had lost their pensions .
" the court finds that the -lrb- eu -rrb- directive does not oblige the member states themselves to fund the rights to old age benefits , " it said in a statement .
it will now be up to the high court in london to make the final ruling on the case .
a department for work and pensions -lrb- dwp -rrb- spokesperson welcomed the european court 's judgement .
" this is a common sense judgement which recognises that article 8 -lrb- of the insolvency directive -rrb- does not require member states to ensure pensions are guaranteed in full . "
we are confident that when this case returns to the high court , our arguments will be upheld " derek simpson , amicus " the court appears to have given a steer that damages may not be payable , but this is now a matter for the high court to decide , " the spokesperson added .
' confident ' the amicus trade union , which is a party in the case , said it was " confident " of persuading the high court in london that compensation was due .
" we are confident that when this case returns to the high court , our arguments will be upheld and our members who , through no fault of their own , lost all or substantial parts of their pensions , will be fully reimbursed , " said derek simpson , general secretary of amicus .
however , groups representing people who have lost their pensions told bbc news that there was little sign of instant relief .
" this is just another stage in a long drawn-out process , " said peter humphreys , head of pensionstheft.org.
" ultimately , we hope the pressure will tell on the government and those people who are struggling to make ends meet or face massive holes in their pensions will receive full compensation , " he added .
in 2006 , the government rejected a call by the parliamentary ombudsman for people who had lost their pensions to be compensated .

the european court of justice said that under the european union insolvency directive , the uk government pension protection regime is " inadequate " .
but the ruling fell well short of saying people should be compensated .
the case will now go back to the high court , which may rule that people who have lost out should be compensated .
paying compensation could cost hundreds of millions of pounds .
the court appears to have given a steer that damages may not be payable , but this is now a matter for the high court to decide department for work and pensions spokesman schemes shut the case has been brought by unions representing former employees at allied steel and wire -lrb- asw -rrb- and united engineering forgings -lrb- uef -rrb- .
both shut in 2002 with staff losing their pensions as a result .
the case rests on whether the government should have done more to protect these workers ' pensions under the terms of the eu insolvency directive , which was introduced in 1983 .
under the directive member states are required to take measures to protect the pensions of employees in the event of their employer 's insolvency .
the case has wide implications for an estimated 125,000 workers who have lost their pensions , when their companies went bust , going back as far as 1983 .
while saying that the pensions protection regime was inadequate , the european court added that it did not mean that the government had to compensate those who had lost their pensions .
" the court finds that the -lrb- eu -rrb- directive does not oblige the member states themselves to fund the rights to old age benefits , " it said in a statement .
it will now be up to the high court in london to make the final ruling on the case .
a department for work and pensions -lrb- dwp -rrb- spokesperson welcomed the european court 's judgement .
" this is a common sense judgement which recognises that article 8 -lrb- of the insolvency directive -rrb- does not require member states to ensure pensions are guaranteed in full .
we are confident that when this case returns to the high court , our arguments will be upheld derek simpson , amicus " the court appears to have given a steer that damages may not be payable , but this is now a matter for the high court to decide , " the spokesperson added .
' confident ' the amicus trade union , which is a party in the case , said it was " confident " of persuading the high court in london that compensation was due .
" we are confident that when this case returns to the high court , our arguments will be upheld and our members who , through no fault of their own , lost all or substantial parts of their pensions , will be fully reimbursed , " said derek simpson , general secretary of amicus .
however , groups representing people who have lost their pensions told bbc news that there was little sign of instant relief .
" this is just another stage in a long drawn-out process , " said peter humphreys , head of pensionstheft.org.
" ultimately , we hope the pressure will tell on the government and those people who are struggling to make ends meet or face massive holes in their pensions will receive full compensation , " he added .
in 2006 , the government rejected a call by the parliamentary ombudsman for people who had lost their pensions to be compensated .

at a secret meeting of operatives from south east asian militant network jemaah islamiah , a man known as hambali is believed to have ordered a new strategy of hitting soft targets like nightclubs and bars rather than high-profile sites like foreign embassies .
but it was not until august 2002 that bali was chosen as the place to strike .
according to ali imron , who was jailed for life for his part in the attacks , it was at a meeting in a house in solo , central java , that " field commander " imam samudra announced the plan to bomb bali , and the main agents in the plot first came together . "
their duty was to explode the bombs , they were ready to die " ali imron bali was chosen " because it was frequented by americans and their associates " , ali imron has said .
he quoted imam samudra as saying it was part of a jihad to " defend the people of afghanistan from america " .
in fact , more australians and indonesians would die than americans , prompting speculation that the plotters were poorly informed , or orchestrated by other people still at large .
hambali , who is now in us custody , is believed to have been the south east asian contact for osama bin laden 's al-qaeda network .
but he is not thought to have played an active part in the bali plotting .
instead , a 43-year-old islamic teacher known as mukhlas was convicted for the overall co-ordination of the attacks .
prosecutors said he approved the targets and channelled the funds to finance the bombings , even though mukhlas himself claimed he just gave the bombers religious guidance .
he also recruited two of his younger brothers , amrozi and ali imron , to carry out key roles in the attack .
mukhlas and imam samudra are said to have chaired preparatory meetings in western java during august and september .
ali imron said that the bali attacks were originally planned for 11 september , to mark the first anniversary of the terror attacks on the us .
but the bombs were apparently not ready in time , and the plans had to be postponed .
final planning the details of the attack were finalised in bali between 6 and 10 october .
the bombers apparently all had separate roles .
a man called idris , who was later jailed for another bomb attack , was accused of gathering funds and arranging transport and accommodation for the bombers in the days leading up to the attack .
amrozi admitted to buying the chemicals and the minivan used in the sari club blast .
ali imron said a man called dulmatin , who is now believed to be in hiding in the southern philippines , helped assemble the bombs , and a man called abdul ghoni mixed the explosives .
ali imron said he helped make the main bomb , which was used to bomb the sari club .
he said a van loaded with explosives was driven to sari by a man called jimi , who died in the blast .
a man called iqbal wore a vest with a bomb in it , which he detonated in paddy 's bar .
" their duty was to explode the bombs , " ali imron had said .
" they were ready to die . "
iqbal is known to have died in paddy 's bar .
but ali imron has also told police that the two bombs exploded prematurely , which could have caught iqbal out , so it is unclear if he was on a suicide mission .
all the individuals detained for playing a major role in the attacks have now been sentenced .
but key suspects were never caught .
these include two malaysians , dr azahari husin , who was alleged to be ji 's top bomb-making expert and the man who helped assemble the bali bombs , and noordin mohammad top .
azahari was killed by police in eastern indonesian in november 2005 , while noordin mohammad top is still at large , as is dulmatin .
their work was allegedly responsible for the massive explosions which rocked legian street in kuta , bali , on the early morning of 12 october 2002 , leaving 202 people dead .
the attack was a team effort , but it apparently provoked different reactions from those involved .
police said imam samudra stayed in bali for several days after the bombing to survey the devastation he wrought and observe the reactions of people he affected .
ali imron shed tears in court , and repeatedly expressed remorse for his actions .
amrozi laughed and joked about his case , and gave a thumbs-up sign when he was convicted .
he has said he is happy to die a martyr .

lennon and his first cousin , stanley parkes , used to stay at the family croft at sango bay .

according to research group ifo , its business climate index fell to 107.9 points , from 108.7 points in december .
the decline surprised analysts , many of whom had predicted a rise in business sentiment after the key barometer hit a 16-year high last month .
sales tax in europe 's biggest economy was increased to 19 % at the beginning of january to help boost state funds .
the ifo institute said it expected the vat rise to dampen consumer spending over the coming months .
however , ifo economist klaus abberger said that he expected the economic situation would pick up again after that period .
the munich-based ifo economic research institute polled about 7,000 german firms for its monthly survey .
