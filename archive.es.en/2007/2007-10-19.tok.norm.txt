reform treaty doubters in minority as moment of truth arrives the eu treaty : the ioannina compromise explained the european treaty : frequently asked questions the eu treaty : the long road to lisbon european union -pipe- 19.10.2007 hard bargaining leads to success at eu treaty summit in lisbon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portuguese prime minister socrates and german chancellor merkel celebrate the deal eu leaders clinched a final deal late thursday , oct .
18 , on a major overhaul of the 27-member bloc after making key concessions to italy and poland .
the new lisbon treaty is now expected to be signed in december . the agreement on the reform treaty , reached by prime ministers and heads of state after hours of wrangling in lisbon , should put an end to a prolonged institutional debate sparked by voters in france and the netherlands , who in 2005 referendums rejected a european constitution .
" this is a victory for europe .
we are getting out of a blind alley .
we no longer have an institutional crisis , " said portuguese prime minister jose socrates , who as holder of the eu rotating presidency was acting as the meeting 's host .
the treaty is designed to streamline the eu 's decision-making process following its " big bang " expansion of 2004 , which welcomed 10 new member states into the 50-year-old organization .
it is also set to improve the eu 's global diplomatic clout by simplifying the way it relates with international partners . '
historic agreement ' for the 21st century " this is a historic agreement .
now europe can defend its interests in the age of globalization , " said a visibly pleased jose manuel barroso , head of the eu 's executive arm , the european commission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso was relieved and happy with the result " in this case we 're really talking about an agreement which really gives the european union a capacity to act in the 21st century , " he added .
the text is now due to be signed on dec .
13 in the portuguese capital by eu prime ministers and heads of state and will thereafter come to be known as the lisbon treaty .
once officially sealed , it will need to be ratified by all member states , by either parliamentary votes or referendums - meaning its implementation is far from assured .
eu officials are nevertheless hopeful that the ratification process will be completed by spring 2009 , when european parliament elections are scheduled .
" this is a good treaty for the union , " said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , the eu 's longest-serving leader .
the impasse was resolved after leaders agreed to give in to demands from poland and italy .
poland satisfied with concessions poland , the most vocal critic of the proposed treaty before the talks , received assurances that a procedure allowing outvoted states to stall eu laws would be enshrined in the treaty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's president kaczynski got what he wanted " poland got what it wanted .
the eu reform treaty project is now crowned with success , " polish president lech kaczynski said .
" i 'm very happy this business is behind us . "
britain also had many reservations about the treaty , but obtained " red line " opt-outs in key areas at the last eu summit in june which remained in the draft presented on thursday .
" the uk 's red lines are secured , " said british prime minister gordon brown , attending his first summit since succeeding tony blair .
" the british national interest has been protected , " he added .
brown was one of the eu leaders at the two-day informal meeting to say that it was time to put years of discussions on the treaty behind them and turn to the more " concrete " problems facing the bloc .
" i have sent a letter round -lsb- to -rsb- fellow colleagues saying that it is time for europe to address detailed issues of global economic change , climate change and security , " brown told journalists .
italy gets extra parliament seat as a sweetener bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi proved to be one of the hardest bargainers italy , which diplomats described as the hardest bargainer during the meeting , obtained one extra seat in the european parliament , giving it the same number of lawmakers as britain .
under the current system , italy , france and britain all have the same number of members in the european parliament .
however , the treaty reduces the overall number of lawmakers by 35 , to 750 , and parliament last week voted for a new distribution , giving italy fewer seats than its similarly sized partners .
close to midnight , diplomats agreed to give italy one more seat without breaching the 750-member cap by excluding the non-voting president of the parliament from the count .
the eu 's two heavyweights , germany and france , both claimed credit for thursday 's success .
merkel , sarkozy both claim credit while french president nicolas sarkozy said he was " extremely satisfied " with the result , german chancellor angela merkel highlighted the role played by her government in launching the final treaty talks in june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel admitted it had been a struggle to reach agreement " after all the political discussions , this is a great success , " merkel said .
" nothing has been changed from the mandate we agreed at the end of the german presidency . "
she added that the treaty would now help the eu function more efficiently as a bloc and as a power in the world .
she also acknowledged that the deal had been hammered out through some very frustrating discussions and hard bargaining , especially with the poles and italians .
" i ca n't hide the fact that the way to this agreement was very difficult , " merkel said .
other tricky issues were successfully addressed earlier in the meeting .
bulgaria reached a deal allowing it to spell the single currency in cyrillic as " evro " rather than " euro . "
austria received assurances that moves to limit the number of foreigners attending its universities would not be pursued in the european court .
among the treaty 's main innovations are clauses reducing the size of the european commission and streamlining decisions by changing voting rules and limiting the power of individual member states to veto legislation .
it also creates several new posts .
these include a president of the european council of member states , who will represent all the member states , and a high representative of the european union for foreign affairs and security policy , who will be in charge of the bloc 's foreign policy , thereby simplifying its relationships with the outside world . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the uk 's red lines are secured , " said british prime minister gordon brown , attending his first summit since succeeding tony blair .
" the british national interest has been protected , " he added .
brown was one of the eu leaders at the two-day informal meeting to say that it was time to put years of discussions on the treaty behind them and turn to the more " concrete " problems facing the bloc .
" i have sent a letter round -lsb- to -rsb- fellow colleagues saying that it is time for europe to address detailed issues of global economic change , climate change and security , " brown told journalists .
italy gets extra parliament seat as a sweetener bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi proved to be one of the hardest bargainers italy , which diplomats described as the hardest bargainer during the meeting , obtained one extra seat in the european parliament , giving it the same number of lawmakers as britain .
under the current system , italy , france and britain all have the same number of members in the european parliament .
however , the treaty reduces the overall number of lawmakers by 35 , to 750 , and parliament last week voted for a new distribution , giving italy fewer seats than its similarly sized partners .
close to midnight , diplomats agreed to give italy one more seat without breaching the 750-member cap by excluding the non-voting president of the parliament from the count .
the eu 's two heavyweights , germany and france , both claimed credit for thursday 's success .
merkel , sarkozy both claim credit while french president nicolas sarkozy said he was " extremely satisfied " with the result , german chancellor angela merkel highlighted the role played by her government in launching the final treaty talks in june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel admitted it had been a struggle to reach agreement " after all the political discussions , this is a great success , " merkel said .
" nothing has been changed from the mandate we agreed at the end of the german presidency . "
she added that the treaty would now help the eu function more efficiently as a bloc and as a power in the world .
she also acknowledged that the deal had been hammered out through some very frustrating discussions and hard bargaining , especially with the poles and italians .
" i ca n't hide the fact that the way to this agreement was very difficult , " merkel said .
other tricky issues were successfully addressed earlier in the meeting .
bulgaria reached a deal allowing it to spell the single currency in cyrillic as " evro " rather than " euro . "
austria received assurances that moves to limit the number of foreigners attending its universities would not be pursued in the european court .
among the treaty 's main innovations are clauses reducing the size of the european commission and streamlining decisions by changing voting rules and limiting the power of individual member states to veto legislation .
it also creates several new posts .
these include a president of the european council of member states , who will represent all the member states , and a high representative of the european union for foreign affairs and security policy , who will be in charge of the bloc 's foreign policy , thereby simplifying its relationships with the outside world . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he had starred in the host nation 's world cup run and secured a big move to bayern munich .
now , however , podolski finds himself in the shadows . the good news for bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld is that he will likely not be pressed to field lukas podolski in the near future .
podolski was one of the major disappointments in germany 's 3-0 home defeat against the czech republic on wednesday night , showing no signs that he deserves a place in munich 's starting line-up .
after all , hitzfeld 's decision to go with klose and luca toni has already proven to be right as the two international strikers share the scoring table lead with eight goals each - and munich enjoy a five-point advantage atop the standings .
podolski was last month warned by munich general manager uli hoeness to finally deliver in his second season , a view also shared by national team general manager oliver bierhoff .
" lukas knows that he has to work on his weaknesses , " said bierhoff .
klose back to partner toni bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose , left , has been in great form since arriving from bremen podolski will have to take his familiar place on the bench on saturday as klose returns from an injury layoff which kept him out of germany 's latest euro-qualifiers .
podolski remains convinced that he can nail down a first-team place with bayern munich .
" i still have two-and-a-half years left on my contract with bayern .
i want to fulfill it , " podolski said this week . hoeness said last month that the player would not make it at the german giants if he did n't " change his attitude . " podolski responded to the comment , saying " i ca n't be prevented from laughing . " poldi more successful in white of germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski remains prolific on the international scene podolski has scored 23 goals in 41 appearances for germany , but has not been as successful in munich after a 2006 move from cologne , with just four goals to date in 25 league matches . he has failed to score in his five substitute appearances in the bundesliga this season following a comeback from a summer injury .
klose , 29 , has been out of action for three weeks with a knee injury , but between him and italian world cup winner toni , the pair already have a 16 goals between them after just 10 league games .
competition fierce up front for bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan schlaudraff is also in the mix for a starting berth german international striker jan schlaudraff is also fighting to break into the bayern first team after a back operation , but says the world-class pairing of klose and toni are a sizeable obstacle .
" let me be clear about this : they absolutely deserve to play , they 've both been superb , " said schlaudraff , who joined bayern this summer from aachen .

18-19 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says economic help is a central aspect of the eu peace plan the german foreign minister said that the proposal would help foster middle east peace by promoting small and medium-sized businesses in the palestinian territories and building up special economic zones .
the plan also aims to increase eu assistance in the training of palestinian police and judiciary as well as in the educational and civil service sectors with greater eu assistance focused on palestinian universities and students .
the idea , steinmeier said , was for the eu to help wean palestinians from development aid by helping to strengthen their private sector .
" in order to swiftly generate the required momentum following an israeli-palestinian accord and the planned middle east conference , europe needs to clearly spell out what contribution it intends to make to take this process forward , " he said .
the point of an eu action plan would be to highlight what the eu is doing to support the process now under way , steinmeier continued .
" we should do everything we can to foster the ongoing dialogue and create a favorable political environment at regional and international level , " he said .
eu ready to play constructive role in peace process steinmeier added that there was no need to wait until the us-hosted conference on the middle east next month before going ahead with the eu ’ s plan .
" i told my colleague -lrb- us secretary of state condoleezza -rrb- rice that we will do everything to ensure that europe plays a constructive role , " he told reporters .
for years the eu has been lending active backing to the middle east peace process and consequently has close relations with the relevant parties and countries in the region and is the main source of funding for reconstruction and development .
steinmeier put total financial and humanitarian aid from the eu and its member states to the region at 800 million euros -lrb- $ 1.14 billion -rrb- for 2007 so far . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german politicians from all major political parties voiced dismay at the increasingly bellicose rhetoric from the united states and russia .
politicians want the rhetoric toned down and a greater focus on diplomacy . german politicians were alarmed when us president george w. bush earlier this week brought up the possibility of another world war .
if iran 's nuclear ambitions are n't kept in check , it could result in world war iii , bush said .

after all , hitzfeld 's decision to go with klose and luca toni has already proven to be right as the two international strikers share the scoring table lead with eight goals each - and munich enjoy a five-point advantage atop the standings .

not everybody thinks it 's the right way to boost acheivement . an international panel of researchers and political representatives in bonn picked six german institutions - berlin 's free university , rwth aachen university and universities in freiburg , göttingen , heidelberg and constance - to join an " elite " list that already includes two schools in munich and one in karlruhe .
a total of nine universities have made the cut and can be considered elite institutions , the german government said .
its so-called " excellence initiative " was developed in 2005 . the initiative is an attempt to boost the country 's chronically under-funded colleges by encouraging high level research and competition .
" a new page in the history of science " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the university of constance proved it deserved recognition the nine elite universities will benefit from a total of 1.9 billion euros in extra research funding over the next five years .
the major chunk of the money will come from the federal government .
the long-term goal is to put them on par with renowned institutions such as harvard and mit in the united states or oxford and cambridge in the united kingdom .
" we wrote a new page in the history of science today , " education minister annette schavan told the dpa news agency .
the minister described the initiative as " a huge step for the further development of germany 's system of science . "
money was also earmarked for 21 graduate schools that showed they knew how to promote new talent as well as for 20 " research clusters " that demonstrated they were centers of excellence in particular fields .
shaking up the system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " elite " universities will get additional money proponents of the competition , which drew applications from dozens of german universities , say it has forced the country 's higher education system to raise standards and reach for greater heights .
gerhart von graevenitz , director of the university of constance , said the award would open new horizons and opportunities for the university which is located on the swiss border .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venerable institutions : the university library in heidelberg but , critics say it 's the wrong way to boost acheivement .
" the excellence iniative worsens the structural problems of the german higher education system rather than solving them , " said andreas keller of the union for education and science -lrb- gew -rrb- .
keller pointed out that the iniative deepened the gap between the country 's various regions since most of the universities that were anointed are located in southern germany .
not a single one comes from former communist east germany .
the union has also said the iniative only focuses on research at universities and ignores actual studies and standards of teaching . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the head of the army association went further in his critique , saying eu 's afghan plan had " failed pathetically . " german defense minister franz josef jung said the eu plan to send 195 trainers to the conflict-riven region should be reconsidered since the number is likely not high enough .
he named the us as a model the eu could follow . " they go at the situation in a completely different dimension , " he told the daily die welt . the head of the german federal armed forces association , bernhard gertz , also called for more training personnel to be sent to the region , accusing the eu and the german government of having " failed pathetically " in its afghanistan policy . he told the hannoversche allgemeine zeitung daily that if a country is to be rebuilt with a self-supporting security apparatus , 40 police training personnel from germany is not near enough .
he said in order to train enough police for all of afghanistan regions , some 5,000 trainers would be needed from the eu instead of the promised 165 . gertz also had harsh words for western efforts to create a new afghan army .

18-19 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says economic help is a central aspect of the eu peace plan the german foreign minister said that the proposal would help foster middle east peace by promoting small and medium-sized businesses in the palestinian territories and building up special economic zones .
the plan also aims to increase eu assistance in the training of palestinian police and judiciary as well as in the educational and civil service sectors with greater eu assistance focused on palestinian universities and students .
the idea , steinmeier said , was for the eu to help wean palestinians from development aid by helping to strengthen their private sector .
" in order to swiftly generate the required momentum following an israeli-palestinian accord and the planned middle east conference , europe needs to clearly spell out what contribution it intends to make to take this process forward , " he said .
the point of an eu action plan would be to highlight what the eu is doing to support the process now under way , steinmeier continued .
" we should do everything we can to foster the ongoing dialogue and create a favorable political environment at regional and international level , " he said .

not everybody thinks it 's the right way to boost acheivement . an international panel of researchers and political representatives in bonn picked six german institutions - berlin 's free university , rwth aachen university and universities in freiburg , göttingen , heidelberg and constance - to join an " elite " list that already includes two schools in munich and one in karlruhe .
a total of nine universities have made the cut and can be considered elite institutions , the german government said .
its so-called " excellence initiative " was developed in 2005 . the initiative is an attempt to boost the country 's chronically under-funded colleges by encouraging high level research and competition .

the long-term goal is to put them on par with renowned institutions such as harvard and mit in the united states or oxford and cambridge in the united kingdom .

18-19 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says economic help is a central aspect of the eu peace plan the german foreign minister said that the proposal would help foster middle east peace by promoting small and medium-sized businesses in the palestinian territories and building up special economic zones .
the plan also aims to increase eu assistance in the training of palestinian police and judiciary as well as in the educational and civil service sectors with greater eu assistance focused on palestinian universities and students .
the idea , steinmeier said , was for the eu to help wean palestinians from development aid by helping to strengthen their private sector .
" in order to swiftly generate the required momentum following an israeli-palestinian accord and the planned middle east conference , europe needs to clearly spell out what contribution it intends to make to take this process forward , " he said .
the point of an eu action plan would be to highlight what the eu is doing to support the process now under way , steinmeier continued .
" we should do everything we can to foster the ongoing dialogue and create a favorable political environment at regional and international level , " he said .
eu ready to play constructive role in peace process steinmeier added that there was no need to wait until the us-hosted conference on the middle east next month before going ahead with the eu ’ s plan .
" i told my colleague -lrb- us secretary of state condoleezza -rrb- rice that we will do everything to ensure that europe plays a constructive role , " he told reporters .
for years the eu has been lending active backing to the middle east peace process and consequently has close relations with the relevant parties and countries in the region and is the main source of funding for reconstruction and development .
steinmeier put total financial and humanitarian aid from the eu and its member states to the region at 800 million euros -lrb- $ 1.14 billion -rrb- for 2007 so far . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the head of the army association went further in his critique , saying eu 's afghan plan had " failed pathetically . " german defense minister franz josef jung said the eu plan to send 195 trainers to the conflict-riven region should be reconsidered since the number is likely not high enough .
he named the us as a model the eu could follow . " they go at the situation in a completely different dimension , " he told the daily die welt . the head of the german federal armed forces association , bernhard gertz , also called for more training personnel to be sent to the region , accusing the eu and the german government of having " failed pathetically " in its afghanistan policy . he told the hannoversche allgemeine zeitung daily that if a country is to be rebuilt with a self-supporting security apparatus , 40 police training personnel from germany is not near enough .
he said in order to train enough police for all of afghanistan regions , some 5,000 trainers would be needed from the eu instead of the promised 165 . gertz also had harsh words for western efforts to create a new afghan army .
he said at best 16,000 soldiers are available to the karsai government when it needed at least 70,000 . deployment : five years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister franz josef jung defense minister jung said he believed german troops could be deployed in afghanistan for at least five more years . " i 'm not saying that we will have achieved everything in five years , but this time span could be a guideline , " he told die welt . last week , germany 's lower house of parliament overwhelmingly approved extending the army 's mission in afghanistan , despite growing public misgivings .
the vote allows for up to 3,500 soldiers to operate in the country as part of the nato international security assistance force for another year . but he again resisted nato calls for german soldiers to be deployed in the southern part of the country to train afghan security forces .
german peacekeepers are currently stationed in the relatively quiet north . but on wednesday night , bundeswehr soldiers were the target of a rocket attack about 30 kilometers southwest of feisabad .

" as long as the taliban have not clearly sworn off violence , i believe negotiations may not be conducted , " he said . he said british troops had had negative experiences in past attempts at talks with the taliban in the volative south of the country , which had led to more violence .

german politicians from all major political parties voiced dismay at the increasingly bellicose rhetoric from the united states and russia .
politicians want the rhetoric toned down and a greater focus on diplomacy . german politicians were alarmed when us president george w. bush earlier this week brought up the possibility of another world war .
if iran 's nuclear ambitions are n't kept in check , it could result in world war iii , bush said .
russian president vladimir putin caused further concern when , while in iran on a historic visit this week , he made it clear that russia plans to modernize its military , including its nuclear capacities .
german politicians were universal in condemning bush and putin 's cold war rhetoric and encouraging dialogue and diplomacy .
escalation counterproductive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush talks of world war iii bush 's mention of an impending world war iii was counterproductive in finding a solution to the nuclear standoff with iran , ruprecht polenz , a specialist in foreign affairs for chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- told the dpa news agency .
polenz also criticized putin for saying he wants to build up russia 's military capacity .
rolf mützenich , who specializes in foreign policy for the social democrats , said bush 's statement puts a " mutual and peaceful approach to the iranian nuclear crisis " in danger . the disagreement over iran 's nuclear program can not be solved using force , mützenich told dpa .
he encouraged merkel to make this clear when she meets with bush next month .
it was also " completely inappropriate " for bush to bring up the possibility of world war iii , mützenich said .
the left party 's foreign affairs expert , norman paech , said bush 's statement were an " additional signal " that the us is a war risk .
a dangerous political climate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians do n't want to see a return to cold war politics the head of the green party , claudia roth , called the harsh tones from washington and moscow a " backslide into the rhetoric of the cold war , " according to an interview in the internet news portal netzeitung .de.
" bush and putin are losing all forms of measurement and control , " she said .
for jürgen trittin of the green party , bush 's and putin 's recent statements show how dangerous the current political climate is .
bush not making war plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians want more diplomacy and less talk of war bush wanted to make " a rhetorical point " when he suggested that if iran could make nuclear weapons , it could lead to world war iii .
" the president was not making any war plans , and he was n't making any declarations , " said white house press secretary dana perino .
" he was making a point , and the point is that we do not believe - and neither does the international community believe - that iran should be allowed to pursue nuclear weapons . "
if iran acquired nuclear weapons , it would lead to a very dangerous situation , perino said .
the us has accused iran of secretly trying to build nuclear weapons , which tehran denies .
putin will modernize the military bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin during his historic visit to iran putin alarmed world leaders when he mentioned on thursday , oct .
18 , that russia is working on new types of nuclear weapons as part of a " grandiose " plan to strengthen the country 's defenses .
moscow is deeply opposed to us plans to extend its missile shield into europe , by installing 10 missile interceptors in poland and tracking radar in the czech republic .
disarmament expert elke hoff of the free democratic party , a free-market liberal party , reproached putin for using us plans for a missile defense shield to undermine non-proliferation politics .
putin embarked on a landmark visit to iran earlier this week to discuss the country 's nuclear program with iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .

he had starred in the host nation 's world cup run and secured a big move to bayern munich .
now , however , podolski finds himself in the shadows . the good news for bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld is that he will likely not be pressed to field lukas podolski in the near future .
podolski was one of the major disappointments in germany 's 3-0 home defeat against the czech republic on wednesday night , showing no signs that he deserves a place in munich 's starting line-up .
after all , hitzfeld 's decision to go with klose and luca toni has already proven to be right as the two international strikers share the scoring table lead with eight goals each - and munich enjoy a five-point advantage atop the standings .
podolski was last month warned by munich general manager uli hoeness to finally deliver in his second season , a view also shared by national team general manager oliver bierhoff .
" lukas knows that he has to work on his weaknesses , " said bierhoff .
klose back to partner toni bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose , left , has been in great form since arriving from bremen podolski will have to take his familiar place on the bench on saturday as klose returns from an injury layoff which kept him out of germany 's latest euro-qualifiers .
podolski remains convinced that he can nail down a first-team place with bayern munich .
" i still have two-and-a-half years left on my contract with bayern .
i want to fulfill it , " podolski said this week . hoeness said last month that the player would not make it at the german giants if he did n't " change his attitude . " podolski responded to the comment , saying " i ca n't be prevented from laughing . " poldi more successful in white of germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski remains prolific on the international scene podolski has scored 23 goals in 41 appearances for germany , but has not been as successful in munich after a 2006 move from cologne , with just four goals to date in 25 league matches . he has failed to score in his five substitute appearances in the bundesliga this season following a comeback from a summer injury .
klose , 29 , has been out of action for three weeks with a knee injury , but between him and italian world cup winner toni , the pair already have a 16 goals between them after just 10 league games .
competition fierce up front for bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan schlaudraff is also in the mix for a starting berth german international striker jan schlaudraff is also fighting to break into the bayern first team after a back operation , but says the world-class pairing of klose and toni are a sizeable obstacle .
" let me be clear about this : they absolutely deserve to play , they 've both been superb , " said schlaudraff , who joined bayern this summer from aachen .

a total of nine universities have made the cut and can be considered elite institutions , the german government said .
its so-called " excellence initiative " was developed in 2005 . the initiative is an attempt to boost the country 's chronically under-funded colleges by encouraging high level research and competition .
" a new page in the history of science " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the university of constance proved it deserved recognition the nine elite universities will benefit from a total of 1.9 billion euros in extra research funding over the next five years .

the long-term goal is to put them on par with renowned institutions such as harvard and mit in the united states or oxford and cambridge in the united kingdom .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says economic help is a central aspect of the eu peace plan the german foreign minister said that the proposal would help foster middle east peace by promoting small and medium-sized businesses in the palestinian territories and building up special economic zones .
the plan also aims to increase eu assistance in the training of palestinian police and judiciary as well as in the educational and civil service sectors with greater eu assistance focused on palestinian universities and students .
the idea , steinmeier said , was for the eu to help wean palestinians from development aid by helping to strengthen their private sector .
" in order to swiftly generate the required momentum following an israeli-palestinian accord and the planned middle east conference , europe needs to clearly spell out what contribution it intends to make to take this process forward , " he said .
the point of an eu action plan would be to highlight what the eu is doing to support the process now under way , steinmeier continued .
" we should do everything we can to foster the ongoing dialogue and create a favorable political environment at regional and international level , " he said .
eu ready to play constructive role in peace process steinmeier added that there was no need to wait until the us-hosted conference on the middle east next month before going ahead with the eu ’ s plan .
" i told my colleague -lrb- us secretary of state condoleezza -rrb- rice that we will do everything to ensure that europe plays a constructive role , " he told reporters .
for years the eu has been lending active backing to the middle east peace process and consequently has close relations with the relevant parties and countries in the region and is the main source of funding for reconstruction and development .
steinmeier put total financial and humanitarian aid from the eu and its member states to the region at 800 million euros -lrb- $ 1.14 billion -rrb- for 2007 so far . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

reform treaty doubters in minority as moment of truth arrives the eu treaty : the ioannina compromise explained the european treaty : frequently asked questions the eu treaty : the long road to lisbon european union -pipe- 19.10.2007 hard bargaining leads to success at eu treaty summit in lisbon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portuguese prime minister socrates and german chancellor merkel celebrate the deal eu leaders clinched a final deal late thursday , oct .
18 , on a major overhaul of the 27-member bloc after making key concessions to italy and poland .
the new lisbon treaty is now expected to be signed in december . the agreement on the reform treaty , reached by prime ministers and heads of state after hours of wrangling in lisbon , should put an end to a prolonged institutional debate sparked by voters in france and the netherlands , who in 2005 referendums rejected a european constitution .
" this is a victory for europe .
we are getting out of a blind alley .
we no longer have an institutional crisis , " said portuguese prime minister jose socrates , who as holder of the eu rotating presidency was acting as the meeting 's host .
the treaty is designed to streamline the eu 's decision-making process following its " big bang " expansion of 2004 , which welcomed 10 new member states into the 50-year-old organization .
it is also set to improve the eu 's global diplomatic clout by simplifying the way it relates with international partners . '
historic agreement ' for the 21st century " this is a historic agreement .
now europe can defend its interests in the age of globalization , " said a visibly pleased jose manuel barroso , head of the eu 's executive arm , the european commission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso was relieved and happy with the result " in this case we 're really talking about an agreement which really gives the european union a capacity to act in the 21st century , " he added .
the text is now due to be signed on dec .
13 in the portuguese capital by eu prime ministers and heads of state and will thereafter come to be known as the lisbon treaty .
once officially sealed , it will need to be ratified by all member states , by either parliamentary votes or referendums - meaning its implementation is far from assured .
eu officials are nevertheless hopeful that the ratification process will be completed by spring 2009 , when european parliament elections are scheduled .
" this is a good treaty for the union , " said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , the eu 's longest-serving leader .
the impasse was resolved after leaders agreed to give in to demands from poland and italy .
poland satisfied with concessions poland , the most vocal critic of the proposed treaty before the talks , received assurances that a procedure allowing outvoted states to stall eu laws would be enshrined in the treaty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's president kaczynski got what he wanted " poland got what it wanted .
the eu reform treaty project is now crowned with success , " polish president lech kaczynski said .
" i 'm very happy this business is behind us . "
britain also had many reservations about the treaty , but obtained " red line " opt-outs in key areas at the last eu summit in june which remained in the draft presented on thursday .
" the uk 's red lines are secured , " said british prime minister gordon brown , attending his first summit since succeeding tony blair .
" the british national interest has been protected , " he added .
brown was one of the eu leaders at the two-day informal meeting to say that it was time to put years of discussions on the treaty behind them and turn to the more " concrete " problems facing the bloc .
" i have sent a letter round -lsb- to -rsb- fellow colleagues saying that it is time for europe to address detailed issues of global economic change , climate change and security , " brown told journalists .
italy gets extra parliament seat as a sweetener bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi proved to be one of the hardest bargainers italy , which diplomats described as the hardest bargainer during the meeting , obtained one extra seat in the european parliament , giving it the same number of lawmakers as britain .
under the current system , italy , france and britain all have the same number of members in the european parliament .
however , the treaty reduces the overall number of lawmakers by 35 , to 750 , and parliament last week voted for a new distribution , giving italy fewer seats than its similarly sized partners .
close to midnight , diplomats agreed to give italy one more seat without breaching the 750-member cap by excluding the non-voting president of the parliament from the count .
the eu 's two heavyweights , germany and france , both claimed credit for thursday 's success .
merkel , sarkozy both claim credit while french president nicolas sarkozy said he was " extremely satisfied " with the result , german chancellor angela merkel highlighted the role played by her government in launching the final treaty talks in june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel admitted it had been a struggle to reach agreement " after all the political discussions , this is a great success , " merkel said .
" nothing has been changed from the mandate we agreed at the end of the german presidency . "
she added that the treaty would now help the eu function more efficiently as a bloc and as a power in the world .
she also acknowledged that the deal had been hammered out through some very frustrating discussions and hard bargaining , especially with the poles and italians .
" i ca n't hide the fact that the way to this agreement was very difficult , " merkel said .
other tricky issues were successfully addressed earlier in the meeting .
bulgaria reached a deal allowing it to spell the single currency in cyrillic as " evro " rather than " euro . "
austria received assurances that moves to limit the number of foreigners attending its universities would not be pursued in the european court .
among the treaty 's main innovations are clauses reducing the size of the european commission and streamlining decisions by changing voting rules and limiting the power of individual member states to veto legislation .
it also creates several new posts .
these include a president of the european council of member states , who will represent all the member states , and a high representative of the european union for foreign affairs and security policy , who will be in charge of the bloc 's foreign policy , thereby simplifying its relationships with the outside world . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he had starred in the host nation 's world cup run and secured a big move to bayern munich .
now , however , podolski finds himself in the shadows . the good news for bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld is that he will likely not be pressed to field lukas podolski in the near future .
podolski was one of the major disappointments in germany 's 3-0 home defeat against the czech republic on wednesday night , showing no signs that he deserves a place in munich 's starting line-up .
after all , hitzfeld 's decision to go with klose and luca toni has already proven to be right as the two international strikers share the scoring table lead with eight goals each - and munich enjoy a five-point advantage atop the standings .
podolski was last month warned by munich general manager uli hoeness to finally deliver in his second season , a view also shared by national team general manager oliver bierhoff .
" lukas knows that he has to work on his weaknesses , " said bierhoff .
klose back to partner toni bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose , left , has been in great form since arriving from bremen podolski will have to take his familiar place on the bench on saturday as klose returns from an injury layoff which kept him out of germany 's latest euro-qualifiers .
podolski remains convinced that he can nail down a first-team place with bayern munich .
" i still have two-and-a-half years left on my contract with bayern .
i want to fulfill it , " podolski said this week . hoeness said last month that the player would not make it at the german giants if he did n't " change his attitude . " podolski responded to the comment , saying " i ca n't be prevented from laughing . " poldi more successful in white of germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski remains prolific on the international scene podolski has scored 23 goals in 41 appearances for germany , but has not been as successful in munich after a 2006 move from cologne , with just four goals to date in 25 league matches . he has failed to score in his five substitute appearances in the bundesliga this season following a comeback from a summer injury .
klose , 29 , has been out of action for three weeks with a knee injury , but between him and italian world cup winner toni , the pair already have a 16 goals between them after just 10 league games .
competition fierce up front for bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan schlaudraff is also in the mix for a starting berth german international striker jan schlaudraff is also fighting to break into the bayern first team after a back operation , but says the world-class pairing of klose and toni are a sizeable obstacle .
" let me be clear about this : they absolutely deserve to play , they 've both been superb , " said schlaudraff , who joined bayern this summer from aachen .

18-19 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says economic help is a central aspect of the eu peace plan the german foreign minister said that the proposal would help foster middle east peace by promoting small and medium-sized businesses in the palestinian territories and building up special economic zones .
the plan also aims to increase eu assistance in the training of palestinian police and judiciary as well as in the educational and civil service sectors with greater eu assistance focused on palestinian universities and students .
the idea , steinmeier said , was for the eu to help wean palestinians from development aid by helping to strengthen their private sector .
" in order to swiftly generate the required momentum following an israeli-palestinian accord and the planned middle east conference , europe needs to clearly spell out what contribution it intends to make to take this process forward , " he said .
the point of an eu action plan would be to highlight what the eu is doing to support the process now under way , steinmeier continued .
" we should do everything we can to foster the ongoing dialogue and create a favorable political environment at regional and international level , " he said .
eu ready to play constructive role in peace process steinmeier added that there was no need to wait until the us-hosted conference on the middle east next month before going ahead with the eu ’ s plan .
" i told my colleague -lrb- us secretary of state condoleezza -rrb- rice that we will do everything to ensure that europe plays a constructive role , " he told reporters .
for years the eu has been lending active backing to the middle east peace process and consequently has close relations with the relevant parties and countries in the region and is the main source of funding for reconstruction and development .
steinmeier put total financial and humanitarian aid from the eu and its member states to the region at 800 million euros -lrb- $ 1.14 billion -rrb- for 2007 so far . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german politicians from all major political parties voiced dismay at the increasingly bellicose rhetoric from the united states and russia .
politicians want the rhetoric toned down and a greater focus on diplomacy . german politicians were alarmed when us president george w. bush earlier this week brought up the possibility of another world war .
if iran 's nuclear ambitions are n't kept in check , it could result in world war iii , bush said .
russian president vladimir putin caused further concern when , while in iran on a historic visit this week , he made it clear that russia plans to modernize its military , including its nuclear capacities .
german politicians were universal in condemning bush and putin 's cold war rhetoric and encouraging dialogue and diplomacy .
escalation counterproductive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush talks of world war iii bush 's mention of an impending world war iii was counterproductive in finding a solution to the nuclear standoff with iran , ruprecht polenz , a specialist in foreign affairs for chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- told the dpa news agency .
polenz also criticized putin for saying he wants to build up russia 's military capacity .
rolf mützenich , who specializes in foreign policy for the social democrats , said bush 's statement puts a " mutual and peaceful approach to the iranian nuclear crisis " in danger . the disagreement over iran 's nuclear program can not be solved using force , mützenich told dpa .
he encouraged merkel to make this clear when she meets with bush next month .
it was also " completely inappropriate " for bush to bring up the possibility of world war iii , mützenich said .

" he was making a point , and the point is that we do not believe - and neither does the international community believe - that iran should be allowed to pursue nuclear weapons . "
if iran acquired nuclear weapons , it would lead to a very dangerous situation , perino said .

politicians want the rhetoric toned down and a greater focus on diplomacy . german politicians were alarmed when us president george w. bush earlier this week brought up the possibility of another world war .
if iran 's nuclear ambitions are n't kept in check , it could result in world war iii , bush said .
russian president vladimir putin caused further concern when , while in iran on a historic visit this week , he made it clear that russia plans to modernize its military , including its nuclear capacities .
german politicians were universal in condemning bush and putin 's cold war rhetoric and encouraging dialogue and diplomacy .
escalation counterproductive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush talks of world war iii bush 's mention of an impending world war iii was counterproductive in finding a solution to the nuclear standoff with iran , ruprecht polenz , a specialist in foreign affairs for chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- told the dpa news agency .
polenz also criticized putin for saying he wants to build up russia 's military capacity .
rolf mützenich , who specializes in foreign policy for the social democrats , said bush 's statement puts a " mutual and peaceful approach to the iranian nuclear crisis " in danger . the disagreement over iran 's nuclear program can not be solved using force , mützenich told dpa .

" he was making a point , and the point is that we do not believe - and neither does the international community believe - that iran should be allowed to pursue nuclear weapons . "

not everybody thinks it 's the right way to boost acheivement . an international panel of researchers and political representatives in bonn picked six german institutions - berlin 's free university , rwth aachen university and universities in freiburg , göttingen , heidelberg and constance - to join an " elite " list that already includes two schools in munich and one in karlruhe .
a total of nine universities have made the cut and can be considered elite institutions , the german government said .
its so-called " excellence initiative " was developed in 2005 . the initiative is an attempt to boost the country 's chronically under-funded colleges by encouraging high level research and competition .
" a new page in the history of science " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the university of constance proved it deserved recognition the nine elite universities will benefit from a total of 1.9 billion euros in extra research funding over the next five years .
the major chunk of the money will come from the federal government .
the long-term goal is to put them on par with renowned institutions such as harvard and mit in the united states or oxford and cambridge in the united kingdom .
" we wrote a new page in the history of science today , " education minister annette schavan told the dpa news agency .
the minister described the initiative as " a huge step for the further development of germany 's system of science . "
money was also earmarked for 21 graduate schools that showed they knew how to promote new talent as well as for 20 " research clusters " that demonstrated they were centers of excellence in particular fields .

a total of nine universities have made the cut and can be considered elite institutions , the german government said .
its so-called " excellence initiative " was developed in 2005 . the initiative is an attempt to boost the country 's chronically under-funded colleges by encouraging high level research and competition .
" a new page in the history of science " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the university of constance proved it deserved recognition the nine elite universities will benefit from a total of 1.9 billion euros in extra research funding over the next five years .

18-19 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says economic help is a central aspect of the eu peace plan the german foreign minister said that the proposal would help foster middle east peace by promoting small and medium-sized businesses in the palestinian territories and building up special economic zones .
the plan also aims to increase eu assistance in the training of palestinian police and judiciary as well as in the educational and civil service sectors with greater eu assistance focused on palestinian universities and students .
the idea , steinmeier said , was for the eu to help wean palestinians from development aid by helping to strengthen their private sector .
" in order to swiftly generate the required momentum following an israeli-palestinian accord and the planned middle east conference , europe needs to clearly spell out what contribution it intends to make to take this process forward , " he said .
the point of an eu action plan would be to highlight what the eu is doing to support the process now under way , steinmeier continued .
" we should do everything we can to foster the ongoing dialogue and create a favorable political environment at regional and international level , " he said .
eu ready to play constructive role in peace process steinmeier added that there was no need to wait until the us-hosted conference on the middle east next month before going ahead with the eu ’ s plan .
" i told my colleague -lrb- us secretary of state condoleezza -rrb- rice that we will do everything to ensure that europe plays a constructive role , " he told reporters .
for years the eu has been lending active backing to the middle east peace process and consequently has close relations with the relevant parties and countries in the region and is the main source of funding for reconstruction and development .
steinmeier put total financial and humanitarian aid from the eu and its member states to the region at 800 million euros -lrb- $ 1.14 billion -rrb- for 2007 so far . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says economic help is a central aspect of the eu peace plan the german foreign minister said that the proposal would help foster middle east peace by promoting small and medium-sized businesses in the palestinian territories and building up special economic zones .
the plan also aims to increase eu assistance in the training of palestinian police and judiciary as well as in the educational and civil service sectors with greater eu assistance focused on palestinian universities and students .
the idea , steinmeier said , was for the eu to help wean palestinians from development aid by helping to strengthen their private sector .
" in order to swiftly generate the required momentum following an israeli-palestinian accord and the planned middle east conference , europe needs to clearly spell out what contribution it intends to make to take this process forward , " he said .
the point of an eu action plan would be to highlight what the eu is doing to support the process now under way , steinmeier continued .
" we should do everything we can to foster the ongoing dialogue and create a favorable political environment at regional and international level , " he said .
eu ready to play constructive role in peace process steinmeier added that there was no need to wait until the us-hosted conference on the middle east next month before going ahead with the eu ’ s plan .
" i told my colleague -lrb- us secretary of state condoleezza -rrb- rice that we will do everything to ensure that europe plays a constructive role , " he told reporters .
for years the eu has been lending active backing to the middle east peace process and consequently has close relations with the relevant parties and countries in the region and is the main source of funding for reconstruction and development .
steinmeier put total financial and humanitarian aid from the eu and its member states to the region at 800 million euros -lrb- $ 1.14 billion -rrb- for 2007 so far . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the new lisbon treaty is now expected to be signed in december . the agreement on the reform treaty , reached by prime ministers and heads of state after hours of wrangling in lisbon , should put an end to a prolonged institutional debate sparked by voters in france and the netherlands , who in 2005 referendums rejected a european constitution .
" this is a victory for europe .
we are getting out of a blind alley .
we no longer have an institutional crisis , " said portuguese prime minister jose socrates , who as holder of the eu rotating presidency was acting as the meeting 's host .
the treaty is designed to streamline the eu 's decision-making process following its " big bang " expansion of 2004 , which welcomed 10 new member states into the 50-year-old organization .
it is also set to improve the eu 's global diplomatic clout by simplifying the way it relates with international partners . '

once officially sealed , it will need to be ratified by all member states , by either parliamentary votes or referendums - meaning its implementation is far from assured .
eu officials are nevertheless hopeful that the ratification process will be completed by spring 2009 , when european parliament elections are scheduled .
" this is a good treaty for the union , " said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , the eu 's longest-serving leader .
the impasse was resolved after leaders agreed to give in to demands from poland and italy .
poland satisfied with concessions poland , the most vocal critic of the proposed treaty before the talks , received assurances that a procedure allowing outvoted states to stall eu laws would be enshrined in the treaty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's president kaczynski got what he wanted " poland got what it wanted .
the eu reform treaty project is now crowned with success , " polish president lech kaczynski said .
" i 'm very happy this business is behind us . "
britain also had many reservations about the treaty , but obtained " red line " opt-outs in key areas at the last eu summit in june which remained in the draft presented on thursday .
" the uk 's red lines are secured , " said british prime minister gordon brown , attending his first summit since succeeding tony blair .
" the british national interest has been protected , " he added .
brown was one of the eu leaders at the two-day informal meeting to say that it was time to put years of discussions on the treaty behind them and turn to the more " concrete " problems facing the bloc .
" i have sent a letter round -lsb- to -rsb- fellow colleagues saying that it is time for europe to address detailed issues of global economic change , climate change and security , " brown told journalists .
italy gets extra parliament seat as a sweetener bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi proved to be one of the hardest bargainers italy , which diplomats described as the hardest bargainer during the meeting , obtained one extra seat in the european parliament , giving it the same number of lawmakers as britain .

however , the treaty reduces the overall number of lawmakers by 35 , to 750 , and parliament last week voted for a new distribution , giving italy fewer seats than its similarly sized partners .
close to midnight , diplomats agreed to give italy one more seat without breaching the 750-member cap by excluding the non-voting president of the parliament from the count .

merkel , sarkozy both claim credit while french president nicolas sarkozy said he was " extremely satisfied " with the result , german chancellor angela merkel highlighted the role played by her government in launching the final treaty talks in june .

" nothing has been changed from the mandate we agreed at the end of the german presidency . "
she added that the treaty would now help the eu function more efficiently as a bloc and as a power in the world .
she also acknowledged that the deal had been hammered out through some very frustrating discussions and hard bargaining , especially with the poles and italians .
" i ca n't hide the fact that the way to this agreement was very difficult , " merkel said .

among the treaty 's main innovations are clauses reducing the size of the european commission and streamlining decisions by changing voting rules and limiting the power of individual member states to veto legislation .
it also creates several new posts .

reform treaty doubters in minority as moment of truth arrives the eu treaty : the ioannina compromise explained the european treaty : frequently asked questions the eu treaty : the long road to lisbon european union -pipe- 19.10.2007 hard bargaining leads to success at eu treaty summit in lisbon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portuguese prime minister socrates and german chancellor merkel celebrate the deal eu leaders clinched a final deal late thursday , oct .
18 , on a major overhaul of the 27-member bloc after making key concessions to italy and poland .
the new lisbon treaty is now expected to be signed in december . the agreement on the reform treaty , reached by prime ministers and heads of state after hours of wrangling in lisbon , should put an end to a prolonged institutional debate sparked by voters in france and the netherlands , who in 2005 referendums rejected a european constitution .
" this is a victory for europe .
we are getting out of a blind alley .
we no longer have an institutional crisis , " said portuguese prime minister jose socrates , who as holder of the eu rotating presidency was acting as the meeting 's host .
the treaty is designed to streamline the eu 's decision-making process following its " big bang " expansion of 2004 , which welcomed 10 new member states into the 50-year-old organization .
it is also set to improve the eu 's global diplomatic clout by simplifying the way it relates with international partners . '
historic agreement ' for the 21st century " this is a historic agreement .
now europe can defend its interests in the age of globalization , " said a visibly pleased jose manuel barroso , head of the eu 's executive arm , the european commission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso was relieved and happy with the result " in this case we 're really talking about an agreement which really gives the european union a capacity to act in the 21st century , " he added .
the text is now due to be signed on dec .
13 in the portuguese capital by eu prime ministers and heads of state and will thereafter come to be known as the lisbon treaty .
once officially sealed , it will need to be ratified by all member states , by either parliamentary votes or referendums - meaning its implementation is far from assured .
eu officials are nevertheless hopeful that the ratification process will be completed by spring 2009 , when european parliament elections are scheduled .
" this is a good treaty for the union , " said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , the eu 's longest-serving leader .
the impasse was resolved after leaders agreed to give in to demands from poland and italy .
poland satisfied with concessions poland , the most vocal critic of the proposed treaty before the talks , received assurances that a procedure allowing outvoted states to stall eu laws would be enshrined in the treaty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's president kaczynski got what he wanted " poland got what it wanted .
the eu reform treaty project is now crowned with success , " polish president lech kaczynski said .
" i 'm very happy this business is behind us . "
britain also had many reservations about the treaty , but obtained " red line " opt-outs in key areas at the last eu summit in june which remained in the draft presented on thursday .
" the uk 's red lines are secured , " said british prime minister gordon brown , attending his first summit since succeeding tony blair .
" the british national interest has been protected , " he added .
brown was one of the eu leaders at the two-day informal meeting to say that it was time to put years of discussions on the treaty behind them and turn to the more " concrete " problems facing the bloc .
" i have sent a letter round -lsb- to -rsb- fellow colleagues saying that it is time for europe to address detailed issues of global economic change , climate change and security , " brown told journalists .
italy gets extra parliament seat as a sweetener bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi proved to be one of the hardest bargainers italy , which diplomats described as the hardest bargainer during the meeting , obtained one extra seat in the european parliament , giving it the same number of lawmakers as britain .
under the current system , italy , france and britain all have the same number of members in the european parliament .
however , the treaty reduces the overall number of lawmakers by 35 , to 750 , and parliament last week voted for a new distribution , giving italy fewer seats than its similarly sized partners .
close to midnight , diplomats agreed to give italy one more seat without breaching the 750-member cap by excluding the non-voting president of the parliament from the count .
the eu 's two heavyweights , germany and france , both claimed credit for thursday 's success .
merkel , sarkozy both claim credit while french president nicolas sarkozy said he was " extremely satisfied " with the result , german chancellor angela merkel highlighted the role played by her government in launching the final treaty talks in june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel admitted it had been a struggle to reach agreement " after all the political discussions , this is a great success , " merkel said .
" nothing has been changed from the mandate we agreed at the end of the german presidency . "
she added that the treaty would now help the eu function more efficiently as a bloc and as a power in the world .
she also acknowledged that the deal had been hammered out through some very frustrating discussions and hard bargaining , especially with the poles and italians .
" i ca n't hide the fact that the way to this agreement was very difficult , " merkel said .
other tricky issues were successfully addressed earlier in the meeting .
bulgaria reached a deal allowing it to spell the single currency in cyrillic as " evro " rather than " euro . "
austria received assurances that moves to limit the number of foreigners attending its universities would not be pursued in the european court .
among the treaty 's main innovations are clauses reducing the size of the european commission and streamlining decisions by changing voting rules and limiting the power of individual member states to veto legislation .
it also creates several new posts .
these include a president of the european council of member states , who will represent all the member states , and a high representative of the european union for foreign affairs and security policy , who will be in charge of the bloc 's foreign policy , thereby simplifying its relationships with the outside world . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the head of the army association went further in his critique , saying eu 's afghan plan had " failed pathetically . " german defense minister franz josef jung said the eu plan to send 195 trainers to the conflict-riven region should be reconsidered since the number is likely not high enough .

german politicians from all major political parties voiced dismay at the increasingly bellicose rhetoric from the united states and russia .
politicians want the rhetoric toned down and a greater focus on diplomacy . german politicians were alarmed when us president george w. bush earlier this week brought up the possibility of another world war .
if iran 's nuclear ambitions are n't kept in check , it could result in world war iii , bush said .
russian president vladimir putin caused further concern when , while in iran on a historic visit this week , he made it clear that russia plans to modernize its military , including its nuclear capacities .
german politicians were universal in condemning bush and putin 's cold war rhetoric and encouraging dialogue and diplomacy .
escalation counterproductive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush talks of world war iii bush 's mention of an impending world war iii was counterproductive in finding a solution to the nuclear standoff with iran , ruprecht polenz , a specialist in foreign affairs for chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- told the dpa news agency .
polenz also criticized putin for saying he wants to build up russia 's military capacity .
rolf mützenich , who specializes in foreign policy for the social democrats , said bush 's statement puts a " mutual and peaceful approach to the iranian nuclear crisis " in danger . the disagreement over iran 's nuclear program can not be solved using force , mützenich told dpa .
he encouraged merkel to make this clear when she meets with bush next month .
it was also " completely inappropriate " for bush to bring up the possibility of world war iii , mützenich said .
the left party 's foreign affairs expert , norman paech , said bush 's statement were an " additional signal " that the us is a war risk .
a dangerous political climate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians do n't want to see a return to cold war politics the head of the green party , claudia roth , called the harsh tones from washington and moscow a " backslide into the rhetoric of the cold war , " according to an interview in the internet news portal netzeitung .de.
" bush and putin are losing all forms of measurement and control , " she said .
for jürgen trittin of the green party , bush 's and putin 's recent statements show how dangerous the current political climate is .
bush not making war plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians want more diplomacy and less talk of war bush wanted to make " a rhetorical point " when he suggested that if iran could make nuclear weapons , it could lead to world war iii .
" the president was not making any war plans , and he was n't making any declarations , " said white house press secretary dana perino .
" he was making a point , and the point is that we do not believe - and neither does the international community believe - that iran should be allowed to pursue nuclear weapons . "
if iran acquired nuclear weapons , it would lead to a very dangerous situation , perino said .
the us has accused iran of secretly trying to build nuclear weapons , which tehran denies .
putin will modernize the military bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin during his historic visit to iran putin alarmed world leaders when he mentioned on thursday , oct .
18 , that russia is working on new types of nuclear weapons as part of a " grandiose " plan to strengthen the country 's defenses .
moscow is deeply opposed to us plans to extend its missile shield into europe , by installing 10 missile interceptors in poland and tracking radar in the czech republic .
disarmament expert elke hoff of the free democratic party , a free-market liberal party , reproached putin for using us plans for a missile defense shield to undermine non-proliferation politics .
putin embarked on a landmark visit to iran earlier this week to discuss the country 's nuclear program with iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
on tuesday , putin said he backed the iranian government in its nuclear dispute with the west , while also urging tehran to cooperate with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- in vienna . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the library , a unesco world heritage site , reopens to the public on wednesday , oct .
24 . the 2004 blaze destroyed 37 paintings and 50,000 books , all of them hundreds of years old .
it also revived germany 's trauma over the loss of irreplaceable archives and libraries to bombs during world war ii .
the fire was caused by an electrical malfunction .
when the library reopens wednesday , it will have 60,000 of its original volumes , said director michael knoche .
thousands more are still being repaired .
restoration work is expected to continue until 2015 .
goethe 's literary treasures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fire destroyed 50,000 historic books the restoration has cost 12.8 million euros -lrb- $ 18.2 million -rrb- as workers have painstakingly restored not only the books , but the building itself , including the library 's famous rococo room .
the reading room is a lofty gilded gallery with busts of poets , paintings and bookcases set against white walls .
" it has always been more than just a library , " said hellmut seemann , head of the foundation managing the library , saying visitors regarded it as a shrine to german classicism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an impressive collection built in 1691 , the library specializes in german literature between 1750 and 1850 and houses some one million books , including many rare first-editions and the largest collection of faust by johann wolfgang goethe .
goethe , one of germany 's best-known authors , worked as a librarian at the anna amalia .
weimar , a city about 250 kilometers -lrb- 150 miles -rrb- southwest of berlin in the eastern german state of thuringia , is the region 's cultural center .

the library , a unesco world heritage site , reopens to the public on wednesday , oct .
24 . the 2004 blaze destroyed 37 paintings and 50,000 books , all of them hundreds of years old .
it also revived germany 's trauma over the loss of irreplaceable archives and libraries to bombs during world war ii .
the fire was caused by an electrical malfunction .
when the library reopens wednesday , it will have 60,000 of its original volumes , said director michael knoche .
thousands more are still being repaired .
restoration work is expected to continue until 2015 .
goethe 's literary treasures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fire destroyed 50,000 historic books the restoration has cost 12.8 million euros -lrb- $ 18.2 million -rrb- as workers have painstakingly restored not only the books , but the building itself , including the library 's famous rococo room .
the reading room is a lofty gilded gallery with busts of poets , paintings and bookcases set against white walls .
" it has always been more than just a library , " said hellmut seemann , head of the foundation managing the library , saying visitors regarded it as a shrine to german classicism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an impressive collection built in 1691 , the library specializes in german literature between 1750 and 1850 and houses some one million books , including many rare first-editions and the largest collection of faust by johann wolfgang goethe .
goethe , one of germany 's best-known authors , worked as a librarian at the anna amalia .
weimar , a city about 250 kilometers -lrb- 150 miles -rrb- southwest of berlin in the eastern german state of thuringia , is the region 's cultural center .
it also served as the backdrop for the german republic , which was declared there in 1919 .

he had starred in the host nation 's world cup run and secured a big move to bayern munich .
now , however , podolski finds himself in the shadows . the good news for bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld is that he will likely not be pressed to field lukas podolski in the near future .
podolski was one of the major disappointments in germany 's 3-0 home defeat against the czech republic on wednesday night , showing no signs that he deserves a place in munich 's starting line-up .
after all , hitzfeld 's decision to go with klose and luca toni has already proven to be right as the two international strikers share the scoring table lead with eight goals each - and munich enjoy a five-point advantage atop the standings .
podolski was last month warned by munich general manager uli hoeness to finally deliver in his second season , a view also shared by national team general manager oliver bierhoff .

he had starred in the host nation 's world cup run and secured a big move to bayern munich .
now , however , podolski finds himself in the shadows . the good news for bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld is that he will likely not be pressed to field lukas podolski in the near future .
podolski was one of the major disappointments in germany 's 3-0 home defeat against the czech republic on wednesday night , showing no signs that he deserves a place in munich 's starting line-up .
after all , hitzfeld 's decision to go with klose and luca toni has already proven to be right as the two international strikers share the scoring table lead with eight goals each - and munich enjoy a five-point advantage atop the standings .

reform treaty doubters in minority as moment of truth arrives the eu treaty : the ioannina compromise explained the european treaty : frequently asked questions the eu treaty : the long road to lisbon european union -pipe- 19.10.2007 hard bargaining leads to success at eu treaty summit in lisbon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portuguese prime minister socrates and german chancellor merkel celebrate the deal eu leaders clinched a final deal late thursday , oct .
18 , on a major overhaul of the 27-member bloc after making key concessions to italy and poland .
the new lisbon treaty is now expected to be signed in december . the agreement on the reform treaty , reached by prime ministers and heads of state after hours of wrangling in lisbon , should put an end to a prolonged institutional debate sparked by voters in france and the netherlands , who in 2005 referendums rejected a european constitution .
" this is a victory for europe .
we are getting out of a blind alley .
we no longer have an institutional crisis , " said portuguese prime minister jose socrates , who as holder of the eu rotating presidency was acting as the meeting 's host .
the treaty is designed to streamline the eu 's decision-making process following its " big bang " expansion of 2004 , which welcomed 10 new member states into the 50-year-old organization .
it is also set to improve the eu 's global diplomatic clout by simplifying the way it relates with international partners . '
historic agreement ' for the 21st century " this is a historic agreement .
now europe can defend its interests in the age of globalization , " said a visibly pleased jose manuel barroso , head of the eu 's executive arm , the european commission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso was relieved and happy with the result " in this case we 're really talking about an agreement which really gives the european union a capacity to act in the 21st century , " he added .
the text is now due to be signed on dec .
13 in the portuguese capital by eu prime ministers and heads of state and will thereafter come to be known as the lisbon treaty .
once officially sealed , it will need to be ratified by all member states , by either parliamentary votes or referendums - meaning its implementation is far from assured .
eu officials are nevertheless hopeful that the ratification process will be completed by spring 2009 , when european parliament elections are scheduled .
" this is a good treaty for the union , " said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , the eu 's longest-serving leader .
the impasse was resolved after leaders agreed to give in to demands from poland and italy .
poland satisfied with concessions poland , the most vocal critic of the proposed treaty before the talks , received assurances that a procedure allowing outvoted states to stall eu laws would be enshrined in the treaty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's president kaczynski got what he wanted " poland got what it wanted .
the eu reform treaty project is now crowned with success , " polish president lech kaczynski said .
" i 'm very happy this business is behind us . "
britain also had many reservations about the treaty , but obtained " red line " opt-outs in key areas at the last eu summit in june which remained in the draft presented on thursday .
" the uk 's red lines are secured , " said british prime minister gordon brown , attending his first summit since succeeding tony blair .
" the british national interest has been protected , " he added .
brown was one of the eu leaders at the two-day informal meeting to say that it was time to put years of discussions on the treaty behind them and turn to the more " concrete " problems facing the bloc .
" i have sent a letter round -lsb- to -rsb- fellow colleagues saying that it is time for europe to address detailed issues of global economic change , climate change and security , " brown told journalists .
italy gets extra parliament seat as a sweetener bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi proved to be one of the hardest bargainers italy , which diplomats described as the hardest bargainer during the meeting , obtained one extra seat in the european parliament , giving it the same number of lawmakers as britain .
under the current system , italy , france and britain all have the same number of members in the european parliament .
however , the treaty reduces the overall number of lawmakers by 35 , to 750 , and parliament last week voted for a new distribution , giving italy fewer seats than its similarly sized partners .
close to midnight , diplomats agreed to give italy one more seat without breaching the 750-member cap by excluding the non-voting president of the parliament from the count .
the eu 's two heavyweights , germany and france , both claimed credit for thursday 's success .
merkel , sarkozy both claim credit while french president nicolas sarkozy said he was " extremely satisfied " with the result , german chancellor angela merkel highlighted the role played by her government in launching the final treaty talks in june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel admitted it had been a struggle to reach agreement " after all the political discussions , this is a great success , " merkel said .
" nothing has been changed from the mandate we agreed at the end of the german presidency . "
she added that the treaty would now help the eu function more efficiently as a bloc and as a power in the world .
she also acknowledged that the deal had been hammered out through some very frustrating discussions and hard bargaining , especially with the poles and italians .
" i ca n't hide the fact that the way to this agreement was very difficult , " merkel said .
other tricky issues were successfully addressed earlier in the meeting .
bulgaria reached a deal allowing it to spell the single currency in cyrillic as " evro " rather than " euro . "
austria received assurances that moves to limit the number of foreigners attending its universities would not be pursued in the european court .
among the treaty 's main innovations are clauses reducing the size of the european commission and streamlining decisions by changing voting rules and limiting the power of individual member states to veto legislation .
it also creates several new posts .
these include a president of the european council of member states , who will represent all the member states , and a high representative of the european union for foreign affairs and security policy , who will be in charge of the bloc 's foreign policy , thereby simplifying its relationships with the outside world . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not everybody thinks it 's the right way to boost acheivement . an international panel of researchers and political representatives in bonn picked six german institutions - berlin 's free university , rwth aachen university and universities in freiburg , göttingen , heidelberg and constance - to join an " elite " list that already includes two schools in munich and one in karlruhe .
a total of nine universities have made the cut and can be considered elite institutions , the german government said .
its so-called " excellence initiative " was developed in 2005 . the initiative is an attempt to boost the country 's chronically under-funded colleges by encouraging high level research and competition .
" a new page in the history of science " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the university of constance proved it deserved recognition the nine elite universities will benefit from a total of 1.9 billion euros in extra research funding over the next five years .
the major chunk of the money will come from the federal government .
the long-term goal is to put them on par with renowned institutions such as harvard and mit in the united states or oxford and cambridge in the united kingdom .
" we wrote a new page in the history of science today , " education minister annette schavan told the dpa news agency .
the minister described the initiative as " a huge step for the further development of germany 's system of science . "
money was also earmarked for 21 graduate schools that showed they knew how to promote new talent as well as for 20 " research clusters " that demonstrated they were centers of excellence in particular fields .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says economic help is a central aspect of the eu peace plan the german foreign minister said that the proposal would help foster middle east peace by promoting small and medium-sized businesses in the palestinian territories and building up special economic zones .
the plan also aims to increase eu assistance in the training of palestinian police and judiciary as well as in the educational and civil service sectors with greater eu assistance focused on palestinian universities and students .
the idea , steinmeier said , was for the eu to help wean palestinians from development aid by helping to strengthen their private sector .
" in order to swiftly generate the required momentum following an israeli-palestinian accord and the planned middle east conference , europe needs to clearly spell out what contribution it intends to make to take this process forward , " he said .
the point of an eu action plan would be to highlight what the eu is doing to support the process now under way , steinmeier continued .
" we should do everything we can to foster the ongoing dialogue and create a favorable political environment at regional and international level , " he said .
eu ready to play constructive role in peace process steinmeier added that there was no need to wait until the us-hosted conference on the middle east next month before going ahead with the eu ’ s plan .
" i told my colleague -lrb- us secretary of state condoleezza -rrb- rice that we will do everything to ensure that europe plays a constructive role , " he told reporters .
for years the eu has been lending active backing to the middle east peace process and consequently has close relations with the relevant parties and countries in the region and is the main source of funding for reconstruction and development .

now , however , podolski finds himself in the shadows . the good news for bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld is that he will likely not be pressed to field lukas podolski in the near future .
podolski was one of the major disappointments in germany 's 3-0 home defeat against the czech republic on wednesday night , showing no signs that he deserves a place in munich 's starting line-up .
after all , hitzfeld 's decision to go with klose and luca toni has already proven to be right as the two international strikers share the scoring table lead with eight goals each - and munich enjoy a five-point advantage atop the standings .

" as long as the taliban have not clearly sworn off violence , i believe negotiations may not be conducted , " he said . he said british troops had had negative experiences in past attempts at talks with the taliban in the volative south of the country , which had led to more violence .

russian president vladimir putin caused further concern when , while in iran on a historic visit this week , he made it clear that russia plans to modernize its military , including its nuclear capacities .
german politicians were universal in condemning bush and putin 's cold war rhetoric and encouraging dialogue and diplomacy .
escalation counterproductive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush talks of world war iii bush 's mention of an impending world war iii was counterproductive in finding a solution to the nuclear standoff with iran , ruprecht polenz , a specialist in foreign affairs for chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- told the dpa news agency .
polenz also criticized putin for saying he wants to build up russia 's military capacity .

" he was making a point , and the point is that we do not believe - and neither does the international community believe - that iran should be allowed to pursue nuclear weapons . "
if iran acquired nuclear weapons , it would lead to a very dangerous situation , perino said .

reform treaty doubters in minority as moment of truth arrives the eu treaty : the ioannina compromise explained the european treaty : frequently asked questions the eu treaty : the long road to lisbon european union -pipe- 19.10.2007 hard bargaining leads to success at eu treaty summit in lisbon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portuguese prime minister socrates and german chancellor merkel celebrate the deal eu leaders clinched a final deal late thursday , oct .
18 , on a major overhaul of the 27-member bloc after making key concessions to italy and poland .
the new lisbon treaty is now expected to be signed in december . the agreement on the reform treaty , reached by prime ministers and heads of state after hours of wrangling in lisbon , should put an end to a prolonged institutional debate sparked by voters in france and the netherlands , who in 2005 referendums rejected a european constitution .
" this is a victory for europe .
we are getting out of a blind alley .
we no longer have an institutional crisis , " said portuguese prime minister jose socrates , who as holder of the eu rotating presidency was acting as the meeting 's host .
the treaty is designed to streamline the eu 's decision-making process following its " big bang " expansion of 2004 , which welcomed 10 new member states into the 50-year-old organization .
it is also set to improve the eu 's global diplomatic clout by simplifying the way it relates with international partners . '
historic agreement ' for the 21st century " this is a historic agreement .
now europe can defend its interests in the age of globalization , " said a visibly pleased jose manuel barroso , head of the eu 's executive arm , the european commission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso was relieved and happy with the result " in this case we 're really talking about an agreement which really gives the european union a capacity to act in the 21st century , " he added .
the text is now due to be signed on dec .
13 in the portuguese capital by eu prime ministers and heads of state and will thereafter come to be known as the lisbon treaty .
once officially sealed , it will need to be ratified by all member states , by either parliamentary votes or referendums - meaning its implementation is far from assured .
eu officials are nevertheless hopeful that the ratification process will be completed by spring 2009 , when european parliament elections are scheduled .
" this is a good treaty for the union , " said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , the eu 's longest-serving leader .
the impasse was resolved after leaders agreed to give in to demands from poland and italy .
poland satisfied with concessions poland , the most vocal critic of the proposed treaty before the talks , received assurances that a procedure allowing outvoted states to stall eu laws would be enshrined in the treaty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's president kaczynski got what he wanted " poland got what it wanted .
the eu reform treaty project is now crowned with success , " polish president lech kaczynski said .
" i 'm very happy this business is behind us . "
britain also had many reservations about the treaty , but obtained " red line " opt-outs in key areas at the last eu summit in june which remained in the draft presented on thursday .
" the uk 's red lines are secured , " said british prime minister gordon brown , attending his first summit since succeeding tony blair .
" the british national interest has been protected , " he added .
brown was one of the eu leaders at the two-day informal meeting to say that it was time to put years of discussions on the treaty behind them and turn to the more " concrete " problems facing the bloc .
" i have sent a letter round -lsb- to -rsb- fellow colleagues saying that it is time for europe to address detailed issues of global economic change , climate change and security , " brown told journalists .
italy gets extra parliament seat as a sweetener bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi proved to be one of the hardest bargainers italy , which diplomats described as the hardest bargainer during the meeting , obtained one extra seat in the european parliament , giving it the same number of lawmakers as britain .
under the current system , italy , france and britain all have the same number of members in the european parliament .
however , the treaty reduces the overall number of lawmakers by 35 , to 750 , and parliament last week voted for a new distribution , giving italy fewer seats than its similarly sized partners .
close to midnight , diplomats agreed to give italy one more seat without breaching the 750-member cap by excluding the non-voting president of the parliament from the count .
the eu 's two heavyweights , germany and france , both claimed credit for thursday 's success .
merkel , sarkozy both claim credit while french president nicolas sarkozy said he was " extremely satisfied " with the result , german chancellor angela merkel highlighted the role played by her government in launching the final treaty talks in june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel admitted it had been a struggle to reach agreement " after all the political discussions , this is a great success , " merkel said .
" nothing has been changed from the mandate we agreed at the end of the german presidency . "
she added that the treaty would now help the eu function more efficiently as a bloc and as a power in the world .
she also acknowledged that the deal had been hammered out through some very frustrating discussions and hard bargaining , especially with the poles and italians .
" i ca n't hide the fact that the way to this agreement was very difficult , " merkel said .
other tricky issues were successfully addressed earlier in the meeting .
bulgaria reached a deal allowing it to spell the single currency in cyrillic as " evro " rather than " euro . "
austria received assurances that moves to limit the number of foreigners attending its universities would not be pursued in the european court .
among the treaty 's main innovations are clauses reducing the size of the european commission and streamlining decisions by changing voting rules and limiting the power of individual member states to veto legislation .
it also creates several new posts .
these include a president of the european council of member states , who will represent all the member states , and a high representative of the european union for foreign affairs and security policy , who will be in charge of the bloc 's foreign policy , thereby simplifying its relationships with the outside world . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

reform treaty doubters in minority as moment of truth arrives the eu treaty : the ioannina compromise explained the european treaty : frequently asked questions the eu treaty : the long road to lisbon european union -pipe- 19.10.2007 hard bargaining leads to success at eu treaty summit in lisbon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portuguese prime minister socrates and german chancellor merkel celebrate the deal eu leaders clinched a final deal late thursday , oct .
18 , on a major overhaul of the 27-member bloc after making key concessions to italy and poland .
the new lisbon treaty is now expected to be signed in december . the agreement on the reform treaty , reached by prime ministers and heads of state after hours of wrangling in lisbon , should put an end to a prolonged institutional debate sparked by voters in france and the netherlands , who in 2005 referendums rejected a european constitution .
" this is a victory for europe .
we are getting out of a blind alley .
we no longer have an institutional crisis , " said portuguese prime minister jose socrates , who as holder of the eu rotating presidency was acting as the meeting 's host .
the treaty is designed to streamline the eu 's decision-making process following its " big bang " expansion of 2004 , which welcomed 10 new member states into the 50-year-old organization .
it is also set to improve the eu 's global diplomatic clout by simplifying the way it relates with international partners . '
historic agreement ' for the 21st century " this is a historic agreement .
now europe can defend its interests in the age of globalization , " said a visibly pleased jose manuel barroso , head of the eu 's executive arm , the european commission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso was relieved and happy with the result " in this case we 're really talking about an agreement which really gives the european union a capacity to act in the 21st century , " he added .
the text is now due to be signed on dec .
13 in the portuguese capital by eu prime ministers and heads of state and will thereafter come to be known as the lisbon treaty .
once officially sealed , it will need to be ratified by all member states , by either parliamentary votes or referendums - meaning its implementation is far from assured .
eu officials are nevertheless hopeful that the ratification process will be completed by spring 2009 , when european parliament elections are scheduled .
" this is a good treaty for the union , " said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , the eu 's longest-serving leader .
the impasse was resolved after leaders agreed to give in to demands from poland and italy .
poland satisfied with concessions poland , the most vocal critic of the proposed treaty before the talks , received assurances that a procedure allowing outvoted states to stall eu laws would be enshrined in the treaty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's president kaczynski got what he wanted " poland got what it wanted .
the eu reform treaty project is now crowned with success , " polish president lech kaczynski said .
" i 'm very happy this business is behind us . "
britain also had many reservations about the treaty , but obtained " red line " opt-outs in key areas at the last eu summit in june which remained in the draft presented on thursday .
" the uk 's red lines are secured , " said british prime minister gordon brown , attending his first summit since succeeding tony blair .
" the british national interest has been protected , " he added .
brown was one of the eu leaders at the two-day informal meeting to say that it was time to put years of discussions on the treaty behind them and turn to the more " concrete " problems facing the bloc .
" i have sent a letter round -lsb- to -rsb- fellow colleagues saying that it is time for europe to address detailed issues of global economic change , climate change and security , " brown told journalists .
italy gets extra parliament seat as a sweetener bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi proved to be one of the hardest bargainers italy , which diplomats described as the hardest bargainer during the meeting , obtained one extra seat in the european parliament , giving it the same number of lawmakers as britain .
under the current system , italy , france and britain all have the same number of members in the european parliament .
however , the treaty reduces the overall number of lawmakers by 35 , to 750 , and parliament last week voted for a new distribution , giving italy fewer seats than its similarly sized partners .
close to midnight , diplomats agreed to give italy one more seat without breaching the 750-member cap by excluding the non-voting president of the parliament from the count .
the eu 's two heavyweights , germany and france , both claimed credit for thursday 's success .
merkel , sarkozy both claim credit while french president nicolas sarkozy said he was " extremely satisfied " with the result , german chancellor angela merkel highlighted the role played by her government in launching the final treaty talks in june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel admitted it had been a struggle to reach agreement " after all the political discussions , this is a great success , " merkel said .
" nothing has been changed from the mandate we agreed at the end of the german presidency . "
she added that the treaty would now help the eu function more efficiently as a bloc and as a power in the world .
she also acknowledged that the deal had been hammered out through some very frustrating discussions and hard bargaining , especially with the poles and italians .
" i ca n't hide the fact that the way to this agreement was very difficult , " merkel said .
other tricky issues were successfully addressed earlier in the meeting .
bulgaria reached a deal allowing it to spell the single currency in cyrillic as " evro " rather than " euro . "
austria received assurances that moves to limit the number of foreigners attending its universities would not be pursued in the european court .
among the treaty 's main innovations are clauses reducing the size of the european commission and streamlining decisions by changing voting rules and limiting the power of individual member states to veto legislation .
it also creates several new posts .
these include a president of the european council of member states , who will represent all the member states , and a high representative of the european union for foreign affairs and security policy , who will be in charge of the bloc 's foreign policy , thereby simplifying its relationships with the outside world . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu reform treaty project is now crowned with success , " polish president lech kaczynski said .
" i 'm very happy this business is behind us . "
britain also had many reservations about the treaty , but obtained " red line " opt-outs in key areas at the last eu summit in june which remained in the draft presented on thursday .
" the uk 's red lines are secured , " said british prime minister gordon brown , attending his first summit since succeeding tony blair .
" the british national interest has been protected , " he added .
brown was one of the eu leaders at the two-day informal meeting to say that it was time to put years of discussions on the treaty behind them and turn to the more " concrete " problems facing the bloc .
" i have sent a letter round -lsb- to -rsb- fellow colleagues saying that it is time for europe to address detailed issues of global economic change , climate change and security , " brown told journalists .
italy gets extra parliament seat as a sweetener bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi proved to be one of the hardest bargainers italy , which diplomats described as the hardest bargainer during the meeting , obtained one extra seat in the european parliament , giving it the same number of lawmakers as britain .
under the current system , italy , france and britain all have the same number of members in the european parliament .
however , the treaty reduces the overall number of lawmakers by 35 , to 750 , and parliament last week voted for a new distribution , giving italy fewer seats than its similarly sized partners .
close to midnight , diplomats agreed to give italy one more seat without breaching the 750-member cap by excluding the non-voting president of the parliament from the count .
the eu 's two heavyweights , germany and france , both claimed credit for thursday 's success .
merkel , sarkozy both claim credit while french president nicolas sarkozy said he was " extremely satisfied " with the result , german chancellor angela merkel highlighted the role played by her government in launching the final treaty talks in june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel admitted it had been a struggle to reach agreement " after all the political discussions , this is a great success , " merkel said .
" nothing has been changed from the mandate we agreed at the end of the german presidency . "
she added that the treaty would now help the eu function more efficiently as a bloc and as a power in the world .
she also acknowledged that the deal had been hammered out through some very frustrating discussions and hard bargaining , especially with the poles and italians .
" i ca n't hide the fact that the way to this agreement was very difficult , " merkel said .
other tricky issues were successfully addressed earlier in the meeting .
bulgaria reached a deal allowing it to spell the single currency in cyrillic as " evro " rather than " euro . "
austria received assurances that moves to limit the number of foreigners attending its universities would not be pursued in the european court .
among the treaty 's main innovations are clauses reducing the size of the european commission and streamlining decisions by changing voting rules and limiting the power of individual member states to veto legislation .
it also creates several new posts .
these include a president of the european council of member states , who will represent all the member states , and a high representative of the european union for foreign affairs and security policy , who will be in charge of the bloc 's foreign policy , thereby simplifying its relationships with the outside world . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he had starred in the host nation 's world cup run and secured a big move to bayern munich .
now , however , podolski finds himself in the shadows . the good news for bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld is that he will likely not be pressed to field lukas podolski in the near future .
podolski was one of the major disappointments in germany 's 3-0 home defeat against the czech republic on wednesday night , showing no signs that he deserves a place in munich 's starting line-up .
after all , hitzfeld 's decision to go with klose and luca toni has already proven to be right as the two international strikers share the scoring table lead with eight goals each - and munich enjoy a five-point advantage atop the standings .
podolski was last month warned by munich general manager uli hoeness to finally deliver in his second season , a view also shared by national team general manager oliver bierhoff .
" lukas knows that he has to work on his weaknesses , " said bierhoff .
klose back to partner toni bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose , left , has been in great form since arriving from bremen podolski will have to take his familiar place on the bench on saturday as klose returns from an injury layoff which kept him out of germany 's latest euro-qualifiers .
podolski remains convinced that he can nail down a first-team place with bayern munich .
" i still have two-and-a-half years left on my contract with bayern .
i want to fulfill it , " podolski said this week . hoeness said last month that the player would not make it at the german giants if he did n't " change his attitude . " podolski responded to the comment , saying " i ca n't be prevented from laughing . " poldi more successful in white of germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski remains prolific on the international scene podolski has scored 23 goals in 41 appearances for germany , but has not been as successful in munich after a 2006 move from cologne , with just four goals to date in 25 league matches . he has failed to score in his five substitute appearances in the bundesliga this season following a comeback from a summer injury .
klose , 29 , has been out of action for three weeks with a knee injury , but between him and italian world cup winner toni , the pair already have a 16 goals between them after just 10 league games .
competition fierce up front for bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan schlaudraff is also in the mix for a starting berth german international striker jan schlaudraff is also fighting to break into the bayern first team after a back operation , but says the world-class pairing of klose and toni are a sizeable obstacle .
" let me be clear about this : they absolutely deserve to play , they 've both been superb , " said schlaudraff , who joined bayern this summer from aachen .
" it should be every footballer 's ambition to play with these stars and learn from them . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german politicians from all major political parties voiced dismay at the increasingly bellicose rhetoric from the united states and russia .
politicians want the rhetoric toned down and a greater focus on diplomacy . german politicians were alarmed when us president george w. bush earlier this week brought up the possibility of another world war .
if iran 's nuclear ambitions are n't kept in check , it could result in world war iii , bush said .
russian president vladimir putin caused further concern when , while in iran on a historic visit this week , he made it clear that russia plans to modernize its military , including its nuclear capacities .
german politicians were universal in condemning bush and putin 's cold war rhetoric and encouraging dialogue and diplomacy .
escalation counterproductive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush talks of world war iii bush 's mention of an impending world war iii was counterproductive in finding a solution to the nuclear standoff with iran , ruprecht polenz , a specialist in foreign affairs for chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- told the dpa news agency .
polenz also criticized putin for saying he wants to build up russia 's military capacity .
rolf mützenich , who specializes in foreign policy for the social democrats , said bush 's statement puts a " mutual and peaceful approach to the iranian nuclear crisis " in danger . the disagreement over iran 's nuclear program can not be solved using force , mützenich told dpa .
he encouraged merkel to make this clear when she meets with bush next month .
it was also " completely inappropriate " for bush to bring up the possibility of world war iii , mützenich said .
the left party 's foreign affairs expert , norman paech , said bush 's statement were an " additional signal " that the us is a war risk .

bush not making war plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians want more diplomacy and less talk of war bush wanted to make " a rhetorical point " when he suggested that if iran could make nuclear weapons , it could lead to world war iii .
" the president was not making any war plans , and he was n't making any declarations , " said white house press secretary dana perino .
" he was making a point , and the point is that we do not believe - and neither does the international community believe - that iran should be allowed to pursue nuclear weapons . "
if iran acquired nuclear weapons , it would lead to a very dangerous situation , perino said .
the us has accused iran of secretly trying to build nuclear weapons , which tehran denies .

disarmament expert elke hoff of the free democratic party , a free-market liberal party , reproached putin for using us plans for a missile defense shield to undermine non-proliferation politics .
putin embarked on a landmark visit to iran earlier this week to discuss the country 's nuclear program with iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .

german politicians from all major political parties voiced dismay at the increasingly bellicose rhetoric from the united states and russia .
politicians want the rhetoric toned down and a greater focus on diplomacy . german politicians were alarmed when us president george w. bush earlier this week brought up the possibility of another world war .
if iran 's nuclear ambitions are n't kept in check , it could result in world war iii , bush said .
russian president vladimir putin caused further concern when , while in iran on a historic visit this week , he made it clear that russia plans to modernize its military , including its nuclear capacities .
german politicians were universal in condemning bush and putin 's cold war rhetoric and encouraging dialogue and diplomacy .
escalation counterproductive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush talks of world war iii bush 's mention of an impending world war iii was counterproductive in finding a solution to the nuclear standoff with iran , ruprecht polenz , a specialist in foreign affairs for chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- told the dpa news agency .
polenz also criticized putin for saying he wants to build up russia 's military capacity .
rolf mützenich , who specializes in foreign policy for the social democrats , said bush 's statement puts a " mutual and peaceful approach to the iranian nuclear crisis " in danger . the disagreement over iran 's nuclear program can not be solved using force , mützenich told dpa .
he encouraged merkel to make this clear when she meets with bush next month .
it was also " completely inappropriate " for bush to bring up the possibility of world war iii , mützenich said .

reform treaty doubters in minority as moment of truth arrives the eu treaty : the ioannina compromise explained the european treaty : frequently asked questions the eu treaty : the long road to lisbon european union -pipe- 19.10.2007 hard bargaining leads to success at eu treaty summit in lisbon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portuguese prime minister socrates and german chancellor merkel celebrate the deal eu leaders clinched a final deal late thursday , oct .
18 , on a major overhaul of the 27-member bloc after making key concessions to italy and poland .
the new lisbon treaty is now expected to be signed in december . the agreement on the reform treaty , reached by prime ministers and heads of state after hours of wrangling in lisbon , should put an end to a prolonged institutional debate sparked by voters in france and the netherlands , who in 2005 referendums rejected a european constitution .
" this is a victory for europe .
we are getting out of a blind alley .
we no longer have an institutional crisis , " said portuguese prime minister jose socrates , who as holder of the eu rotating presidency was acting as the meeting 's host .
the treaty is designed to streamline the eu 's decision-making process following its " big bang " expansion of 2004 , which welcomed 10 new member states into the 50-year-old organization .
it is also set to improve the eu 's global diplomatic clout by simplifying the way it relates with international partners . '
historic agreement ' for the 21st century " this is a historic agreement .
now europe can defend its interests in the age of globalization , " said a visibly pleased jose manuel barroso , head of the eu 's executive arm , the european commission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso was relieved and happy with the result " in this case we 're really talking about an agreement which really gives the european union a capacity to act in the 21st century , " he added .
the text is now due to be signed on dec .
13 in the portuguese capital by eu prime ministers and heads of state and will thereafter come to be known as the lisbon treaty .
once officially sealed , it will need to be ratified by all member states , by either parliamentary votes or referendums - meaning its implementation is far from assured .
eu officials are nevertheless hopeful that the ratification process will be completed by spring 2009 , when european parliament elections are scheduled .
" this is a good treaty for the union , " said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , the eu 's longest-serving leader .
the impasse was resolved after leaders agreed to give in to demands from poland and italy .
poland satisfied with concessions poland , the most vocal critic of the proposed treaty before the talks , received assurances that a procedure allowing outvoted states to stall eu laws would be enshrined in the treaty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's president kaczynski got what he wanted " poland got what it wanted .
the eu reform treaty project is now crowned with success , " polish president lech kaczynski said .
" i 'm very happy this business is behind us . "
britain also had many reservations about the treaty , but obtained " red line " opt-outs in key areas at the last eu summit in june which remained in the draft presented on thursday .
" the uk 's red lines are secured , " said british prime minister gordon brown , attending his first summit since succeeding tony blair .
" the british national interest has been protected , " he added .
brown was one of the eu leaders at the two-day informal meeting to say that it was time to put years of discussions on the treaty behind them and turn to the more " concrete " problems facing the bloc .
" i have sent a letter round -lsb- to -rsb- fellow colleagues saying that it is time for europe to address detailed issues of global economic change , climate change and security , " brown told journalists .
italy gets extra parliament seat as a sweetener bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi proved to be one of the hardest bargainers italy , which diplomats described as the hardest bargainer during the meeting , obtained one extra seat in the european parliament , giving it the same number of lawmakers as britain .
under the current system , italy , france and britain all have the same number of members in the european parliament .
however , the treaty reduces the overall number of lawmakers by 35 , to 750 , and parliament last week voted for a new distribution , giving italy fewer seats than its similarly sized partners .
close to midnight , diplomats agreed to give italy one more seat without breaching the 750-member cap by excluding the non-voting president of the parliament from the count .
the eu 's two heavyweights , germany and france , both claimed credit for thursday 's success .
merkel , sarkozy both claim credit while french president nicolas sarkozy said he was " extremely satisfied " with the result , german chancellor angela merkel highlighted the role played by her government in launching the final treaty talks in june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel admitted it had been a struggle to reach agreement " after all the political discussions , this is a great success , " merkel said .
" nothing has been changed from the mandate we agreed at the end of the german presidency . "
she added that the treaty would now help the eu function more efficiently as a bloc and as a power in the world .
she also acknowledged that the deal had been hammered out through some very frustrating discussions and hard bargaining , especially with the poles and italians .
" i ca n't hide the fact that the way to this agreement was very difficult , " merkel said .
other tricky issues were successfully addressed earlier in the meeting .

reform treaty doubters in minority as moment of truth arrives the eu treaty : the ioannina compromise explained the european treaty : frequently asked questions the eu treaty : the long road to lisbon european union -pipe- 19.10.2007 hard bargaining leads to success at eu treaty summit in lisbon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portuguese prime minister socrates and german chancellor merkel celebrate the deal eu leaders clinched a final deal late thursday , oct .
18 , on a major overhaul of the 27-member bloc after making key concessions to italy and poland .
the new lisbon treaty is now expected to be signed in december . the agreement on the reform treaty , reached by prime ministers and heads of state after hours of wrangling in lisbon , should put an end to a prolonged institutional debate sparked by voters in france and the netherlands , who in 2005 referendums rejected a european constitution .
" this is a victory for europe .
we are getting out of a blind alley .
we no longer have an institutional crisis , " said portuguese prime minister jose socrates , who as holder of the eu rotating presidency was acting as the meeting 's host .
the treaty is designed to streamline the eu 's decision-making process following its " big bang " expansion of 2004 , which welcomed 10 new member states into the 50-year-old organization .
it is also set to improve the eu 's global diplomatic clout by simplifying the way it relates with international partners . '
historic agreement ' for the 21st century " this is a historic agreement .
now europe can defend its interests in the age of globalization , " said a visibly pleased jose manuel barroso , head of the eu 's executive arm , the european commission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso was relieved and happy with the result " in this case we 're really talking about an agreement which really gives the european union a capacity to act in the 21st century , " he added .
the text is now due to be signed on dec .
13 in the portuguese capital by eu prime ministers and heads of state and will thereafter come to be known as the lisbon treaty .
once officially sealed , it will need to be ratified by all member states , by either parliamentary votes or referendums - meaning its implementation is far from assured .
eu officials are nevertheless hopeful that the ratification process will be completed by spring 2009 , when european parliament elections are scheduled .
" this is a good treaty for the union , " said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , the eu 's longest-serving leader .
the impasse was resolved after leaders agreed to give in to demands from poland and italy .
poland satisfied with concessions poland , the most vocal critic of the proposed treaty before the talks , received assurances that a procedure allowing outvoted states to stall eu laws would be enshrined in the treaty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's president kaczynski got what he wanted " poland got what it wanted .
the eu reform treaty project is now crowned with success , " polish president lech kaczynski said .
" i 'm very happy this business is behind us . "
britain also had many reservations about the treaty , but obtained " red line " opt-outs in key areas at the last eu summit in june which remained in the draft presented on thursday .
" the uk 's red lines are secured , " said british prime minister gordon brown , attending his first summit since succeeding tony blair .
" the british national interest has been protected , " he added .
brown was one of the eu leaders at the two-day informal meeting to say that it was time to put years of discussions on the treaty behind them and turn to the more " concrete " problems facing the bloc .
" i have sent a letter round -lsb- to -rsb- fellow colleagues saying that it is time for europe to address detailed issues of global economic change , climate change and security , " brown told journalists .
italy gets extra parliament seat as a sweetener bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi proved to be one of the hardest bargainers italy , which diplomats described as the hardest bargainer during the meeting , obtained one extra seat in the european parliament , giving it the same number of lawmakers as britain .
under the current system , italy , france and britain all have the same number of members in the european parliament .
however , the treaty reduces the overall number of lawmakers by 35 , to 750 , and parliament last week voted for a new distribution , giving italy fewer seats than its similarly sized partners .
close to midnight , diplomats agreed to give italy one more seat without breaching the 750-member cap by excluding the non-voting president of the parliament from the count .
the eu 's two heavyweights , germany and france , both claimed credit for thursday 's success .
merkel , sarkozy both claim credit while french president nicolas sarkozy said he was " extremely satisfied " with the result , german chancellor angela merkel highlighted the role played by her government in launching the final treaty talks in june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel admitted it had been a struggle to reach agreement " after all the political discussions , this is a great success , " merkel said .
" nothing has been changed from the mandate we agreed at the end of the german presidency . "
she added that the treaty would now help the eu function more efficiently as a bloc and as a power in the world .
she also acknowledged that the deal had been hammered out through some very frustrating discussions and hard bargaining , especially with the poles and italians .
" i ca n't hide the fact that the way to this agreement was very difficult , " merkel said .
other tricky issues were successfully addressed earlier in the meeting .

reform treaty doubters in minority as moment of truth arrives the eu treaty : the ioannina compromise explained the european treaty : frequently asked questions the eu treaty : the long road to lisbon european union -pipe- 19.10.2007 hard bargaining leads to success at eu treaty summit in lisbon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portuguese prime minister socrates and german chancellor merkel celebrate the deal eu leaders clinched a final deal late thursday , oct .
18 , on a major overhaul of the 27-member bloc after making key concessions to italy and poland .
the new lisbon treaty is now expected to be signed in december . the agreement on the reform treaty , reached by prime ministers and heads of state after hours of wrangling in lisbon , should put an end to a prolonged institutional debate sparked by voters in france and the netherlands , who in 2005 referendums rejected a european constitution .
" this is a victory for europe .
we are getting out of a blind alley .
we no longer have an institutional crisis , " said portuguese prime minister jose socrates , who as holder of the eu rotating presidency was acting as the meeting 's host .
the treaty is designed to streamline the eu 's decision-making process following its " big bang " expansion of 2004 , which welcomed 10 new member states into the 50-year-old organization .
it is also set to improve the eu 's global diplomatic clout by simplifying the way it relates with international partners . '
historic agreement ' for the 21st century " this is a historic agreement .
now europe can defend its interests in the age of globalization , " said a visibly pleased jose manuel barroso , head of the eu 's executive arm , the european commission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso was relieved and happy with the result " in this case we 're really talking about an agreement which really gives the european union a capacity to act in the 21st century , " he added .
the text is now due to be signed on dec .
13 in the portuguese capital by eu prime ministers and heads of state and will thereafter come to be known as the lisbon treaty .
once officially sealed , it will need to be ratified by all member states , by either parliamentary votes or referendums - meaning its implementation is far from assured .
eu officials are nevertheless hopeful that the ratification process will be completed by spring 2009 , when european parliament elections are scheduled .
" this is a good treaty for the union , " said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , the eu 's longest-serving leader .
the impasse was resolved after leaders agreed to give in to demands from poland and italy .
poland satisfied with concessions poland , the most vocal critic of the proposed treaty before the talks , received assurances that a procedure allowing outvoted states to stall eu laws would be enshrined in the treaty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's president kaczynski got what he wanted " poland got what it wanted .
the eu reform treaty project is now crowned with success , " polish president lech kaczynski said .
" i 'm very happy this business is behind us . "
britain also had many reservations about the treaty , but obtained " red line " opt-outs in key areas at the last eu summit in june which remained in the draft presented on thursday .
" the uk 's red lines are secured , " said british prime minister gordon brown , attending his first summit since succeeding tony blair .
" the british national interest has been protected , " he added .
brown was one of the eu leaders at the two-day informal meeting to say that it was time to put years of discussions on the treaty behind them and turn to the more " concrete " problems facing the bloc .
" i have sent a letter round -lsb- to -rsb- fellow colleagues saying that it is time for europe to address detailed issues of global economic change , climate change and security , " brown told journalists .
italy gets extra parliament seat as a sweetener bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi proved to be one of the hardest bargainers italy , which diplomats described as the hardest bargainer during the meeting , obtained one extra seat in the european parliament , giving it the same number of lawmakers as britain .
under the current system , italy , france and britain all have the same number of members in the european parliament .
however , the treaty reduces the overall number of lawmakers by 35 , to 750 , and parliament last week voted for a new distribution , giving italy fewer seats than its similarly sized partners .
close to midnight , diplomats agreed to give italy one more seat without breaching the 750-member cap by excluding the non-voting president of the parliament from the count .
the eu 's two heavyweights , germany and france , both claimed credit for thursday 's success .
merkel , sarkozy both claim credit while french president nicolas sarkozy said he was " extremely satisfied " with the result , german chancellor angela merkel highlighted the role played by her government in launching the final treaty talks in june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel admitted it had been a struggle to reach agreement " after all the political discussions , this is a great success , " merkel said .
" nothing has been changed from the mandate we agreed at the end of the german presidency . "
she added that the treaty would now help the eu function more efficiently as a bloc and as a power in the world .
she also acknowledged that the deal had been hammered out through some very frustrating discussions and hard bargaining , especially with the poles and italians .
" i ca n't hide the fact that the way to this agreement was very difficult , " merkel said .
other tricky issues were successfully addressed earlier in the meeting .
bulgaria reached a deal allowing it to spell the single currency in cyrillic as " evro " rather than " euro . "
austria received assurances that moves to limit the number of foreigners attending its universities would not be pursued in the european court .
among the treaty 's main innovations are clauses reducing the size of the european commission and streamlining decisions by changing voting rules and limiting the power of individual member states to veto legislation .
it also creates several new posts .
these include a president of the european council of member states , who will represent all the member states , and a high representative of the european union for foreign affairs and security policy , who will be in charge of the bloc 's foreign policy , thereby simplifying its relationships with the outside world . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says economic help is a central aspect of the eu peace plan the german foreign minister said that the proposal would help foster middle east peace by promoting small and medium-sized businesses in the palestinian territories and building up special economic zones .
the plan also aims to increase eu assistance in the training of palestinian police and judiciary as well as in the educational and civil service sectors with greater eu assistance focused on palestinian universities and students .
the idea , steinmeier said , was for the eu to help wean palestinians from development aid by helping to strengthen their private sector .
" in order to swiftly generate the required momentum following an israeli-palestinian accord and the planned middle east conference , europe needs to clearly spell out what contribution it intends to make to take this process forward , " he said .
the point of an eu action plan would be to highlight what the eu is doing to support the process now under way , steinmeier continued .
" we should do everything we can to foster the ongoing dialogue and create a favorable political environment at regional and international level , " he said .
eu ready to play constructive role in peace process steinmeier added that there was no need to wait until the us-hosted conference on the middle east next month before going ahead with the eu ’ s plan .
" i told my colleague -lrb- us secretary of state condoleezza -rrb- rice that we will do everything to ensure that europe plays a constructive role , " he told reporters .
for years the eu has been lending active backing to the middle east peace process and consequently has close relations with the relevant parties and countries in the region and is the main source of funding for reconstruction and development .
steinmeier put total financial and humanitarian aid from the eu and its member states to the region at 800 million euros -lrb- $ 1.14 billion -rrb- for 2007 so far . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the plan also aims to increase eu assistance in the training of palestinian police and judiciary as well as in the educational and civil service sectors with greater eu assistance focused on palestinian universities and students .
the idea , steinmeier said , was for the eu to help wean palestinians from development aid by helping to strengthen their private sector .

not everybody thinks it 's the right way to boost acheivement . an international panel of researchers and political representatives in bonn picked six german institutions - berlin 's free university , rwth aachen university and universities in freiburg , göttingen , heidelberg and constance - to join an " elite " list that already includes two schools in munich and one in karlruhe .
a total of nine universities have made the cut and can be considered elite institutions , the german government said .
its so-called " excellence initiative " was developed in 2005 . the initiative is an attempt to boost the country 's chronically under-funded colleges by encouraging high level research and competition .
" a new page in the history of science " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the university of constance proved it deserved recognition the nine elite universities will benefit from a total of 1.9 billion euros in extra research funding over the next five years .
the major chunk of the money will come from the federal government .
the long-term goal is to put them on par with renowned institutions such as harvard and mit in the united states or oxford and cambridge in the united kingdom .
" we wrote a new page in the history of science today , " education minister annette schavan told the dpa news agency .

the head of the army association went further in his critique , saying eu 's afghan plan had " failed pathetically . " german defense minister franz josef jung said the eu plan to send 195 trainers to the conflict-riven region should be reconsidered since the number is likely not high enough .
he named the us as a model the eu could follow . " they go at the situation in a completely different dimension , " he told the daily die welt . the head of the german federal armed forces association , bernhard gertz , also called for more training personnel to be sent to the region , accusing the eu and the german government of having " failed pathetically " in its afghanistan policy . he told the hannoversche allgemeine zeitung daily that if a country is to be rebuilt with a self-supporting security apparatus , 40 police training personnel from germany is not near enough .
he said in order to train enough police for all of afghanistan regions , some 5,000 trainers would be needed from the eu instead of the promised 165 . gertz also had harsh words for western efforts to create a new afghan army .
he said at best 16,000 soldiers are available to the karsai government when it needed at least 70,000 . deployment : five years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister franz josef jung defense minister jung said he believed german troops could be deployed in afghanistan for at least five more years . " i 'm not saying that we will have achieved everything in five years , but this time span could be a guideline , " he told die welt . last week , germany 's lower house of parliament overwhelmingly approved extending the army 's mission in afghanistan , despite growing public misgivings .
the vote allows for up to 3,500 soldiers to operate in the country as part of the nato international security assistance force for another year . but he again resisted nato calls for german soldiers to be deployed in the southern part of the country to train afghan security forces .
german peacekeepers are currently stationed in the relatively quiet north . but on wednesday night , bundeswehr soldiers were the target of a rocket attack about 30 kilometers southwest of feisabad .
it was the third attack this month .
three rockets exploded near the soldiers , but no one was hurt . taliban negotiations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no negotiations with the taliban , jung said the defense minister also told the paper he was against calls to negotiate with taliban rebels because previous attempts to do so had failed . " as long as the taliban have not clearly sworn off violence , i believe negotiations may not be conducted , " he said . he said british troops had had negative experiences in past attempts at talks with the taliban in the volative south of the country , which had led to more violence . " you can not negotiate with those who conducted a reign of terror and today are doing everything to bring about this utterly blind vision of a fundamentalist world .

dw-world.de ahead of key vote , minister says afghanistan mission can work days before a key parliamentary vote on extending the german army 's peacekeeping mandate in afghanistan , defense minister jung said there is a good chance at achieving success there .
-lrb- 08.10.2007 -rrb- defense minister : germany would shoot down hijacked plane german defense minister franz josef jung said he would give the order to shoot down a plane that has been hijacked for an attack , despite a ruling by the country 's constitutional court banning such action .

reform treaty doubters in minority as moment of truth arrives the eu treaty : the ioannina compromise explained the european treaty : frequently asked questions the eu treaty : the long road to lisbon european union -pipe- 19.10.2007 hard bargaining leads to success at eu treaty summit in lisbon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portuguese prime minister socrates and german chancellor merkel celebrate the deal eu leaders clinched a final deal late thursday , oct .
18 , on a major overhaul of the 27-member bloc after making key concessions to italy and poland .
the new lisbon treaty is now expected to be signed in december . the agreement on the reform treaty , reached by prime ministers and heads of state after hours of wrangling in lisbon , should put an end to a prolonged institutional debate sparked by voters in france and the netherlands , who in 2005 referendums rejected a european constitution .
" this is a victory for europe .
we are getting out of a blind alley .
we no longer have an institutional crisis , " said portuguese prime minister jose socrates , who as holder of the eu rotating presidency was acting as the meeting 's host .
the treaty is designed to streamline the eu 's decision-making process following its " big bang " expansion of 2004 , which welcomed 10 new member states into the 50-year-old organization .
it is also set to improve the eu 's global diplomatic clout by simplifying the way it relates with international partners . '
historic agreement ' for the 21st century " this is a historic agreement .
now europe can defend its interests in the age of globalization , " said a visibly pleased jose manuel barroso , head of the eu 's executive arm , the european commission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso was relieved and happy with the result " in this case we 're really talking about an agreement which really gives the european union a capacity to act in the 21st century , " he added .
the text is now due to be signed on dec .
13 in the portuguese capital by eu prime ministers and heads of state and will thereafter come to be known as the lisbon treaty .
once officially sealed , it will need to be ratified by all member states , by either parliamentary votes or referendums - meaning its implementation is far from assured .
eu officials are nevertheless hopeful that the ratification process will be completed by spring 2009 , when european parliament elections are scheduled .
" this is a good treaty for the union , " said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , the eu 's longest-serving leader .
the impasse was resolved after leaders agreed to give in to demands from poland and italy .
poland satisfied with concessions poland , the most vocal critic of the proposed treaty before the talks , received assurances that a procedure allowing outvoted states to stall eu laws would be enshrined in the treaty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's president kaczynski got what he wanted " poland got what it wanted .
the eu reform treaty project is now crowned with success , " polish president lech kaczynski said .
" i 'm very happy this business is behind us . "
britain also had many reservations about the treaty , but obtained " red line " opt-outs in key areas at the last eu summit in june which remained in the draft presented on thursday .
" the uk 's red lines are secured , " said british prime minister gordon brown , attending his first summit since succeeding tony blair .
" the british national interest has been protected , " he added .
brown was one of the eu leaders at the two-day informal meeting to say that it was time to put years of discussions on the treaty behind them and turn to the more " concrete " problems facing the bloc .
" i have sent a letter round -lsb- to -rsb- fellow colleagues saying that it is time for europe to address detailed issues of global economic change , climate change and security , " brown told journalists .
italy gets extra parliament seat as a sweetener bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi proved to be one of the hardest bargainers italy , which diplomats described as the hardest bargainer during the meeting , obtained one extra seat in the european parliament , giving it the same number of lawmakers as britain .
under the current system , italy , france and britain all have the same number of members in the european parliament .
however , the treaty reduces the overall number of lawmakers by 35 , to 750 , and parliament last week voted for a new distribution , giving italy fewer seats than its similarly sized partners .
close to midnight , diplomats agreed to give italy one more seat without breaching the 750-member cap by excluding the non-voting president of the parliament from the count .
the eu 's two heavyweights , germany and france , both claimed credit for thursday 's success .
merkel , sarkozy both claim credit while french president nicolas sarkozy said he was " extremely satisfied " with the result , german chancellor angela merkel highlighted the role played by her government in launching the final treaty talks in june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel admitted it had been a struggle to reach agreement " after all the political discussions , this is a great success , " merkel said .
" nothing has been changed from the mandate we agreed at the end of the german presidency . "
she added that the treaty would now help the eu function more efficiently as a bloc and as a power in the world .
she also acknowledged that the deal had been hammered out through some very frustrating discussions and hard bargaining , especially with the poles and italians .
" i ca n't hide the fact that the way to this agreement was very difficult , " merkel said .
other tricky issues were successfully addressed earlier in the meeting .
bulgaria reached a deal allowing it to spell the single currency in cyrillic as " evro " rather than " euro . "
austria received assurances that moves to limit the number of foreigners attending its universities would not be pursued in the european court .
among the treaty 's main innovations are clauses reducing the size of the european commission and streamlining decisions by changing voting rules and limiting the power of individual member states to veto legislation .
it also creates several new posts .
these include a president of the european council of member states , who will represent all the member states , and a high representative of the european union for foreign affairs and security policy , who will be in charge of the bloc 's foreign policy , thereby simplifying its relationships with the outside world . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not everybody thinks it 's the right way to boost acheivement . an international panel of researchers and political representatives in bonn picked six german institutions - berlin 's free university , rwth aachen university and universities in freiburg , göttingen , heidelberg and constance - to join an " elite " list that already includes two schools in munich and one in karlruhe .
a total of nine universities have made the cut and can be considered elite institutions , the german government said .
its so-called " excellence initiative " was developed in 2005 . the initiative is an attempt to boost the country 's chronically under-funded colleges by encouraging high level research and competition .
" a new page in the history of science " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the university of constance proved it deserved recognition the nine elite universities will benefit from a total of 1.9 billion euros in extra research funding over the next five years .

the long-term goal is to put them on par with renowned institutions such as harvard and mit in the united states or oxford and cambridge in the united kingdom .
" we wrote a new page in the history of science today , " education minister annette schavan told the dpa news agency .
the minister described the initiative as " a huge step for the further development of germany 's system of science . "
money was also earmarked for 21 graduate schools that showed they knew how to promote new talent as well as for 20 " research clusters " that demonstrated they were centers of excellence in particular fields .

not everybody thinks it 's the right way to boost acheivement . an international panel of researchers and political representatives in bonn picked six german institutions - berlin 's free university , rwth aachen university and universities in freiburg , göttingen , heidelberg and constance - to join an " elite " list that already includes two schools in munich and one in karlruhe .
a total of nine universities have made the cut and can be considered elite institutions , the german government said .
its so-called " excellence initiative " was developed in 2005 . the initiative is an attempt to boost the country 's chronically under-funded colleges by encouraging high level research and competition .
" a new page in the history of science " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the university of constance proved it deserved recognition the nine elite universities will benefit from a total of 1.9 billion euros in extra research funding over the next five years .
the major chunk of the money will come from the federal government .
the long-term goal is to put them on par with renowned institutions such as harvard and mit in the united states or oxford and cambridge in the united kingdom .
" we wrote a new page in the history of science today , " education minister annette schavan told the dpa news agency .
the minister described the initiative as " a huge step for the further development of germany 's system of science . "
money was also earmarked for 21 graduate schools that showed they knew how to promote new talent as well as for 20 " research clusters " that demonstrated they were centers of excellence in particular fields .
shaking up the system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " elite " universities will get additional money proponents of the competition , which drew applications from dozens of german universities , say it has forced the country 's higher education system to raise standards and reach for greater heights .
gerhart von graevenitz , director of the university of constance , said the award would open new horizons and opportunities for the university which is located on the swiss border .

the library , a unesco world heritage site , reopens to the public on wednesday , oct .
24 . the 2004 blaze destroyed 37 paintings and 50,000 books , all of them hundreds of years old .
it also revived germany 's trauma over the loss of irreplaceable archives and libraries to bombs during world war ii .
the fire was caused by an electrical malfunction .
when the library reopens wednesday , it will have 60,000 of its original volumes , said director michael knoche .
thousands more are still being repaired .
restoration work is expected to continue until 2015 .
goethe 's literary treasures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fire destroyed 50,000 historic books the restoration has cost 12.8 million euros -lrb- $ 18.2 million -rrb- as workers have painstakingly restored not only the books , but the building itself , including the library 's famous rococo room .
the reading room is a lofty gilded gallery with busts of poets , paintings and bookcases set against white walls .
" it has always been more than just a library , " said hellmut seemann , head of the foundation managing the library , saying visitors regarded it as a shrine to german classicism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an impressive collection built in 1691 , the library specializes in german literature between 1750 and 1850 and houses some one million books , including many rare first-editions and the largest collection of faust by johann wolfgang goethe .
goethe , one of germany 's best-known authors , worked as a librarian at the anna amalia .
weimar , a city about 250 kilometers -lrb- 150 miles -rrb- southwest of berlin in the eastern german state of thuringia , is the region 's cultural center .
it also served as the backdrop for the german republic , which was declared there in 1919 .
saving history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german classical culture lives on in the library on the day of the fire , as flames licked at the library 's roof , people formed a human chain to save as many books as possible .
they salvaged some 6,000 historical works , including a 1543 martin luther .
since then , some 22,000 german firms and people donated funds to repair the anna amalia , or to pay to repair books or buy replacements .
library staff estimates that two of every three of the lost books can be bought from other collections or in auctions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a unesco world heritage site " it was the worst library fire in germany since the war , " said jens goebel , culture minister of thuringia , at the start of a week of celebrations to mark the opening .

the library , a unesco world heritage site , reopens to the public on wednesday , oct .
24 . the 2004 blaze destroyed 37 paintings and 50,000 books , all of them hundreds of years old .
it also revived germany 's trauma over the loss of irreplaceable archives and libraries to bombs during world war ii .
the fire was caused by an electrical malfunction .
when the library reopens wednesday , it will have 60,000 of its original volumes , said director michael knoche .
thousands more are still being repaired .
restoration work is expected to continue until 2015 .
goethe 's literary treasures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fire destroyed 50,000 historic books the restoration has cost 12.8 million euros -lrb- $ 18.2 million -rrb- as workers have painstakingly restored not only the books , but the building itself , including the library 's famous rococo room .
the reading room is a lofty gilded gallery with busts of poets , paintings and bookcases set against white walls .
" it has always been more than just a library , " said hellmut seemann , head of the foundation managing the library , saying visitors regarded it as a shrine to german classicism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an impressive collection built in 1691 , the library specializes in german literature between 1750 and 1850 and houses some one million books , including many rare first-editions and the largest collection of faust by johann wolfgang goethe .

since then , some 22,000 german firms and people donated funds to repair the anna amalia , or to pay to repair books or buy replacements .
library staff estimates that two of every three of the lost books can be bought from other collections or in auctions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a unesco world heritage site " it was the worst library fire in germany since the war , " said jens goebel , culture minister of thuringia , at the start of a week of celebrations to mark the opening .

german politicians from all major political parties voiced dismay at the increasingly bellicose rhetoric from the united states and russia .
politicians want the rhetoric toned down and a greater focus on diplomacy . german politicians were alarmed when us president george w. bush earlier this week brought up the possibility of another world war .
if iran 's nuclear ambitions are n't kept in check , it could result in world war iii , bush said .
russian president vladimir putin caused further concern when , while in iran on a historic visit this week , he made it clear that russia plans to modernize its military , including its nuclear capacities .
german politicians were universal in condemning bush and putin 's cold war rhetoric and encouraging dialogue and diplomacy .

polenz also criticized putin for saying he wants to build up russia 's military capacity .
rolf mützenich , who specializes in foreign policy for the social democrats , said bush 's statement puts a " mutual and peaceful approach to the iranian nuclear crisis " in danger . the disagreement over iran 's nuclear program can not be solved using force , mützenich told dpa .

reform treaty doubters in minority as moment of truth arrives the eu treaty : the ioannina compromise explained the european treaty : frequently asked questions the eu treaty : the long road to lisbon european union -pipe- 19.10.2007 hard bargaining leads to success at eu treaty summit in lisbon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portuguese prime minister socrates and german chancellor merkel celebrate the deal eu leaders clinched a final deal late thursday , oct .
18 , on a major overhaul of the 27-member bloc after making key concessions to italy and poland .
the new lisbon treaty is now expected to be signed in december . the agreement on the reform treaty , reached by prime ministers and heads of state after hours of wrangling in lisbon , should put an end to a prolonged institutional debate sparked by voters in france and the netherlands , who in 2005 referendums rejected a european constitution .
" this is a victory for europe .
we are getting out of a blind alley .
we no longer have an institutional crisis , " said portuguese prime minister jose socrates , who as holder of the eu rotating presidency was acting as the meeting 's host .
the treaty is designed to streamline the eu 's decision-making process following its " big bang " expansion of 2004 , which welcomed 10 new member states into the 50-year-old organization .
it is also set to improve the eu 's global diplomatic clout by simplifying the way it relates with international partners . '
historic agreement ' for the 21st century " this is a historic agreement .
now europe can defend its interests in the age of globalization , " said a visibly pleased jose manuel barroso , head of the eu 's executive arm , the european commission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso was relieved and happy with the result " in this case we 're really talking about an agreement which really gives the european union a capacity to act in the 21st century , " he added .
the text is now due to be signed on dec .
13 in the portuguese capital by eu prime ministers and heads of state and will thereafter come to be known as the lisbon treaty .
once officially sealed , it will need to be ratified by all member states , by either parliamentary votes or referendums - meaning its implementation is far from assured .
eu officials are nevertheless hopeful that the ratification process will be completed by spring 2009 , when european parliament elections are scheduled .
" this is a good treaty for the union , " said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , the eu 's longest-serving leader .
the impasse was resolved after leaders agreed to give in to demands from poland and italy .
poland satisfied with concessions poland , the most vocal critic of the proposed treaty before the talks , received assurances that a procedure allowing outvoted states to stall eu laws would be enshrined in the treaty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's president kaczynski got what he wanted " poland got what it wanted .
the eu reform treaty project is now crowned with success , " polish president lech kaczynski said .
" i 'm very happy this business is behind us . "
britain also had many reservations about the treaty , but obtained " red line " opt-outs in key areas at the last eu summit in june which remained in the draft presented on thursday .
" the uk 's red lines are secured , " said british prime minister gordon brown , attending his first summit since succeeding tony blair .
" the british national interest has been protected , " he added .
brown was one of the eu leaders at the two-day informal meeting to say that it was time to put years of discussions on the treaty behind them and turn to the more " concrete " problems facing the bloc .
" i have sent a letter round -lsb- to -rsb- fellow colleagues saying that it is time for europe to address detailed issues of global economic change , climate change and security , " brown told journalists .
italy gets extra parliament seat as a sweetener bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi proved to be one of the hardest bargainers italy , which diplomats described as the hardest bargainer during the meeting , obtained one extra seat in the european parliament , giving it the same number of lawmakers as britain .
under the current system , italy , france and britain all have the same number of members in the european parliament .
however , the treaty reduces the overall number of lawmakers by 35 , to 750 , and parliament last week voted for a new distribution , giving italy fewer seats than its similarly sized partners .
close to midnight , diplomats agreed to give italy one more seat without breaching the 750-member cap by excluding the non-voting president of the parliament from the count .
the eu 's two heavyweights , germany and france , both claimed credit for thursday 's success .
merkel , sarkozy both claim credit while french president nicolas sarkozy said he was " extremely satisfied " with the result , german chancellor angela merkel highlighted the role played by her government in launching the final treaty talks in june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel admitted it had been a struggle to reach agreement " after all the political discussions , this is a great success , " merkel said .
" nothing has been changed from the mandate we agreed at the end of the german presidency . "
she added that the treaty would now help the eu function more efficiently as a bloc and as a power in the world .
she also acknowledged that the deal had been hammered out through some very frustrating discussions and hard bargaining , especially with the poles and italians .
" i ca n't hide the fact that the way to this agreement was very difficult , " merkel said .
other tricky issues were successfully addressed earlier in the meeting .
bulgaria reached a deal allowing it to spell the single currency in cyrillic as " evro " rather than " euro . "
austria received assurances that moves to limit the number of foreigners attending its universities would not be pursued in the european court .
among the treaty 's main innovations are clauses reducing the size of the european commission and streamlining decisions by changing voting rules and limiting the power of individual member states to veto legislation .
it also creates several new posts .
these include a president of the european council of member states , who will represent all the member states , and a high representative of the european union for foreign affairs and security policy , who will be in charge of the bloc 's foreign policy , thereby simplifying its relationships with the outside world . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the new lisbon treaty is now expected to be signed in december . the agreement on the reform treaty , reached by prime ministers and heads of state after hours of wrangling in lisbon , should put an end to a prolonged institutional debate sparked by voters in france and the netherlands , who in 2005 referendums rejected a european constitution .
" this is a victory for europe .
we are getting out of a blind alley .
we no longer have an institutional crisis , " said portuguese prime minister jose socrates , who as holder of the eu rotating presidency was acting as the meeting 's host .
the treaty is designed to streamline the eu 's decision-making process following its " big bang " expansion of 2004 , which welcomed 10 new member states into the 50-year-old organization .

german politicians from all major political parties voiced dismay at the increasingly bellicose rhetoric from the united states and russia .
politicians want the rhetoric toned down and a greater focus on diplomacy . german politicians were alarmed when us president george w. bush earlier this week brought up the possibility of another world war .
if iran 's nuclear ambitions are n't kept in check , it could result in world war iii , bush said .
russian president vladimir putin caused further concern when , while in iran on a historic visit this week , he made it clear that russia plans to modernize its military , including its nuclear capacities .
german politicians were universal in condemning bush and putin 's cold war rhetoric and encouraging dialogue and diplomacy .
escalation counterproductive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush talks of world war iii bush 's mention of an impending world war iii was counterproductive in finding a solution to the nuclear standoff with iran , ruprecht polenz , a specialist in foreign affairs for chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- told the dpa news agency .
polenz also criticized putin for saying he wants to build up russia 's military capacity .
rolf mützenich , who specializes in foreign policy for the social democrats , said bush 's statement puts a " mutual and peaceful approach to the iranian nuclear crisis " in danger . the disagreement over iran 's nuclear program can not be solved using force , mützenich told dpa .
he encouraged merkel to make this clear when she meets with bush next month .
it was also " completely inappropriate " for bush to bring up the possibility of world war iii , mützenich said .
the left party 's foreign affairs expert , norman paech , said bush 's statement were an " additional signal " that the us is a war risk .
a dangerous political climate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians do n't want to see a return to cold war politics the head of the green party , claudia roth , called the harsh tones from washington and moscow a " backslide into the rhetoric of the cold war , " according to an interview in the internet news portal netzeitung .de.
" bush and putin are losing all forms of measurement and control , " she said .
for jürgen trittin of the green party , bush 's and putin 's recent statements show how dangerous the current political climate is .
bush not making war plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians want more diplomacy and less talk of war bush wanted to make " a rhetorical point " when he suggested that if iran could make nuclear weapons , it could lead to world war iii .
" the president was not making any war plans , and he was n't making any declarations , " said white house press secretary dana perino .
" he was making a point , and the point is that we do not believe - and neither does the international community believe - that iran should be allowed to pursue nuclear weapons . "
if iran acquired nuclear weapons , it would lead to a very dangerous situation , perino said .
the us has accused iran of secretly trying to build nuclear weapons , which tehran denies .
putin will modernize the military bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin during his historic visit to iran putin alarmed world leaders when he mentioned on thursday , oct .
18 , that russia is working on new types of nuclear weapons as part of a " grandiose " plan to strengthen the country 's defenses .
moscow is deeply opposed to us plans to extend its missile shield into europe , by installing 10 missile interceptors in poland and tracking radar in the czech republic .
disarmament expert elke hoff of the free democratic party , a free-market liberal party , reproached putin for using us plans for a missile defense shield to undermine non-proliferation politics .
putin embarked on a landmark visit to iran earlier this week to discuss the country 's nuclear program with iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
on tuesday , putin said he backed the iranian government in its nuclear dispute with the west , while also urging tehran to cooperate with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- in vienna . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the head of the army association went further in his critique , saying eu 's afghan plan had " failed pathetically . " german defense minister franz josef jung said the eu plan to send 195 trainers to the conflict-riven region should be reconsidered since the number is likely not high enough .
he named the us as a model the eu could follow . " they go at the situation in a completely different dimension , " he told the daily die welt . the head of the german federal armed forces association , bernhard gertz , also called for more training personnel to be sent to the region , accusing the eu and the german government of having " failed pathetically " in its afghanistan policy . he told the hannoversche allgemeine zeitung daily that if a country is to be rebuilt with a self-supporting security apparatus , 40 police training personnel from germany is not near enough .
he said in order to train enough police for all of afghanistan regions , some 5,000 trainers would be needed from the eu instead of the promised 165 . gertz also had harsh words for western efforts to create a new afghan army .
he said at best 16,000 soldiers are available to the karsai government when it needed at least 70,000 . deployment : five years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister franz josef jung defense minister jung said he believed german troops could be deployed in afghanistan for at least five more years . " i 'm not saying that we will have achieved everything in five years , but this time span could be a guideline , " he told die welt . last week , germany 's lower house of parliament overwhelmingly approved extending the army 's mission in afghanistan , despite growing public misgivings .
the vote allows for up to 3,500 soldiers to operate in the country as part of the nato international security assistance force for another year . but he again resisted nato calls for german soldiers to be deployed in the southern part of the country to train afghan security forces .
german peacekeepers are currently stationed in the relatively quiet north . but on wednesday night , bundeswehr soldiers were the target of a rocket attack about 30 kilometers southwest of feisabad .
it was the third attack this month .
three rockets exploded near the soldiers , but no one was hurt . taliban negotiations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no negotiations with the taliban , jung said the defense minister also told the paper he was against calls to negotiate with taliban rebels because previous attempts to do so had failed . " as long as the taliban have not clearly sworn off violence , i believe negotiations may not be conducted , " he said . he said british troops had had negative experiences in past attempts at talks with the taliban in the volative south of the country , which had led to more violence . " you can not negotiate with those who conducted a reign of terror and today are doing everything to bring about this utterly blind vision of a fundamentalist world .

not everybody thinks it 's the right way to boost acheivement . an international panel of researchers and political representatives in bonn picked six german institutions - berlin 's free university , rwth aachen university and universities in freiburg , göttingen , heidelberg and constance - to join an " elite " list that already includes two schools in munich and one in karlruhe .
a total of nine universities have made the cut and can be considered elite institutions , the german government said .
its so-called " excellence initiative " was developed in 2005 . the initiative is an attempt to boost the country 's chronically under-funded colleges by encouraging high level research and competition .
" a new page in the history of science " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the university of constance proved it deserved recognition the nine elite universities will benefit from a total of 1.9 billion euros in extra research funding over the next five years .
the major chunk of the money will come from the federal government .
the long-term goal is to put them on par with renowned institutions such as harvard and mit in the united states or oxford and cambridge in the united kingdom .
" we wrote a new page in the history of science today , " education minister annette schavan told the dpa news agency .
the minister described the initiative as " a huge step for the further development of germany 's system of science . "

he had starred in the host nation 's world cup run and secured a big move to bayern munich .
now , however , podolski finds himself in the shadows . the good news for bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld is that he will likely not be pressed to field lukas podolski in the near future .
podolski was one of the major disappointments in germany 's 3-0 home defeat against the czech republic on wednesday night , showing no signs that he deserves a place in munich 's starting line-up .
after all , hitzfeld 's decision to go with klose and luca toni has already proven to be right as the two international strikers share the scoring table lead with eight goals each - and munich enjoy a five-point advantage atop the standings .
podolski was last month warned by munich general manager uli hoeness to finally deliver in his second season , a view also shared by national team general manager oliver bierhoff .
" lukas knows that he has to work on his weaknesses , " said bierhoff .
klose back to partner toni bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose , left , has been in great form since arriving from bremen podolski will have to take his familiar place on the bench on saturday as klose returns from an injury layoff which kept him out of germany 's latest euro-qualifiers .
podolski remains convinced that he can nail down a first-team place with bayern munich .
" i still have two-and-a-half years left on my contract with bayern .
i want to fulfill it , " podolski said this week . hoeness said last month that the player would not make it at the german giants if he did n't " change his attitude . " podolski responded to the comment , saying " i ca n't be prevented from laughing . " poldi more successful in white of germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski remains prolific on the international scene podolski has scored 23 goals in 41 appearances for germany , but has not been as successful in munich after a 2006 move from cologne , with just four goals to date in 25 league matches . he has failed to score in his five substitute appearances in the bundesliga this season following a comeback from a summer injury .
klose , 29 , has been out of action for three weeks with a knee injury , but between him and italian world cup winner toni , the pair already have a 16 goals between them after just 10 league games .
competition fierce up front for bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan schlaudraff is also in the mix for a starting berth german international striker jan schlaudraff is also fighting to break into the bayern first team after a back operation , but says the world-class pairing of klose and toni are a sizeable obstacle .
" let me be clear about this : they absolutely deserve to play , they 've both been superb , " said schlaudraff , who joined bayern this summer from aachen .

he had starred in the host nation 's world cup run and secured a big move to bayern munich .
now , however , podolski finds himself in the shadows . the good news for bayern munich coach ottmar hitzfeld is that he will likely not be pressed to field lukas podolski in the near future .
podolski was one of the major disappointments in germany 's 3-0 home defeat against the czech republic on wednesday night , showing no signs that he deserves a place in munich 's starting line-up .
after all , hitzfeld 's decision to go with klose and luca toni has already proven to be right as the two international strikers share the scoring table lead with eight goals each - and munich enjoy a five-point advantage atop the standings .
podolski was last month warned by munich general manager uli hoeness to finally deliver in his second season , a view also shared by national team general manager oliver bierhoff .
" lukas knows that he has to work on his weaknesses , " said bierhoff .
klose back to partner toni bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose , left , has been in great form since arriving from bremen podolski will have to take his familiar place on the bench on saturday as klose returns from an injury layoff which kept him out of germany 's latest euro-qualifiers .
podolski remains convinced that he can nail down a first-team place with bayern munich .
" i still have two-and-a-half years left on my contract with bayern .
i want to fulfill it , " podolski said this week . hoeness said last month that the player would not make it at the german giants if he did n't " change his attitude . " podolski responded to the comment , saying " i ca n't be prevented from laughing . " poldi more successful in white of germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski remains prolific on the international scene podolski has scored 23 goals in 41 appearances for germany , but has not been as successful in munich after a 2006 move from cologne , with just four goals to date in 25 league matches . he has failed to score in his five substitute appearances in the bundesliga this season following a comeback from a summer injury .
klose , 29 , has been out of action for three weeks with a knee injury , but between him and italian world cup winner toni , the pair already have a 16 goals between them after just 10 league games .

not everybody thinks it 's the right way to boost acheivement . an international panel of researchers and political representatives in bonn picked six german institutions - berlin 's free university , rwth aachen university and universities in freiburg , göttingen , heidelberg and constance - to join an " elite " list that already includes two schools in munich and one in karlruhe .
a total of nine universities have made the cut and can be considered elite institutions , the german government said .
its so-called " excellence initiative " was developed in 2005 . the initiative is an attempt to boost the country 's chronically under-funded colleges by encouraging high level research and competition .
" a new page in the history of science " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the university of constance proved it deserved recognition the nine elite universities will benefit from a total of 1.9 billion euros in extra research funding over the next five years .
the major chunk of the money will come from the federal government .
the long-term goal is to put them on par with renowned institutions such as harvard and mit in the united states or oxford and cambridge in the united kingdom .
" we wrote a new page in the history of science today , " education minister annette schavan told the dpa news agency .
the minister described the initiative as " a huge step for the further development of germany 's system of science . "
money was also earmarked for 21 graduate schools that showed they knew how to promote new talent as well as for 20 " research clusters " that demonstrated they were centers of excellence in particular fields .
shaking up the system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " elite " universities will get additional money proponents of the competition , which drew applications from dozens of german universities , say it has forced the country 's higher education system to raise standards and reach for greater heights .
gerhart von graevenitz , director of the university of constance , said the award would open new horizons and opportunities for the university which is located on the swiss border .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venerable institutions : the university library in heidelberg but , critics say it 's the wrong way to boost acheivement .
" the excellence iniative worsens the structural problems of the german higher education system rather than solving them , " said andreas keller of the union for education and science -lrb- gew -rrb- .
keller pointed out that the iniative deepened the gap between the country 's various regions since most of the universities that were anointed are located in southern germany .
not a single one comes from former communist east germany .
the union has also said the iniative only focuses on research at universities and ignores actual studies and standards of teaching . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german politicians from all major political parties voiced dismay at the increasingly bellicose rhetoric from the united states and russia .
politicians want the rhetoric toned down and a greater focus on diplomacy . german politicians were alarmed when us president george w. bush earlier this week brought up the possibility of another world war .
if iran 's nuclear ambitions are n't kept in check , it could result in world war iii , bush said .
russian president vladimir putin caused further concern when , while in iran on a historic visit this week , he made it clear that russia plans to modernize its military , including its nuclear capacities .
german politicians were universal in condemning bush and putin 's cold war rhetoric and encouraging dialogue and diplomacy .
escalation counterproductive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush talks of world war iii bush 's mention of an impending world war iii was counterproductive in finding a solution to the nuclear standoff with iran , ruprecht polenz , a specialist in foreign affairs for chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- told the dpa news agency .
polenz also criticized putin for saying he wants to build up russia 's military capacity .
rolf mützenich , who specializes in foreign policy for the social democrats , said bush 's statement puts a " mutual and peaceful approach to the iranian nuclear crisis " in danger . the disagreement over iran 's nuclear program can not be solved using force , mützenich told dpa .
he encouraged merkel to make this clear when she meets with bush next month .
it was also " completely inappropriate " for bush to bring up the possibility of world war iii , mützenich said .
the left party 's foreign affairs expert , norman paech , said bush 's statement were an " additional signal " that the us is a war risk .
a dangerous political climate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians do n't want to see a return to cold war politics the head of the green party , claudia roth , called the harsh tones from washington and moscow a " backslide into the rhetoric of the cold war , " according to an interview in the internet news portal netzeitung .de.
" bush and putin are losing all forms of measurement and control , " she said .
for jürgen trittin of the green party , bush 's and putin 's recent statements show how dangerous the current political climate is .
bush not making war plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians want more diplomacy and less talk of war bush wanted to make " a rhetorical point " when he suggested that if iran could make nuclear weapons , it could lead to world war iii .
" the president was not making any war plans , and he was n't making any declarations , " said white house press secretary dana perino .
" he was making a point , and the point is that we do not believe - and neither does the international community believe - that iran should be allowed to pursue nuclear weapons . "
if iran acquired nuclear weapons , it would lead to a very dangerous situation , perino said .
the us has accused iran of secretly trying to build nuclear weapons , which tehran denies .
putin will modernize the military bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin during his historic visit to iran putin alarmed world leaders when he mentioned on thursday , oct .
18 , that russia is working on new types of nuclear weapons as part of a " grandiose " plan to strengthen the country 's defenses .
moscow is deeply opposed to us plans to extend its missile shield into europe , by installing 10 missile interceptors in poland and tracking radar in the czech republic .
disarmament expert elke hoff of the free democratic party , a free-market liberal party , reproached putin for using us plans for a missile defense shield to undermine non-proliferation politics .
putin embarked on a landmark visit to iran earlier this week to discuss the country 's nuclear program with iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
on tuesday , putin said he backed the iranian government in its nuclear dispute with the west , while also urging tehran to cooperate with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- in vienna . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in order to swiftly generate the required momentum following an israeli-palestinian accord and the planned middle east conference , europe needs to clearly spell out what contribution it intends to make to take this process forward , " he said .
the point of an eu action plan would be to highlight what the eu is doing to support the process now under way , steinmeier continued .
" we should do everything we can to foster the ongoing dialogue and create a favorable political environment at regional and international level , " he said .
eu ready to play constructive role in peace process steinmeier added that there was no need to wait until the us-hosted conference on the middle east next month before going ahead with the eu ’ s plan .
" i told my colleague -lrb- us secretary of state condoleezza -rrb- rice that we will do everything to ensure that europe plays a constructive role , " he told reporters .
for years the eu has been lending active backing to the middle east peace process and consequently has close relations with the relevant parties and countries in the region and is the main source of funding for reconstruction and development .
steinmeier put total financial and humanitarian aid from the eu and its member states to the region at 800 million euros -lrb- $ 1.14 billion -rrb- for 2007 so far . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the library , a unesco world heritage site , reopens to the public on wednesday , oct .
24 . the 2004 blaze destroyed 37 paintings and 50,000 books , all of them hundreds of years old .
it also revived germany 's trauma over the loss of irreplaceable archives and libraries to bombs during world war ii .
the fire was caused by an electrical malfunction .
when the library reopens wednesday , it will have 60,000 of its original volumes , said director michael knoche .
thousands more are still being repaired .
restoration work is expected to continue until 2015 .
goethe 's literary treasures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fire destroyed 50,000 historic books the restoration has cost 12.8 million euros -lrb- $ 18.2 million -rrb- as workers have painstakingly restored not only the books , but the building itself , including the library 's famous rococo room .
the reading room is a lofty gilded gallery with busts of poets , paintings and bookcases set against white walls .
" it has always been more than just a library , " said hellmut seemann , head of the foundation managing the library , saying visitors regarded it as a shrine to german classicism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an impressive collection built in 1691 , the library specializes in german literature between 1750 and 1850 and houses some one million books , including many rare first-editions and the largest collection of faust by johann wolfgang goethe .
goethe , one of germany 's best-known authors , worked as a librarian at the anna amalia .
weimar , a city about 250 kilometers -lrb- 150 miles -rrb- southwest of berlin in the eastern german state of thuringia , is the region 's cultural center .
it also served as the backdrop for the german republic , which was declared there in 1919 .
saving history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german classical culture lives on in the library on the day of the fire , as flames licked at the library 's roof , people formed a human chain to save as many books as possible .
they salvaged some 6,000 historical works , including a 1543 martin luther .
since then , some 22,000 german firms and people donated funds to repair the anna amalia , or to pay to repair books or buy replacements .
library staff estimates that two of every three of the lost books can be bought from other collections or in auctions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a unesco world heritage site " it was the worst library fire in germany since the war , " said jens goebel , culture minister of thuringia , at the start of a week of celebrations to mark the opening .

russian president vladimir putin caused further concern when , while in iran on a historic visit this week , he made it clear that russia plans to modernize its military , including its nuclear capacities .
german politicians were universal in condemning bush and putin 's cold war rhetoric and encouraging dialogue and diplomacy .

polenz also criticized putin for saying he wants to build up russia 's military capacity .

" he was making a point , and the point is that we do not believe - and neither does the international community believe - that iran should be allowed to pursue nuclear weapons . "
if iran acquired nuclear weapons , it would lead to a very dangerous situation , perino said .

the library , a unesco world heritage site , reopens to the public on wednesday , oct .
24 . the 2004 blaze destroyed 37 paintings and 50,000 books , all of them hundreds of years old .
it also revived germany 's trauma over the loss of irreplaceable archives and libraries to bombs during world war ii .
the fire was caused by an electrical malfunction .
when the library reopens wednesday , it will have 60,000 of its original volumes , said director michael knoche .
thousands more are still being repaired .
restoration work is expected to continue until 2015 .
goethe 's literary treasures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fire destroyed 50,000 historic books the restoration has cost 12.8 million euros -lrb- $ 18.2 million -rrb- as workers have painstakingly restored not only the books , but the building itself , including the library 's famous rococo room .
the reading room is a lofty gilded gallery with busts of poets , paintings and bookcases set against white walls .
" it has always been more than just a library , " said hellmut seemann , head of the foundation managing the library , saying visitors regarded it as a shrine to german classicism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an impressive collection built in 1691 , the library specializes in german literature between 1750 and 1850 and houses some one million books , including many rare first-editions and the largest collection of faust by johann wolfgang goethe .
goethe , one of germany 's best-known authors , worked as a librarian at the anna amalia .
weimar , a city about 250 kilometers -lrb- 150 miles -rrb- southwest of berlin in the eastern german state of thuringia , is the region 's cultural center .
it also served as the backdrop for the german republic , which was declared there in 1919 .
saving history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german classical culture lives on in the library on the day of the fire , as flames licked at the library 's roof , people formed a human chain to save as many books as possible .
they salvaged some 6,000 historical works , including a 1543 martin luther .
since then , some 22,000 german firms and people donated funds to repair the anna amalia , or to pay to repair books or buy replacements .
library staff estimates that two of every three of the lost books can be bought from other collections or in auctions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a unesco world heritage site " it was the worst library fire in germany since the war , " said jens goebel , culture minister of thuringia , at the start of a week of celebrations to mark the opening .

the head of the army association went further in his critique , saying eu 's afghan plan had " failed pathetically . " german defense minister franz josef jung said the eu plan to send 195 trainers to the conflict-riven region should be reconsidered since the number is likely not high enough .
he named the us as a model the eu could follow . " they go at the situation in a completely different dimension , " he told the daily die welt . the head of the german federal armed forces association , bernhard gertz , also called for more training personnel to be sent to the region , accusing the eu and the german government of having " failed pathetically " in its afghanistan policy . he told the hannoversche allgemeine zeitung daily that if a country is to be rebuilt with a self-supporting security apparatus , 40 police training personnel from germany is not near enough .
he said in order to train enough police for all of afghanistan regions , some 5,000 trainers would be needed from the eu instead of the promised 165 . gertz also had harsh words for western efforts to create a new afghan army .
he said at best 16,000 soldiers are available to the karsai government when it needed at least 70,000 . deployment : five years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister franz josef jung defense minister jung said he believed german troops could be deployed in afghanistan for at least five more years . " i 'm not saying that we will have achieved everything in five years , but this time span could be a guideline , " he told die welt . last week , germany 's lower house of parliament overwhelmingly approved extending the army 's mission in afghanistan , despite growing public misgivings .
the vote allows for up to 3,500 soldiers to operate in the country as part of the nato international security assistance force for another year . but he again resisted nato calls for german soldiers to be deployed in the southern part of the country to train afghan security forces .
german peacekeepers are currently stationed in the relatively quiet north . but on wednesday night , bundeswehr soldiers were the target of a rocket attack about 30 kilometers southwest of feisabad .
it was the third attack this month .
three rockets exploded near the soldiers , but no one was hurt . taliban negotiations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no negotiations with the taliban , jung said the defense minister also told the paper he was against calls to negotiate with taliban rebels because previous attempts to do so had failed . " as long as the taliban have not clearly sworn off violence , i believe negotiations may not be conducted , " he said . he said british troops had had negative experiences in past attempts at talks with the taliban in the volative south of the country , which had led to more violence . " you can not negotiate with those who conducted a reign of terror and today are doing everything to bring about this utterly blind vision of a fundamentalist world .

german politicians from all major political parties voiced dismay at the increasingly bellicose rhetoric from the united states and russia .
politicians want the rhetoric toned down and a greater focus on diplomacy . german politicians were alarmed when us president george w. bush earlier this week brought up the possibility of another world war .
if iran 's nuclear ambitions are n't kept in check , it could result in world war iii , bush said .
russian president vladimir putin caused further concern when , while in iran on a historic visit this week , he made it clear that russia plans to modernize its military , including its nuclear capacities .
german politicians were universal in condemning bush and putin 's cold war rhetoric and encouraging dialogue and diplomacy .
escalation counterproductive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush talks of world war iii bush 's mention of an impending world war iii was counterproductive in finding a solution to the nuclear standoff with iran , ruprecht polenz , a specialist in foreign affairs for chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- told the dpa news agency .
polenz also criticized putin for saying he wants to build up russia 's military capacity .
rolf mützenich , who specializes in foreign policy for the social democrats , said bush 's statement puts a " mutual and peaceful approach to the iranian nuclear crisis " in danger . the disagreement over iran 's nuclear program can not be solved using force , mützenich told dpa .
he encouraged merkel to make this clear when she meets with bush next month .
it was also " completely inappropriate " for bush to bring up the possibility of world war iii , mützenich said .
the left party 's foreign affairs expert , norman paech , said bush 's statement were an " additional signal " that the us is a war risk .
a dangerous political climate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians do n't want to see a return to cold war politics the head of the green party , claudia roth , called the harsh tones from washington and moscow a " backslide into the rhetoric of the cold war , " according to an interview in the internet news portal netzeitung .de.
" bush and putin are losing all forms of measurement and control , " she said .
for jürgen trittin of the green party , bush 's and putin 's recent statements show how dangerous the current political climate is .
bush not making war plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians want more diplomacy and less talk of war bush wanted to make " a rhetorical point " when he suggested that if iran could make nuclear weapons , it could lead to world war iii .
" the president was not making any war plans , and he was n't making any declarations , " said white house press secretary dana perino .
" he was making a point , and the point is that we do not believe - and neither does the international community believe - that iran should be allowed to pursue nuclear weapons . "
if iran acquired nuclear weapons , it would lead to a very dangerous situation , perino said .
the us has accused iran of secretly trying to build nuclear weapons , which tehran denies .
putin will modernize the military bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin during his historic visit to iran putin alarmed world leaders when he mentioned on thursday , oct .
18 , that russia is working on new types of nuclear weapons as part of a " grandiose " plan to strengthen the country 's defenses .
moscow is deeply opposed to us plans to extend its missile shield into europe , by installing 10 missile interceptors in poland and tracking radar in the czech republic .
disarmament expert elke hoff of the free democratic party , a free-market liberal party , reproached putin for using us plans for a missile defense shield to undermine non-proliferation politics .
putin embarked on a landmark visit to iran earlier this week to discuss the country 's nuclear program with iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .
on tuesday , putin said he backed the iranian government in its nuclear dispute with the west , while also urging tehran to cooperate with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- in vienna . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

reform treaty doubters in minority as moment of truth arrives the eu treaty : the ioannina compromise explained the european treaty : frequently asked questions the eu treaty : the long road to lisbon european union -pipe- 19.10.2007 hard bargaining leads to success at eu treaty summit in lisbon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portuguese prime minister socrates and german chancellor merkel celebrate the deal eu leaders clinched a final deal late thursday , oct .
18 , on a major overhaul of the 27-member bloc after making key concessions to italy and poland .
the new lisbon treaty is now expected to be signed in december . the agreement on the reform treaty , reached by prime ministers and heads of state after hours of wrangling in lisbon , should put an end to a prolonged institutional debate sparked by voters in france and the netherlands , who in 2005 referendums rejected a european constitution .
" this is a victory for europe .
we are getting out of a blind alley .
we no longer have an institutional crisis , " said portuguese prime minister jose socrates , who as holder of the eu rotating presidency was acting as the meeting 's host .
the treaty is designed to streamline the eu 's decision-making process following its " big bang " expansion of 2004 , which welcomed 10 new member states into the 50-year-old organization .
it is also set to improve the eu 's global diplomatic clout by simplifying the way it relates with international partners . '
historic agreement ' for the 21st century " this is a historic agreement .
now europe can defend its interests in the age of globalization , " said a visibly pleased jose manuel barroso , head of the eu 's executive arm , the european commission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso was relieved and happy with the result " in this case we 're really talking about an agreement which really gives the european union a capacity to act in the 21st century , " he added .
the text is now due to be signed on dec .
13 in the portuguese capital by eu prime ministers and heads of state and will thereafter come to be known as the lisbon treaty .
once officially sealed , it will need to be ratified by all member states , by either parliamentary votes or referendums - meaning its implementation is far from assured .
eu officials are nevertheless hopeful that the ratification process will be completed by spring 2009 , when european parliament elections are scheduled .
" this is a good treaty for the union , " said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , the eu 's longest-serving leader .
the impasse was resolved after leaders agreed to give in to demands from poland and italy .
poland satisfied with concessions poland , the most vocal critic of the proposed treaty before the talks , received assurances that a procedure allowing outvoted states to stall eu laws would be enshrined in the treaty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's president kaczynski got what he wanted " poland got what it wanted .
the eu reform treaty project is now crowned with success , " polish president lech kaczynski said .
" i 'm very happy this business is behind us . "
britain also had many reservations about the treaty , but obtained " red line " opt-outs in key areas at the last eu summit in june which remained in the draft presented on thursday .
" the uk 's red lines are secured , " said british prime minister gordon brown , attending his first summit since succeeding tony blair .
" the british national interest has been protected , " he added .
brown was one of the eu leaders at the two-day informal meeting to say that it was time to put years of discussions on the treaty behind them and turn to the more " concrete " problems facing the bloc .
" i have sent a letter round -lsb- to -rsb- fellow colleagues saying that it is time for europe to address detailed issues of global economic change , climate change and security , " brown told journalists .
italy gets extra parliament seat as a sweetener bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi proved to be one of the hardest bargainers italy , which diplomats described as the hardest bargainer during the meeting , obtained one extra seat in the european parliament , giving it the same number of lawmakers as britain .
under the current system , italy , france and britain all have the same number of members in the european parliament .
however , the treaty reduces the overall number of lawmakers by 35 , to 750 , and parliament last week voted for a new distribution , giving italy fewer seats than its similarly sized partners .
close to midnight , diplomats agreed to give italy one more seat without breaching the 750-member cap by excluding the non-voting president of the parliament from the count .
the eu 's two heavyweights , germany and france , both claimed credit for thursday 's success .
merkel , sarkozy both claim credit while french president nicolas sarkozy said he was " extremely satisfied " with the result , german chancellor angela merkel highlighted the role played by her government in launching the final treaty talks in june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel admitted it had been a struggle to reach agreement " after all the political discussions , this is a great success , " merkel said .
" nothing has been changed from the mandate we agreed at the end of the german presidency . "
she added that the treaty would now help the eu function more efficiently as a bloc and as a power in the world .
she also acknowledged that the deal had been hammered out through some very frustrating discussions and hard bargaining , especially with the poles and italians .
" i ca n't hide the fact that the way to this agreement was very difficult , " merkel said .
other tricky issues were successfully addressed earlier in the meeting .
bulgaria reached a deal allowing it to spell the single currency in cyrillic as " evro " rather than " euro . "
austria received assurances that moves to limit the number of foreigners attending its universities would not be pursued in the european court .
among the treaty 's main innovations are clauses reducing the size of the european commission and streamlining decisions by changing voting rules and limiting the power of individual member states to veto legislation .
it also creates several new posts .
these include a president of the european council of member states , who will represent all the member states , and a high representative of the european union for foreign affairs and security policy , who will be in charge of the bloc 's foreign policy , thereby simplifying its relationships with the outside world . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

reform treaty doubters in minority as moment of truth arrives the eu treaty : the ioannina compromise explained the european treaty : frequently asked questions the eu treaty : the long road to lisbon european union -pipe- 19.10.2007 hard bargaining leads to success at eu treaty summit in lisbon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portuguese prime minister socrates and german chancellor merkel celebrate the deal eu leaders clinched a final deal late thursday , oct .
18 , on a major overhaul of the 27-member bloc after making key concessions to italy and poland .
the new lisbon treaty is now expected to be signed in december . the agreement on the reform treaty , reached by prime ministers and heads of state after hours of wrangling in lisbon , should put an end to a prolonged institutional debate sparked by voters in france and the netherlands , who in 2005 referendums rejected a european constitution .
" this is a victory for europe .
we are getting out of a blind alley .
we no longer have an institutional crisis , " said portuguese prime minister jose socrates , who as holder of the eu rotating presidency was acting as the meeting 's host .
the treaty is designed to streamline the eu 's decision-making process following its " big bang " expansion of 2004 , which welcomed 10 new member states into the 50-year-old organization .
it is also set to improve the eu 's global diplomatic clout by simplifying the way it relates with international partners . '
historic agreement ' for the 21st century " this is a historic agreement .
now europe can defend its interests in the age of globalization , " said a visibly pleased jose manuel barroso , head of the eu 's executive arm , the european commission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso was relieved and happy with the result " in this case we 're really talking about an agreement which really gives the european union a capacity to act in the 21st century , " he added .
the text is now due to be signed on dec .
13 in the portuguese capital by eu prime ministers and heads of state and will thereafter come to be known as the lisbon treaty .
once officially sealed , it will need to be ratified by all member states , by either parliamentary votes or referendums - meaning its implementation is far from assured .
eu officials are nevertheless hopeful that the ratification process will be completed by spring 2009 , when european parliament elections are scheduled .
" this is a good treaty for the union , " said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , the eu 's longest-serving leader .
the impasse was resolved after leaders agreed to give in to demands from poland and italy .
poland satisfied with concessions poland , the most vocal critic of the proposed treaty before the talks , received assurances that a procedure allowing outvoted states to stall eu laws would be enshrined in the treaty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's president kaczynski got what he wanted " poland got what it wanted .
the eu reform treaty project is now crowned with success , " polish president lech kaczynski said .
" i 'm very happy this business is behind us . "
britain also had many reservations about the treaty , but obtained " red line " opt-outs in key areas at the last eu summit in june which remained in the draft presented on thursday .
" the uk 's red lines are secured , " said british prime minister gordon brown , attending his first summit since succeeding tony blair .
" the british national interest has been protected , " he added .
brown was one of the eu leaders at the two-day informal meeting to say that it was time to put years of discussions on the treaty behind them and turn to the more " concrete " problems facing the bloc .
" i have sent a letter round -lsb- to -rsb- fellow colleagues saying that it is time for europe to address detailed issues of global economic change , climate change and security , " brown told journalists .
italy gets extra parliament seat as a sweetener bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prodi proved to be one of the hardest bargainers italy , which diplomats described as the hardest bargainer during the meeting , obtained one extra seat in the european parliament , giving it the same number of lawmakers as britain .
under the current system , italy , france and britain all have the same number of members in the european parliament .
however , the treaty reduces the overall number of lawmakers by 35 , to 750 , and parliament last week voted for a new distribution , giving italy fewer seats than its similarly sized partners .
close to midnight , diplomats agreed to give italy one more seat without breaching the 750-member cap by excluding the non-voting president of the parliament from the count .
the eu 's two heavyweights , germany and france , both claimed credit for thursday 's success .
merkel , sarkozy both claim credit while french president nicolas sarkozy said he was " extremely satisfied " with the result , german chancellor angela merkel highlighted the role played by her government in launching the final treaty talks in june .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel admitted it had been a struggle to reach agreement " after all the political discussions , this is a great success , " merkel said .
" nothing has been changed from the mandate we agreed at the end of the german presidency . "
she added that the treaty would now help the eu function more efficiently as a bloc and as a power in the world .
she also acknowledged that the deal had been hammered out through some very frustrating discussions and hard bargaining , especially with the poles and italians .
" i ca n't hide the fact that the way to this agreement was very difficult , " merkel said .
other tricky issues were successfully addressed earlier in the meeting .
bulgaria reached a deal allowing it to spell the single currency in cyrillic as " evro " rather than " euro . "
austria received assurances that moves to limit the number of foreigners attending its universities would not be pursued in the european court .
among the treaty 's main innovations are clauses reducing the size of the european commission and streamlining decisions by changing voting rules and limiting the power of individual member states to veto legislation .
it also creates several new posts .
these include a president of the european council of member states , who will represent all the member states , and a high representative of the european union for foreign affairs and security policy , who will be in charge of the bloc 's foreign policy , thereby simplifying its relationships with the outside world . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the library , a unesco world heritage site , reopens to the public on wednesday , oct .
24 . the 2004 blaze destroyed 37 paintings and 50,000 books , all of them hundreds of years old .
it also revived germany 's trauma over the loss of irreplaceable archives and libraries to bombs during world war ii .
the fire was caused by an electrical malfunction .
when the library reopens wednesday , it will have 60,000 of its original volumes , said director michael knoche .
thousands more are still being repaired .
restoration work is expected to continue until 2015 .
goethe 's literary treasures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fire destroyed 50,000 historic books the restoration has cost 12.8 million euros -lrb- $ 18.2 million -rrb- as workers have painstakingly restored not only the books , but the building itself , including the library 's famous rococo room .
the reading room is a lofty gilded gallery with busts of poets , paintings and bookcases set against white walls .
" it has always been more than just a library , " said hellmut seemann , head of the foundation managing the library , saying visitors regarded it as a shrine to german classicism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an impressive collection built in 1691 , the library specializes in german literature between 1750 and 1850 and houses some one million books , including many rare first-editions and the largest collection of faust by johann wolfgang goethe .
goethe , one of germany 's best-known authors , worked as a librarian at the anna amalia .
weimar , a city about 250 kilometers -lrb- 150 miles -rrb- southwest of berlin in the eastern german state of thuringia , is the region 's cultural center .
it also served as the backdrop for the german republic , which was declared there in 1919 .
saving history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german classical culture lives on in the library on the day of the fire , as flames licked at the library 's roof , people formed a human chain to save as many books as possible .
they salvaged some 6,000 historical works , including a 1543 martin luther .
since then , some 22,000 german firms and people donated funds to repair the anna amalia , or to pay to repair books or buy replacements .
library staff estimates that two of every three of the lost books can be bought from other collections or in auctions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a unesco world heritage site " it was the worst library fire in germany since the war , " said jens goebel , culture minister of thuringia , at the start of a week of celebrations to mark the opening .

german politicians from all major political parties voiced dismay at the increasingly bellicose rhetoric from the united states and russia .
politicians want the rhetoric toned down and a greater focus on diplomacy . german politicians were alarmed when us president george w. bush earlier this week brought up the possibility of another world war .
if iran 's nuclear ambitions are n't kept in check , it could result in world war iii , bush said .
russian president vladimir putin caused further concern when , while in iran on a historic visit this week , he made it clear that russia plans to modernize its military , including its nuclear capacities .
german politicians were universal in condemning bush and putin 's cold war rhetoric and encouraging dialogue and diplomacy .
escalation counterproductive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush talks of world war iii bush 's mention of an impending world war iii was counterproductive in finding a solution to the nuclear standoff with iran , ruprecht polenz , a specialist in foreign affairs for chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- told the dpa news agency .
polenz also criticized putin for saying he wants to build up russia 's military capacity .
rolf mützenich , who specializes in foreign policy for the social democrats , said bush 's statement puts a " mutual and peaceful approach to the iranian nuclear crisis " in danger . the disagreement over iran 's nuclear program can not be solved using force , mützenich told dpa .
he encouraged merkel to make this clear when she meets with bush next month .
it was also " completely inappropriate " for bush to bring up the possibility of world war iii , mützenich said .
the left party 's foreign affairs expert , norman paech , said bush 's statement were an " additional signal " that the us is a war risk .
a dangerous political climate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians do n't want to see a return to cold war politics the head of the green party , claudia roth , called the harsh tones from washington and moscow a " backslide into the rhetoric of the cold war , " according to an interview in the internet news portal netzeitung .de.
" bush and putin are losing all forms of measurement and control , " she said .
for jürgen trittin of the green party , bush 's and putin 's recent statements show how dangerous the current political climate is .
bush not making war plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians want more diplomacy and less talk of war bush wanted to make " a rhetorical point " when he suggested that if iran could make nuclear weapons , it could lead to world war iii .
" the president was not making any war plans , and he was n't making any declarations , " said white house press secretary dana perino .
" he was making a point , and the point is that we do not believe - and neither does the international community believe - that iran should be allowed to pursue nuclear weapons . "
if iran acquired nuclear weapons , it would lead to a very dangerous situation , perino said .
the us has accused iran of secretly trying to build nuclear weapons , which tehran denies .
putin will modernize the military bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin during his historic visit to iran putin alarmed world leaders when he mentioned on thursday , oct .

disarmament expert elke hoff of the free democratic party , a free-market liberal party , reproached putin for using us plans for a missile defense shield to undermine non-proliferation politics .
putin embarked on a landmark visit to iran earlier this week to discuss the country 's nuclear program with iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad .

" the red lines have been secured .
the british national interest has been protected , " mr brown said .
he said britain can still set its own policies on justice , home and foreign affairs , as well as security .
but shadow europe minister mark francois said the conservatives would continue to campaign for a referendum .
mr brown said : " it is now time for europe to move on and devote all our efforts to the issues that matter to the people of europe - economic growth , jobs , climate change and security . "
britain has negotiated very hard some opt-outs on some specific issues - now we do n't expect any more requests in that area jose manuel barroso earlier the european commission 's president jose manuel barroso said britain 's requests for concessions in the eu treaty were likely to be met , but it must not make any fresh demands .
he added he hoped for no further " difficulties " at the two-day summit in lisbon as he urged all eu leaders to back the treaty .
" we prefer to have a solution that is broadly agreed with some specific opt-outs for some countries than not to move forward , " he had said .
foreign secretary david miliband told bbc radio 4 's today programme : " the consequence of this treaty is that europe has to prove that it can make a real difference to people 's lives on issues like climate change , jobs and terrorism . "
' national interests ' the opt-outs , which mr brown referred to as " red lines " , were in areas such as human rights , tax and benefits , foreign policy and justice .
mr barroso said a " broadly agreed " eu treaty would be a good outcome the prime minister said that if these made the final draft of the treaty , it would avoid any significant transfer of power to brussels .
" i 've been determined that britain will continue to decide in justice and home affairs - and i believe that the detailed changes that are being made with the opt-in for britain in this area protect the british national interests , " mr brown said at a news conference in the portuguese capital before the deal was reached .
" on foreign affairs and security matters , it is important for us that britain can decide , and that 's why we have been determined that foreign policy remains inter-governmental and decisions are made by unanimity .
" on social security , we have been determined that there is an emergency break - and in some cases a veto - so that decisions are made in the interests of britain . "
mr brown , attending his first eu summit as prime minister , had pledged to veto the treaty if britain 's " red lines " were not fully incorporated .
referendum calls tory mark francois said : " in the small hours of the night gordon brown has agreed the revised eu constitution which potentially transfers massive powers from britain to the eu .
" he had absolutely no democratic mandate to do this and we will now step up our campaign to secure the referendum which he promised the british people all along . "
and shadow foreign secretary william hague said that by failing to agree to a referendum , mr brown was " still treating the british people like fools " with comments that had " reached new depths of cynicism " .
" he still claims that because the name ' constitution ' has been dropped , this treaty is somehow different , even though the european scrutiny committee has specifically told him his argument is misleading .
" he claims that this treaty is about making a free-trading europe work better , when he knows that it downgrades the importance of free competition . "
but mr miliband said the constitution was " dead " and " by no measure " could the treaty be called a constitution .
he said it was time to dispel the " myths " that the treaty amounted to " the end of britain " .
mr hague said polls showed most british people wanted a referendum ' country called europe ' the uk independence party -lrb- ukip -rrb- has also demanded a referendum , along with some labour mps , while ex-lib dem leader sir menzies campbell has said a public vote should be held on the wider question of uk membership of the eu as well .
speaking on bbc radio 4 , ukip leader nigel farage said : " we 've agreed a treaty that makes the european union a country , a country called europe now exists .
" once this treaty goes through there 's no legal debate or argument about that . "
but mr brown was adamant a referendum was not needed .
" if we were debating as big an issue as britain 's membership of the euro , i would have been the first - indeed , i was the first - to say this is such an issue of great significance that the british people must vote in a referendum , " he said .
" if it was the previous constitutional treaty , i would have argued , as we did , that there should have been a referendum .
but this is an amending treaty , where the constitutional concept has been abandoned . "
he said this was " a very different document " to the failed eu constitution , on which voters in the uk were promised a referendum .
and a parliamentary debate would be " the proper way of discussing this " , he insisted , as long as the " red lines " made the final draft .

" he claims that this treaty is about making a free-trading europe work better , when he knows that it downgrades the importance of free competition . "
but mr miliband said the constitution was " dead " and " by no measure " could the treaty be called a constitution .
he said it was time to dispel the " myths " that the treaty amounted to " the end of britain " .
mr hague said polls showed most british people wanted a referendum ' country called europe ' the uk independence party -lrb- ukip -rrb- has also demanded a referendum , along with some labour mps , while ex-lib dem leader sir menzies campbell has said a public vote should be held on the wider question of uk membership of the eu as well .
speaking on bbc radio 4 , ukip leader nigel farage said : " we 've agreed a treaty that makes the european union a country , a country called europe now exists .
" once this treaty goes through there 's no legal debate or argument about that . "
but mr brown was adamant a referendum was not needed .
" if we were debating as big an issue as britain 's membership of the euro , i would have been the first - indeed , i was the first - to say this is such an issue of great significance that the british people must vote in a referendum , " he said .
" if it was the previous constitutional treaty , i would have argued , as we did , that there should have been a referendum .
but this is an amending treaty , where the constitutional concept has been abandoned . "
he said this was " a very different document " to the failed eu constitution , on which voters in the uk were promised a referendum .
and a parliamentary debate would be " the proper way of discussing this " , he insisted , as long as the " red lines " made the final draft .

" the red lines have been secured .
the british national interest has been protected , " mr brown said .
he said britain can still set its own policies on justice , home and foreign affairs , as well as security .
but shadow europe minister mark francois said the conservatives would continue to campaign for a referendum .
mr brown said : " it is now time for europe to move on and devote all our efforts to the issues that matter to the people of europe - economic growth , jobs , climate change and security . "
britain has negotiated very hard some opt-outs on some specific issues - now we do n't expect any more requests in that area jose manuel barroso earlier the european commission 's president jose manuel barroso said britain 's requests for concessions in the eu treaty were likely to be met , but it must not make any fresh demands .
he added he hoped for no further " difficulties " at the two-day summit in lisbon as he urged all eu leaders to back the treaty .
" we prefer to have a solution that is broadly agreed with some specific opt-outs for some countries than not to move forward , " he had said .
foreign secretary david miliband told bbc radio 4 's today programme : " the consequence of this treaty is that europe has to prove that it can make a real difference to people 's lives on issues like climate change , jobs and terrorism . "
' national interests ' the opt-outs , which mr brown referred to as " red lines " , were in areas such as human rights , tax and benefits , foreign policy and justice .
mr barroso said a " broadly agreed " eu treaty would be a good outcome the prime minister said that if these made the final draft of the treaty , it would avoid any significant transfer of power to brussels .
" i 've been determined that britain will continue to decide in justice and home affairs - and i believe that the detailed changes that are being made with the opt-in for britain in this area protect the british national interests , " mr brown said at a news conference in the portuguese capital before the deal was reached .
" on foreign affairs and security matters , it is important for us that britain can decide , and that 's why we have been determined that foreign policy remains inter-governmental and decisions are made by unanimity .
" on social security , we have been determined that there is an emergency break - and in some cases a veto - so that decisions are made in the interests of britain . "
mr brown , attending his first eu summit as prime minister , had pledged to veto the treaty if britain 's " red lines " were not fully incorporated .
referendum calls tory mark francois said : " in the small hours of the night gordon brown has agreed the revised eu constitution which potentially transfers massive powers from britain to the eu .
" he had absolutely no democratic mandate to do this and we will now step up our campaign to secure the referendum which he promised the british people all along . "

the agreement in lisbon was sealed shortly after midnight after objections from italy and poland were overcome .
the treaty is designed to replace the european constitution that was rejected by french and dutch voters in 2005 and will be formally signed on 13 december .
it includes the creation of a new longer-term president of the european council and an eu foreign policy chief .
if what will become known as the treaty of lisbon is ratified by all member states , it will come into force in 2009 .
national pride after seven hours of talks , eu leaders emerged embracing and slapping each other on the back in sheer relief that the most serious crisis in the bloc 's 50-year history seemed to be over , the bbc 's oana lungescu in lisbon says .
in the last-minute negotiations , italy gained an extra seat in the future european parliament , returning it to parity with the uk and restoring italian national pride , our correspondent says .
poland secured a guarantee that small groups of countries would be able to delay eu decisions they do not like - a victory for the polish government just days before sunday 's early parliamentary election , she adds . "
with this treaty , europe is showing that the european project is on the move - now we can look forward to the future with confidence " jose socrates , portuguese prime minister q & a : the reform treaty send us your reaction earlier , austria reached a deal over its bid to maintain quotas for foreign students , with the european commission agreeing to suspend for five years its legal action over the country 's quota .
bulgaria also won the right to call the eu single currency the " evro " , rather than euro , in its cyrillic alphabet .
the new reform treaty is designed to speed up decision making in the expanded european union .
it will also create a new president of the european council , a new eu foreign affairs chief , a reformed voting system and scrap vetoes in dozens of areas .
however , the 250-page document has been stripped of any trappings of a super-state , such as the mention of the eu anthem and flag .
it amends , rather than replaces , existing eu treaties , a point which some countries - notably the uk - have argued means there is no need for national referendums on the document .
' great achievement ' after the agreement was reached , jose socrates , the prime minister of portugal , which holds the rotating presidency , said europe had emerged from an " institutional crisis " .
" with this treaty , europe is showing that the european project is on the move .
now we can look forward to the future with confidence , " he added .
european commission president jose manuel barroso said the treaty was a " great achievement " .
" i believe we have a treaty that will give us now the capacity to act , " he said .
" our citizens want results .
they want to see in concrete terms what europe brings them in their daily lives . "
the uk government had little to say in friday 's negotiations .
prime minister gordon brown said the uk 's " red lines " , which his government had declared around various policy areas , had been secured .
" the british national interest has been protected , " he added .
on thursday , mr brown once again ruled out a referendum on the treaty .
despite pressure in the uk and several other countries for a popular vote , only ireland is legally bound to hold a referendum , and most governments will do what they can to avoid another embarrassing failure , our correspondent oana lungescu says .

with this treaty , europe is showing that the european project is on the move - now we can look forward to the future with confidence jose socrates , portuguese prime minister q & a : the reform treaty send us your reaction earlier , austria reached a deal over its bid to maintain quotas for foreign students , with the european commission agreeing to suspend for five years its legal action over the country 's quota .
bulgaria also won the right to call the eu single currency the " evro " , rather than euro , in its cyrillic alphabet .
the new reform treaty is designed to speed up decision making in the expanded european union .
it will also create a new president of the european council , a new eu foreign affairs chief , a reformed voting system and scrap vetoes in dozens of areas .
however , the 250-page document has been stripped of any trappings of a super-state , such as the mention of the eu anthem and flag .
it amends , rather than replaces , existing eu treaties , a point which some countries - notably the uk - have argued means there is no need for national referendums on the document .
' great achievement ' after the agreement was reached , jose socrates , the prime minister of portugal , which holds the rotating presidency , said europe had emerged from an " institutional crisis " .
the uk government says the treaty respects britain 's " red lines " " with this treaty , europe is showing that the european project is on the move .
now we can look forward to the future with confidence , " he added .
european commission president jose manuel barroso said the treaty was a " great achievement " .
" i believe we have a treaty that will give us now the capacity to act , " he said .
" our citizens want results .
they want to see in concrete terms what europe brings them in their daily lives . "
the uk government had little to say in friday 's negotiations .
prime minister gordon brown said the uk 's " red lines " , which his government had declared around various policy areas , had been secured .
" the british national interest has been protected , " he added .
on thursday , mr brown once again ruled out a referendum on the treaty .
despite pressure in the uk and several other countries for a popular vote , only ireland is legally bound to hold a referendum , and most governments will do what they can to avoid another embarrassing failure , our correspondent oana lungescu says .

mr blair told a charity event in new york that iran was prepared to destabilise peaceful countries .
in his first major speech since leaving office , mr blair again defended the decision to go to war in iraq .
he urged continued vigilance by the united states , britain and their allies in combating the threat of extremism .
mr blair - now an envoy for the middle east quartet - warned against being " forced into retreat " as the world faced a situation similar to " rising fascism in the 1920s " .
shared values the former pm is still regarded as a staunch ally of the us .
he was greeted with a standing ovation even before he spoke .
the audience , new york 's political and catholic elite , laughed when he joked that americans were slowly mastering the english language .
but on a more serious note he spoke of what he called an extremist islamic ideology .
" this ideology now has a state - iran - that is prepared to back and finance terror in the pursuit of destabilising countries whose people wish to live in peace . "
" there is a tendency even now , even in some of our own circles , to believe that they are as they are because we have provoked them and if we left them alone they would leave us alone .
" i fear this is mistaken .
they have no intention of leaving us alone . "
mr blair stressed the shared values that he believes unite britain and the us .
" america and europe should not be divided , we should stand up together .
" the values we share are as vital and true and , above all , needed today as they have been at any time in the last 100 years . "
the charity dinner was held in honour of al smith , the former governor of new york who was the first catholic to be nominated by a major political party to run for us president .
the annual event has gained a reputation as a major social gathering in election years , when organisers traditionally invite the presidential candidates to speak .
however new york 's two presidential candidates , senator hillary clinton and former mayor rudolph giuliani , did not attend .

with a major label deal , they now are tipped for mainstream success .
frontman dappy - real name costas dinos contostavlos - talks about his band 's growing fame , his family link to 1970s rockers mungo jerry and his love for phil collins .
who are n dubz ?
we 're all from camden town and we went to the same school .
it is nowhere near a manufactured band , we 've all been through some crazy lives back where we live .
my dad and our manager -lsb- byron contostavlos -rsb- helped us from day one and he died on 12 april .
he 's the one who put us in studios .
he was in a band called mungo jerry , he played the bass , so we are very musically influenced .
he put us on the right path , he stopped us doing bad things , and here we are eight years down the line .
and you won the mobo award , beating artists like mutya buena ...
now we carry a big responsibility on our shoulders .
now we have to deliver and we wo n't let them down .
we have to prove to everyone that we are the uk 's best newcomers .
it was voted for by fans and it was the biggest margin ever for the best uk newcomer award - we won by miles .
what kind of following have you got ?
up and down the country - scotland down to cornwall - every teenager -lsb- knows us -rsb- .
we 're doing a schools tour at the moment , we 've been doing primary schools , and every single kid knows the words .
if you do n't have n dubz on your phone , or you do n't have an n dubz dappy hat , you 're not cool .
in your feva las vegas video , a record industry man offers you a briefcase full of cash - is that what happened ?
this is all true stuff - someone tried to offer us £ 80,000 for our publishing and we said no .
in a briefcase ?
not exactly .
the reason we put the briefcase in was because the way he said it to us was blunt , straightforward : ' i 've got £ 80,000 , publishing , right now . '
we was like : ' no , na na nah , ha ha .
we are worth much more than £ 80,000 . '
the video for love for my slum showed you punching a " rich kid " .
the independent newspaper said you could " encourage their viewers to indulge in criminality " .
are they right ?
n dubz are dappy -lrb- left -rrb- , tulisa -lrb- centre -rrb- and fazer dappy and tulisa are cousins the group started making music aged 11 all three had roles in channel 4 's dubplate drama their song i swear was number one on the channel u chart for six months they are completely utterly wrong .
there 's a lot of kids from a very good background , they come down to where we live and all they want to do is fit in with people like us that have n't really had a good start in life .
i 'm trying to say to them there is no need to do that .
you 're in a great position .
-lsb- reciting the song 's lyrics -rsb- " how can you be ghetto if my whole freakin ' flat is smaller than your kitchen ?
you would n't last a minute where i 'm from , you 'd go missing .
so appreciate what you 've got because for that i 'm still wishing . "
what you 've got i 'm wishing for , and what i 've got they 're wishing for , and that there really hurts me inside .
not many british urban artists have broken though to the big time - why is that and why will you be different ?
the majority of urban artists are stuck in a car park .
they are afraid to expand their degrees of knowledge in music .
you have to know about a verse leading into the bridge , crescendo into the chorus , back out into a verse , bridge , chorus , middle eight .
even if you want to do garage , grime , all that funny fast stuff , you have to know how to make a song , how to keep people interested .
in my spare time , i listen to -lsb- london pop radio station -rsb- magic 105.4 , due to the fact that the vocal arrangements are how a song should be .
george michael , phil collins , roachford , the police - these are all very big inspirations to us and we take that back to our little laboratory in finsbury park and come up with our smashers that every single teenager in the uk is raving about at the moment .
where have your hats come from ?
this is just us , camden town .
i felt very comfortable with those hats from a baby , with the two strings , i like to have things hanging from the side of my head so i 'm very noticeable .
if i walk on any high street , anywhere i go , there will be hands and there will be screams and i do n't know how i 've done it .

ms bhutto , who was travelling from the city 's airport to a rally marking her homecoming after eight years in self-imposed exile , was not hurt .
the truck carrying her had its windows shattered and a door blown off .
the attacks on the motorcade happened despite a heavy security presence following threats from militant groups .
witnesses described horrific scenes , with bodies and body parts littering the area .
children were among the dead .

ms bhutto , who was travelling from the city 's airport to a rally marking her homecoming after eight years in self-imposed exile , was not hurt .
the truck carrying her had its windows shattered and a door blown off .
the attacks on the motorcade happened despite a heavy security presence following threats from militant groups .
witnesses described horrific scenes , with bodies and body parts littering the area .
children were among the dead .
several islamist groups , including pro-taleban militants , had said they would attack ms bhutto on her return , after she promised to confront those operating in the northern tribal areas bordering afghanistan .
her husband , asif ali zardari , said members of the government and intelligence agencies who were going to lose power were behind the attack .
ms bhutto had earlier warned that if targeted , she would hold what she described as hidden authorities within the government as partly responsible .
extremists will not be allowed to stop pakistanis from selecting their representatives through an open and democratic process gordon johndroe white house spokesman in quotes : blast reaction from joy to horror send us your comments ms bhutto heads the country 's largest political force , the pakistan people 's party -lrb- ppp -rrb- .
she wants to contest parliamentary elections due to be held in january and she has been negotiating with president pervez musharraf over a possible power-sharing agreement .
the us has backed such a deal , amid concerns about the military 's inability to defeat islamist militants and gen musharraf 's rising unpopularity .
ms bhutto has been prime minister twice .
on both occasions , her government was prematurely dismissed by the president of the day under special powers .
she left pakistan in april 1999 , shortly before gen musharraf seized power in a coup - and two years after her husband was jailed and a series of corruption charges were brought against her .
she denies the charges .
gen musharraf said the attack on ms bhutto 's convoy was a " conspiracy against democracy " .
" the president appealed to the nation and especially the people of karachi to exercise patience and calm in this hour , " said a statement by his office .
the united states also condemned the blasts .
" extremists will not be allowed to stop pakistanis from selecting their representatives through an open and democratic process , " said national security council spokesman gordon johndroe .
' suicide bomber ' victoria schofield , a friend of ms bhutto who was also on the bus , said the former prime minister had been standing on top of the bus for six hours , but had just gone downstairs to work on a speech when the first explosion went off .
" we were sitting up on the top and suddenly there was this absolute flash of light and a blast , " she told the bbc .
there was blood all around and it was chaos - we did n't know where to go , what to do farzana raja ppp spokeswoman on board bhutto 's flight in pictures : blast scene " i felt lots of really hot air coming and we all - there were about 15 of us on the top of the bus - we all literally went to the ground . "
ms schofield said the first blast was relatively small but that it had had left people sitting on the left-hand side of the bus covered with blood .
she said the first explosion had come from a parked car which police had begun to investigate .
ms schofield said a second , much larger explosion occurred two minutes later .
" there was blood all around and it was chaos - and we could n't understand what was happening - we did n't know where to go , what to do , " said farzana raja , a spokeswoman for the ppp .
most of the dead were members of the ppp , although police vehicles took the main force of the blasts and more than 20 police officers are thought to have died .
a cameraman for a local tv station was also killed .
key dates 06 oct : presidential polls held 17 oct : supreme court resumes hearing challenges to musharraf candidacy 18 oct : benazir bhutto 's homecoming 15 nov : parliamentary term ends and general election must be held by mid-january flying into uncertainty the chief of police in karachi , azhar farooqi , said a preliminary investigation suggested the second blast had been caused by a suicide bomber .
" the first blast was probably a hand grenade and it did not cause much damage , " he told the bbc .
after the blasts , a dazed ms bhutto was immediately rushed from the scene to her karachi home .
ms bhutto flew in from dubai earlier on thursday , accompanied by about 100 ppp members .
at least 200,000 people turned out to greet her in what correspondents described as a carnival atmosphere , but the crowds slowed the progress of her convoy .
ms bhutto had been planning to make a speech at the tomb of pakistan 's founding father , mohammed ali jinnah .
