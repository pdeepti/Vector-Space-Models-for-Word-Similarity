the federal commissioner for data protection has accused the german government of " culpable neglect " in protecting data privacy .
he said the government should halt plans for greater access to phone and internet records . fundamental civil liberties in germany are increasingly under attack from state authorities and private businesses seeking to snoop into peoples ' lives , said german federal commissioner for data protection peter schaar during an annual data protection presentation in berlin on tuesday . schaar accused security officials of violating the law in their attempts to fight terror , adding that the federal criminal police office had passed on information to germany 's domestic intelligence agency - the federal office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- - that was unnecessary for its fight against terrorism . out of step with technology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commissioner schaar was displeased about government access to personal data schaar said modern technology provides plenty of opportunities for unauthorized access to personal data that had previously been protected under stringent laws .
" data protection laws have not kept up with the advance of technology , " schaar said , calling for an update of data privacy laws .
" complete surveillance is already technologically possible today . "
in addition to technology making it possible to observe people 's actions in the privacy of their homes and offices , he said " businesses can access and exploit that personal data . "
though thorough in his criticism of the government , schaar also put some of the blame for deteriorating privacy at the feet of private individuals , many of whom willing share private information . " there is an exhibitionist tendency among people themselves that makes it easy to glean specific data about them from the internet , " he said .

schaar also criticized a government plan to store the fingerprints of all adult germans in a central database .
after intense debate within the government , german media reported tuesday that plans to store digital fingerprints had been scrapped .
fighting terrorism vs. personal freedoms proponents , including interior minister wolfgang schäuble , have argued the measures schaar criticized are needed to fight terrorism .

the federal commissioner for data protection has accused the german government of " culpable neglect " in protecting data privacy .
he said the government should halt plans for greater access to phone and internet records . fundamental civil liberties in germany are increasingly under attack from state authorities and private businesses seeking to snoop into peoples ' lives , said german federal commissioner for data protection peter schaar during an annual data protection presentation in berlin on tuesday . schaar accused security officials of violating the law in their attempts to fight terror , adding that the federal criminal police office had passed on information to germany 's domestic intelligence agency - the federal office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- - that was unnecessary for its fight against terrorism . out of step with technology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commissioner schaar was displeased about government access to personal data schaar said modern technology provides plenty of opportunities for unauthorized access to personal data that had previously been protected under stringent laws .
" data protection laws have not kept up with the advance of technology , " schaar said , calling for an update of data privacy laws .
" complete surveillance is already technologically possible today . "
in addition to technology making it possible to observe people 's actions in the privacy of their homes and offices , he said " businesses can access and exploit that personal data . "
though thorough in his criticism of the government , schaar also put some of the blame for deteriorating privacy at the feet of private individuals , many of whom willing share private information . " there is an exhibitionist tendency among people themselves that makes it easy to glean specific data about them from the internet , " he said .
complaints about violations schaar warned that germany has embarked on the road to an orwellian-style surveillance state that runs counter to the principle of individual freedom and a state based on the rule of law .
the introduction of new anti-terror laws in the wake of the sept .
11 terrorist attacks on the united states , he argued , has led to a situation in which law enforcement officials and intelligence services are illegally exchanging data that should be kept separate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plans to give police automatic access to fingerprints have been scrapped in addition , the commissioner strongly criticized plans for a new law to give authorities greater access to phone and internet records and enabling authorities to access a computer 's contents without the owner 's knowledge .
schaar also criticized a government plan to store the fingerprints of all adult germans in a central database .
after intense debate within the government , german media reported tuesday that plans to store digital fingerprints had been scrapped .
fighting terrorism vs. personal freedoms proponents , including interior minister wolfgang schäuble , have argued the measures schaar criticized are needed to fight terrorism .
the anti-terror measures and wider pre-emptive police powers have met with resistance in germany , which remains particularly sensitive to state surveillance due to the legacy of the nazi regime and former east german secret police . " we must not allow the government to upset the balance between people 's right to security and their freedoms , " schaar said .
" unfortunately , i have the impression that the government is bent on tipping the scale against civil liberties .

according to a survey conducted for the german transport ministry , over 80 percent of drivers on german roads say other drivers have become increasingly rude , and the government has decided to take action . the people polled said drivers are more inconsiderate than they used to be , with women and older drivers feeling particularly annoyed by impolite drivers and those who drive very fast , the transport ministry 's survey showed . germany is famed for its fast cars and high speed highways - the autobahn , stretches of which do not have speed limits . the country even attracts international auto-tourists , who book special vacation packages to enjoy the freedom of driving as fast as they want . off the autobahn , germans unhappy on the road bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new safety campaign aims to get people to be more polite on highways and other roads it 's not so much road rage that is getting on everyone 's nerves , as " road rudeness . "
germany 's transport minister wolfgang tiefensee said the results of the poll are a warning signal , adding that action needed to be taken soon . tiefensee has launched a new campaign encouraging people more consideration to fellow drivers .

drivers between 18 and 25 years old make up over 30 percent of alcohol-related accidents . tiefensee also said stricter drinking limits are now in place for new drivers .

by calling it a " treaty , " the current german eu presidency has begun reviving the stalled approval process for a new constitution for the union .
but not everyone is happy about the strategy . chancellor angela merkel and other german officials are currently in talks with representatives from the bloc 's other 26 members to try and hammer out an agreement before the german presidency ends at the end of june .
by leaving the word " constitution " out of the discussion , merkel hopes to get her colleagues to agree on a document that lacks the grave connotations and still manages to give the eu an improved voting system based largely on population size , a president and a foreign minister - even though they might not be called that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been discussing the idea with euroskeptics such as klaus " i consider it likely that symbolic elements like the words ' constitution ' or ' constitutional ' or the title ' foreign minister ' will not be in the new treaty , " czech negotiator jan zahradil told reuters news service after merkel met czech president vaclav klaus , a euroskeptic , last week .
" maybe the position will be there without the title of minister , " he added .
points of dispute according to zahradil , german officials have come up with 12 so-called " points of dispute " that will be the focus of any further discussions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could this dutch cow be convinced of the benefits of a treaty ?
according to diplomats cited by reuters , these points include the future of a charter of fundamental rights , which britain and the netherlands do not support .
also up for debate are plans to extend majority decision-making to justice and security issues .
german officials also want to include stronger references to energy security and climate change and give greater importance to social issues - a french request .
merkel 's efforts are backed by people such as outgoing british premier tony blair , who has been talking about a " simplified treaty " that would allow eu members to reach a swift agreement .
no mini-treaty but supporters of an eu consitution , such as belgian premier guy verhofstadt , have said that they are unwilling to back a watered-down document .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guy verhofstadt wants the real thing " we ca n't just follow the proposal of some states and wipe the slate clean of the constitutional treaty , " verhofstadt said in a speech at the egmont institute , a foreign policy think-tank , according to reuters .
" let there be no mistake : a mini-treaty is unacceptable , " he added .
it 's unlikely that merkel will be able to go beyond initial talks during her time as eu president , however : diplomats expect an intergovernmental conference to take place under the portuguese eu presidency in october , reuters reported .

the federal commissioner for data protection has accused the german government of " culpable neglect " in protecting data privacy .
he said the government should halt plans for greater access to phone and internet records . fundamental civil liberties in germany are increasingly under attack from state authorities and private businesses seeking to snoop into peoples ' lives , said german federal commissioner for data protection peter schaar during an annual data protection presentation in berlin on tuesday . schaar accused security officials of violating the law in their attempts to fight terror , adding that the federal criminal police office had passed on information to germany 's domestic intelligence agency - the federal office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- - that was unnecessary for its fight against terrorism . out of step with technology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commissioner schaar was displeased about government access to personal data schaar said modern technology provides plenty of opportunities for unauthorized access to personal data that had previously been protected under stringent laws .
" data protection laws have not kept up with the advance of technology , " schaar said , calling for an update of data privacy laws .
" complete surveillance is already technologically possible today . "
in addition to technology making it possible to observe people 's actions in the privacy of their homes and offices , he said " businesses can access and exploit that personal data . "
though thorough in his criticism of the government , schaar also put some of the blame for deteriorating privacy at the feet of private individuals , many of whom willing share private information . " there is an exhibitionist tendency among people themselves that makes it easy to glean specific data about them from the internet , " he said .

the federal commissioner for data protection has accused the german government of " culpable neglect " in protecting data privacy .
he said the government should halt plans for greater access to phone and internet records . fundamental civil liberties in germany are increasingly under attack from state authorities and private businesses seeking to snoop into peoples ' lives , said german federal commissioner for data protection peter schaar during an annual data protection presentation in berlin on tuesday . schaar accused security officials of violating the law in their attempts to fight terror , adding that the federal criminal police office had passed on information to germany 's domestic intelligence agency - the federal office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- - that was unnecessary for its fight against terrorism . out of step with technology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commissioner schaar was displeased about government access to personal data schaar said modern technology provides plenty of opportunities for unauthorized access to personal data that had previously been protected under stringent laws .
" data protection laws have not kept up with the advance of technology , " schaar said , calling for an update of data privacy laws .
" complete surveillance is already technologically possible today . "
in addition to technology making it possible to observe people 's actions in the privacy of their homes and offices , he said " businesses can access and exploit that personal data . "
though thorough in his criticism of the government , schaar also put some of the blame for deteriorating privacy at the feet of private individuals , many of whom willing share private information . " there is an exhibitionist tendency among people themselves that makes it easy to glean specific data about them from the internet , " he said .
complaints about violations schaar warned that germany has embarked on the road to an orwellian-style surveillance state that runs counter to the principle of individual freedom and a state based on the rule of law .

the board is expected to confirm that announcement on wednesday .
von pierer is to be replaced by german steel giant thyssenkrupp chairman gerhard cromme . on tuesday , it was reported that linde ceo wolfgang reitzle had been approached about possibly succeeding kleinfeld .

" those foreigners who are well-integrated , speak the german language and have an income of their own should be offered german citizenship , " stegner told the weekly bild am sonntag .
" and that without the precondition of having to relinquish their original nationality first . "
latest available statistics show that in 2005 only about 110,000 foreigners applied to become german nationals - a drop by almost 60 percent compared with the year 2000 when figures peaked in postwar germany .
at that time the previous spd-led government made it easier for germany 's four million foreigners to become citizens of this country .

a nationwide signature campaign spearheaded by cdu state premier roland koch stopped a more far-reaching citizenship reform .
the powerful regional leader is again stonewalling against softening citizenship laws .
" the conditions for granting german citizenship must remain crystal clear , " koch said .

critics denounce this arguing that ethnic germans from the former soviet union who know just little about life here automatically receive citizenship while children of immigrants born in germany are technically foreigners .
current laws , they say , are a slap in the face especially of turks here who have strong links to their country and religion .
" certainly , the more muslims have a german passport the better they know who to vote for , " said abdul hadi hoffmann , deputy head of the berlin-based muslim academy .
" so we do encourage muslims to participate in german society and politics , " he added .
" however , if someone decides to lead his family life , earn a living and not spend his evenings in a bar drinking beer , this is not a sign of isolation and of being against the german state . "
the debate unleashed by germany 's social democrats comes at a time when less turkish nationals living in germany opt to become citizens of their host country .
this number has dropped by amore than half recently from 103,000 applicants in 1999 to merely 44,000 last year .

i 'm working up to seven hours a day to get my fitness back .

you were the top goal-getter in the bundesliga , stuttgart was at the top of the table , and you had made your debut in the german national team .
will you have to start from scratch ? i definitely wo n't have to start from scratch .

i 'm happy for them .
it does n't matter who scores the goals .

are you hoping to make a name for yourself on the european stage ? if someone had told me before the start of this season that i 'd score 13 goals and play for germany , i would have laughed in his face .
i do n't like putting myself under pressure .
i just want to get healthy again and improve as a player . you 're considered a natural talent .
but how much of that is hard work ? i have some natural ability , but i also work hard on my weaknesses . what are your weaknesses ? above all : staying calm in front of the goal .

it would be a dream come true to play for them . you come from a mixed german-spanish background and have two mexican teammates at stuttgart , ricardo osorio and pavel pardo .
do you speak to them in spanish ? both of them speak good german , and they 're getting better every day .

dw-world.de talked to the 21-year-old about his meteoric rise and his future ambitions . dw-world.de : mario , when are we going to see you on the pitch again ? mario gomez : i ca n't say at the moment .
i 'm working up to seven hours a day to get my fitness back .
but i 'm definitely not going to rush things . before you suffered a knee injury on march 11 , everything was going great .
you were the top goal-getter in the bundesliga , stuttgart was at the top of the table , and you had made your debut in the german national team .
will you have to start from scratch ? i definitely wo n't have to start from scratch .
but it would be arrogant to think that i 'll have the same form i had before i got hurt . you teammates in stuttgart have been scoring lots of goals in your absence .
do you feel like the team needs you less ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gomez 's is one of germany 's most technically proficient strikers not at all .
i 'm happy for them .
it does n't matter who scores the goals .
the main thing is that we 're successful as a team . next season you could be playing with stuttgart in the champions league and with the german national team at euro 2008 .
are you hoping to make a name for yourself on the european stage ? if someone had told me before the start of this season that i 'd score 13 goals and play for germany , i would have laughed in his face .
i do n't like putting myself under pressure .
i just want to get healthy again and improve as a player . you 're considered a natural talent .
but how much of that is hard work ? i have some natural ability , but i also work hard on my weaknesses . what are your weaknesses ? above all : staying calm in front of the goal .
sometimes i also let my opponent get the better of me in one-on-one situations .
i try to address these deficiencies every time i practice . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gomez got stuttgart off to a good start - now they 're bidding for the champions league do you think you have a guaranteed spot in germany 's euro 2008 squad ? getting injured has shown me how fast things can change .
so i 'm not thinking ahead at all to the european championship next year . are you staying in stuttgart ?
there have been reports of offers from foreign clubs , for example , juventus and ac milan . of course i 'm staying at stuttgart .
i just extended my contract to 2011 . so you do n't dream of playing in spain 's primera division ? my favorite club is barcelona .
it would be a dream come true to play for them . you come from a mixed german-spanish background and have two mexican teammates at stuttgart , ricardo osorio and pavel pardo .
do you speak to them in spanish ? both of them speak good german , and they 're getting better every day .
but sometimes we do talk to each other in spanish . so where will stuttgart end up this season .

" my brother abdullah gül , with whom we established this movement -lrb- the governing justice and development party , akp -rrb- ... is the person who emerged at the end of our evaluations as the candidate to become turkey 's 11th president , " erdogan told the akp group in parliament in ankara .
" the people have seen the services that -lrb- gül -rrb- has done for his country , " erdogan also told the akp .
erdogan had been widely expected to run for the post , but the prospect sparked harsh objections from secularists .
they say the former islamist , who now describes himself as a conservative democrat , is a divisive figure with no true commitment to the mainly muslim nation 's secular system .
gul has been foreign minister since 2003 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah gul is also currently deputy prime minister the 56-year-old gül , who is also a deputy prime minister , is virtually certain to become president thanks to the comfortable majority of 353 seats that the akp holds in the 550-member parliament , which elects the president for a single , seven-year term .
he is unlikely to get the post in the first two rounds of voting , when a two-thirds majority of 367 is required , but is a shoo-in for the third or fourth round , when a simple majority of 276 suffices .
the first round is scheduled for this friday , the second for may 2 , the third for may 9 and the fourth for may 15 .
outgoing president ahmet necdet sezer 's mandate expires on may 16 .
gül is a former academic and banker who became a member of parliament in 1991 .
he and erdogan helped establish the mildly islamist akp , splitting from a group of hardliners .

" my brother abdullah gül , with whom we established this movement -lrb- the governing justice and development party , akp -rrb- ... is the person who emerged at the end of our evaluations as the candidate to become turkey 's 11th president , " erdogan told the akp group in parliament in ankara .
" the people have seen the services that -lrb- gül -rrb- has done for his country , " erdogan also told the akp .
erdogan had been widely expected to run for the post , but the prospect sparked harsh objections from secularists .
they say the former islamist , who now describes himself as a conservative democrat , is a divisive figure with no true commitment to the mainly muslim nation 's secular system .
gul has been foreign minister since 2003 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah gul is also currently deputy prime minister the 56-year-old gül , who is also a deputy prime minister , is virtually certain to become president thanks to the comfortable majority of 353 seats that the akp holds in the 550-member parliament , which elects the president for a single , seven-year term .
he is unlikely to get the post in the first two rounds of voting , when a two-thirds majority of 367 is required , but is a shoo-in for the third or fourth round , when a simple majority of 276 suffices .
the first round is scheduled for this friday , the second for may 2 , the third for may 9 and the fourth for may 15 .
outgoing president ahmet necdet sezer 's mandate expires on may 16 .
gül is a former academic and banker who became a member of parliament in 1991 .
he and erdogan helped establish the mildly islamist akp , splitting from a group of hardliners .
the ak party was elected to government in 2002 and gül became prime minister for four months before stepping down once ak party leader erdogan secured a seat in parliament .

the 24-year old german-born turk was a prisoner in guantanamo bay and the subject of a legal battle with the german government of the time , who , according to kurnaz , failed to secure his release when they had the chance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us was prepared to release kurnaz from guantanamo in 2002 his memoir , entitled " five years of my life , " which hit german bookstands on tuesday , paints a disturbing picture of kurnaz ' ordeal . " i understood a long time ago what this prison was about , " kurnaz said .
" they could do with us whatever they wanted . " kurnaz was arrested in pakistan shortly after the sept .
11 attacks on the united states .
kurnaz insists he did n't travel to pakistan to fight alongside al qaeda , but rather to work for an islamic " salvation army " to help the homeless , among others .
kurnaz claims he was " sold " to us soldiers by unscrupulous bounty hunters .
he was then taken to afghanistan , where he faced torturous interrogations . no help from germany according to his own account , kurnaz was left for days to hang by his hands that were tied behind his back and that were attached to electrodes .
he hoped in vain that the german authorities would help him out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily said the german government did what it had to do to protect its citizens " one of the german soldiers came , pulled my head up and asked if i knew who they were , " kurnaz said .
" he said they were the elite force , the ksk , and slammed my head on the floor .
later another one came up and kicked me and the group of soldiers started laughing . " kurnaz was subsequently transported to guantanamo .
in the book , he accuses the us soldiers there of gross maltreatment .
he describes how doctors would make unnecessary amputations and how guards would hand out regular beatings .
kurnaz himself spent over a year in solitary confinement , suffering from extreme cold , heat , darkness and oxygen deprivation . " i never imagined i would come out of it alive , " kurnaz said .
" i presumed i could die at any minute .
i was often unconscious due to the pain and the cold .
my body could n't take any more . " personal intervention # b # it was n't until august 2006 that the newly elected chancellor angela merkel intervened personally to secure kurnaz ' release from guantanamo .
the us was reportedly prepared to release him as early as 2002 , but the germans were allegedly reluctant to allow him to return to germany at the time - a fact that sparked uproar and prompted a parliamentary inquiry . the question whether kurnaz did represent a terror threat and whether the government of the time should have done more to free him is the subject of an ongoing investigation .
according to former interior minister otto schily , however , the social democratic-green party government coalition headed by gerhard schröder responded adequately to the situation . " we have a responsibility for the safety of our citizens , " schily said .
" and that includes keeping people out of our country who represent a danger to our security .
and that was the case with murat kurnaz . " now back in his home city of bremen , kurnaz says he just wants to get on with his life .
he says the book is not intended to settle any scores , but rather to tell the world how his co-prisoners lost their legs , hands and lives in guantanamo bay . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : steinmeier 's record is blemished germany 's foreign minister has denied he caused an innocent german-born turk to be imprisoned for years at the us guantanamo bay prison .

the 24-year old german-born turk was a prisoner in guantanamo bay and the subject of a legal battle with the german government of the time , who , according to kurnaz , failed to secure his release when they had the chance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us was prepared to release kurnaz from guantanamo in 2002 his memoir , entitled " five years of my life , " which hit german bookstands on tuesday , paints a disturbing picture of kurnaz ' ordeal . " i understood a long time ago what this prison was about , " kurnaz said .
" they could do with us whatever they wanted . " kurnaz was arrested in pakistan shortly after the sept .
11 attacks on the united states .
kurnaz insists he did n't travel to pakistan to fight alongside al qaeda , but rather to work for an islamic " salvation army " to help the homeless , among others .
kurnaz claims he was " sold " to us soldiers by unscrupulous bounty hunters .
he was then taken to afghanistan , where he faced torturous interrogations . no help from germany according to his own account , kurnaz was left for days to hang by his hands that were tied behind his back and that were attached to electrodes .
he hoped in vain that the german authorities would help him out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily said the german government did what it had to do to protect its citizens " one of the german soldiers came , pulled my head up and asked if i knew who they were , " kurnaz said .
" he said they were the elite force , the ksk , and slammed my head on the floor .
later another one came up and kicked me and the group of soldiers started laughing . " kurnaz was subsequently transported to guantanamo .
in the book , he accuses the us soldiers there of gross maltreatment .
he describes how doctors would make unnecessary amputations and how guards would hand out regular beatings .
kurnaz himself spent over a year in solitary confinement , suffering from extreme cold , heat , darkness and oxygen deprivation . " i never imagined i would come out of it alive , " kurnaz said .
" i presumed i could die at any minute .
i was often unconscious due to the pain and the cold .
my body could n't take any more . " personal intervention # b # it was n't until august 2006 that the newly elected chancellor angela merkel intervened personally to secure kurnaz ' release from guantanamo .
the us was reportedly prepared to release him as early as 2002 , but the germans were allegedly reluctant to allow him to return to germany at the time - a fact that sparked uproar and prompted a parliamentary inquiry . the question whether kurnaz did represent a terror threat and whether the government of the time should have done more to free him is the subject of an ongoing investigation .
according to former interior minister otto schily , however , the social democratic-green party government coalition headed by gerhard schröder responded adequately to the situation . " we have a responsibility for the safety of our citizens , " schily said .
" and that includes keeping people out of our country who represent a danger to our security .
and that was the case with murat kurnaz . " now back in his home city of bremen , kurnaz says he just wants to get on with his life .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 24.04.2007 imprisoned german terrorist receives day-outing ops großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former raf terrorist christian klar a german court on tuesday granted prison day releases to a former red army faction militant after 24 years of imprisonment .
this comes amid a raging debate over new revelations about the group 's terror campaign . the regional court in the southwestern city of karlsruhe approved outings with a court-appointed chaperone beginning in july for christian klar , who has been serving a life term for his role in several murders with the urban red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- guerrilla group .
klar 's attorney had issued a formal complaint after authorities in february rejected his appeal for more lenient prison conditions because he had recently made fiery anti-capitalist remarks .
in those remarks , he spoke of the " defeat of capitalism " and said europe was being ruled by an imperial alliance .
klar , who is eligible for early release in 2009 , has also appealed to german president horst köhler for clemency .
this is strongly opposed by most of the families of his victims because he has never expressed regret for the murders .
gripped by a violent history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klar is in prison in bruchsal , southern germany german media have been gripped by the former leftist militant 's fate for months , questioning whether the country is ready to draw a line under the bloody raf campaign of killings and kidnappings that shook the nation to its core .
klar was jailed for a series of killings , including the shooting of federal prosecutor siegfried buback , during the raf 's violent campaign against what it called the oppressive capitalist west german state and elite in the 1970s and early 1980s .
however , an ex-raf radical has recently come to say klar was not involved in buback 's murder and has blamed another man for the killing .
german authorities are now reviewing those claims and reports that the state was aware of testimonies in the early 1980s stating that klar was not guilty of buback 's killing .
opting for silence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mug shots of klar and former raf member mohnhaupt -lrb- r -rrb- to this day , members of the group have refused to provide information about their crimes , leaving german officials and victims ' relatives uncertain about who actually pulled the trigger in a number of high-profile cases .
former raf member peter-juergen boock , who spent 17 years in prison for his role in the group , broke that silence in a weekend interview with der spiegel newsmagazine .
he said he believed klar had driven the getaway car for the two raf members who ambushed buback in april 1977 , and suggested that german authorities had misidentified the trigger-man in the shooting .
buback was the first victim of a bloody era dubbed the " german autumn " of 1977 when he was shot in his mercedes car by a raf gunman on a motorcycle in karlsruhe .
in february , a german court ordered the release of another raf leader , brigitte mohnhaupt , after 24 years in jail on the basis that she no longer poses a threat to society .
the raf is suspected of killing 34 people before laying down its arms in 1992 .
the group officially disbanded six years later . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans mull reopening left-wing terror murder case german officials on sunday called for reopening the probe of the 1977 murder of a federal prosecutor after a former leftist radical stepped forward to say a man serving time was not involved .

this comes amid a raging debate over new revelations about the group 's terror campaign . the regional court in the southwestern city of karlsruhe approved outings with a court-appointed chaperone beginning in july for christian klar , who has been serving a life term for his role in several murders with the urban red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- guerrilla group .
klar 's attorney had issued a formal complaint after authorities in february rejected his appeal for more lenient prison conditions because he had recently made fiery anti-capitalist remarks .
in those remarks , he spoke of the " defeat of capitalism " and said europe was being ruled by an imperial alliance .
klar , who is eligible for early release in 2009 , has also appealed to german president horst köhler for clemency .
this is strongly opposed by most of the families of his victims because he has never expressed regret for the murders .
gripped by a violent history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klar is in prison in bruchsal , southern germany german media have been gripped by the former leftist militant 's fate for months , questioning whether the country is ready to draw a line under the bloody raf campaign of killings and kidnappings that shook the nation to its core .
klar was jailed for a series of killings , including the shooting of federal prosecutor siegfried buback , during the raf 's violent campaign against what it called the oppressive capitalist west german state and elite in the 1970s and early 1980s .
however , an ex-raf radical has recently come to say klar was not involved in buback 's murder and has blamed another man for the killing .
german authorities are now reviewing those claims and reports that the state was aware of testimonies in the early 1980s stating that klar was not guilty of buback 's killing .
opting for silence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mug shots of klar and former raf member mohnhaupt -lrb- r -rrb- to this day , members of the group have refused to provide information about their crimes , leaving german officials and victims ' relatives uncertain about who actually pulled the trigger in a number of high-profile cases .
former raf member peter-juergen boock , who spent 17 years in prison for his role in the group , broke that silence in a weekend interview with der spiegel newsmagazine .
he said he believed klar had driven the getaway car for the two raf members who ambushed buback in april 1977 , and suggested that german authorities had misidentified the trigger-man in the shooting .
buback was the first victim of a bloody era dubbed the " german autumn " of 1977 when he was shot in his mercedes car by a raf gunman on a motorcycle in karlsruhe .
in february , a german court ordered the release of another raf leader , brigitte mohnhaupt , after 24 years in jail on the basis that she no longer poses a threat to society .

the federal commissioner for data protection has accused the german government of " culpable neglect " in protecting data privacy .
he said the government should halt plans for greater access to phone and internet records . fundamental civil liberties in germany are increasingly under attack from state authorities and private businesses seeking to snoop into peoples ' lives , said german federal commissioner for data protection peter schaar during an annual data protection presentation in berlin on tuesday . schaar accused security officials of violating the law in their attempts to fight terror , adding that the federal criminal police office had passed on information to germany 's domestic intelligence agency - the federal office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- - that was unnecessary for its fight against terrorism . out of step with technology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commissioner schaar was displeased about government access to personal data schaar said modern technology provides plenty of opportunities for unauthorized access to personal data that had previously been protected under stringent laws .
" data protection laws have not kept up with the advance of technology , " schaar said , calling for an update of data privacy laws .
" complete surveillance is already technologically possible today . "
in addition to technology making it possible to observe people 's actions in the privacy of their homes and offices , he said " businesses can access and exploit that personal data . "
though thorough in his criticism of the government , schaar also put some of the blame for deteriorating privacy at the feet of private individuals , many of whom willing share private information . " there is an exhibitionist tendency among people themselves that makes it easy to glean specific data about them from the internet , " he said .
complaints about violations schaar warned that germany has embarked on the road to an orwellian-style surveillance state that runs counter to the principle of individual freedom and a state based on the rule of law .
the introduction of new anti-terror laws in the wake of the sept .
11 terrorist attacks on the united states , he argued , has led to a situation in which law enforcement officials and intelligence services are illegally exchanging data that should be kept separate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plans to give police automatic access to fingerprints have been scrapped in addition , the commissioner strongly criticized plans for a new law to give authorities greater access to phone and internet records and enabling authorities to access a computer 's contents without the owner 's knowledge .
schaar also criticized a government plan to store the fingerprints of all adult germans in a central database .
after intense debate within the government , german media reported tuesday that plans to store digital fingerprints had been scrapped .
fighting terrorism vs. personal freedoms proponents , including interior minister wolfgang schäuble , have argued the measures schaar criticized are needed to fight terrorism .
the anti-terror measures and wider pre-emptive police powers have met with resistance in germany , which remains particularly sensitive to state surveillance due to the legacy of the nazi regime and former east german secret police . " we must not allow the government to upset the balance between people 's right to security and their freedoms , " schaar said .
" unfortunately , i have the impression that the government is bent on tipping the scale against civil liberties .

it evokes memories of a singular triumph and a tradition of failure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " hard rock hallelujah " was the winning song in 2006 contrary to popular belief , germany is a land of dreamers .
every year , come springtime , when bees , educated fleas , lithuanians and letts start fantasizing of falling in love , germans subject themselves to tantalizing rituals of wishful thinking , childish petulance and utter masochism by posing the " big " national question : " could we - this year perhaps , or even ever again - really win the eurovision song contest ? " eurovision is a remarkable european tradition .
not only is it still the largest music event in the world , it is also a telling indicator of the changing image and notion of what europe is . in contrast to the elegant , black-tie affair which it was in the 1950s , eurovision is nowadays a celebration of gory exaggeration - a musical circus act that inspires national passions , instigates unusual political alliances and offers more surprising twists and turns than any modern-day casting show could ever hope to achieve . an international musical battlefield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : times have changed : transvestite singer verka serduchka will sing for ukraine this year it is a battlefield of musical styles in which ukrainian drag queens can perform along with spanish boy bands , israeli comedy acts , norwegian senior citizens and a host of irreparably gloomy songs from the balkans . it is also the only democratic competition in the world in which a handful of televoting monegasques and a couple of dozens of andorrans have the same influence on the outcome as millions of germans or spaniards . and it is a rare event at which eastern european voters legally get to gang up on the west and divide most of the votes among themselves . germany 's meager record germany 's path to eurovision glory has been laden with thorns rather than rose petals .
only once in the last five decades did germany actually win the competition - on april 24 , 1982 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it still fits !
nicole likes to show off her victory dress wearing a glittery black dress and playing a white guitar that screamed 80s kitsch in several languages , 17-year-old nicole won a landslide victory for the teutons by asking for " ein bisschen frieden " -lrb- a little bit of peace -rrb- at the time when the cold war was still a reality and margaret thatcher busy pursuing her argentinean military adventure in the falklands . nicole sang about being " just a girl who says what she feels " and " helpless like a bird against the wind " while europe - no matter how strange that may seem today - decided that the catholic schoolgirl look was a very in look that year , albeit , as one can now safely tell from a quarter-century distance , in a sad reject sort of way . nicole went on to sell millions of records , becoming eventually the uncrowned queen of the german schlager , the original pop-folk hybrid of the beer-garden variety that has been , much to the chagrin of iberian sophisticates , successfully exported to majorcan bars and discos catering to the german clientele as well .
good-bye , flamenco and hello , singing fräulein ! same old story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is europe ready for a retro hit from germany ?
germany won second place on four occasions and came third no less than five times , but it also came last in 2005 when a modern-day casting show product gracia failed to comprehend that she was actually supposed to sing the actual notes that the composer wrote for her . the shame of coming last two years ago is still like an open wound in the german national consciousness .
nicole , who is these days respectably 42 years old and still riding high on her historic victory , still treasures her eurovision dress and the famous white guitar .
she also likes to point out that after all these years , the dress still fits her - which is , indeed , quite an achievement . but it 's probably lonely at the top .
will any other german ever manage to join nicole on the german eurotrash olymp ?
all eyes and ears are now set on germany 's darling swinging kid roger cicero and his feminist hit " frauen regieren die welt " -lrb- women rule the world -rrb- . europe had a weird infatuation with heavy metal last year - when a scary band of noise-producing finnish vampires won against all logic and good sense - but is the old continent ready to go retro this year when representatives from 42 countries gather in helsinki in may ? in the demonically possessed world of hardcore eurovision fans , hope dies last . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nationalists , russia find ukraine 's eurovision song quite a drag ukraine 's eurovision song contest entry is causing friction at home and abroad .

by calling it a " treaty , " the current german eu presidency has begun reviving the stalled approval process for a new constitution for the union .
but not everyone is happy about the strategy . chancellor angela merkel and other german officials are currently in talks with representatives from the bloc 's other 26 members to try and hammer out an agreement before the german presidency ends at the end of june .
by leaving the word " constitution " out of the discussion , merkel hopes to get her colleagues to agree on a document that lacks the grave connotations and still manages to give the eu an improved voting system based largely on population size , a president and a foreign minister - even though they might not be called that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been discussing the idea with euroskeptics such as klaus " i consider it likely that symbolic elements like the words ' constitution ' or ' constitutional ' or the title ' foreign minister ' will not be in the new treaty , " czech negotiator jan zahradil told reuters news service after merkel met czech president vaclav klaus , a euroskeptic , last week .
" maybe the position will be there without the title of minister , " he added .
points of dispute according to zahradil , german officials have come up with 12 so-called " points of dispute " that will be the focus of any further discussions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could this dutch cow be convinced of the benefits of a treaty ?
according to diplomats cited by reuters , these points include the future of a charter of fundamental rights , which britain and the netherlands do not support .
also up for debate are plans to extend majority decision-making to justice and security issues .
german officials also want to include stronger references to energy security and climate change and give greater importance to social issues - a french request .
merkel 's efforts are backed by people such as outgoing british premier tony blair , who has been talking about a " simplified treaty " that would allow eu members to reach a swift agreement .
no mini-treaty but supporters of an eu consitution , such as belgian premier guy verhofstadt , have said that they are unwilling to back a watered-down document .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guy verhofstadt wants the real thing " we ca n't just follow the proposal of some states and wipe the slate clean of the constitutional treaty , " verhofstadt said in a speech at the egmont institute , a foreign policy think-tank , according to reuters .
" let there be no mistake : a mini-treaty is unacceptable , " he added .
it 's unlikely that merkel will be able to go beyond initial talks during her time as eu president , however : diplomats expect an intergovernmental conference to take place under the portuguese eu presidency in october , reuters reported .
a decision is not likely to come before december . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " every community needs a minimum of common orientation " in an interview with deutsche welle , norbert lammert , the president of germany 's parliament , talks about turkey and the future of the eu as well as the need for a common leading culture in europe and germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 24.04.2007 german minister urges reversal of dual citizenship policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners applying for german citizenship must relinquish their original nationality a public debate about the introduction of dual german citizenship has resurfaced after a senior social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- member demanded new incentives for foreigners to integrate into german society . ralf stegner , interior minister in the regional state of schleswig-holstein , has urged conservative chancellor angela merkel to rethink her position on dual citizenship , saying law-abiding foreigners should be given the chance to become german citizens while maintaining their original nationality .
" those foreigners who are well-integrated , speak the german language and have an income of their own should be offered german citizenship , " stegner told the weekly bild am sonntag .
" and that without the precondition of having to relinquish their original nationality first . "

but dw-radio 's miodrag soric says that wo n't prevent him from going down in history as a champion of freedom in europe . boris nikolayevich yeltsin was a courageous man .
he proved that in august 1991 when he mounted a tank in front of the so-called white house in moscow to rally resistance against an attempted coup d 'etat by members of the old soviet guard .
he risked his life for his people , helping to seal the fate of the ussr and pave the way for a democratic , post-soviet russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miodrag soric germans , in particular , have many reasons to be grateful to yeltsin .
as the first democratically elected russian president , he withdrew his country 's troops from germany .
most europeans saw yeltsin as a typically gruff , hard-drinking russian leader .
but he was also responsible for restructuring a decrepit state-run economy .
germany , under former chancellor helmut kohl , supported yeltsin 's efforts with billions of marks in cheap loans since the state yeltsin took over was essentially broke .
but money was n't always the answer to the problems faced by the world 's largest geographic nation .
yeltsin was not able to end corruption , and he did n't always make the best choices when appointing ministers and advisors .
but the reforms he undertook were unprecedented , and it would be naïve to expect that they could have come off without any mistakes .
under yeltsin , russia 's image abroad was much better than it is today .
back then the russian media was free to report on the problems facing the country .
today , the remit of most russian newspapers and tv stations is merely to applaud the policies of the kremlin .
of course , yeltsin too could be a hardliner .
in october 1993 , he ordered russian troops to fire on the country 's parliament , the duma , after its members wanted to restrict his own power .
one year later , he began the first of russia 's bloody campaigns against rebels in the province of chechnya .
and he allowed members of his family to illegal profit from his government .
nor was yeltsin a particularly good administrator .
during his term in office , contradictions between state and regional laws often made parts of the gigantic country virtually ungovernable .
yet for all his shortcomings , yeltsin will go down in history as a man of principle , as someone who - despite the lack of expert allies - strove to found both a democracy and a free-market economy in russia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 24.04.2007 opinion : a man of principle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boris yeltsin made a lot of mistakes as russia 's first democratically elected president .
but dw-radio 's miodrag soric says that wo n't prevent him from going down in history as a champion of freedom in europe . boris nikolayevich yeltsin was a courageous man .
he proved that in august 1991 when he mounted a tank in front of the so-called white house in moscow to rally resistance against an attempted coup d 'etat by members of the old soviet guard .
he risked his life for his people , helping to seal the fate of the ussr and pave the way for a democratic , post-soviet russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miodrag soric germans , in particular , have many reasons to be grateful to yeltsin .
as the first democratically elected russian president , he withdrew his country 's troops from germany .
most europeans saw yeltsin as a typically gruff , hard-drinking russian leader .
but he was also responsible for restructuring a decrepit state-run economy .
germany , under former chancellor helmut kohl , supported yeltsin 's efforts with billions of marks in cheap loans since the state yeltsin took over was essentially broke .
but money was n't always the answer to the problems faced by the world 's largest geographic nation .
yeltsin was not able to end corruption , and he did n't always make the best choices when appointing ministers and advisors .
but the reforms he undertook were unprecedented , and it would be naïve to expect that they could have come off without any mistakes .
under yeltsin , russia 's image abroad was much better than it is today .
back then the russian media was free to report on the problems facing the country .
today , the remit of most russian newspapers and tv stations is merely to applaud the policies of the kremlin .
of course , yeltsin too could be a hardliner .
in october 1993 , he ordered russian troops to fire on the country 's parliament , the duma , after its members wanted to restrict his own power .
one year later , he began the first of russia 's bloody campaigns against rebels in the province of chechnya .
and he allowed members of his family to illegal profit from his government .
nor was yeltsin a particularly good administrator .
during his term in office , contradictions between state and regional laws often made parts of the gigantic country virtually ungovernable .
yet for all his shortcomings , yeltsin will go down in history as a man of principle , as someone who - despite the lack of expert allies - strove to found both a democracy and a free-market economy in russia .
yeltsin was not afraid to stand alone in fighting for what he believed was right .

" we have made clear there will be continuity .
we are going to take things up where gleneagles ended . " one of the targets that emerged from the gleneagles summit was a promise to double development aid to africa by 2010 .

" there has been an immense amount of progress , but we know there 's a tremendous amount that has yet to be done , " blair said .
" there are far too many africans who die when their death is preventable with the right help . " annan said international efforts to aid africa needed to continue and pointed out that many of the continent 's nations broke free of their past military rulers .
the former un head is now leading the african progress panel , which is set up to monitor industrialized nations progress on reaching development targets .

dw-world.de talked to the 21-year-old about his meteoric rise and his future ambitions . dw-world.de : mario , when are we going to see you on the pitch again ? mario gomez : i ca n't say at the moment .
i 'm working up to seven hours a day to get my fitness back .
but i 'm definitely not going to rush things . before you suffered a knee injury on march 11 , everything was going great .
you were the top goal-getter in the bundesliga , stuttgart was at the top of the table , and you had made your debut in the german national team .
will you have to start from scratch ? i definitely wo n't have to start from scratch .
but it would be arrogant to think that i 'll have the same form i had before i got hurt . you teammates in stuttgart have been scoring lots of goals in your absence .
do you feel like the team needs you less ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gomez 's is one of germany 's most technically proficient strikers not at all .
i 'm happy for them .
it does n't matter who scores the goals .
the main thing is that we 're successful as a team . next season you could be playing with stuttgart in the champions league and with the german national team at euro 2008 .
are you hoping to make a name for yourself on the european stage ? if someone had told me before the start of this season that i 'd score 13 goals and play for germany , i would have laughed in his face .
i do n't like putting myself under pressure .
i just want to get healthy again and improve as a player . you 're considered a natural talent .
but how much of that is hard work ? i have some natural ability , but i also work hard on my weaknesses . what are your weaknesses ? above all : staying calm in front of the goal .

" my brother abdullah gül , with whom we established this movement -lrb- the governing justice and development party , akp -rrb- ... is the person who emerged at the end of our evaluations as the candidate to become turkey 's 11th president , " erdogan told the akp group in parliament in ankara .
" the people have seen the services that -lrb- gül -rrb- has done for his country , " erdogan also told the akp .
erdogan had been widely expected to run for the post , but the prospect sparked harsh objections from secularists .
they say the former islamist , who now describes himself as a conservative democrat , is a divisive figure with no true commitment to the mainly muslim nation 's secular system .
gul has been foreign minister since 2003 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah gul is also currently deputy prime minister the 56-year-old gül , who is also a deputy prime minister , is virtually certain to become president thanks to the comfortable majority of 353 seats that the akp holds in the 550-member parliament , which elects the president for a single , seven-year term .
he is unlikely to get the post in the first two rounds of voting , when a two-thirds majority of 367 is required , but is a shoo-in for the third or fourth round , when a simple majority of 276 suffices .
the first round is scheduled for this friday , the second for may 2 , the third for may 9 and the fourth for may 15 .
outgoing president ahmet necdet sezer 's mandate expires on may 16 .
gül is a former academic and banker who became a member of parliament in 1991 .
he and erdogan helped establish the mildly islamist akp , splitting from a group of hardliners .
the ak party was elected to government in 2002 and gül became prime minister for four months before stepping down once ak party leader erdogan secured a seat in parliament .

" my brother abdullah gül , with whom we established this movement -lrb- the governing justice and development party , akp -rrb- ... is the person who emerged at the end of our evaluations as the candidate to become turkey 's 11th president , " erdogan told the akp group in parliament in ankara .
" the people have seen the services that -lrb- gül -rrb- has done for his country , " erdogan also told the akp .
erdogan had been widely expected to run for the post , but the prospect sparked harsh objections from secularists .
they say the former islamist , who now describes himself as a conservative democrat , is a divisive figure with no true commitment to the mainly muslim nation 's secular system .
gul has been foreign minister since 2003 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah gul is also currently deputy prime minister the 56-year-old gül , who is also a deputy prime minister , is virtually certain to become president thanks to the comfortable majority of 353 seats that the akp holds in the 550-member parliament , which elects the president for a single , seven-year term .
he is unlikely to get the post in the first two rounds of voting , when a two-thirds majority of 367 is required , but is a shoo-in for the third or fourth round , when a simple majority of 276 suffices .

the 24-year old german-born turk was a prisoner in guantanamo bay and the subject of a legal battle with the german government of the time , who , according to kurnaz , failed to secure his release when they had the chance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us was prepared to release kurnaz from guantanamo in 2002 his memoir , entitled " five years of my life , " which hit german bookstands on tuesday , paints a disturbing picture of kurnaz ' ordeal . " i understood a long time ago what this prison was about , " kurnaz said .
" they could do with us whatever they wanted . " kurnaz was arrested in pakistan shortly after the sept .
11 attacks on the united states .
kurnaz insists he did n't travel to pakistan to fight alongside al qaeda , but rather to work for an islamic " salvation army " to help the homeless , among others .
kurnaz claims he was " sold " to us soldiers by unscrupulous bounty hunters .
he was then taken to afghanistan , where he faced torturous interrogations . no help from germany according to his own account , kurnaz was left for days to hang by his hands that were tied behind his back and that were attached to electrodes .
he hoped in vain that the german authorities would help him out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily said the german government did what it had to do to protect its citizens " one of the german soldiers came , pulled my head up and asked if i knew who they were , " kurnaz said .
" he said they were the elite force , the ksk , and slammed my head on the floor .
later another one came up and kicked me and the group of soldiers started laughing . " kurnaz was subsequently transported to guantanamo .
in the book , he accuses the us soldiers there of gross maltreatment .
he describes how doctors would make unnecessary amputations and how guards would hand out regular beatings .
kurnaz himself spent over a year in solitary confinement , suffering from extreme cold , heat , darkness and oxygen deprivation . " i never imagined i would come out of it alive , " kurnaz said .
" i presumed i could die at any minute .
i was often unconscious due to the pain and the cold .
my body could n't take any more . " personal intervention # b # it was n't until august 2006 that the newly elected chancellor angela merkel intervened personally to secure kurnaz ' release from guantanamo .
the us was reportedly prepared to release him as early as 2002 , but the germans were allegedly reluctant to allow him to return to germany at the time - a fact that sparked uproar and prompted a parliamentary inquiry . the question whether kurnaz did represent a terror threat and whether the government of the time should have done more to free him is the subject of an ongoing investigation .
according to former interior minister otto schily , however , the social democratic-green party government coalition headed by gerhard schröder responded adequately to the situation . " we have a responsibility for the safety of our citizens , " schily said .
" and that includes keeping people out of our country who represent a danger to our security .
and that was the case with murat kurnaz . " now back in his home city of bremen , kurnaz says he just wants to get on with his life .
he says the book is not intended to settle any scores , but rather to tell the world how his co-prisoners lost their legs , hands and lives in guantanamo bay . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : steinmeier 's record is blemished germany 's foreign minister has denied he caused an innocent german-born turk to be imprisoned for years at the us guantanamo bay prison .

i was often unconscious due to the pain and the cold .
my body could n't take any more . " personal intervention # b # it was n't until august 2006 that the newly elected chancellor angela merkel intervened personally to secure kurnaz ' release from guantanamo .
the us was reportedly prepared to release him as early as 2002 , but the germans were allegedly reluctant to allow him to return to germany at the time - a fact that sparked uproar and prompted a parliamentary inquiry . the question whether kurnaz did represent a terror threat and whether the government of the time should have done more to free him is the subject of an ongoing investigation .
according to former interior minister otto schily , however , the social democratic-green party government coalition headed by gerhard schröder responded adequately to the situation . " we have a responsibility for the safety of our citizens , " schily said .
" and that includes keeping people out of our country who represent a danger to our security .
and that was the case with murat kurnaz . " now back in his home city of bremen , kurnaz says he just wants to get on with his life .

this comes amid a raging debate over new revelations about the group 's terror campaign . the regional court in the southwestern city of karlsruhe approved outings with a court-appointed chaperone beginning in july for christian klar , who has been serving a life term for his role in several murders with the urban red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- guerrilla group .
klar 's attorney had issued a formal complaint after authorities in february rejected his appeal for more lenient prison conditions because he had recently made fiery anti-capitalist remarks .
in those remarks , he spoke of the " defeat of capitalism " and said europe was being ruled by an imperial alliance .
klar , who is eligible for early release in 2009 , has also appealed to german president horst köhler for clemency .
this is strongly opposed by most of the families of his victims because he has never expressed regret for the murders .
gripped by a violent history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klar is in prison in bruchsal , southern germany german media have been gripped by the former leftist militant 's fate for months , questioning whether the country is ready to draw a line under the bloody raf campaign of killings and kidnappings that shook the nation to its core .
klar was jailed for a series of killings , including the shooting of federal prosecutor siegfried buback , during the raf 's violent campaign against what it called the oppressive capitalist west german state and elite in the 1970s and early 1980s .
however , an ex-raf radical has recently come to say klar was not involved in buback 's murder and has blamed another man for the killing .
german authorities are now reviewing those claims and reports that the state was aware of testimonies in the early 1980s stating that klar was not guilty of buback 's killing .
opting for silence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mug shots of klar and former raf member mohnhaupt -lrb- r -rrb- to this day , members of the group have refused to provide information about their crimes , leaving german officials and victims ' relatives uncertain about who actually pulled the trigger in a number of high-profile cases .
former raf member peter-juergen boock , who spent 17 years in prison for his role in the group , broke that silence in a weekend interview with der spiegel newsmagazine .
he said he believed klar had driven the getaway car for the two raf members who ambushed buback in april 1977 , and suggested that german authorities had misidentified the trigger-man in the shooting .
buback was the first victim of a bloody era dubbed the " german autumn " of 1977 when he was shot in his mercedes car by a raf gunman on a motorcycle in karlsruhe .
in february , a german court ordered the release of another raf leader , brigitte mohnhaupt , after 24 years in jail on the basis that she no longer poses a threat to society .

the board is expected to confirm that announcement on wednesday .

the federal commissioner for data protection has accused the german government of " culpable neglect " in protecting data privacy .
he said the government should halt plans for greater access to phone and internet records . fundamental civil liberties in germany are increasingly under attack from state authorities and private businesses seeking to snoop into peoples ' lives , said german federal commissioner for data protection peter schaar during an annual data protection presentation in berlin on tuesday . schaar accused security officials of violating the law in their attempts to fight terror , adding that the federal criminal police office had passed on information to germany 's domestic intelligence agency - the federal office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- - that was unnecessary for its fight against terrorism . out of step with technology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commissioner schaar was displeased about government access to personal data schaar said modern technology provides plenty of opportunities for unauthorized access to personal data that had previously been protected under stringent laws .
" data protection laws have not kept up with the advance of technology , " schaar said , calling for an update of data privacy laws .
" complete surveillance is already technologically possible today . "
in addition to technology making it possible to observe people 's actions in the privacy of their homes and offices , he said " businesses can access and exploit that personal data . "
though thorough in his criticism of the government , schaar also put some of the blame for deteriorating privacy at the feet of private individuals , many of whom willing share private information . " there is an exhibitionist tendency among people themselves that makes it easy to glean specific data about them from the internet , " he said .

schaar also criticized a government plan to store the fingerprints of all adult germans in a central database .
after intense debate within the government , german media reported tuesday that plans to store digital fingerprints had been scrapped .
fighting terrorism vs. personal freedoms proponents , including interior minister wolfgang schäuble , have argued the measures schaar criticized are needed to fight terrorism .
the anti-terror measures and wider pre-emptive police powers have met with resistance in germany , which remains particularly sensitive to state surveillance due to the legacy of the nazi regime and former east german secret police .

schaar also criticized a government plan to store the fingerprints of all adult germans in a central database .
after intense debate within the government , german media reported tuesday that plans to store digital fingerprints had been scrapped .
fighting terrorism vs. personal freedoms proponents , including interior minister wolfgang schäuble , have argued the measures schaar criticized are needed to fight terrorism .
the anti-terror measures and wider pre-emptive police powers have met with resistance in germany , which remains particularly sensitive to state surveillance due to the legacy of the nazi regime and former east german secret police . " we must not allow the government to upset the balance between people 's right to security and their freedoms , " schaar said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 24.04.2007 germans bank on " treaty " to replace doomed eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will europeans find it easier to swallow a treaty or a constitution ?
by calling it a " treaty , " the current german eu presidency has begun reviving the stalled approval process for a new constitution for the union .
but not everyone is happy about the strategy . chancellor angela merkel and other german officials are currently in talks with representatives from the bloc 's other 26 members to try and hammer out an agreement before the german presidency ends at the end of june .
by leaving the word " constitution " out of the discussion , merkel hopes to get her colleagues to agree on a document that lacks the grave connotations and still manages to give the eu an improved voting system based largely on population size , a president and a foreign minister - even though they might not be called that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been discussing the idea with euroskeptics such as klaus " i consider it likely that symbolic elements like the words ' constitution ' or ' constitutional ' or the title ' foreign minister ' will not be in the new treaty , " czech negotiator jan zahradil told reuters news service after merkel met czech president vaclav klaus , a euroskeptic , last week .
" maybe the position will be there without the title of minister , " he added .
points of dispute according to zahradil , german officials have come up with 12 so-called " points of dispute " that will be the focus of any further discussions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could this dutch cow be convinced of the benefits of a treaty ?
according to diplomats cited by reuters , these points include the future of a charter of fundamental rights , which britain and the netherlands do not support .
also up for debate are plans to extend majority decision-making to justice and security issues .
german officials also want to include stronger references to energy security and climate change and give greater importance to social issues - a french request .
merkel 's efforts are backed by people such as outgoing british premier tony blair , who has been talking about a " simplified treaty " that would allow eu members to reach a swift agreement .
no mini-treaty but supporters of an eu consitution , such as belgian premier guy verhofstadt , have said that they are unwilling to back a watered-down document .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guy verhofstadt wants the real thing " we ca n't just follow the proposal of some states and wipe the slate clean of the constitutional treaty , " verhofstadt said in a speech at the egmont institute , a foreign policy think-tank , according to reuters .
" let there be no mistake : a mini-treaty is unacceptable , " he added .
it 's unlikely that merkel will be able to go beyond initial talks during her time as eu president , however : diplomats expect an intergovernmental conference to take place under the portuguese eu presidency in october , reuters reported .
a decision is not likely to come before december . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " every community needs a minimum of common orientation " in an interview with deutsche welle , norbert lammert , the president of germany 's parliament , talks about turkey and the future of the eu as well as the need for a common leading culture in europe and germany .

by calling it a " treaty , " the current german eu presidency has begun reviving the stalled approval process for a new constitution for the union .
but not everyone is happy about the strategy . chancellor angela merkel and other german officials are currently in talks with representatives from the bloc 's other 26 members to try and hammer out an agreement before the german presidency ends at the end of june .
by leaving the word " constitution " out of the discussion , merkel hopes to get her colleagues to agree on a document that lacks the grave connotations and still manages to give the eu an improved voting system based largely on population size , a president and a foreign minister - even though they might not be called that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been discussing the idea with euroskeptics such as klaus " i consider it likely that symbolic elements like the words ' constitution ' or ' constitutional ' or the title ' foreign minister ' will not be in the new treaty , " czech negotiator jan zahradil told reuters news service after merkel met czech president vaclav klaus , a euroskeptic , last week .
" maybe the position will be there without the title of minister , " he added .
points of dispute according to zahradil , german officials have come up with 12 so-called " points of dispute " that will be the focus of any further discussions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could this dutch cow be convinced of the benefits of a treaty ?
according to diplomats cited by reuters , these points include the future of a charter of fundamental rights , which britain and the netherlands do not support .
also up for debate are plans to extend majority decision-making to justice and security issues .
german officials also want to include stronger references to energy security and climate change and give greater importance to social issues - a french request .
merkel 's efforts are backed by people such as outgoing british premier tony blair , who has been talking about a " simplified treaty " that would allow eu members to reach a swift agreement .
no mini-treaty but supporters of an eu consitution , such as belgian premier guy verhofstadt , have said that they are unwilling to back a watered-down document .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guy verhofstadt wants the real thing " we ca n't just follow the proposal of some states and wipe the slate clean of the constitutional treaty , " verhofstadt said in a speech at the egmont institute , a foreign policy think-tank , according to reuters .
" let there be no mistake : a mini-treaty is unacceptable , " he added .
it 's unlikely that merkel will be able to go beyond initial talks during her time as eu president , however : diplomats expect an intergovernmental conference to take place under the portuguese eu presidency in october , reuters reported .
a decision is not likely to come before december . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " every community needs a minimum of common orientation " in an interview with deutsche welle , norbert lammert , the president of germany 's parliament , talks about turkey and the future of the eu as well as the need for a common leading culture in europe and germany .

" we can not stagnate now , " said merkel , who currently holds the presidency of both the g8 and european union , titles that lend her a wide degree of international agenda-setting power .
" we have made clear there will be continuity .
we are going to take things up where gleneagles ended . " one of the targets that emerged from the gleneagles summit was a promise to double development aid to africa by 2010 .

" there has been an immense amount of progress , but we know there 's a tremendous amount that has yet to be done , " blair said .
" there are far too many africans who die when their death is preventable with the right help . " annan said international efforts to aid africa needed to continue and pointed out that many of the continent 's nations broke free of their past military rulers .
the former un head is now leading the african progress panel , which is set up to monitor industrialized nations progress on reaching development targets .

" it 's fairly obvious that in europe there are different perspectives and different positions , " the outgoing prime minister said .
" we 've got to see whether it 's possible to reach agreement to allow europe to work effectively and move forward .

by calling it a " treaty , " the current german eu presidency has begun reviving the stalled approval process for a new constitution for the union .
but not everyone is happy about the strategy . chancellor angela merkel and other german officials are currently in talks with representatives from the bloc 's other 26 members to try and hammer out an agreement before the german presidency ends at the end of june .
by leaving the word " constitution " out of the discussion , merkel hopes to get her colleagues to agree on a document that lacks the grave connotations and still manages to give the eu an improved voting system based largely on population size , a president and a foreign minister - even though they might not be called that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been discussing the idea with euroskeptics such as klaus " i consider it likely that symbolic elements like the words ' constitution ' or ' constitutional ' or the title ' foreign minister ' will not be in the new treaty , " czech negotiator jan zahradil told reuters news service after merkel met czech president vaclav klaus , a euroskeptic , last week .
" maybe the position will be there without the title of minister , " he added .
points of dispute according to zahradil , german officials have come up with 12 so-called " points of dispute " that will be the focus of any further discussions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could this dutch cow be convinced of the benefits of a treaty ?
according to diplomats cited by reuters , these points include the future of a charter of fundamental rights , which britain and the netherlands do not support .
also up for debate are plans to extend majority decision-making to justice and security issues .
german officials also want to include stronger references to energy security and climate change and give greater importance to social issues - a french request .
merkel 's efforts are backed by people such as outgoing british premier tony blair , who has been talking about a " simplified treaty " that would allow eu members to reach a swift agreement .
no mini-treaty but supporters of an eu consitution , such as belgian premier guy verhofstadt , have said that they are unwilling to back a watered-down document .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guy verhofstadt wants the real thing " we ca n't just follow the proposal of some states and wipe the slate clean of the constitutional treaty , " verhofstadt said in a speech at the egmont institute , a foreign policy think-tank , according to reuters .
" let there be no mistake : a mini-treaty is unacceptable , " he added .
it 's unlikely that merkel will be able to go beyond initial talks during her time as eu president , however : diplomats expect an intergovernmental conference to take place under the portuguese eu presidency in october , reuters reported .

according to a survey conducted for the german transport ministry , over 80 percent of drivers on german roads say other drivers have become increasingly rude , and the government has decided to take action . the people polled said drivers are more inconsiderate than they used to be , with women and older drivers feeling particularly annoyed by impolite drivers and those who drive very fast , the transport ministry 's survey showed . germany is famed for its fast cars and high speed highways - the autobahn , stretches of which do not have speed limits . the country even attracts international auto-tourists , who book special vacation packages to enjoy the freedom of driving as fast as they want . off the autobahn , germans unhappy on the road bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new safety campaign aims to get people to be more polite on highways and other roads it 's not so much road rage that is getting on everyone 's nerves , as " road rudeness . "
germany 's transport minister wolfgang tiefensee said the results of the poll are a warning signal , adding that action needed to be taken soon . tiefensee has launched a new campaign encouraging people more consideration to fellow drivers .
to kick off global road safety week , tiefensee unveiled a poster in berlin on this week bearing the slogan : " do you have strength of character ?
drive responsibly . " some 800 posters will go up on billboards along highways around the country .
one of the faces of the campaign is high-profile german soccer international philipp lahm .

they are also the drivers involved in or responsible for serious or fatal accidents in disproportionately high numbers . over 1,000 out of 5,000 people who died in traffic accidents in 2005 were young drivers .
drivers between 18 and 25 years old make up over 30 percent of alcohol-related accidents . tiefensee also said stricter drinking limits are now in place for new drivers .
a new law to go into effect at the end of the summer bans any drinking for drivers in their first two years . harsh penalties to send a message offenders caught with traces of alcohol in their blood will face a fine of 125 euros -lrb- $ 160 -rrb- and have their names registered in an index of traffic offenders .
in addition , they will have their license probation period extended by four years and will have to complete a course on behavior in traffic at a cost of 450 euros . for drivers who 've had their licenses for longer than two years , a blood alcohol limit of 0.5 milligrams per milliliter of blood will apply .

the federal commissioner for data protection has accused the german government of " culpable neglect " in protecting data privacy .
he said the government should halt plans for greater access to phone and internet records . fundamental civil liberties in germany are increasingly under attack from state authorities and private businesses seeking to snoop into peoples ' lives , said german federal commissioner for data protection peter schaar during an annual data protection presentation in berlin on tuesday . schaar accused security officials of violating the law in their attempts to fight terror , adding that the federal criminal police office had passed on information to germany 's domestic intelligence agency - the federal office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- - that was unnecessary for its fight against terrorism . out of step with technology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commissioner schaar was displeased about government access to personal data schaar said modern technology provides plenty of opportunities for unauthorized access to personal data that had previously been protected under stringent laws .
" data protection laws have not kept up with the advance of technology , " schaar said , calling for an update of data privacy laws .
" complete surveillance is already technologically possible today . "
in addition to technology making it possible to observe people 's actions in the privacy of their homes and offices , he said " businesses can access and exploit that personal data . "
though thorough in his criticism of the government , schaar also put some of the blame for deteriorating privacy at the feet of private individuals , many of whom willing share private information . " there is an exhibitionist tendency among people themselves that makes it easy to glean specific data about them from the internet , " he said .

schaar also criticized a government plan to store the fingerprints of all adult germans in a central database .
after intense debate within the government , german media reported tuesday that plans to store digital fingerprints had been scrapped .
fighting terrorism vs. personal freedoms proponents , including interior minister wolfgang schäuble , have argued the measures schaar criticized are needed to fight terrorism .
the anti-terror measures and wider pre-emptive police powers have met with resistance in germany , which remains particularly sensitive to state surveillance due to the legacy of the nazi regime and former east german secret police . " we must not allow the government to upset the balance between people 's right to security and their freedoms , " schaar said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 24.04.2007 imprisoned german terrorist receives day-outing ops großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former raf terrorist christian klar a german court on tuesday granted prison day releases to a former red army faction militant after 24 years of imprisonment .
this comes amid a raging debate over new revelations about the group 's terror campaign . the regional court in the southwestern city of karlsruhe approved outings with a court-appointed chaperone beginning in july for christian klar , who has been serving a life term for his role in several murders with the urban red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- guerrilla group .
klar 's attorney had issued a formal complaint after authorities in february rejected his appeal for more lenient prison conditions because he had recently made fiery anti-capitalist remarks .
in those remarks , he spoke of the " defeat of capitalism " and said europe was being ruled by an imperial alliance .
klar , who is eligible for early release in 2009 , has also appealed to german president horst köhler for clemency .
this is strongly opposed by most of the families of his victims because he has never expressed regret for the murders .
gripped by a violent history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klar is in prison in bruchsal , southern germany german media have been gripped by the former leftist militant 's fate for months , questioning whether the country is ready to draw a line under the bloody raf campaign of killings and kidnappings that shook the nation to its core .
klar was jailed for a series of killings , including the shooting of federal prosecutor siegfried buback , during the raf 's violent campaign against what it called the oppressive capitalist west german state and elite in the 1970s and early 1980s .
however , an ex-raf radical has recently come to say klar was not involved in buback 's murder and has blamed another man for the killing .
german authorities are now reviewing those claims and reports that the state was aware of testimonies in the early 1980s stating that klar was not guilty of buback 's killing .
opting for silence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mug shots of klar and former raf member mohnhaupt -lrb- r -rrb- to this day , members of the group have refused to provide information about their crimes , leaving german officials and victims ' relatives uncertain about who actually pulled the trigger in a number of high-profile cases .
former raf member peter-juergen boock , who spent 17 years in prison for his role in the group , broke that silence in a weekend interview with der spiegel newsmagazine .
he said he believed klar had driven the getaway car for the two raf members who ambushed buback in april 1977 , and suggested that german authorities had misidentified the trigger-man in the shooting .
buback was the first victim of a bloody era dubbed the " german autumn " of 1977 when he was shot in his mercedes car by a raf gunman on a motorcycle in karlsruhe .
in february , a german court ordered the release of another raf leader , brigitte mohnhaupt , after 24 years in jail on the basis that she no longer poses a threat to society .
the raf is suspected of killing 34 people before laying down its arms in 1992 .
the group officially disbanded six years later . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans mull reopening left-wing terror murder case german officials on sunday called for reopening the probe of the 1977 murder of a federal prosecutor after a former leftist radical stepped forward to say a man serving time was not involved .

klar was jailed for a series of killings , including the shooting of federal prosecutor siegfried buback , during the raf 's violent campaign against what it called the oppressive capitalist west german state and elite in the 1970s and early 1980s .
however , an ex-raf radical has recently come to say klar was not involved in buback 's murder and has blamed another man for the killing .

former raf member peter-juergen boock , who spent 17 years in prison for his role in the group , broke that silence in a weekend interview with der spiegel newsmagazine .
he said he believed klar had driven the getaway car for the two raf members who ambushed buback in april 1977 , and suggested that german authorities had misidentified the trigger-man in the shooting .
buback was the first victim of a bloody era dubbed the " german autumn " of 1977 when he was shot in his mercedes car by a raf gunman on a motorcycle in karlsruhe .
in february , a german court ordered the release of another raf leader , brigitte mohnhaupt , after 24 years in jail on the basis that she no longer poses a threat to society .

the 24-year old german-born turk was a prisoner in guantanamo bay and the subject of a legal battle with the german government of the time , who , according to kurnaz , failed to secure his release when they had the chance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us was prepared to release kurnaz from guantanamo in 2002 his memoir , entitled " five years of my life , " which hit german bookstands on tuesday , paints a disturbing picture of kurnaz ' ordeal . " i understood a long time ago what this prison was about , " kurnaz said .
" they could do with us whatever they wanted . " kurnaz was arrested in pakistan shortly after the sept .
11 attacks on the united states .
kurnaz insists he did n't travel to pakistan to fight alongside al qaeda , but rather to work for an islamic " salvation army " to help the homeless , among others .
kurnaz claims he was " sold " to us soldiers by unscrupulous bounty hunters .
he was then taken to afghanistan , where he faced torturous interrogations . no help from germany according to his own account , kurnaz was left for days to hang by his hands that were tied behind his back and that were attached to electrodes .
he hoped in vain that the german authorities would help him out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily said the german government did what it had to do to protect its citizens " one of the german soldiers came , pulled my head up and asked if i knew who they were , " kurnaz said .
" he said they were the elite force , the ksk , and slammed my head on the floor .
later another one came up and kicked me and the group of soldiers started laughing . " kurnaz was subsequently transported to guantanamo .
in the book , he accuses the us soldiers there of gross maltreatment .
he describes how doctors would make unnecessary amputations and how guards would hand out regular beatings .
kurnaz himself spent over a year in solitary confinement , suffering from extreme cold , heat , darkness and oxygen deprivation . " i never imagined i would come out of it alive , " kurnaz said .
" i presumed i could die at any minute .
i was often unconscious due to the pain and the cold .
my body could n't take any more . " personal intervention # b # it was n't until august 2006 that the newly elected chancellor angela merkel intervened personally to secure kurnaz ' release from guantanamo .
the us was reportedly prepared to release him as early as 2002 , but the germans were allegedly reluctant to allow him to return to germany at the time - a fact that sparked uproar and prompted a parliamentary inquiry . the question whether kurnaz did represent a terror threat and whether the government of the time should have done more to free him is the subject of an ongoing investigation .
according to former interior minister otto schily , however , the social democratic-green party government coalition headed by gerhard schröder responded adequately to the situation . " we have a responsibility for the safety of our citizens , " schily said .
" and that includes keeping people out of our country who represent a danger to our security .
and that was the case with murat kurnaz . " now back in his home city of bremen , kurnaz says he just wants to get on with his life .
he says the book is not intended to settle any scores , but rather to tell the world how his co-prisoners lost their legs , hands and lives in guantanamo bay . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : steinmeier 's record is blemished germany 's foreign minister has denied he caused an innocent german-born turk to be imprisoned for years at the us guantanamo bay prison .

you were the top goal-getter in the bundesliga , stuttgart was at the top of the table , and you had made your debut in the german national team .

" those foreigners who are well-integrated , speak the german language and have an income of their own should be offered german citizenship , " stegner told the weekly bild am sonntag .
" and that without the precondition of having to relinquish their original nationality first . "
latest available statistics show that in 2005 only about 110,000 foreigners applied to become german nationals - a drop by almost 60 percent compared with the year 2000 when figures peaked in postwar germany .

current laws , they say , are a slap in the face especially of turks here who have strong links to their country and religion .
" certainly , the more muslims have a german passport the better they know who to vote for , " said abdul hadi hoffmann , deputy head of the berlin-based muslim academy .
" so we do encourage muslims to participate in german society and politics , " he added .
" however , if someone decides to lead his family life , earn a living and not spend his evenings in a bar drinking beer , this is not a sign of isolation and of being against the german state . "
the debate unleashed by germany 's social democrats comes at a time when less turkish nationals living in germany opt to become citizens of their host country .
this number has dropped by amore than half recently from 103,000 applicants in 1999 to merely 44,000 last year .

according to a survey conducted for the german transport ministry , over 80 percent of drivers on german roads say other drivers have become increasingly rude , and the government has decided to take action . the people polled said drivers are more inconsiderate than they used to be , with women and older drivers feeling particularly annoyed by impolite drivers and those who drive very fast , the transport ministry 's survey showed . germany is famed for its fast cars and high speed highways - the autobahn , stretches of which do not have speed limits . the country even attracts international auto-tourists , who book special vacation packages to enjoy the freedom of driving as fast as they want . off the autobahn , germans unhappy on the road bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new safety campaign aims to get people to be more polite on highways and other roads it 's not so much road rage that is getting on everyone 's nerves , as " road rudeness . "
germany 's transport minister wolfgang tiefensee said the results of the poll are a warning signal , adding that action needed to be taken soon . tiefensee has launched a new campaign encouraging people more consideration to fellow drivers .
to kick off global road safety week , tiefensee unveiled a poster in berlin on this week bearing the slogan : " do you have strength of character ?
drive responsibly . " some 800 posters will go up on billboards along highways around the country .
one of the faces of the campaign is high-profile german soccer international philipp lahm .
in using celebrities to present their message , the ministry is hoping to get through to young drivers in particular . new drivers are dangerous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower blood-alcohol limits will apply to new drivers the transport ministry study showed young men who have just received their driver 's licenses are primarily responsible for the increasing aggression on the road .
they are also the drivers involved in or responsible for serious or fatal accidents in disproportionately high numbers . over 1,000 out of 5,000 people who died in traffic accidents in 2005 were young drivers .
drivers between 18 and 25 years old make up over 30 percent of alcohol-related accidents . tiefensee also said stricter drinking limits are now in place for new drivers .
a new law to go into effect at the end of the summer bans any drinking for drivers in their first two years . harsh penalties to send a message offenders caught with traces of alcohol in their blood will face a fine of 125 euros -lrb- $ 160 -rrb- and have their names registered in an index of traffic offenders .
in addition , they will have their license probation period extended by four years and will have to complete a course on behavior in traffic at a cost of 450 euros . for drivers who 've had their licenses for longer than two years , a blood alcohol limit of 0.5 milligrams per milliliter of blood will apply .

" my brother abdullah gül , with whom we established this movement -lrb- the governing justice and development party , akp -rrb- ... is the person who emerged at the end of our evaluations as the candidate to become turkey 's 11th president , " erdogan told the akp group in parliament in ankara .
" the people have seen the services that -lrb- gül -rrb- has done for his country , " erdogan also told the akp .
erdogan had been widely expected to run for the post , but the prospect sparked harsh objections from secularists .
they say the former islamist , who now describes himself as a conservative democrat , is a divisive figure with no true commitment to the mainly muslim nation 's secular system .
gul has been foreign minister since 2003 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah gul is also currently deputy prime minister the 56-year-old gül , who is also a deputy prime minister , is virtually certain to become president thanks to the comfortable majority of 353 seats that the akp holds in the 550-member parliament , which elects the president for a single , seven-year term .
he is unlikely to get the post in the first two rounds of voting , when a two-thirds majority of 367 is required , but is a shoo-in for the third or fourth round , when a simple majority of 276 suffices .
the first round is scheduled for this friday , the second for may 2 , the third for may 9 and the fourth for may 15 .
outgoing president ahmet necdet sezer 's mandate expires on may 16 .
gül is a former academic and banker who became a member of parliament in 1991 .
he and erdogan helped establish the mildly islamist akp , splitting from a group of hardliners .
the ak party was elected to government in 2002 and gül became prime minister for four months before stepping down once ak party leader erdogan secured a seat in parliament .
gül has served as foreign minister since march 2003 . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " every community needs a minimum of common orientation " in an interview with deutsche welle , norbert lammert , the president of germany 's parliament , talks about turkey and the future of the eu as well as the need for a common leading culture in europe and germany .

in the wake of recent scandals , some have called for change at the very top . company numbers , including a 51 percent increase in first-quarter earnings , are good , but they may not be enough to save kleinfeld 's job . ahead of the supervisory board 's meeting on wednesday , siemens refused to comment on whether it would renew the ceo 's contract , which expires on sept .

the board is expected to confirm that announcement on wednesday .
von pierer is to be replaced by german steel giant thyssenkrupp chairman gerhard cromme . on tuesday , it was reported that linde ceo wolfgang reitzle had been approached about possibly succeeding kleinfeld .

" it 's fairly obvious that in europe there are different perspectives and different positions , " the outgoing prime minister said .
" we 've got to see whether it 's possible to reach agreement to allow europe to work effectively and move forward .

" we can not stagnate now , " said merkel , who currently holds the presidency of both the g8 and european union , titles that lend her a wide degree of international agenda-setting power .
" we have made clear there will be continuity .
we are going to take things up where gleneagles ended . " one of the targets that emerged from the gleneagles summit was a promise to double development aid to africa by 2010 .

" there are far too many africans who die when their death is preventable with the right help . " annan said international efforts to aid africa needed to continue and pointed out that many of the continent 's nations broke free of their past military rulers .
the former un head is now leading the african progress panel , which is set up to monitor industrialized nations progress on reaching development targets .

it evokes memories of a singular triumph and a tradition of failure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " hard rock hallelujah " was the winning song in 2006 contrary to popular belief , germany is a land of dreamers .
every year , come springtime , when bees , educated fleas , lithuanians and letts start fantasizing of falling in love , germans subject themselves to tantalizing rituals of wishful thinking , childish petulance and utter masochism by posing the " big " national question : " could we - this year perhaps , or even ever again - really win the eurovision song contest ? " eurovision is a remarkable european tradition .
not only is it still the largest music event in the world , it is also a telling indicator of the changing image and notion of what europe is . in contrast to the elegant , black-tie affair which it was in the 1950s , eurovision is nowadays a celebration of gory exaggeration - a musical circus act that inspires national passions , instigates unusual political alliances and offers more surprising twists and turns than any modern-day casting show could ever hope to achieve . an international musical battlefield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : times have changed : transvestite singer verka serduchka will sing for ukraine this year it is a battlefield of musical styles in which ukrainian drag queens can perform along with spanish boy bands , israeli comedy acts , norwegian senior citizens and a host of irreparably gloomy songs from the balkans . it is also the only democratic competition in the world in which a handful of televoting monegasques and a couple of dozens of andorrans have the same influence on the outcome as millions of germans or spaniards . and it is a rare event at which eastern european voters legally get to gang up on the west and divide most of the votes among themselves . germany 's meager record germany 's path to eurovision glory has been laden with thorns rather than rose petals .
only once in the last five decades did germany actually win the competition - on april 24 , 1982 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it still fits !
nicole likes to show off her victory dress wearing a glittery black dress and playing a white guitar that screamed 80s kitsch in several languages , 17-year-old nicole won a landslide victory for the teutons by asking for " ein bisschen frieden " -lrb- a little bit of peace -rrb- at the time when the cold war was still a reality and margaret thatcher busy pursuing her argentinean military adventure in the falklands . nicole sang about being " just a girl who says what she feels " and " helpless like a bird against the wind " while europe - no matter how strange that may seem today - decided that the catholic schoolgirl look was a very in look that year , albeit , as one can now safely tell from a quarter-century distance , in a sad reject sort of way . nicole went on to sell millions of records , becoming eventually the uncrowned queen of the german schlager , the original pop-folk hybrid of the beer-garden variety that has been , much to the chagrin of iberian sophisticates , successfully exported to majorcan bars and discos catering to the german clientele as well .
good-bye , flamenco and hello , singing fräulein ! same old story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is europe ready for a retro hit from germany ?
germany won second place on four occasions and came third no less than five times , but it also came last in 2005 when a modern-day casting show product gracia failed to comprehend that she was actually supposed to sing the actual notes that the composer wrote for her . the shame of coming last two years ago is still like an open wound in the german national consciousness .
nicole , who is these days respectably 42 years old and still riding high on her historic victory , still treasures her eurovision dress and the famous white guitar .
she also likes to point out that after all these years , the dress still fits her - which is , indeed , quite an achievement . but it 's probably lonely at the top .
will any other german ever manage to join nicole on the german eurotrash olymp ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 24.04.2007 german minister urges reversal of dual citizenship policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners applying for german citizenship must relinquish their original nationality a public debate about the introduction of dual german citizenship has resurfaced after a senior social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- member demanded new incentives for foreigners to integrate into german society . ralf stegner , interior minister in the regional state of schleswig-holstein , has urged conservative chancellor angela merkel to rethink her position on dual citizenship , saying law-abiding foreigners should be given the chance to become german citizens while maintaining their original nationality .
" those foreigners who are well-integrated , speak the german language and have an income of their own should be offered german citizenship , " stegner told the weekly bild am sonntag .
" and that without the precondition of having to relinquish their original nationality first . "
latest available statistics show that in 2005 only about 110,000 foreigners applied to become german nationals - a drop by almost 60 percent compared with the year 2000 when figures peaked in postwar germany .
at that time the previous spd-led government made it easier for germany 's four million foreigners to become citizens of this country .
conservative backlash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf stegner wants to make it easier for foreigners to become german citizens the introduction of dual citizenship , however , was prevented by the country 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
a nationwide signature campaign spearheaded by cdu state premier roland koch stopped a more far-reaching citizenship reform .
the powerful regional leader is again stonewalling against softening citizenship laws .
" the conditions for granting german citizenship must remain crystal clear , " koch said .
" the majority population must be sure that applicants integrate and accept german life as it is .
citizenship is a manifestation that should not be made easy and dual citizenship must remain an exception rather than the rule . "
bloodlines and ethnicity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservatives such as roland koch are generally opposed to a far-reaching citizenship reform nationality in germany is still largely based on bloodlines .
critics denounce this arguing that ethnic germans from the former soviet union who know just little about life here automatically receive citizenship while children of immigrants born in germany are technically foreigners .
current laws , they say , are a slap in the face especially of turks here who have strong links to their country and religion .
" certainly , the more muslims have a german passport the better they know who to vote for , " said abdul hadi hoffmann , deputy head of the berlin-based muslim academy .
" so we do encourage muslims to participate in german society and politics , " he added .
" however , if someone decides to lead his family life , earn a living and not spend his evenings in a bar drinking beer , this is not a sign of isolation and of being against the german state . "
the debate unleashed by germany 's social democrats comes at a time when less turkish nationals living in germany opt to become citizens of their host country .
this number has dropped by amore than half recently from 103,000 applicants in 1999 to merely 44,000 last year .
politicians like ralf stegner fear that this is a sign of germany 's largest immigrant community - boasting 3.5 million people - is gradually retreating from mainstream society . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " every community needs a minimum of common orientation " in an interview with deutsche welle , norbert lammert , the president of germany 's parliament , talks about turkey and the future of the eu as well as the need for a common leading culture in europe and germany .

in the wake of recent scandals , some have called for change at the very top . company numbers , including a 51 percent increase in first-quarter earnings , are good , but they may not be enough to save kleinfeld 's job . ahead of the supervisory board 's meeting on wednesday , siemens refused to comment on whether it would renew the ceo 's contract , which expires on sept .
30 . but various news agencies have reported that some members of the board think it would be inappropriate to keep kleinfeld on after siemens was hit by a number of scandals concerning pay-offs to labor representatives .
kleinfeld was not directly implicated in these controversies , but they did happen during his tenure . apart from the burgeoning corruption scandal , kleinfeld , who took over as chief executive about two years ago was also forced to launch a major damage control operation after taiwanese-owned benq filed for insolvency for the loss-making mobile handset operations it bought from siemens in 2005 .

the board is expected to confirm that announcement on wednesday .
von pierer is to be replaced by german steel giant thyssenkrupp chairman gerhard cromme . on tuesday , it was reported that linde ceo wolfgang reitzle had been approached about possibly succeeding kleinfeld .
but reitzle has already signaled that he is not interested in the job . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german companies do too little to curb corruption , study says corruption in international business is on the rise , according to a recent study .

the 24-year old german-born turk was a prisoner in guantanamo bay and the subject of a legal battle with the german government of the time , who , according to kurnaz , failed to secure his release when they had the chance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us was prepared to release kurnaz from guantanamo in 2002 his memoir , entitled " five years of my life , " which hit german bookstands on tuesday , paints a disturbing picture of kurnaz ' ordeal .

kurnaz claims he was " sold " to us soldiers by unscrupulous bounty hunters .
he was then taken to afghanistan , where he faced torturous interrogations . no help from germany according to his own account , kurnaz was left for days to hang by his hands that were tied behind his back and that were attached to electrodes .

in the book , he accuses the us soldiers there of gross maltreatment .
he describes how doctors would make unnecessary amputations and how guards would hand out regular beatings .
kurnaz himself spent over a year in solitary confinement , suffering from extreme cold , heat , darkness and oxygen deprivation . " i never imagined i would come out of it alive , " kurnaz said .

" my brother abdullah gül , with whom we established this movement -lrb- the governing justice and development party , akp -rrb- ... is the person who emerged at the end of our evaluations as the candidate to become turkey 's 11th president , " erdogan told the akp group in parliament in ankara .
" the people have seen the services that -lrb- gül -rrb- has done for his country , " erdogan also told the akp .
erdogan had been widely expected to run for the post , but the prospect sparked harsh objections from secularists .
they say the former islamist , who now describes himself as a conservative democrat , is a divisive figure with no true commitment to the mainly muslim nation 's secular system .
gul has been foreign minister since 2003 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah gul is also currently deputy prime minister the 56-year-old gül , who is also a deputy prime minister , is virtually certain to become president thanks to the comfortable majority of 353 seats that the akp holds in the 550-member parliament , which elects the president for a single , seven-year term .
he is unlikely to get the post in the first two rounds of voting , when a two-thirds majority of 367 is required , but is a shoo-in for the third or fourth round , when a simple majority of 276 suffices .
the first round is scheduled for this friday , the second for may 2 , the third for may 9 and the fourth for may 15 .
outgoing president ahmet necdet sezer 's mandate expires on may 16 .
gül is a former academic and banker who became a member of parliament in 1991 .
he and erdogan helped establish the mildly islamist akp , splitting from a group of hardliners .
the ak party was elected to government in 2002 and gül became prime minister for four months before stepping down once ak party leader erdogan secured a seat in parliament .
gül has served as foreign minister since march 2003 . dw staff / afp / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " every community needs a minimum of common orientation " in an interview with deutsche welle , norbert lammert , the president of germany 's parliament , talks about turkey and the future of the eu as well as the need for a common leading culture in europe and germany .

allegations that some siemens ' executives paid kickbacks to secure overseas contracts have also recently surfaced . new ceo a break with past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several investigations are centering on allegations of corruption at siemens " leading members of the supervisory board believe that replacing the chief executive is the right way to make a fresh start , " the daily financial times deutschland cited one source as saying on tuesday . despite assurances from siemens that it kleinfeld 's contract was on wednesday 's agenda , the paper added that a decision on a successor could be postponed until the next supervisory board meeting in july . last week siemens chairman heinrich von pierer announced he was stepping down after 38 years with the company in response to the pay-off allegations .
the board is expected to confirm that announcement on wednesday .
von pierer is to be replaced by german steel giant thyssenkrupp chairman gerhard cromme . on tuesday , it was reported that linde ceo wolfgang reitzle had been approached about possibly succeeding kleinfeld .

" those foreigners who are well-integrated , speak the german language and have an income of their own should be offered german citizenship , " stegner told the weekly bild am sonntag .
" and that without the precondition of having to relinquish their original nationality first . "
latest available statistics show that in 2005 only about 110,000 foreigners applied to become german nationals - a drop by almost 60 percent compared with the year 2000 when figures peaked in postwar germany .
at that time the previous spd-led government made it easier for germany 's four million foreigners to become citizens of this country .
conservative backlash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf stegner wants to make it easier for foreigners to become german citizens the introduction of dual citizenship , however , was prevented by the country 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
a nationwide signature campaign spearheaded by cdu state premier roland koch stopped a more far-reaching citizenship reform .
the powerful regional leader is again stonewalling against softening citizenship laws .
" the conditions for granting german citizenship must remain crystal clear , " koch said .
" the majority population must be sure that applicants integrate and accept german life as it is .
citizenship is a manifestation that should not be made easy and dual citizenship must remain an exception rather than the rule . "
bloodlines and ethnicity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservatives such as roland koch are generally opposed to a far-reaching citizenship reform nationality in germany is still largely based on bloodlines .
critics denounce this arguing that ethnic germans from the former soviet union who know just little about life here automatically receive citizenship while children of immigrants born in germany are technically foreigners .
current laws , they say , are a slap in the face especially of turks here who have strong links to their country and religion .
" certainly , the more muslims have a german passport the better they know who to vote for , " said abdul hadi hoffmann , deputy head of the berlin-based muslim academy .
" so we do encourage muslims to participate in german society and politics , " he added .
" however , if someone decides to lead his family life , earn a living and not spend his evenings in a bar drinking beer , this is not a sign of isolation and of being against the german state . "
the debate unleashed by germany 's social democrats comes at a time when less turkish nationals living in germany opt to become citizens of their host country .
this number has dropped by amore than half recently from 103,000 applicants in 1999 to merely 44,000 last year .
politicians like ralf stegner fear that this is a sign of germany 's largest immigrant community - boasting 3.5 million people - is gradually retreating from mainstream society . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " every community needs a minimum of common orientation " in an interview with deutsche welle , norbert lammert , the president of germany 's parliament , talks about turkey and the future of the eu as well as the need for a common leading culture in europe and germany .

by calling it a " treaty , " the current german eu presidency has begun reviving the stalled approval process for a new constitution for the union .
but not everyone is happy about the strategy . chancellor angela merkel and other german officials are currently in talks with representatives from the bloc 's other 26 members to try and hammer out an agreement before the german presidency ends at the end of june .
by leaving the word " constitution " out of the discussion , merkel hopes to get her colleagues to agree on a document that lacks the grave connotations and still manages to give the eu an improved voting system based largely on population size , a president and a foreign minister - even though they might not be called that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been discussing the idea with euroskeptics such as klaus " i consider it likely that symbolic elements like the words ' constitution ' or ' constitutional ' or the title ' foreign minister ' will not be in the new treaty , " czech negotiator jan zahradil told reuters news service after merkel met czech president vaclav klaus , a euroskeptic , last week .
" maybe the position will be there without the title of minister , " he added .
points of dispute according to zahradil , german officials have come up with 12 so-called " points of dispute " that will be the focus of any further discussions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could this dutch cow be convinced of the benefits of a treaty ?
according to diplomats cited by reuters , these points include the future of a charter of fundamental rights , which britain and the netherlands do not support .
also up for debate are plans to extend majority decision-making to justice and security issues .
german officials also want to include stronger references to energy security and climate change and give greater importance to social issues - a french request .
merkel 's efforts are backed by people such as outgoing british premier tony blair , who has been talking about a " simplified treaty " that would allow eu members to reach a swift agreement .
no mini-treaty but supporters of an eu consitution , such as belgian premier guy verhofstadt , have said that they are unwilling to back a watered-down document .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guy verhofstadt wants the real thing " we ca n't just follow the proposal of some states and wipe the slate clean of the constitutional treaty , " verhofstadt said in a speech at the egmont institute , a foreign policy think-tank , according to reuters .
" let there be no mistake : a mini-treaty is unacceptable , " he added .
it 's unlikely that merkel will be able to go beyond initial talks during her time as eu president , however : diplomats expect an intergovernmental conference to take place under the portuguese eu presidency in october , reuters reported .

by calling it a " treaty , " the current german eu presidency has begun reviving the stalled approval process for a new constitution for the union .
but not everyone is happy about the strategy . chancellor angela merkel and other german officials are currently in talks with representatives from the bloc 's other 26 members to try and hammer out an agreement before the german presidency ends at the end of june .
by leaving the word " constitution " out of the discussion , merkel hopes to get her colleagues to agree on a document that lacks the grave connotations and still manages to give the eu an improved voting system based largely on population size , a president and a foreign minister - even though they might not be called that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been discussing the idea with euroskeptics such as klaus " i consider it likely that symbolic elements like the words ' constitution ' or ' constitutional ' or the title ' foreign minister ' will not be in the new treaty , " czech negotiator jan zahradil told reuters news service after merkel met czech president vaclav klaus , a euroskeptic , last week .
" maybe the position will be there without the title of minister , " he added .
points of dispute according to zahradil , german officials have come up with 12 so-called " points of dispute " that will be the focus of any further discussions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could this dutch cow be convinced of the benefits of a treaty ?
according to diplomats cited by reuters , these points include the future of a charter of fundamental rights , which britain and the netherlands do not support .
also up for debate are plans to extend majority decision-making to justice and security issues .
german officials also want to include stronger references to energy security and climate change and give greater importance to social issues - a french request .
merkel 's efforts are backed by people such as outgoing british premier tony blair , who has been talking about a " simplified treaty " that would allow eu members to reach a swift agreement .

" those foreigners who are well-integrated , speak the german language and have an income of their own should be offered german citizenship , " stegner told the weekly bild am sonntag .
" and that without the precondition of having to relinquish their original nationality first . "
latest available statistics show that in 2005 only about 110,000 foreigners applied to become german nationals - a drop by almost 60 percent compared with the year 2000 when figures peaked in postwar germany .
at that time the previous spd-led government made it easier for germany 's four million foreigners to become citizens of this country .
conservative backlash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf stegner wants to make it easier for foreigners to become german citizens the introduction of dual citizenship , however , was prevented by the country 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
a nationwide signature campaign spearheaded by cdu state premier roland koch stopped a more far-reaching citizenship reform .
the powerful regional leader is again stonewalling against softening citizenship laws .
" the conditions for granting german citizenship must remain crystal clear , " koch said .
" the majority population must be sure that applicants integrate and accept german life as it is .
citizenship is a manifestation that should not be made easy and dual citizenship must remain an exception rather than the rule . "
bloodlines and ethnicity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservatives such as roland koch are generally opposed to a far-reaching citizenship reform nationality in germany is still largely based on bloodlines .
critics denounce this arguing that ethnic germans from the former soviet union who know just little about life here automatically receive citizenship while children of immigrants born in germany are technically foreigners .
current laws , they say , are a slap in the face especially of turks here who have strong links to their country and religion .
" certainly , the more muslims have a german passport the better they know who to vote for , " said abdul hadi hoffmann , deputy head of the berlin-based muslim academy .
" so we do encourage muslims to participate in german society and politics , " he added .
" however , if someone decides to lead his family life , earn a living and not spend his evenings in a bar drinking beer , this is not a sign of isolation and of being against the german state . "
the debate unleashed by germany 's social democrats comes at a time when less turkish nationals living in germany opt to become citizens of their host country .
this number has dropped by amore than half recently from 103,000 applicants in 1999 to merely 44,000 last year .
politicians like ralf stegner fear that this is a sign of germany 's largest immigrant community - boasting 3.5 million people - is gradually retreating from mainstream society . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " every community needs a minimum of common orientation " in an interview with deutsche welle , norbert lammert , the president of germany 's parliament , talks about turkey and the future of the eu as well as the need for a common leading culture in europe and germany .

this comes amid a raging debate over new revelations about the group 's terror campaign . the regional court in the southwestern city of karlsruhe approved outings with a court-appointed chaperone beginning in july for christian klar , who has been serving a life term for his role in several murders with the urban red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- guerrilla group .
klar 's attorney had issued a formal complaint after authorities in february rejected his appeal for more lenient prison conditions because he had recently made fiery anti-capitalist remarks .
in those remarks , he spoke of the " defeat of capitalism " and said europe was being ruled by an imperial alliance .
klar , who is eligible for early release in 2009 , has also appealed to german president horst köhler for clemency .
this is strongly opposed by most of the families of his victims because he has never expressed regret for the murders .
gripped by a violent history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klar is in prison in bruchsal , southern germany german media have been gripped by the former leftist militant 's fate for months , questioning whether the country is ready to draw a line under the bloody raf campaign of killings and kidnappings that shook the nation to its core .
klar was jailed for a series of killings , including the shooting of federal prosecutor siegfried buback , during the raf 's violent campaign against what it called the oppressive capitalist west german state and elite in the 1970s and early 1980s .
however , an ex-raf radical has recently come to say klar was not involved in buback 's murder and has blamed another man for the killing .
german authorities are now reviewing those claims and reports that the state was aware of testimonies in the early 1980s stating that klar was not guilty of buback 's killing .
opting for silence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mug shots of klar and former raf member mohnhaupt -lrb- r -rrb- to this day , members of the group have refused to provide information about their crimes , leaving german officials and victims ' relatives uncertain about who actually pulled the trigger in a number of high-profile cases .
former raf member peter-juergen boock , who spent 17 years in prison for his role in the group , broke that silence in a weekend interview with der spiegel newsmagazine .
he said he believed klar had driven the getaway car for the two raf members who ambushed buback in april 1977 , and suggested that german authorities had misidentified the trigger-man in the shooting .
buback was the first victim of a bloody era dubbed the " german autumn " of 1977 when he was shot in his mercedes car by a raf gunman on a motorcycle in karlsruhe .
in february , a german court ordered the release of another raf leader , brigitte mohnhaupt , after 24 years in jail on the basis that she no longer poses a threat to society .
the raf is suspected of killing 34 people before laying down its arms in 1992 .

" those foreigners who are well-integrated , speak the german language and have an income of their own should be offered german citizenship , " stegner told the weekly bild am sonntag .
" and that without the precondition of having to relinquish their original nationality first . "
latest available statistics show that in 2005 only about 110,000 foreigners applied to become german nationals - a drop by almost 60 percent compared with the year 2000 when figures peaked in postwar germany .
at that time the previous spd-led government made it easier for germany 's four million foreigners to become citizens of this country .
conservative backlash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf stegner wants to make it easier for foreigners to become german citizens the introduction of dual citizenship , however , was prevented by the country 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
a nationwide signature campaign spearheaded by cdu state premier roland koch stopped a more far-reaching citizenship reform .
the powerful regional leader is again stonewalling against softening citizenship laws .
" the conditions for granting german citizenship must remain crystal clear , " koch said .
" the majority population must be sure that applicants integrate and accept german life as it is .
citizenship is a manifestation that should not be made easy and dual citizenship must remain an exception rather than the rule . "
bloodlines and ethnicity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservatives such as roland koch are generally opposed to a far-reaching citizenship reform nationality in germany is still largely based on bloodlines .
critics denounce this arguing that ethnic germans from the former soviet union who know just little about life here automatically receive citizenship while children of immigrants born in germany are technically foreigners .
current laws , they say , are a slap in the face especially of turks here who have strong links to their country and religion .
" certainly , the more muslims have a german passport the better they know who to vote for , " said abdul hadi hoffmann , deputy head of the berlin-based muslim academy .
" so we do encourage muslims to participate in german society and politics , " he added .
" however , if someone decides to lead his family life , earn a living and not spend his evenings in a bar drinking beer , this is not a sign of isolation and of being against the german state . "
the debate unleashed by germany 's social democrats comes at a time when less turkish nationals living in germany opt to become citizens of their host country .
this number has dropped by amore than half recently from 103,000 applicants in 1999 to merely 44,000 last year .

by calling it a " treaty , " the current german eu presidency has begun reviving the stalled approval process for a new constitution for the union .
but not everyone is happy about the strategy . chancellor angela merkel and other german officials are currently in talks with representatives from the bloc 's other 26 members to try and hammer out an agreement before the german presidency ends at the end of june .
by leaving the word " constitution " out of the discussion , merkel hopes to get her colleagues to agree on a document that lacks the grave connotations and still manages to give the eu an improved voting system based largely on population size , a president and a foreign minister - even though they might not be called that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been discussing the idea with euroskeptics such as klaus " i consider it likely that symbolic elements like the words ' constitution ' or ' constitutional ' or the title ' foreign minister ' will not be in the new treaty , " czech negotiator jan zahradil told reuters news service after merkel met czech president vaclav klaus , a euroskeptic , last week .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could this dutch cow be convinced of the benefits of a treaty ?
according to diplomats cited by reuters , these points include the future of a charter of fundamental rights , which britain and the netherlands do not support .
also up for debate are plans to extend majority decision-making to justice and security issues .
german officials also want to include stronger references to energy security and climate change and give greater importance to social issues - a french request .
merkel 's efforts are backed by people such as outgoing british premier tony blair , who has been talking about a " simplified treaty " that would allow eu members to reach a swift agreement .

" let there be no mistake : a mini-treaty is unacceptable , " he added .

dw-world.de talked to the 21-year-old about his meteoric rise and his future ambitions . dw-world.de : mario , when are we going to see you on the pitch again ? mario gomez : i ca n't say at the moment .
i 'm working up to seven hours a day to get my fitness back .
but i 'm definitely not going to rush things . before you suffered a knee injury on march 11 , everything was going great .
you were the top goal-getter in the bundesliga , stuttgart was at the top of the table , and you had made your debut in the german national team .
will you have to start from scratch ? i definitely wo n't have to start from scratch .

do you feel like the team needs you less ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gomez 's is one of germany 's most technically proficient strikers not at all .
i 'm happy for them .
it does n't matter who scores the goals .
the main thing is that we 're successful as a team . next season you could be playing with stuttgart in the champions league and with the german national team at euro 2008 .
are you hoping to make a name for yourself on the european stage ? if someone had told me before the start of this season that i 'd score 13 goals and play for germany , i would have laughed in his face .
i do n't like putting myself under pressure .
i just want to get healthy again and improve as a player . you 're considered a natural talent .
but how much of that is hard work ? i have some natural ability , but i also work hard on my weaknesses . what are your weaknesses ? above all : staying calm in front of the goal .
sometimes i also let my opponent get the better of me in one-on-one situations .

there have been reports of offers from foreign clubs , for example , juventus and ac milan . of course i 'm staying at stuttgart .
i just extended my contract to 2011 . so you do n't dream of playing in spain 's primera division ? my favorite club is barcelona .
it would be a dream come true to play for them . you come from a mixed german-spanish background and have two mexican teammates at stuttgart , ricardo osorio and pavel pardo .
do you speak to them in spanish ? both of them speak good german , and they 're getting better every day .

not only is it still the largest music event in the world , it is also a telling indicator of the changing image and notion of what europe is . in contrast to the elegant , black-tie affair which it was in the 1950s , eurovision is nowadays a celebration of gory exaggeration - a musical circus act that inspires national passions , instigates unusual political alliances and offers more surprising twists and turns than any modern-day casting show could ever hope to achieve . an international musical battlefield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : times have changed : transvestite singer verka serduchka will sing for ukraine this year it is a battlefield of musical styles in which ukrainian drag queens can perform along with spanish boy bands , israeli comedy acts , norwegian senior citizens and a host of irreparably gloomy songs from the balkans . it is also the only democratic competition in the world in which a handful of televoting monegasques and a couple of dozens of andorrans have the same influence on the outcome as millions of germans or spaniards . and it is a rare event at which eastern european voters legally get to gang up on the west and divide most of the votes among themselves . germany 's meager record germany 's path to eurovision glory has been laden with thorns rather than rose petals .

nicole likes to show off her victory dress wearing a glittery black dress and playing a white guitar that screamed 80s kitsch in several languages , 17-year-old nicole won a landslide victory for the teutons by asking for " ein bisschen frieden " -lrb- a little bit of peace -rrb- at the time when the cold war was still a reality and margaret thatcher busy pursuing her argentinean military adventure in the falklands . nicole sang about being " just a girl who says what she feels " and " helpless like a bird against the wind " while europe - no matter how strange that may seem today - decided that the catholic schoolgirl look was a very in look that year , albeit , as one can now safely tell from a quarter-century distance , in a sad reject sort of way . nicole went on to sell millions of records , becoming eventually the uncrowned queen of the german schlager , the original pop-folk hybrid of the beer-garden variety that has been , much to the chagrin of iberian sophisticates , successfully exported to majorcan bars and discos catering to the german clientele as well .
good-bye , flamenco and hello , singing fräulein ! same old story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is europe ready for a retro hit from germany ?
germany won second place on four occasions and came third no less than five times , but it also came last in 2005 when a modern-day casting show product gracia failed to comprehend that she was actually supposed to sing the actual notes that the composer wrote for her . the shame of coming last two years ago is still like an open wound in the german national consciousness .
nicole , who is these days respectably 42 years old and still riding high on her historic victory , still treasures her eurovision dress and the famous white guitar .
she also likes to point out that after all these years , the dress still fits her - which is , indeed , quite an achievement . but it 's probably lonely at the top .
will any other german ever manage to join nicole on the german eurotrash olymp ?
all eyes and ears are now set on germany 's darling swinging kid roger cicero and his feminist hit " frauen regieren die welt " -lrb- women rule the world -rrb- . europe had a weird infatuation with heavy metal last year - when a scary band of noise-producing finnish vampires won against all logic and good sense - but is the old continent ready to go retro this year when representatives from 42 countries gather in helsinki in may ? in the demonically possessed world of hardcore eurovision fans , hope dies last . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nationalists , russia find ukraine 's eurovision song quite a drag ukraine 's eurovision song contest entry is causing friction at home and abroad .

nicole likes to show off her victory dress wearing a glittery black dress and playing a white guitar that screamed 80s kitsch in several languages , 17-year-old nicole won a landslide victory for the teutons by asking for " ein bisschen frieden " -lrb- a little bit of peace -rrb- at the time when the cold war was still a reality and margaret thatcher busy pursuing her argentinean military adventure in the falklands . nicole sang about being " just a girl who says what she feels " and " helpless like a bird against the wind " while europe - no matter how strange that may seem today - decided that the catholic schoolgirl look was a very in look that year , albeit , as one can now safely tell from a quarter-century distance , in a sad reject sort of way . nicole went on to sell millions of records , becoming eventually the uncrowned queen of the german schlager , the original pop-folk hybrid of the beer-garden variety that has been , much to the chagrin of iberian sophisticates , successfully exported to majorcan bars and discos catering to the german clientele as well .
good-bye , flamenco and hello , singing fräulein ! same old story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is europe ready for a retro hit from germany ?
germany won second place on four occasions and came third no less than five times , but it also came last in 2005 when a modern-day casting show product gracia failed to comprehend that she was actually supposed to sing the actual notes that the composer wrote for her . the shame of coming last two years ago is still like an open wound in the german national consciousness .
nicole , who is these days respectably 42 years old and still riding high on her historic victory , still treasures her eurovision dress and the famous white guitar .
she also likes to point out that after all these years , the dress still fits her - which is , indeed , quite an achievement . but it 's probably lonely at the top .
will any other german ever manage to join nicole on the german eurotrash olymp ?

dw-world.de talked to the 21-year-old about his meteoric rise and his future ambitions . dw-world.de : mario , when are we going to see you on the pitch again ? mario gomez : i ca n't say at the moment .
i 'm working up to seven hours a day to get my fitness back .
but i 'm definitely not going to rush things . before you suffered a knee injury on march 11 , everything was going great .
you were the top goal-getter in the bundesliga , stuttgart was at the top of the table , and you had made your debut in the german national team .
will you have to start from scratch ? i definitely wo n't have to start from scratch .
but it would be arrogant to think that i 'll have the same form i had before i got hurt . you teammates in stuttgart have been scoring lots of goals in your absence .
do you feel like the team needs you less ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gomez 's is one of germany 's most technically proficient strikers not at all .
i 'm happy for them .
it does n't matter who scores the goals .
the main thing is that we 're successful as a team . next season you could be playing with stuttgart in the champions league and with the german national team at euro 2008 .
are you hoping to make a name for yourself on the european stage ? if someone had told me before the start of this season that i 'd score 13 goals and play for germany , i would have laughed in his face .
i do n't like putting myself under pressure .
i just want to get healthy again and improve as a player . you 're considered a natural talent .
but how much of that is hard work ? i have some natural ability , but i also work hard on my weaknesses . what are your weaknesses ? above all : staying calm in front of the goal .
sometimes i also let my opponent get the better of me in one-on-one situations .
i try to address these deficiencies every time i practice . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gomez got stuttgart off to a good start - now they 're bidding for the champions league do you think you have a guaranteed spot in germany 's euro 2008 squad ? getting injured has shown me how fast things can change .
so i 'm not thinking ahead at all to the european championship next year . are you staying in stuttgart ?
there have been reports of offers from foreign clubs , for example , juventus and ac milan . of course i 'm staying at stuttgart .
i just extended my contract to 2011 . so you do n't dream of playing in spain 's primera division ? my favorite club is barcelona .
it would be a dream come true to play for them . you come from a mixed german-spanish background and have two mexican teammates at stuttgart , ricardo osorio and pavel pardo .
do you speak to them in spanish ? both of them speak good german , and they 're getting better every day .
but sometimes we do talk to each other in spanish . so where will stuttgart end up this season .

the 24-year old german-born turk was a prisoner in guantanamo bay and the subject of a legal battle with the german government of the time , who , according to kurnaz , failed to secure his release when they had the chance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us was prepared to release kurnaz from guantanamo in 2002 his memoir , entitled " five years of my life , " which hit german bookstands on tuesday , paints a disturbing picture of kurnaz ' ordeal . " i understood a long time ago what this prison was about , " kurnaz said .
" they could do with us whatever they wanted . " kurnaz was arrested in pakistan shortly after the sept .
11 attacks on the united states .
kurnaz insists he did n't travel to pakistan to fight alongside al qaeda , but rather to work for an islamic " salvation army " to help the homeless , among others .
kurnaz claims he was " sold " to us soldiers by unscrupulous bounty hunters .
he was then taken to afghanistan , where he faced torturous interrogations . no help from germany according to his own account , kurnaz was left for days to hang by his hands that were tied behind his back and that were attached to electrodes .
he hoped in vain that the german authorities would help him out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily said the german government did what it had to do to protect its citizens " one of the german soldiers came , pulled my head up and asked if i knew who they were , " kurnaz said .
" he said they were the elite force , the ksk , and slammed my head on the floor .
later another one came up and kicked me and the group of soldiers started laughing . " kurnaz was subsequently transported to guantanamo .
in the book , he accuses the us soldiers there of gross maltreatment .
he describes how doctors would make unnecessary amputations and how guards would hand out regular beatings .
kurnaz himself spent over a year in solitary confinement , suffering from extreme cold , heat , darkness and oxygen deprivation . " i never imagined i would come out of it alive , " kurnaz said .
" i presumed i could die at any minute .
i was often unconscious due to the pain and the cold .
my body could n't take any more . " personal intervention # b # it was n't until august 2006 that the newly elected chancellor angela merkel intervened personally to secure kurnaz ' release from guantanamo .
the us was reportedly prepared to release him as early as 2002 , but the germans were allegedly reluctant to allow him to return to germany at the time - a fact that sparked uproar and prompted a parliamentary inquiry . the question whether kurnaz did represent a terror threat and whether the government of the time should have done more to free him is the subject of an ongoing investigation .
according to former interior minister otto schily , however , the social democratic-green party government coalition headed by gerhard schröder responded adequately to the situation . " we have a responsibility for the safety of our citizens , " schily said .
" and that includes keeping people out of our country who represent a danger to our security .
and that was the case with murat kurnaz . " now back in his home city of bremen , kurnaz says he just wants to get on with his life .
he says the book is not intended to settle any scores , but rather to tell the world how his co-prisoners lost their legs , hands and lives in guantanamo bay . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : steinmeier 's record is blemished germany 's foreign minister has denied he caused an innocent german-born turk to be imprisoned for years at the us guantanamo bay prison .

" we can not stagnate now , " said merkel , who currently holds the presidency of both the g8 and european union , titles that lend her a wide degree of international agenda-setting power .
" we have made clear there will be continuity .
we are going to take things up where gleneagles ended . " one of the targets that emerged from the gleneagles summit was a promise to double development aid to africa by 2010 .
merkel said that vow should be fulfilled before new promises are made at the german g8 summit in june , where she has promised to make africa a major topic . merkel : the goals have been set bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has promised to make aid for africa a key issue at the g8 summit " we do not need to hold any additional conferences now to define goals , " she said .
" now we need to make a certain amount of progress . " merkel highlighted the use of micro-credits in africa , adding that not only the amount of money reaching the continent was important but also the instruments used to distribute it . blair said europe would suffer from " poverty , conflict , mass migration and the spread of terrorism " if it did not act to help solve africa 's problems . " there has been an immense amount of progress , but we know there 's a tremendous amount that has yet to be done , " blair said .
" there are far too many africans who die when their death is preventable with the right help . " annan said international efforts to aid africa needed to continue and pointed out that many of the continent 's nations broke free of their past military rulers .
the former un head is now leading the african progress panel , which is set up to monitor industrialized nations progress on reaching development targets . " unless we step up our efforts ... we will not make the -lrb- gleneagles -rrb- target , " he said . annan said he believed war in europe was now unthinkable and that he hoped that in a generation the same would be true in africa . eu constitution could become treaty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu fell into a " period of reflection " after the constitutional treaty was rejected in addition to development aid , merkel and blair also discussed differences within europe on the stalled constitutional process . blair said the intention had always been to " come back " to the constitutional issue after a " period of reflection " following the rejection of the constitution by french and dutch voters in referenda two years ago . " it 's fairly obvious that in europe there are different perspectives and different positions , " the outgoing prime minister said .
" we 've got to see whether it 's possible to reach agreement to allow europe to work effectively and move forward .

" my brother abdullah gül , with whom we established this movement -lrb- the governing justice and development party , akp -rrb- ... is the person who emerged at the end of our evaluations as the candidate to become turkey 's 11th president , " erdogan told the akp group in parliament in ankara .
" the people have seen the services that -lrb- gül -rrb- has done for his country , " erdogan also told the akp .
erdogan had been widely expected to run for the post , but the prospect sparked harsh objections from secularists .
they say the former islamist , who now describes himself as a conservative democrat , is a divisive figure with no true commitment to the mainly muslim nation 's secular system .
gul has been foreign minister since 2003 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah gul is also currently deputy prime minister the 56-year-old gül , who is also a deputy prime minister , is virtually certain to become president thanks to the comfortable majority of 353 seats that the akp holds in the 550-member parliament , which elects the president for a single , seven-year term .
he is unlikely to get the post in the first two rounds of voting , when a two-thirds majority of 367 is required , but is a shoo-in for the third or fourth round , when a simple majority of 276 suffices .

outgoing president ahmet necdet sezer 's mandate expires on may 16 .
gül is a former academic and banker who became a member of parliament in 1991 .
he and erdogan helped establish the mildly islamist akp , splitting from a group of hardliners .

the federal commissioner for data protection has accused the german government of " culpable neglect " in protecting data privacy .
he said the government should halt plans for greater access to phone and internet records . fundamental civil liberties in germany are increasingly under attack from state authorities and private businesses seeking to snoop into peoples ' lives , said german federal commissioner for data protection peter schaar during an annual data protection presentation in berlin on tuesday . schaar accused security officials of violating the law in their attempts to fight terror , adding that the federal criminal police office had passed on information to germany 's domestic intelligence agency - the federal office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- - that was unnecessary for its fight against terrorism . out of step with technology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commissioner schaar was displeased about government access to personal data schaar said modern technology provides plenty of opportunities for unauthorized access to personal data that had previously been protected under stringent laws .
" data protection laws have not kept up with the advance of technology , " schaar said , calling for an update of data privacy laws .
" complete surveillance is already technologically possible today . "

this comes amid a raging debate over new revelations about the group 's terror campaign . the regional court in the southwestern city of karlsruhe approved outings with a court-appointed chaperone beginning in july for christian klar , who has been serving a life term for his role in several murders with the urban red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- guerrilla group .
klar 's attorney had issued a formal complaint after authorities in february rejected his appeal for more lenient prison conditions because he had recently made fiery anti-capitalist remarks .
in those remarks , he spoke of the " defeat of capitalism " and said europe was being ruled by an imperial alliance .
klar , who is eligible for early release in 2009 , has also appealed to german president horst köhler for clemency .
this is strongly opposed by most of the families of his victims because he has never expressed regret for the murders .
gripped by a violent history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klar is in prison in bruchsal , southern germany german media have been gripped by the former leftist militant 's fate for months , questioning whether the country is ready to draw a line under the bloody raf campaign of killings and kidnappings that shook the nation to its core .
klar was jailed for a series of killings , including the shooting of federal prosecutor siegfried buback , during the raf 's violent campaign against what it called the oppressive capitalist west german state and elite in the 1970s and early 1980s .
however , an ex-raf radical has recently come to say klar was not involved in buback 's murder and has blamed another man for the killing .
german authorities are now reviewing those claims and reports that the state was aware of testimonies in the early 1980s stating that klar was not guilty of buback 's killing .
opting for silence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mug shots of klar and former raf member mohnhaupt -lrb- r -rrb- to this day , members of the group have refused to provide information about their crimes , leaving german officials and victims ' relatives uncertain about who actually pulled the trigger in a number of high-profile cases .
former raf member peter-juergen boock , who spent 17 years in prison for his role in the group , broke that silence in a weekend interview with der spiegel newsmagazine .
he said he believed klar had driven the getaway car for the two raf members who ambushed buback in april 1977 , and suggested that german authorities had misidentified the trigger-man in the shooting .
buback was the first victim of a bloody era dubbed the " german autumn " of 1977 when he was shot in his mercedes car by a raf gunman on a motorcycle in karlsruhe .
in february , a german court ordered the release of another raf leader , brigitte mohnhaupt , after 24 years in jail on the basis that she no longer poses a threat to society .
the raf is suspected of killing 34 people before laying down its arms in 1992 .

the federal commissioner for data protection has accused the german government of " culpable neglect " in protecting data privacy .
he said the government should halt plans for greater access to phone and internet records . fundamental civil liberties in germany are increasingly under attack from state authorities and private businesses seeking to snoop into peoples ' lives , said german federal commissioner for data protection peter schaar during an annual data protection presentation in berlin on tuesday . schaar accused security officials of violating the law in their attempts to fight terror , adding that the federal criminal police office had passed on information to germany 's domestic intelligence agency - the federal office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- - that was unnecessary for its fight against terrorism . out of step with technology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commissioner schaar was displeased about government access to personal data schaar said modern technology provides plenty of opportunities for unauthorized access to personal data that had previously been protected under stringent laws .
" data protection laws have not kept up with the advance of technology , " schaar said , calling for an update of data privacy laws .
" complete surveillance is already technologically possible today . "
in addition to technology making it possible to observe people 's actions in the privacy of their homes and offices , he said " businesses can access and exploit that personal data . "
though thorough in his criticism of the government , schaar also put some of the blame for deteriorating privacy at the feet of private individuals , many of whom willing share private information . " there is an exhibitionist tendency among people themselves that makes it easy to glean specific data about them from the internet , " he said .
complaints about violations schaar warned that germany has embarked on the road to an orwellian-style surveillance state that runs counter to the principle of individual freedom and a state based on the rule of law .
the introduction of new anti-terror laws in the wake of the sept .
11 terrorist attacks on the united states , he argued , has led to a situation in which law enforcement officials and intelligence services are illegally exchanging data that should be kept separate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plans to give police automatic access to fingerprints have been scrapped in addition , the commissioner strongly criticized plans for a new law to give authorities greater access to phone and internet records and enabling authorities to access a computer 's contents without the owner 's knowledge .
schaar also criticized a government plan to store the fingerprints of all adult germans in a central database .
after intense debate within the government , german media reported tuesday that plans to store digital fingerprints had been scrapped .
fighting terrorism vs. personal freedoms proponents , including interior minister wolfgang schäuble , have argued the measures schaar criticized are needed to fight terrorism .
the anti-terror measures and wider pre-emptive police powers have met with resistance in germany , which remains particularly sensitive to state surveillance due to the legacy of the nazi regime and former east german secret police . " we must not allow the government to upset the balance between people 's right to security and their freedoms , " schaar said .
" unfortunately , i have the impression that the government is bent on tipping the scale against civil liberties .

according to a survey conducted for the german transport ministry , over 80 percent of drivers on german roads say other drivers have become increasingly rude , and the government has decided to take action . the people polled said drivers are more inconsiderate than they used to be , with women and older drivers feeling particularly annoyed by impolite drivers and those who drive very fast , the transport ministry 's survey showed . germany is famed for its fast cars and high speed highways - the autobahn , stretches of which do not have speed limits . the country even attracts international auto-tourists , who book special vacation packages to enjoy the freedom of driving as fast as they want . off the autobahn , germans unhappy on the road bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new safety campaign aims to get people to be more polite on highways and other roads it 's not so much road rage that is getting on everyone 's nerves , as " road rudeness . "
germany 's transport minister wolfgang tiefensee said the results of the poll are a warning signal , adding that action needed to be taken soon . tiefensee has launched a new campaign encouraging people more consideration to fellow drivers .
to kick off global road safety week , tiefensee unveiled a poster in berlin on this week bearing the slogan : " do you have strength of character ?
drive responsibly . " some 800 posters will go up on billboards along highways around the country .
one of the faces of the campaign is high-profile german soccer international philipp lahm .

they are also the drivers involved in or responsible for serious or fatal accidents in disproportionately high numbers . over 1,000 out of 5,000 people who died in traffic accidents in 2005 were young drivers .
drivers between 18 and 25 years old make up over 30 percent of alcohol-related accidents . tiefensee also said stricter drinking limits are now in place for new drivers .
a new law to go into effect at the end of the summer bans any drinking for drivers in their first two years . harsh penalties to send a message offenders caught with traces of alcohol in their blood will face a fine of 125 euros -lrb- $ 160 -rrb- and have their names registered in an index of traffic offenders .
in addition , they will have their license probation period extended by four years and will have to complete a course on behavior in traffic at a cost of 450 euros . for drivers who 've had their licenses for longer than two years , a blood alcohol limit of 0.5 milligrams per milliliter of blood will apply .

this comes amid a raging debate over new revelations about the group 's terror campaign . the regional court in the southwestern city of karlsruhe approved outings with a court-appointed chaperone beginning in july for christian klar , who has been serving a life term for his role in several murders with the urban red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- guerrilla group .
klar 's attorney had issued a formal complaint after authorities in february rejected his appeal for more lenient prison conditions because he had recently made fiery anti-capitalist remarks .
in those remarks , he spoke of the " defeat of capitalism " and said europe was being ruled by an imperial alliance .
klar , who is eligible for early release in 2009 , has also appealed to german president horst köhler for clemency .
this is strongly opposed by most of the families of his victims because he has never expressed regret for the murders .
gripped by a violent history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klar is in prison in bruchsal , southern germany german media have been gripped by the former leftist militant 's fate for months , questioning whether the country is ready to draw a line under the bloody raf campaign of killings and kidnappings that shook the nation to its core .
klar was jailed for a series of killings , including the shooting of federal prosecutor siegfried buback , during the raf 's violent campaign against what it called the oppressive capitalist west german state and elite in the 1970s and early 1980s .
however , an ex-raf radical has recently come to say klar was not involved in buback 's murder and has blamed another man for the killing .
german authorities are now reviewing those claims and reports that the state was aware of testimonies in the early 1980s stating that klar was not guilty of buback 's killing .
opting for silence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mug shots of klar and former raf member mohnhaupt -lrb- r -rrb- to this day , members of the group have refused to provide information about their crimes , leaving german officials and victims ' relatives uncertain about who actually pulled the trigger in a number of high-profile cases .
former raf member peter-juergen boock , who spent 17 years in prison for his role in the group , broke that silence in a weekend interview with der spiegel newsmagazine .
he said he believed klar had driven the getaway car for the two raf members who ambushed buback in april 1977 , and suggested that german authorities had misidentified the trigger-man in the shooting .
buback was the first victim of a bloody era dubbed the " german autumn " of 1977 when he was shot in his mercedes car by a raf gunman on a motorcycle in karlsruhe .

according to a survey conducted for the german transport ministry , over 80 percent of drivers on german roads say other drivers have become increasingly rude , and the government has decided to take action . the people polled said drivers are more inconsiderate than they used to be , with women and older drivers feeling particularly annoyed by impolite drivers and those who drive very fast , the transport ministry 's survey showed . germany is famed for its fast cars and high speed highways - the autobahn , stretches of which do not have speed limits . the country even attracts international auto-tourists , who book special vacation packages to enjoy the freedom of driving as fast as they want . off the autobahn , germans unhappy on the road bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new safety campaign aims to get people to be more polite on highways and other roads it 's not so much road rage that is getting on everyone 's nerves , as " road rudeness . "
germany 's transport minister wolfgang tiefensee said the results of the poll are a warning signal , adding that action needed to be taken soon . tiefensee has launched a new campaign encouraging people more consideration to fellow drivers .
to kick off global road safety week , tiefensee unveiled a poster in berlin on this week bearing the slogan : " do you have strength of character ?
drive responsibly . " some 800 posters will go up on billboards along highways around the country .
one of the faces of the campaign is high-profile german soccer international philipp lahm .
in using celebrities to present their message , the ministry is hoping to get through to young drivers in particular . new drivers are dangerous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower blood-alcohol limits will apply to new drivers the transport ministry study showed young men who have just received their driver 's licenses are primarily responsible for the increasing aggression on the road .
they are also the drivers involved in or responsible for serious or fatal accidents in disproportionately high numbers . over 1,000 out of 5,000 people who died in traffic accidents in 2005 were young drivers .
drivers between 18 and 25 years old make up over 30 percent of alcohol-related accidents . tiefensee also said stricter drinking limits are now in place for new drivers .
a new law to go into effect at the end of the summer bans any drinking for drivers in their first two years . harsh penalties to send a message offenders caught with traces of alcohol in their blood will face a fine of 125 euros -lrb- $ 160 -rrb- and have their names registered in an index of traffic offenders .
in addition , they will have their license probation period extended by four years and will have to complete a course on behavior in traffic at a cost of 450 euros . for drivers who 've had their licenses for longer than two years , a blood alcohol limit of 0.5 milligrams per milliliter of blood will apply .

erdogan had been widely expected to run for the post , but the prospect sparked harsh objections from secularists .

he is unlikely to get the post in the first two rounds of voting , when a two-thirds majority of 367 is required , but is a shoo-in for the third or fourth round , when a simple majority of 276 suffices .

gül is a former academic and banker who became a member of parliament in 1991 .
he and erdogan helped establish the mildly islamist akp , splitting from a group of hardliners .

the federal commissioner for data protection has accused the german government of " culpable neglect " in protecting data privacy .
he said the government should halt plans for greater access to phone and internet records . fundamental civil liberties in germany are increasingly under attack from state authorities and private businesses seeking to snoop into peoples ' lives , said german federal commissioner for data protection peter schaar during an annual data protection presentation in berlin on tuesday . schaar accused security officials of violating the law in their attempts to fight terror , adding that the federal criminal police office had passed on information to germany 's domestic intelligence agency - the federal office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- - that was unnecessary for its fight against terrorism . out of step with technology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commissioner schaar was displeased about government access to personal data schaar said modern technology provides plenty of opportunities for unauthorized access to personal data that had previously been protected under stringent laws .
" data protection laws have not kept up with the advance of technology , " schaar said , calling for an update of data privacy laws .
" complete surveillance is already technologically possible today . "
in addition to technology making it possible to observe people 's actions in the privacy of their homes and offices , he said " businesses can access and exploit that personal data . "
though thorough in his criticism of the government , schaar also put some of the blame for deteriorating privacy at the feet of private individuals , many of whom willing share private information . " there is an exhibitionist tendency among people themselves that makes it easy to glean specific data about them from the internet , " he said .

schaar also criticized a government plan to store the fingerprints of all adult germans in a central database .
after intense debate within the government , german media reported tuesday that plans to store digital fingerprints had been scrapped .
fighting terrorism vs. personal freedoms proponents , including interior minister wolfgang schäuble , have argued the measures schaar criticized are needed to fight terrorism .
the anti-terror measures and wider pre-emptive police powers have met with resistance in germany , which remains particularly sensitive to state surveillance due to the legacy of the nazi regime and former east german secret police .

this comes amid a raging debate over new revelations about the group 's terror campaign . the regional court in the southwestern city of karlsruhe approved outings with a court-appointed chaperone beginning in july for christian klar , who has been serving a life term for his role in several murders with the urban red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- guerrilla group .
klar 's attorney had issued a formal complaint after authorities in february rejected his appeal for more lenient prison conditions because he had recently made fiery anti-capitalist remarks .
in those remarks , he spoke of the " defeat of capitalism " and said europe was being ruled by an imperial alliance .
klar , who is eligible for early release in 2009 , has also appealed to german president horst köhler for clemency .
this is strongly opposed by most of the families of his victims because he has never expressed regret for the murders .
gripped by a violent history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klar is in prison in bruchsal , southern germany german media have been gripped by the former leftist militant 's fate for months , questioning whether the country is ready to draw a line under the bloody raf campaign of killings and kidnappings that shook the nation to its core .
klar was jailed for a series of killings , including the shooting of federal prosecutor siegfried buback , during the raf 's violent campaign against what it called the oppressive capitalist west german state and elite in the 1970s and early 1980s .
however , an ex-raf radical has recently come to say klar was not involved in buback 's murder and has blamed another man for the killing .
german authorities are now reviewing those claims and reports that the state was aware of testimonies in the early 1980s stating that klar was not guilty of buback 's killing .
opting for silence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mug shots of klar and former raf member mohnhaupt -lrb- r -rrb- to this day , members of the group have refused to provide information about their crimes , leaving german officials and victims ' relatives uncertain about who actually pulled the trigger in a number of high-profile cases .
former raf member peter-juergen boock , who spent 17 years in prison for his role in the group , broke that silence in a weekend interview with der spiegel newsmagazine .
he said he believed klar had driven the getaway car for the two raf members who ambushed buback in april 1977 , and suggested that german authorities had misidentified the trigger-man in the shooting .
buback was the first victim of a bloody era dubbed the " german autumn " of 1977 when he was shot in his mercedes car by a raf gunman on a motorcycle in karlsruhe .
in february , a german court ordered the release of another raf leader , brigitte mohnhaupt , after 24 years in jail on the basis that she no longer poses a threat to society .
the raf is suspected of killing 34 people before laying down its arms in 1992 .
the group officially disbanded six years later . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans mull reopening left-wing terror murder case german officials on sunday called for reopening the probe of the 1977 murder of a federal prosecutor after a former leftist radical stepped forward to say a man serving time was not involved .

" my brother abdullah gül , with whom we established this movement -lrb- the governing justice and development party , akp -rrb- ... is the person who emerged at the end of our evaluations as the candidate to become turkey 's 11th president , " erdogan told the akp group in parliament in ankara .
" the people have seen the services that -lrb- gül -rrb- has done for his country , " erdogan also told the akp .
erdogan had been widely expected to run for the post , but the prospect sparked harsh objections from secularists .
they say the former islamist , who now describes himself as a conservative democrat , is a divisive figure with no true commitment to the mainly muslim nation 's secular system .
gul has been foreign minister since 2003 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah gul is also currently deputy prime minister the 56-year-old gül , who is also a deputy prime minister , is virtually certain to become president thanks to the comfortable majority of 353 seats that the akp holds in the 550-member parliament , which elects the president for a single , seven-year term .
he is unlikely to get the post in the first two rounds of voting , when a two-thirds majority of 367 is required , but is a shoo-in for the third or fourth round , when a simple majority of 276 suffices .
the first round is scheduled for this friday , the second for may 2 , the third for may 9 and the fourth for may 15 .
outgoing president ahmet necdet sezer 's mandate expires on may 16 .
gül is a former academic and banker who became a member of parliament in 1991 .
he and erdogan helped establish the mildly islamist akp , splitting from a group of hardliners .
the ak party was elected to government in 2002 and gül became prime minister for four months before stepping down once ak party leader erdogan secured a seat in parliament .

by calling it a " treaty , " the current german eu presidency has begun reviving the stalled approval process for a new constitution for the union .
but not everyone is happy about the strategy . chancellor angela merkel and other german officials are currently in talks with representatives from the bloc 's other 26 members to try and hammer out an agreement before the german presidency ends at the end of june .
by leaving the word " constitution " out of the discussion , merkel hopes to get her colleagues to agree on a document that lacks the grave connotations and still manages to give the eu an improved voting system based largely on population size , a president and a foreign minister - even though they might not be called that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been discussing the idea with euroskeptics such as klaus " i consider it likely that symbolic elements like the words ' constitution ' or ' constitutional ' or the title ' foreign minister ' will not be in the new treaty , " czech negotiator jan zahradil told reuters news service after merkel met czech president vaclav klaus , a euroskeptic , last week .
" maybe the position will be there without the title of minister , " he added .
points of dispute according to zahradil , german officials have come up with 12 so-called " points of dispute " that will be the focus of any further discussions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could this dutch cow be convinced of the benefits of a treaty ?
according to diplomats cited by reuters , these points include the future of a charter of fundamental rights , which britain and the netherlands do not support .
also up for debate are plans to extend majority decision-making to justice and security issues .
german officials also want to include stronger references to energy security and climate change and give greater importance to social issues - a french request .
merkel 's efforts are backed by people such as outgoing british premier tony blair , who has been talking about a " simplified treaty " that would allow eu members to reach a swift agreement .
no mini-treaty but supporters of an eu consitution , such as belgian premier guy verhofstadt , have said that they are unwilling to back a watered-down document .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guy verhofstadt wants the real thing " we ca n't just follow the proposal of some states and wipe the slate clean of the constitutional treaty , " verhofstadt said in a speech at the egmont institute , a foreign policy think-tank , according to reuters .
" let there be no mistake : a mini-treaty is unacceptable , " he added .
it 's unlikely that merkel will be able to go beyond initial talks during her time as eu president , however : diplomats expect an intergovernmental conference to take place under the portuguese eu presidency in october , reuters reported .
a decision is not likely to come before december . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " every community needs a minimum of common orientation " in an interview with deutsche welle , norbert lammert , the president of germany 's parliament , talks about turkey and the future of the eu as well as the need for a common leading culture in europe and germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 24.04.2007 imprisoned german terrorist receives day-outing ops großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former raf terrorist christian klar a german court on tuesday granted prison day releases to a former red army faction militant after 24 years of imprisonment .
this comes amid a raging debate over new revelations about the group 's terror campaign . the regional court in the southwestern city of karlsruhe approved outings with a court-appointed chaperone beginning in july for christian klar , who has been serving a life term for his role in several murders with the urban red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- guerrilla group .
klar 's attorney had issued a formal complaint after authorities in february rejected his appeal for more lenient prison conditions because he had recently made fiery anti-capitalist remarks .
in those remarks , he spoke of the " defeat of capitalism " and said europe was being ruled by an imperial alliance .
klar , who is eligible for early release in 2009 , has also appealed to german president horst köhler for clemency .
this is strongly opposed by most of the families of his victims because he has never expressed regret for the murders .
gripped by a violent history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klar is in prison in bruchsal , southern germany german media have been gripped by the former leftist militant 's fate for months , questioning whether the country is ready to draw a line under the bloody raf campaign of killings and kidnappings that shook the nation to its core .
klar was jailed for a series of killings , including the shooting of federal prosecutor siegfried buback , during the raf 's violent campaign against what it called the oppressive capitalist west german state and elite in the 1970s and early 1980s .
however , an ex-raf radical has recently come to say klar was not involved in buback 's murder and has blamed another man for the killing .
german authorities are now reviewing those claims and reports that the state was aware of testimonies in the early 1980s stating that klar was not guilty of buback 's killing .
opting for silence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mug shots of klar and former raf member mohnhaupt -lrb- r -rrb- to this day , members of the group have refused to provide information about their crimes , leaving german officials and victims ' relatives uncertain about who actually pulled the trigger in a number of high-profile cases .
former raf member peter-juergen boock , who spent 17 years in prison for his role in the group , broke that silence in a weekend interview with der spiegel newsmagazine .
he said he believed klar had driven the getaway car for the two raf members who ambushed buback in april 1977 , and suggested that german authorities had misidentified the trigger-man in the shooting .
buback was the first victim of a bloody era dubbed the " german autumn " of 1977 when he was shot in his mercedes car by a raf gunman on a motorcycle in karlsruhe .
in february , a german court ordered the release of another raf leader , brigitte mohnhaupt , after 24 years in jail on the basis that she no longer poses a threat to society .
the raf is suspected of killing 34 people before laying down its arms in 1992 .

klar was jailed for a series of killings , including the shooting of federal prosecutor siegfried buback , during the raf 's violent campaign against what it called the oppressive capitalist west german state and elite in the 1970s and early 1980s .
however , an ex-raf radical has recently come to say klar was not involved in buback 's murder and has blamed another man for the killing .
german authorities are now reviewing those claims and reports that the state was aware of testimonies in the early 1980s stating that klar was not guilty of buback 's killing .

former raf member peter-juergen boock , who spent 17 years in prison for his role in the group , broke that silence in a weekend interview with der spiegel newsmagazine .
he said he believed klar had driven the getaway car for the two raf members who ambushed buback in april 1977 , and suggested that german authorities had misidentified the trigger-man in the shooting .
buback was the first victim of a bloody era dubbed the " german autumn " of 1977 when he was shot in his mercedes car by a raf gunman on a motorcycle in karlsruhe .
in february , a german court ordered the release of another raf leader , brigitte mohnhaupt , after 24 years in jail on the basis that she no longer poses a threat to society .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 24.04.2007 germans bank on " treaty " to replace doomed eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will europeans find it easier to swallow a treaty or a constitution ?
by calling it a " treaty , " the current german eu presidency has begun reviving the stalled approval process for a new constitution for the union .
but not everyone is happy about the strategy . chancellor angela merkel and other german officials are currently in talks with representatives from the bloc 's other 26 members to try and hammer out an agreement before the german presidency ends at the end of june .
by leaving the word " constitution " out of the discussion , merkel hopes to get her colleagues to agree on a document that lacks the grave connotations and still manages to give the eu an improved voting system based largely on population size , a president and a foreign minister - even though they might not be called that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been discussing the idea with euroskeptics such as klaus " i consider it likely that symbolic elements like the words ' constitution ' or ' constitutional ' or the title ' foreign minister ' will not be in the new treaty , " czech negotiator jan zahradil told reuters news service after merkel met czech president vaclav klaus , a euroskeptic , last week .
" maybe the position will be there without the title of minister , " he added .
points of dispute according to zahradil , german officials have come up with 12 so-called " points of dispute " that will be the focus of any further discussions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could this dutch cow be convinced of the benefits of a treaty ?
according to diplomats cited by reuters , these points include the future of a charter of fundamental rights , which britain and the netherlands do not support .
also up for debate are plans to extend majority decision-making to justice and security issues .
german officials also want to include stronger references to energy security and climate change and give greater importance to social issues - a french request .
merkel 's efforts are backed by people such as outgoing british premier tony blair , who has been talking about a " simplified treaty " that would allow eu members to reach a swift agreement .
no mini-treaty but supporters of an eu consitution , such as belgian premier guy verhofstadt , have said that they are unwilling to back a watered-down document .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guy verhofstadt wants the real thing " we ca n't just follow the proposal of some states and wipe the slate clean of the constitutional treaty , " verhofstadt said in a speech at the egmont institute , a foreign policy think-tank , according to reuters .
" let there be no mistake : a mini-treaty is unacceptable , " he added .
it 's unlikely that merkel will be able to go beyond initial talks during her time as eu president , however : diplomats expect an intergovernmental conference to take place under the portuguese eu presidency in october , reuters reported .
a decision is not likely to come before december . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " every community needs a minimum of common orientation " in an interview with deutsche welle , norbert lammert , the president of germany 's parliament , talks about turkey and the future of the eu as well as the need for a common leading culture in europe and germany .

" we can not stagnate now , " said merkel , who currently holds the presidency of both the g8 and european union , titles that lend her a wide degree of international agenda-setting power .
" we have made clear there will be continuity .
we are going to take things up where gleneagles ended . " one of the targets that emerged from the gleneagles summit was a promise to double development aid to africa by 2010 .

" merkel highlighted the use of micro-credits in africa , adding that not only the amount of money reaching the continent was important but also the instruments used to distribute it . blair said europe would suffer from " poverty , conflict , mass migration and the spread of terrorism " if it did not act to help solve africa 's problems . " there has been an immense amount of progress , but we know there 's a tremendous amount that has yet to be done , " blair said .
" there are far too many africans who die when their death is preventable with the right help . " annan said international efforts to aid africa needed to continue and pointed out that many of the continent 's nations broke free of their past military rulers .
the former un head is now leading the african progress panel , which is set up to monitor industrialized nations progress on reaching development targets .

" we can not stagnate now , " said merkel , who currently holds the presidency of both the g8 and european union , titles that lend her a wide degree of international agenda-setting power .
" we have made clear there will be continuity .
we are going to take things up where gleneagles ended . " one of the targets that emerged from the gleneagles summit was a promise to double development aid to africa by 2010 .

" now we need to make a certain amount of progress . " merkel highlighted the use of micro-credits in africa , adding that not only the amount of money reaching the continent was important but also the instruments used to distribute it . blair said europe would suffer from " poverty , conflict , mass migration and the spread of terrorism " if it did not act to help solve africa 's problems . " there has been an immense amount of progress , but we know there 's a tremendous amount that has yet to be done , " blair said .
" there are far too many africans who die when their death is preventable with the right help . " annan said international efforts to aid africa needed to continue and pointed out that many of the continent 's nations broke free of their past military rulers .

by calling it a " treaty , " the current german eu presidency has begun reviving the stalled approval process for a new constitution for the union .
but not everyone is happy about the strategy . chancellor angela merkel and other german officials are currently in talks with representatives from the bloc 's other 26 members to try and hammer out an agreement before the german presidency ends at the end of june .
by leaving the word " constitution " out of the discussion , merkel hopes to get her colleagues to agree on a document that lacks the grave connotations and still manages to give the eu an improved voting system based largely on population size , a president and a foreign minister - even though they might not be called that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been discussing the idea with euroskeptics such as klaus " i consider it likely that symbolic elements like the words ' constitution ' or ' constitutional ' or the title ' foreign minister ' will not be in the new treaty , " czech negotiator jan zahradil told reuters news service after merkel met czech president vaclav klaus , a euroskeptic , last week .
" maybe the position will be there without the title of minister , " he added .
points of dispute according to zahradil , german officials have come up with 12 so-called " points of dispute " that will be the focus of any further discussions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could this dutch cow be convinced of the benefits of a treaty ?
according to diplomats cited by reuters , these points include the future of a charter of fundamental rights , which britain and the netherlands do not support .
also up for debate are plans to extend majority decision-making to justice and security issues .
german officials also want to include stronger references to energy security and climate change and give greater importance to social issues - a french request .
merkel 's efforts are backed by people such as outgoing british premier tony blair , who has been talking about a " simplified treaty " that would allow eu members to reach a swift agreement .
no mini-treaty but supporters of an eu consitution , such as belgian premier guy verhofstadt , have said that they are unwilling to back a watered-down document .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guy verhofstadt wants the real thing " we ca n't just follow the proposal of some states and wipe the slate clean of the constitutional treaty , " verhofstadt said in a speech at the egmont institute , a foreign policy think-tank , according to reuters .
" let there be no mistake : a mini-treaty is unacceptable , " he added .

by calling it a " treaty , " the current german eu presidency has begun reviving the stalled approval process for a new constitution for the union .
but not everyone is happy about the strategy . chancellor angela merkel and other german officials are currently in talks with representatives from the bloc 's other 26 members to try and hammer out an agreement before the german presidency ends at the end of june .
by leaving the word " constitution " out of the discussion , merkel hopes to get her colleagues to agree on a document that lacks the grave connotations and still manages to give the eu an improved voting system based largely on population size , a president and a foreign minister - even though they might not be called that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been discussing the idea with euroskeptics such as klaus " i consider it likely that symbolic elements like the words ' constitution ' or ' constitutional ' or the title ' foreign minister ' will not be in the new treaty , " czech negotiator jan zahradil told reuters news service after merkel met czech president vaclav klaus , a euroskeptic , last week .
" maybe the position will be there without the title of minister , " he added .
points of dispute according to zahradil , german officials have come up with 12 so-called " points of dispute " that will be the focus of any further discussions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could this dutch cow be convinced of the benefits of a treaty ?
according to diplomats cited by reuters , these points include the future of a charter of fundamental rights , which britain and the netherlands do not support .
also up for debate are plans to extend majority decision-making to justice and security issues .
german officials also want to include stronger references to energy security and climate change and give greater importance to social issues - a french request .
merkel 's efforts are backed by people such as outgoing british premier tony blair , who has been talking about a " simplified treaty " that would allow eu members to reach a swift agreement .
no mini-treaty but supporters of an eu consitution , such as belgian premier guy verhofstadt , have said that they are unwilling to back a watered-down document .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guy verhofstadt wants the real thing " we ca n't just follow the proposal of some states and wipe the slate clean of the constitutional treaty , " verhofstadt said in a speech at the egmont institute , a foreign policy think-tank , according to reuters .
" let there be no mistake : a mini-treaty is unacceptable , " he added .
it 's unlikely that merkel will be able to go beyond initial talks during her time as eu president , however : diplomats expect an intergovernmental conference to take place under the portuguese eu presidency in october , reuters reported .

the federal commissioner for data protection has accused the german government of " culpable neglect " in protecting data privacy .
he said the government should halt plans for greater access to phone and internet records . fundamental civil liberties in germany are increasingly under attack from state authorities and private businesses seeking to snoop into peoples ' lives , said german federal commissioner for data protection peter schaar during an annual data protection presentation in berlin on tuesday . schaar accused security officials of violating the law in their attempts to fight terror , adding that the federal criminal police office had passed on information to germany 's domestic intelligence agency - the federal office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- - that was unnecessary for its fight against terrorism . out of step with technology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commissioner schaar was displeased about government access to personal data schaar said modern technology provides plenty of opportunities for unauthorized access to personal data that had previously been protected under stringent laws .
" data protection laws have not kept up with the advance of technology , " schaar said , calling for an update of data privacy laws .
" complete surveillance is already technologically possible today . "
in addition to technology making it possible to observe people 's actions in the privacy of their homes and offices , he said " businesses can access and exploit that personal data . "
though thorough in his criticism of the government , schaar also put some of the blame for deteriorating privacy at the feet of private individuals , many of whom willing share private information . " there is an exhibitionist tendency among people themselves that makes it easy to glean specific data about them from the internet , " he said .
complaints about violations schaar warned that germany has embarked on the road to an orwellian-style surveillance state that runs counter to the principle of individual freedom and a state based on the rule of law .
the introduction of new anti-terror laws in the wake of the sept .
11 terrorist attacks on the united states , he argued , has led to a situation in which law enforcement officials and intelligence services are illegally exchanging data that should be kept separate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plans to give police automatic access to fingerprints have been scrapped in addition , the commissioner strongly criticized plans for a new law to give authorities greater access to phone and internet records and enabling authorities to access a computer 's contents without the owner 's knowledge .
schaar also criticized a government plan to store the fingerprints of all adult germans in a central database .
after intense debate within the government , german media reported tuesday that plans to store digital fingerprints had been scrapped .
fighting terrorism vs. personal freedoms proponents , including interior minister wolfgang schäuble , have argued the measures schaar criticized are needed to fight terrorism .
the anti-terror measures and wider pre-emptive police powers have met with resistance in germany , which remains particularly sensitive to state surveillance due to the legacy of the nazi regime and former east german secret police . " we must not allow the government to upset the balance between people 's right to security and their freedoms , " schaar said .

by calling it a " treaty , " the current german eu presidency has begun reviving the stalled approval process for a new constitution for the union .
but not everyone is happy about the strategy . chancellor angela merkel and other german officials are currently in talks with representatives from the bloc 's other 26 members to try and hammer out an agreement before the german presidency ends at the end of june .
by leaving the word " constitution " out of the discussion , merkel hopes to get her colleagues to agree on a document that lacks the grave connotations and still manages to give the eu an improved voting system based largely on population size , a president and a foreign minister - even though they might not be called that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been discussing the idea with euroskeptics such as klaus " i consider it likely that symbolic elements like the words ' constitution ' or ' constitutional ' or the title ' foreign minister ' will not be in the new treaty , " czech negotiator jan zahradil told reuters news service after merkel met czech president vaclav klaus , a euroskeptic , last week .
" maybe the position will be there without the title of minister , " he added .
points of dispute according to zahradil , german officials have come up with 12 so-called " points of dispute " that will be the focus of any further discussions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could this dutch cow be convinced of the benefits of a treaty ?
according to diplomats cited by reuters , these points include the future of a charter of fundamental rights , which britain and the netherlands do not support .
also up for debate are plans to extend majority decision-making to justice and security issues .
german officials also want to include stronger references to energy security and climate change and give greater importance to social issues - a french request .
merkel 's efforts are backed by people such as outgoing british premier tony blair , who has been talking about a " simplified treaty " that would allow eu members to reach a swift agreement .
no mini-treaty but supporters of an eu consitution , such as belgian premier guy verhofstadt , have said that they are unwilling to back a watered-down document .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guy verhofstadt wants the real thing " we ca n't just follow the proposal of some states and wipe the slate clean of the constitutional treaty , " verhofstadt said in a speech at the egmont institute , a foreign policy think-tank , according to reuters .
" let there be no mistake : a mini-treaty is unacceptable , " he added .
it 's unlikely that merkel will be able to go beyond initial talks during her time as eu president , however : diplomats expect an intergovernmental conference to take place under the portuguese eu presidency in october , reuters reported .
a decision is not likely to come before december . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " every community needs a minimum of common orientation " in an interview with deutsche welle , norbert lammert , the president of germany 's parliament , talks about turkey and the future of the eu as well as the need for a common leading culture in europe and germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 24.04.2007 german minister urges reversal of dual citizenship policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners applying for german citizenship must relinquish their original nationality a public debate about the introduction of dual german citizenship has resurfaced after a senior social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- member demanded new incentives for foreigners to integrate into german society . ralf stegner , interior minister in the regional state of schleswig-holstein , has urged conservative chancellor angela merkel to rethink her position on dual citizenship , saying law-abiding foreigners should be given the chance to become german citizens while maintaining their original nationality .
" those foreigners who are well-integrated , speak the german language and have an income of their own should be offered german citizenship , " stegner told the weekly bild am sonntag .
" and that without the precondition of having to relinquish their original nationality first . "
latest available statistics show that in 2005 only about 110,000 foreigners applied to become german nationals - a drop by almost 60 percent compared with the year 2000 when figures peaked in postwar germany .
at that time the previous spd-led government made it easier for germany 's four million foreigners to become citizens of this country .
conservative backlash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf stegner wants to make it easier for foreigners to become german citizens the introduction of dual citizenship , however , was prevented by the country 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
a nationwide signature campaign spearheaded by cdu state premier roland koch stopped a more far-reaching citizenship reform .
the powerful regional leader is again stonewalling against softening citizenship laws .
" the conditions for granting german citizenship must remain crystal clear , " koch said .
" the majority population must be sure that applicants integrate and accept german life as it is .
citizenship is a manifestation that should not be made easy and dual citizenship must remain an exception rather than the rule . "
bloodlines and ethnicity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservatives such as roland koch are generally opposed to a far-reaching citizenship reform nationality in germany is still largely based on bloodlines .
critics denounce this arguing that ethnic germans from the former soviet union who know just little about life here automatically receive citizenship while children of immigrants born in germany are technically foreigners .
current laws , they say , are a slap in the face especially of turks here who have strong links to their country and religion .
" certainly , the more muslims have a german passport the better they know who to vote for , " said abdul hadi hoffmann , deputy head of the berlin-based muslim academy .
" so we do encourage muslims to participate in german society and politics , " he added .
" however , if someone decides to lead his family life , earn a living and not spend his evenings in a bar drinking beer , this is not a sign of isolation and of being against the german state . "
the debate unleashed by germany 's social democrats comes at a time when less turkish nationals living in germany opt to become citizens of their host country .
this number has dropped by amore than half recently from 103,000 applicants in 1999 to merely 44,000 last year .
politicians like ralf stegner fear that this is a sign of germany 's largest immigrant community - boasting 3.5 million people - is gradually retreating from mainstream society . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " every community needs a minimum of common orientation " in an interview with deutsche welle , norbert lammert , the president of germany 's parliament , talks about turkey and the future of the eu as well as the need for a common leading culture in europe and germany .

" those foreigners who are well-integrated , speak the german language and have an income of their own should be offered german citizenship , " stegner told the weekly bild am sonntag .
" and that without the precondition of having to relinquish their original nationality first . "
latest available statistics show that in 2005 only about 110,000 foreigners applied to become german nationals - a drop by almost 60 percent compared with the year 2000 when figures peaked in postwar germany .
at that time the previous spd-led government made it easier for germany 's four million foreigners to become citizens of this country .

a nationwide signature campaign spearheaded by cdu state premier roland koch stopped a more far-reaching citizenship reform .
the powerful regional leader is again stonewalling against softening citizenship laws .
" the conditions for granting german citizenship must remain crystal clear , " koch said .
" the majority population must be sure that applicants integrate and accept german life as it is .
citizenship is a manifestation that should not be made easy and dual citizenship must remain an exception rather than the rule . "
bloodlines and ethnicity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservatives such as roland koch are generally opposed to a far-reaching citizenship reform nationality in germany is still largely based on bloodlines .
critics denounce this arguing that ethnic germans from the former soviet union who know just little about life here automatically receive citizenship while children of immigrants born in germany are technically foreigners .
current laws , they say , are a slap in the face especially of turks here who have strong links to their country and religion .
" certainly , the more muslims have a german passport the better they know who to vote for , " said abdul hadi hoffmann , deputy head of the berlin-based muslim academy .
" so we do encourage muslims to participate in german society and politics , " he added .
" however , if someone decides to lead his family life , earn a living and not spend his evenings in a bar drinking beer , this is not a sign of isolation and of being against the german state . "
the debate unleashed by germany 's social democrats comes at a time when less turkish nationals living in germany opt to become citizens of their host country .
this number has dropped by amore than half recently from 103,000 applicants in 1999 to merely 44,000 last year .

" those foreigners who are well-integrated , speak the german language and have an income of their own should be offered german citizenship , " stegner told the weekly bild am sonntag .
" and that without the precondition of having to relinquish their original nationality first . "
latest available statistics show that in 2005 only about 110,000 foreigners applied to become german nationals - a drop by almost 60 percent compared with the year 2000 when figures peaked in postwar germany .
at that time the previous spd-led government made it easier for germany 's four million foreigners to become citizens of this country .

a nationwide signature campaign spearheaded by cdu state premier roland koch stopped a more far-reaching citizenship reform .
the powerful regional leader is again stonewalling against softening citizenship laws .
" the conditions for granting german citizenship must remain crystal clear , " koch said .
" the majority population must be sure that applicants integrate and accept german life as it is .
citizenship is a manifestation that should not be made easy and dual citizenship must remain an exception rather than the rule . "

critics denounce this arguing that ethnic germans from the former soviet union who know just little about life here automatically receive citizenship while children of immigrants born in germany are technically foreigners .
current laws , they say , are a slap in the face especially of turks here who have strong links to their country and religion .
" certainly , the more muslims have a german passport the better they know who to vote for , " said abdul hadi hoffmann , deputy head of the berlin-based muslim academy .
" so we do encourage muslims to participate in german society and politics , " he added .
" however , if someone decides to lead his family life , earn a living and not spend his evenings in a bar drinking beer , this is not a sign of isolation and of being against the german state . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 24.04.2007 it happened once on the road to eurovision heaven großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 600 million tv viewers watched nicole win the eurovision song contest in 1982 it happened 25 years ago , germany won the eurovision song contest , which is why springtime is such a melancholy season for german music fans .
it evokes memories of a singular triumph and a tradition of failure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " hard rock hallelujah " was the winning song in 2006 contrary to popular belief , germany is a land of dreamers .
every year , come springtime , when bees , educated fleas , lithuanians and letts start fantasizing of falling in love , germans subject themselves to tantalizing rituals of wishful thinking , childish petulance and utter masochism by posing the " big " national question : " could we - this year perhaps , or even ever again - really win the eurovision song contest ? " eurovision is a remarkable european tradition .
not only is it still the largest music event in the world , it is also a telling indicator of the changing image and notion of what europe is . in contrast to the elegant , black-tie affair which it was in the 1950s , eurovision is nowadays a celebration of gory exaggeration - a musical circus act that inspires national passions , instigates unusual political alliances and offers more surprising twists and turns than any modern-day casting show could ever hope to achieve . an international musical battlefield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : times have changed : transvestite singer verka serduchka will sing for ukraine this year it is a battlefield of musical styles in which ukrainian drag queens can perform along with spanish boy bands , israeli comedy acts , norwegian senior citizens and a host of irreparably gloomy songs from the balkans . it is also the only democratic competition in the world in which a handful of televoting monegasques and a couple of dozens of andorrans have the same influence on the outcome as millions of germans or spaniards . and it is a rare event at which eastern european voters legally get to gang up on the west and divide most of the votes among themselves . germany 's meager record germany 's path to eurovision glory has been laden with thorns rather than rose petals .
only once in the last five decades did germany actually win the competition - on april 24 , 1982 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it still fits !
nicole likes to show off her victory dress wearing a glittery black dress and playing a white guitar that screamed 80s kitsch in several languages , 17-year-old nicole won a landslide victory for the teutons by asking for " ein bisschen frieden " -lrb- a little bit of peace -rrb- at the time when the cold war was still a reality and margaret thatcher busy pursuing her argentinean military adventure in the falklands . nicole sang about being " just a girl who says what she feels " and " helpless like a bird against the wind " while europe - no matter how strange that may seem today - decided that the catholic schoolgirl look was a very in look that year , albeit , as one can now safely tell from a quarter-century distance , in a sad reject sort of way . nicole went on to sell millions of records , becoming eventually the uncrowned queen of the german schlager , the original pop-folk hybrid of the beer-garden variety that has been , much to the chagrin of iberian sophisticates , successfully exported to majorcan bars and discos catering to the german clientele as well .
good-bye , flamenco and hello , singing fräulein ! same old story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is europe ready for a retro hit from germany ?
germany won second place on four occasions and came third no less than five times , but it also came last in 2005 when a modern-day casting show product gracia failed to comprehend that she was actually supposed to sing the actual notes that the composer wrote for her . the shame of coming last two years ago is still like an open wound in the german national consciousness .
nicole , who is these days respectably 42 years old and still riding high on her historic victory , still treasures her eurovision dress and the famous white guitar .
she also likes to point out that after all these years , the dress still fits her - which is , indeed , quite an achievement . but it 's probably lonely at the top .
will any other german ever manage to join nicole on the german eurotrash olymp ?
all eyes and ears are now set on germany 's darling swinging kid roger cicero and his feminist hit " frauen regieren die welt " -lrb- women rule the world -rrb- . europe had a weird infatuation with heavy metal last year - when a scary band of noise-producing finnish vampires won against all logic and good sense - but is the old continent ready to go retro this year when representatives from 42 countries gather in helsinki in may ? in the demonically possessed world of hardcore eurovision fans , hope dies last . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nationalists , russia find ukraine 's eurovision song quite a drag ukraine 's eurovision song contest entry is causing friction at home and abroad .
verka serduchka is accused by nationalists of enforcing negative ukrainian stereotypes while the russians see her song as a political snub .
-lrb- 02.04.2007 -rrb- germany swings around eurovision in surprising national final germany has never fully recovered from its 2005 eurovision debacle when it came last .
but you ca n't say the germans are not trying .

dw-world.de talked to the 21-year-old about his meteoric rise and his future ambitions . dw-world.de : mario , when are we going to see you on the pitch again ? mario gomez : i ca n't say at the moment .
i 'm working up to seven hours a day to get my fitness back .
but i 'm definitely not going to rush things . before you suffered a knee injury on march 11 , everything was going great .
you were the top goal-getter in the bundesliga , stuttgart was at the top of the table , and you had made your debut in the german national team .
will you have to start from scratch ? i definitely wo n't have to start from scratch .
but it would be arrogant to think that i 'll have the same form i had before i got hurt . you teammates in stuttgart have been scoring lots of goals in your absence .
do you feel like the team needs you less ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gomez 's is one of germany 's most technically proficient strikers not at all .
i 'm happy for them .
it does n't matter who scores the goals .
the main thing is that we 're successful as a team . next season you could be playing with stuttgart in the champions league and with the german national team at euro 2008 .
are you hoping to make a name for yourself on the european stage ? if someone had told me before the start of this season that i 'd score 13 goals and play for germany , i would have laughed in his face .
i do n't like putting myself under pressure .
i just want to get healthy again and improve as a player . you 're considered a natural talent .
but how much of that is hard work ? i have some natural ability , but i also work hard on my weaknesses . what are your weaknesses ? above all : staying calm in front of the goal .
sometimes i also let my opponent get the better of me in one-on-one situations .
i try to address these deficiencies every time i practice . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gomez got stuttgart off to a good start - now they 're bidding for the champions league do you think you have a guaranteed spot in germany 's euro 2008 squad ? getting injured has shown me how fast things can change .
so i 'm not thinking ahead at all to the european championship next year . are you staying in stuttgart ?
there have been reports of offers from foreign clubs , for example , juventus and ac milan . of course i 'm staying at stuttgart .
i just extended my contract to 2011 . so you do n't dream of playing in spain 's primera division ? my favorite club is barcelona .
it would be a dream come true to play for them . you come from a mixed german-spanish background and have two mexican teammates at stuttgart , ricardo osorio and pavel pardo .

dw-world.de talked to the 21-year-old about his meteoric rise and his future ambitions . dw-world.de : mario , when are we going to see you on the pitch again ? mario gomez : i ca n't say at the moment .
i 'm working up to seven hours a day to get my fitness back .
but i 'm definitely not going to rush things . before you suffered a knee injury on march 11 , everything was going great .
you were the top goal-getter in the bundesliga , stuttgart was at the top of the table , and you had made your debut in the german national team .
will you have to start from scratch ? i definitely wo n't have to start from scratch .
but it would be arrogant to think that i 'll have the same form i had before i got hurt . you teammates in stuttgart have been scoring lots of goals in your absence .
do you feel like the team needs you less ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gomez 's is one of germany 's most technically proficient strikers not at all .
i 'm happy for them .
it does n't matter who scores the goals .
the main thing is that we 're successful as a team . next season you could be playing with stuttgart in the champions league and with the german national team at euro 2008 .
are you hoping to make a name for yourself on the european stage ? if someone had told me before the start of this season that i 'd score 13 goals and play for germany , i would have laughed in his face .
i do n't like putting myself under pressure .
i just want to get healthy again and improve as a player . you 're considered a natural talent .
but how much of that is hard work ? i have some natural ability , but i also work hard on my weaknesses . what are your weaknesses ? above all : staying calm in front of the goal .
sometimes i also let my opponent get the better of me in one-on-one situations .
i try to address these deficiencies every time i practice . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gomez got stuttgart off to a good start - now they 're bidding for the champions league do you think you have a guaranteed spot in germany 's euro 2008 squad ? getting injured has shown me how fast things can change .
so i 'm not thinking ahead at all to the european championship next year . are you staying in stuttgart ?
there have been reports of offers from foreign clubs , for example , juventus and ac milan . of course i 'm staying at stuttgart .
i just extended my contract to 2011 . so you do n't dream of playing in spain 's primera division ? my favorite club is barcelona .
it would be a dream come true to play for them . you come from a mixed german-spanish background and have two mexican teammates at stuttgart , ricardo osorio and pavel pardo .
do you speak to them in spanish ? both of them speak good german , and they 're getting better every day .

" my brother abdullah gül , with whom we established this movement -lrb- the governing justice and development party , akp -rrb- ... is the person who emerged at the end of our evaluations as the candidate to become turkey 's 11th president , " erdogan told the akp group in parliament in ankara .
" the people have seen the services that -lrb- gül -rrb- has done for his country , " erdogan also told the akp .
erdogan had been widely expected to run for the post , but the prospect sparked harsh objections from secularists .
they say the former islamist , who now describes himself as a conservative democrat , is a divisive figure with no true commitment to the mainly muslim nation 's secular system .
gul has been foreign minister since 2003 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah gul is also currently deputy prime minister the 56-year-old gül , who is also a deputy prime minister , is virtually certain to become president thanks to the comfortable majority of 353 seats that the akp holds in the 550-member parliament , which elects the president for a single , seven-year term .
he is unlikely to get the post in the first two rounds of voting , when a two-thirds majority of 367 is required , but is a shoo-in for the third or fourth round , when a simple majority of 276 suffices .
the first round is scheduled for this friday , the second for may 2 , the third for may 9 and the fourth for may 15 .
outgoing president ahmet necdet sezer 's mandate expires on may 16 .
gül is a former academic and banker who became a member of parliament in 1991 .
he and erdogan helped establish the mildly islamist akp , splitting from a group of hardliners .
the ak party was elected to government in 2002 and gül became prime minister for four months before stepping down once ak party leader erdogan secured a seat in parliament .

according to a survey conducted for the german transport ministry , over 80 percent of drivers on german roads say other drivers have become increasingly rude , and the government has decided to take action . the people polled said drivers are more inconsiderate than they used to be , with women and older drivers feeling particularly annoyed by impolite drivers and those who drive very fast , the transport ministry 's survey showed . germany is famed for its fast cars and high speed highways - the autobahn , stretches of which do not have speed limits . the country even attracts international auto-tourists , who book special vacation packages to enjoy the freedom of driving as fast as they want . off the autobahn , germans unhappy on the road bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new safety campaign aims to get people to be more polite on highways and other roads it 's not so much road rage that is getting on everyone 's nerves , as " road rudeness . "
germany 's transport minister wolfgang tiefensee said the results of the poll are a warning signal , adding that action needed to be taken soon . tiefensee has launched a new campaign encouraging people more consideration to fellow drivers .
to kick off global road safety week , tiefensee unveiled a poster in berlin on this week bearing the slogan : " do you have strength of character ?
drive responsibly . " some 800 posters will go up on billboards along highways around the country .
one of the faces of the campaign is high-profile german soccer international philipp lahm .
in using celebrities to present their message , the ministry is hoping to get through to young drivers in particular . new drivers are dangerous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower blood-alcohol limits will apply to new drivers the transport ministry study showed young men who have just received their driver 's licenses are primarily responsible for the increasing aggression on the road .
they are also the drivers involved in or responsible for serious or fatal accidents in disproportionately high numbers . over 1,000 out of 5,000 people who died in traffic accidents in 2005 were young drivers .
drivers between 18 and 25 years old make up over 30 percent of alcohol-related accidents . tiefensee also said stricter drinking limits are now in place for new drivers .
a new law to go into effect at the end of the summer bans any drinking for drivers in their first two years . harsh penalties to send a message offenders caught with traces of alcohol in their blood will face a fine of 125 euros -lrb- $ 160 -rrb- and have their names registered in an index of traffic offenders .
in addition , they will have their license probation period extended by four years and will have to complete a course on behavior in traffic at a cost of 450 euros . for drivers who 've had their licenses for longer than two years , a blood alcohol limit of 0.5 milligrams per milliliter of blood will apply .

according to a survey conducted for the german transport ministry , over 80 percent of drivers on german roads say other drivers have become increasingly rude , and the government has decided to take action . the people polled said drivers are more inconsiderate than they used to be , with women and older drivers feeling particularly annoyed by impolite drivers and those who drive very fast , the transport ministry 's survey showed . germany is famed for its fast cars and high speed highways - the autobahn , stretches of which do not have speed limits . the country even attracts international auto-tourists , who book special vacation packages to enjoy the freedom of driving as fast as they want . off the autobahn , germans unhappy on the road bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new safety campaign aims to get people to be more polite on highways and other roads it 's not so much road rage that is getting on everyone 's nerves , as " road rudeness . "
germany 's transport minister wolfgang tiefensee said the results of the poll are a warning signal , adding that action needed to be taken soon . tiefensee has launched a new campaign encouraging people more consideration to fellow drivers .
to kick off global road safety week , tiefensee unveiled a poster in berlin on this week bearing the slogan : " do you have strength of character ?
drive responsibly . " some 800 posters will go up on billboards along highways around the country .
one of the faces of the campaign is high-profile german soccer international philipp lahm .
in using celebrities to present their message , the ministry is hoping to get through to young drivers in particular . new drivers are dangerous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower blood-alcohol limits will apply to new drivers the transport ministry study showed young men who have just received their driver 's licenses are primarily responsible for the increasing aggression on the road .
they are also the drivers involved in or responsible for serious or fatal accidents in disproportionately high numbers . over 1,000 out of 5,000 people who died in traffic accidents in 2005 were young drivers .
drivers between 18 and 25 years old make up over 30 percent of alcohol-related accidents . tiefensee also said stricter drinking limits are now in place for new drivers .
a new law to go into effect at the end of the summer bans any drinking for drivers in their first two years . harsh penalties to send a message offenders caught with traces of alcohol in their blood will face a fine of 125 euros -lrb- $ 160 -rrb- and have their names registered in an index of traffic offenders .
in addition , they will have their license probation period extended by four years and will have to complete a course on behavior in traffic at a cost of 450 euros . for drivers who 've had their licenses for longer than two years , a blood alcohol limit of 0.5 milligrams per milliliter of blood will apply .
that is about two small beers or a shot of hard liquor . dw staff -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de angry german drivers take revenge on speed cameras german motorists bent on revenge have begun setting speed cameras mounted on poles on fire .

the 24-year old german-born turk was a prisoner in guantanamo bay and the subject of a legal battle with the german government of the time , who , according to kurnaz , failed to secure his release when they had the chance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us was prepared to release kurnaz from guantanamo in 2002 his memoir , entitled " five years of my life , " which hit german bookstands on tuesday , paints a disturbing picture of kurnaz ' ordeal . " i understood a long time ago what this prison was about , " kurnaz said .
" they could do with us whatever they wanted . " kurnaz was arrested in pakistan shortly after the sept .
11 attacks on the united states .
kurnaz insists he did n't travel to pakistan to fight alongside al qaeda , but rather to work for an islamic " salvation army " to help the homeless , among others .
kurnaz claims he was " sold " to us soldiers by unscrupulous bounty hunters .
he was then taken to afghanistan , where he faced torturous interrogations . no help from germany according to his own account , kurnaz was left for days to hang by his hands that were tied behind his back and that were attached to electrodes .
he hoped in vain that the german authorities would help him out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily said the german government did what it had to do to protect its citizens " one of the german soldiers came , pulled my head up and asked if i knew who they were , " kurnaz said .
" he said they were the elite force , the ksk , and slammed my head on the floor .
later another one came up and kicked me and the group of soldiers started laughing . " kurnaz was subsequently transported to guantanamo .
in the book , he accuses the us soldiers there of gross maltreatment .
he describes how doctors would make unnecessary amputations and how guards would hand out regular beatings .
kurnaz himself spent over a year in solitary confinement , suffering from extreme cold , heat , darkness and oxygen deprivation . " i never imagined i would come out of it alive , " kurnaz said .
" i presumed i could die at any minute .
i was often unconscious due to the pain and the cold .
my body could n't take any more . " personal intervention # b # it was n't until august 2006 that the newly elected chancellor angela merkel intervened personally to secure kurnaz ' release from guantanamo .
the us was reportedly prepared to release him as early as 2002 , but the germans were allegedly reluctant to allow him to return to germany at the time - a fact that sparked uproar and prompted a parliamentary inquiry . the question whether kurnaz did represent a terror threat and whether the government of the time should have done more to free him is the subject of an ongoing investigation .
according to former interior minister otto schily , however , the social democratic-green party government coalition headed by gerhard schröder responded adequately to the situation . " we have a responsibility for the safety of our citizens , " schily said .
" and that includes keeping people out of our country who represent a danger to our security .
and that was the case with murat kurnaz . " now back in his home city of bremen , kurnaz says he just wants to get on with his life .

the 24-year old german-born turk was a prisoner in guantanamo bay and the subject of a legal battle with the german government of the time , who , according to kurnaz , failed to secure his release when they had the chance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us was prepared to release kurnaz from guantanamo in 2002 his memoir , entitled " five years of my life , " which hit german bookstands on tuesday , paints a disturbing picture of kurnaz ' ordeal . " i understood a long time ago what this prison was about , " kurnaz said .
" they could do with us whatever they wanted . " kurnaz was arrested in pakistan shortly after the sept .
11 attacks on the united states .
kurnaz insists he did n't travel to pakistan to fight alongside al qaeda , but rather to work for an islamic " salvation army " to help the homeless , among others .
kurnaz claims he was " sold " to us soldiers by unscrupulous bounty hunters .
he was then taken to afghanistan , where he faced torturous interrogations . no help from germany according to his own account , kurnaz was left for days to hang by his hands that were tied behind his back and that were attached to electrodes .
he hoped in vain that the german authorities would help him out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily said the german government did what it had to do to protect its citizens " one of the german soldiers came , pulled my head up and asked if i knew who they were , " kurnaz said .
" he said they were the elite force , the ksk , and slammed my head on the floor .
later another one came up and kicked me and the group of soldiers started laughing . " kurnaz was subsequently transported to guantanamo .
in the book , he accuses the us soldiers there of gross maltreatment .
he describes how doctors would make unnecessary amputations and how guards would hand out regular beatings .
kurnaz himself spent over a year in solitary confinement , suffering from extreme cold , heat , darkness and oxygen deprivation . " i never imagined i would come out of it alive , " kurnaz said .
" i presumed i could die at any minute .
i was often unconscious due to the pain and the cold .
my body could n't take any more . " personal intervention # b # it was n't until august 2006 that the newly elected chancellor angela merkel intervened personally to secure kurnaz ' release from guantanamo .
the us was reportedly prepared to release him as early as 2002 , but the germans were allegedly reluctant to allow him to return to germany at the time - a fact that sparked uproar and prompted a parliamentary inquiry . the question whether kurnaz did represent a terror threat and whether the government of the time should have done more to free him is the subject of an ongoing investigation .
according to former interior minister otto schily , however , the social democratic-green party government coalition headed by gerhard schröder responded adequately to the situation . " we have a responsibility for the safety of our citizens , " schily said .
" and that includes keeping people out of our country who represent a danger to our security .
and that was the case with murat kurnaz . " now back in his home city of bremen , kurnaz says he just wants to get on with his life .
he says the book is not intended to settle any scores , but rather to tell the world how his co-prisoners lost their legs , hands and lives in guantanamo bay . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : steinmeier 's record is blemished germany 's foreign minister has denied he caused an innocent german-born turk to be imprisoned for years at the us guantanamo bay prison .

it evokes memories of a singular triumph and a tradition of failure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " hard rock hallelujah " was the winning song in 2006 contrary to popular belief , germany is a land of dreamers .
every year , come springtime , when bees , educated fleas , lithuanians and letts start fantasizing of falling in love , germans subject themselves to tantalizing rituals of wishful thinking , childish petulance and utter masochism by posing the " big " national question : " could we - this year perhaps , or even ever again - really win the eurovision song contest ? " eurovision is a remarkable european tradition .
not only is it still the largest music event in the world , it is also a telling indicator of the changing image and notion of what europe is . in contrast to the elegant , black-tie affair which it was in the 1950s , eurovision is nowadays a celebration of gory exaggeration - a musical circus act that inspires national passions , instigates unusual political alliances and offers more surprising twists and turns than any modern-day casting show could ever hope to achieve . an international musical battlefield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : times have changed : transvestite singer verka serduchka will sing for ukraine this year it is a battlefield of musical styles in which ukrainian drag queens can perform along with spanish boy bands , israeli comedy acts , norwegian senior citizens and a host of irreparably gloomy songs from the balkans . it is also the only democratic competition in the world in which a handful of televoting monegasques and a couple of dozens of andorrans have the same influence on the outcome as millions of germans or spaniards . and it is a rare event at which eastern european voters legally get to gang up on the west and divide most of the votes among themselves . germany 's meager record germany 's path to eurovision glory has been laden with thorns rather than rose petals .

" we can not stagnate now , " said merkel , who currently holds the presidency of both the g8 and european union , titles that lend her a wide degree of international agenda-setting power .
" we have made clear there will be continuity .
we are going to take things up where gleneagles ended . " one of the targets that emerged from the gleneagles summit was a promise to double development aid to africa by 2010 .
merkel said that vow should be fulfilled before new promises are made at the german g8 summit in june , where she has promised to make africa a major topic . merkel : the goals have been set bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has promised to make aid for africa a key issue at the g8 summit " we do not need to hold any additional conferences now to define goals , " she said .
" now we need to make a certain amount of progress . " merkel highlighted the use of micro-credits in africa , adding that not only the amount of money reaching the continent was important but also the instruments used to distribute it . blair said europe would suffer from " poverty , conflict , mass migration and the spread of terrorism " if it did not act to help solve africa 's problems . " there has been an immense amount of progress , but we know there 's a tremendous amount that has yet to be done , " blair said .
" there are far too many africans who die when their death is preventable with the right help . " annan said international efforts to aid africa needed to continue and pointed out that many of the continent 's nations broke free of their past military rulers .
the former un head is now leading the african progress panel , which is set up to monitor industrialized nations progress on reaching development targets . " unless we step up our efforts ... we will not make the -lrb- gleneagles -rrb- target , " he said . annan said he believed war in europe was now unthinkable and that he hoped that in a generation the same would be true in africa . eu constitution could become treaty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu fell into a " period of reflection " after the constitutional treaty was rejected in addition to development aid , merkel and blair also discussed differences within europe on the stalled constitutional process . blair said the intention had always been to " come back " to the constitutional issue after a " period of reflection " following the rejection of the constitution by french and dutch voters in referenda two years ago . " it 's fairly obvious that in europe there are different perspectives and different positions , " the outgoing prime minister said .
" we 've got to see whether it 's possible to reach agreement to allow europe to work effectively and move forward .

only once in the last five decades did germany actually win the competition - on april 24 , 1982 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it still fits !
nicole likes to show off her victory dress wearing a glittery black dress and playing a white guitar that screamed 80s kitsch in several languages , 17-year-old nicole won a landslide victory for the teutons by asking for " ein bisschen frieden " -lrb- a little bit of peace -rrb- at the time when the cold war was still a reality and margaret thatcher busy pursuing her argentinean military adventure in the falklands . nicole sang about being " just a girl who says what she feels " and " helpless like a bird against the wind " while europe - no matter how strange that may seem today - decided that the catholic schoolgirl look was a very in look that year , albeit , as one can now safely tell from a quarter-century distance , in a sad reject sort of way . nicole went on to sell millions of records , becoming eventually the uncrowned queen of the german schlager , the original pop-folk hybrid of the beer-garden variety that has been , much to the chagrin of iberian sophisticates , successfully exported to majorcan bars and discos catering to the german clientele as well .
good-bye , flamenco and hello , singing fräulein ! same old story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is europe ready for a retro hit from germany ?
germany won second place on four occasions and came third no less than five times , but it also came last in 2005 when a modern-day casting show product gracia failed to comprehend that she was actually supposed to sing the actual notes that the composer wrote for her . the shame of coming last two years ago is still like an open wound in the german national consciousness .
nicole , who is these days respectably 42 years old and still riding high on her historic victory , still treasures her eurovision dress and the famous white guitar .
she also likes to point out that after all these years , the dress still fits her - which is , indeed , quite an achievement . but it 's probably lonely at the top .
will any other german ever manage to join nicole on the german eurotrash olymp ?
all eyes and ears are now set on germany 's darling swinging kid roger cicero and his feminist hit " frauen regieren die welt " -lrb- women rule the world -rrb- . europe had a weird infatuation with heavy metal last year - when a scary band of noise-producing finnish vampires won against all logic and good sense - but is the old continent ready to go retro this year when representatives from 42 countries gather in helsinki in may ? in the demonically possessed world of hardcore eurovision fans , hope dies last . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nationalists , russia find ukraine 's eurovision song quite a drag ukraine 's eurovision song contest entry is causing friction at home and abroad .
verka serduchka is accused by nationalists of enforcing negative ukrainian stereotypes while the russians see her song as a political snub .

but you ca n't say the germans are not trying .

it evokes memories of a singular triumph and a tradition of failure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " hard rock hallelujah " was the winning song in 2006 contrary to popular belief , germany is a land of dreamers .
every year , come springtime , when bees , educated fleas , lithuanians and letts start fantasizing of falling in love , germans subject themselves to tantalizing rituals of wishful thinking , childish petulance and utter masochism by posing the " big " national question : " could we - this year perhaps , or even ever again - really win the eurovision song contest ? " eurovision is a remarkable european tradition .
not only is it still the largest music event in the world , it is also a telling indicator of the changing image and notion of what europe is . in contrast to the elegant , black-tie affair which it was in the 1950s , eurovision is nowadays a celebration of gory exaggeration - a musical circus act that inspires national passions , instigates unusual political alliances and offers more surprising twists and turns than any modern-day casting show could ever hope to achieve . an international musical battlefield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : times have changed : transvestite singer verka serduchka will sing for ukraine this year it is a battlefield of musical styles in which ukrainian drag queens can perform along with spanish boy bands , israeli comedy acts , norwegian senior citizens and a host of irreparably gloomy songs from the balkans . it is also the only democratic competition in the world in which a handful of televoting monegasques and a couple of dozens of andorrans have the same influence on the outcome as millions of germans or spaniards . and it is a rare event at which eastern european voters legally get to gang up on the west and divide most of the votes among themselves . germany 's meager record germany 's path to eurovision glory has been laden with thorns rather than rose petals .
only once in the last five decades did germany actually win the competition - on april 24 , 1982 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it still fits !
nicole likes to show off her victory dress wearing a glittery black dress and playing a white guitar that screamed 80s kitsch in several languages , 17-year-old nicole won a landslide victory for the teutons by asking for " ein bisschen frieden " -lrb- a little bit of peace -rrb- at the time when the cold war was still a reality and margaret thatcher busy pursuing her argentinean military adventure in the falklands . nicole sang about being " just a girl who says what she feels " and " helpless like a bird against the wind " while europe - no matter how strange that may seem today - decided that the catholic schoolgirl look was a very in look that year , albeit , as one can now safely tell from a quarter-century distance , in a sad reject sort of way . nicole went on to sell millions of records , becoming eventually the uncrowned queen of the german schlager , the original pop-folk hybrid of the beer-garden variety that has been , much to the chagrin of iberian sophisticates , successfully exported to majorcan bars and discos catering to the german clientele as well .
good-bye , flamenco and hello , singing fräulein ! same old story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is europe ready for a retro hit from germany ?
germany won second place on four occasions and came third no less than five times , but it also came last in 2005 when a modern-day casting show product gracia failed to comprehend that she was actually supposed to sing the actual notes that the composer wrote for her . the shame of coming last two years ago is still like an open wound in the german national consciousness .
nicole , who is these days respectably 42 years old and still riding high on her historic victory , still treasures her eurovision dress and the famous white guitar .
she also likes to point out that after all these years , the dress still fits her - which is , indeed , quite an achievement . but it 's probably lonely at the top .
will any other german ever manage to join nicole on the german eurotrash olymp ?
all eyes and ears are now set on germany 's darling swinging kid roger cicero and his feminist hit " frauen regieren die welt " -lrb- women rule the world -rrb- . europe had a weird infatuation with heavy metal last year - when a scary band of noise-producing finnish vampires won against all logic and good sense - but is the old continent ready to go retro this year when representatives from 42 countries gather in helsinki in may ? in the demonically possessed world of hardcore eurovision fans , hope dies last . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nationalists , russia find ukraine 's eurovision song quite a drag ukraine 's eurovision song contest entry is causing friction at home and abroad .

the federal commissioner for data protection has accused the german government of " culpable neglect " in protecting data privacy .
he said the government should halt plans for greater access to phone and internet records . fundamental civil liberties in germany are increasingly under attack from state authorities and private businesses seeking to snoop into peoples ' lives , said german federal commissioner for data protection peter schaar during an annual data protection presentation in berlin on tuesday . schaar accused security officials of violating the law in their attempts to fight terror , adding that the federal criminal police office had passed on information to germany 's domestic intelligence agency - the federal office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- - that was unnecessary for its fight against terrorism . out of step with technology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commissioner schaar was displeased about government access to personal data schaar said modern technology provides plenty of opportunities for unauthorized access to personal data that had previously been protected under stringent laws .
" data protection laws have not kept up with the advance of technology , " schaar said , calling for an update of data privacy laws .
" complete surveillance is already technologically possible today . "
in addition to technology making it possible to observe people 's actions in the privacy of their homes and offices , he said " businesses can access and exploit that personal data . "
though thorough in his criticism of the government , schaar also put some of the blame for deteriorating privacy at the feet of private individuals , many of whom willing share private information . " there is an exhibitionist tendency among people themselves that makes it easy to glean specific data about them from the internet , " he said .
complaints about violations schaar warned that germany has embarked on the road to an orwellian-style surveillance state that runs counter to the principle of individual freedom and a state based on the rule of law .
the introduction of new anti-terror laws in the wake of the sept .
11 terrorist attacks on the united states , he argued , has led to a situation in which law enforcement officials and intelligence services are illegally exchanging data that should be kept separate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plans to give police automatic access to fingerprints have been scrapped in addition , the commissioner strongly criticized plans for a new law to give authorities greater access to phone and internet records and enabling authorities to access a computer 's contents without the owner 's knowledge .
schaar also criticized a government plan to store the fingerprints of all adult germans in a central database .
after intense debate within the government , german media reported tuesday that plans to store digital fingerprints had been scrapped .
fighting terrorism vs. personal freedoms proponents , including interior minister wolfgang schäuble , have argued the measures schaar criticized are needed to fight terrorism .
the anti-terror measures and wider pre-emptive police powers have met with resistance in germany , which remains particularly sensitive to state surveillance due to the legacy of the nazi regime and former east german secret police . " we must not allow the government to upset the balance between people 's right to security and their freedoms , " schaar said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 24.04.2007 it happened once on the road to eurovision heaven großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 600 million tv viewers watched nicole win the eurovision song contest in 1982 it happened 25 years ago , germany won the eurovision song contest , which is why springtime is such a melancholy season for german music fans .
it evokes memories of a singular triumph and a tradition of failure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " hard rock hallelujah " was the winning song in 2006 contrary to popular belief , germany is a land of dreamers .
every year , come springtime , when bees , educated fleas , lithuanians and letts start fantasizing of falling in love , germans subject themselves to tantalizing rituals of wishful thinking , childish petulance and utter masochism by posing the " big " national question : " could we - this year perhaps , or even ever again - really win the eurovision song contest ? " eurovision is a remarkable european tradition .
not only is it still the largest music event in the world , it is also a telling indicator of the changing image and notion of what europe is . in contrast to the elegant , black-tie affair which it was in the 1950s , eurovision is nowadays a celebration of gory exaggeration - a musical circus act that inspires national passions , instigates unusual political alliances and offers more surprising twists and turns than any modern-day casting show could ever hope to achieve . an international musical battlefield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : times have changed : transvestite singer verka serduchka will sing for ukraine this year it is a battlefield of musical styles in which ukrainian drag queens can perform along with spanish boy bands , israeli comedy acts , norwegian senior citizens and a host of irreparably gloomy songs from the balkans . it is also the only democratic competition in the world in which a handful of televoting monegasques and a couple of dozens of andorrans have the same influence on the outcome as millions of germans or spaniards . and it is a rare event at which eastern european voters legally get to gang up on the west and divide most of the votes among themselves . germany 's meager record germany 's path to eurovision glory has been laden with thorns rather than rose petals .
only once in the last five decades did germany actually win the competition - on april 24 , 1982 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it still fits !
nicole likes to show off her victory dress wearing a glittery black dress and playing a white guitar that screamed 80s kitsch in several languages , 17-year-old nicole won a landslide victory for the teutons by asking for " ein bisschen frieden " -lrb- a little bit of peace -rrb- at the time when the cold war was still a reality and margaret thatcher busy pursuing her argentinean military adventure in the falklands . nicole sang about being " just a girl who says what she feels " and " helpless like a bird against the wind " while europe - no matter how strange that may seem today - decided that the catholic schoolgirl look was a very in look that year , albeit , as one can now safely tell from a quarter-century distance , in a sad reject sort of way . nicole went on to sell millions of records , becoming eventually the uncrowned queen of the german schlager , the original pop-folk hybrid of the beer-garden variety that has been , much to the chagrin of iberian sophisticates , successfully exported to majorcan bars and discos catering to the german clientele as well .
good-bye , flamenco and hello , singing fräulein ! same old story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is europe ready for a retro hit from germany ?
germany won second place on four occasions and came third no less than five times , but it also came last in 2005 when a modern-day casting show product gracia failed to comprehend that she was actually supposed to sing the actual notes that the composer wrote for her . the shame of coming last two years ago is still like an open wound in the german national consciousness .
nicole , who is these days respectably 42 years old and still riding high on her historic victory , still treasures her eurovision dress and the famous white guitar .
she also likes to point out that after all these years , the dress still fits her - which is , indeed , quite an achievement . but it 's probably lonely at the top .
will any other german ever manage to join nicole on the german eurotrash olymp ?
all eyes and ears are now set on germany 's darling swinging kid roger cicero and his feminist hit " frauen regieren die welt " -lrb- women rule the world -rrb- . europe had a weird infatuation with heavy metal last year - when a scary band of noise-producing finnish vampires won against all logic and good sense - but is the old continent ready to go retro this year when representatives from 42 countries gather in helsinki in may ? in the demonically possessed world of hardcore eurovision fans , hope dies last . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nationalists , russia find ukraine 's eurovision song quite a drag ukraine 's eurovision song contest entry is causing friction at home and abroad .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 24.04.2007 imprisoned german terrorist receives day-outing ops großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former raf terrorist christian klar a german court on tuesday granted prison day releases to a former red army faction militant after 24 years of imprisonment .
this comes amid a raging debate over new revelations about the group 's terror campaign . the regional court in the southwestern city of karlsruhe approved outings with a court-appointed chaperone beginning in july for christian klar , who has been serving a life term for his role in several murders with the urban red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- guerrilla group .
klar 's attorney had issued a formal complaint after authorities in february rejected his appeal for more lenient prison conditions because he had recently made fiery anti-capitalist remarks .
in those remarks , he spoke of the " defeat of capitalism " and said europe was being ruled by an imperial alliance .
klar , who is eligible for early release in 2009 , has also appealed to german president horst köhler for clemency .
this is strongly opposed by most of the families of his victims because he has never expressed regret for the murders .
gripped by a violent history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klar is in prison in bruchsal , southern germany german media have been gripped by the former leftist militant 's fate for months , questioning whether the country is ready to draw a line under the bloody raf campaign of killings and kidnappings that shook the nation to its core .
klar was jailed for a series of killings , including the shooting of federal prosecutor siegfried buback , during the raf 's violent campaign against what it called the oppressive capitalist west german state and elite in the 1970s and early 1980s .

this comes amid a raging debate over new revelations about the group 's terror campaign . the regional court in the southwestern city of karlsruhe approved outings with a court-appointed chaperone beginning in july for christian klar , who has been serving a life term for his role in several murders with the urban red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- guerrilla group .

in those remarks , he spoke of the " defeat of capitalism " and said europe was being ruled by an imperial alliance .
klar , who is eligible for early release in 2009 , has also appealed to german president horst köhler for clemency .
this is strongly opposed by most of the families of his victims because he has never expressed regret for the murders .

the 24-year old german-born turk was a prisoner in guantanamo bay and the subject of a legal battle with the german government of the time , who , according to kurnaz , failed to secure his release when they had the chance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us was prepared to release kurnaz from guantanamo in 2002 his memoir , entitled " five years of my life , " which hit german bookstands on tuesday , paints a disturbing picture of kurnaz ' ordeal . " i understood a long time ago what this prison was about , " kurnaz said .
" they could do with us whatever they wanted . " kurnaz was arrested in pakistan shortly after the sept .
11 attacks on the united states .
kurnaz insists he did n't travel to pakistan to fight alongside al qaeda , but rather to work for an islamic " salvation army " to help the homeless , among others .
kurnaz claims he was " sold " to us soldiers by unscrupulous bounty hunters .
he was then taken to afghanistan , where he faced torturous interrogations . no help from germany according to his own account , kurnaz was left for days to hang by his hands that were tied behind his back and that were attached to electrodes .
he hoped in vain that the german authorities would help him out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily said the german government did what it had to do to protect its citizens " one of the german soldiers came , pulled my head up and asked if i knew who they were , " kurnaz said .
" he said they were the elite force , the ksk , and slammed my head on the floor .
later another one came up and kicked me and the group of soldiers started laughing . " kurnaz was subsequently transported to guantanamo .
in the book , he accuses the us soldiers there of gross maltreatment .

" my brother abdullah gül , with whom we established this movement -lrb- the governing justice and development party , akp -rrb- ... is the person who emerged at the end of our evaluations as the candidate to become turkey 's 11th president , " erdogan told the akp group in parliament in ankara .
" the people have seen the services that -lrb- gül -rrb- has done for his country , " erdogan also told the akp .
erdogan had been widely expected to run for the post , but the prospect sparked harsh objections from secularists .
they say the former islamist , who now describes himself as a conservative democrat , is a divisive figure with no true commitment to the mainly muslim nation 's secular system .
gul has been foreign minister since 2003 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah gul is also currently deputy prime minister the 56-year-old gül , who is also a deputy prime minister , is virtually certain to become president thanks to the comfortable majority of 353 seats that the akp holds in the 550-member parliament , which elects the president for a single , seven-year term .
he is unlikely to get the post in the first two rounds of voting , when a two-thirds majority of 367 is required , but is a shoo-in for the third or fourth round , when a simple majority of 276 suffices .
the first round is scheduled for this friday , the second for may 2 , the third for may 9 and the fourth for may 15 .
outgoing president ahmet necdet sezer 's mandate expires on may 16 .
gül is a former academic and banker who became a member of parliament in 1991 .
he and erdogan helped establish the mildly islamist akp , splitting from a group of hardliners .
the ak party was elected to government in 2002 and gül became prime minister for four months before stepping down once ak party leader erdogan secured a seat in parliament .

dw-world.de talked to the 21-year-old about his meteoric rise and his future ambitions . dw-world.de : mario , when are we going to see you on the pitch again ? mario gomez : i ca n't say at the moment .
i 'm working up to seven hours a day to get my fitness back .
but i 'm definitely not going to rush things . before you suffered a knee injury on march 11 , everything was going great .
you were the top goal-getter in the bundesliga , stuttgart was at the top of the table , and you had made your debut in the german national team .
will you have to start from scratch ? i definitely wo n't have to start from scratch .
but it would be arrogant to think that i 'll have the same form i had before i got hurt . you teammates in stuttgart have been scoring lots of goals in your absence .
do you feel like the team needs you less ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gomez 's is one of germany 's most technically proficient strikers not at all .
i 'm happy for them .
it does n't matter who scores the goals .
the main thing is that we 're successful as a team . next season you could be playing with stuttgart in the champions league and with the german national team at euro 2008 .
are you hoping to make a name for yourself on the european stage ? if someone had told me before the start of this season that i 'd score 13 goals and play for germany , i would have laughed in his face .
i do n't like putting myself under pressure .
i just want to get healthy again and improve as a player . you 're considered a natural talent .
but how much of that is hard work ? i have some natural ability , but i also work hard on my weaknesses . what are your weaknesses ? above all : staying calm in front of the goal .
sometimes i also let my opponent get the better of me in one-on-one situations .
i try to address these deficiencies every time i practice . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gomez got stuttgart off to a good start - now they 're bidding for the champions league do you think you have a guaranteed spot in germany 's euro 2008 squad ? getting injured has shown me how fast things can change .
so i 'm not thinking ahead at all to the european championship next year . are you staying in stuttgart ?
there have been reports of offers from foreign clubs , for example , juventus and ac milan . of course i 'm staying at stuttgart .
i just extended my contract to 2011 . so you do n't dream of playing in spain 's primera division ? my favorite club is barcelona .
it would be a dream come true to play for them . you come from a mixed german-spanish background and have two mexican teammates at stuttgart , ricardo osorio and pavel pardo .
do you speak to them in spanish ? both of them speak good german , and they 're getting better every day .

dw-world.de talked to the 21-year-old about his meteoric rise and his future ambitions . dw-world.de : mario , when are we going to see you on the pitch again ? mario gomez : i ca n't say at the moment .
i 'm working up to seven hours a day to get my fitness back .
but i 'm definitely not going to rush things . before you suffered a knee injury on march 11 , everything was going great .
you were the top goal-getter in the bundesliga , stuttgart was at the top of the table , and you had made your debut in the german national team .
will you have to start from scratch ? i definitely wo n't have to start from scratch .
but it would be arrogant to think that i 'll have the same form i had before i got hurt . you teammates in stuttgart have been scoring lots of goals in your absence .
do you feel like the team needs you less ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gomez 's is one of germany 's most technically proficient strikers not at all .
i 'm happy for them .
it does n't matter who scores the goals .
the main thing is that we 're successful as a team . next season you could be playing with stuttgart in the champions league and with the german national team at euro 2008 .
are you hoping to make a name for yourself on the european stage ? if someone had told me before the start of this season that i 'd score 13 goals and play for germany , i would have laughed in his face .
i do n't like putting myself under pressure .
i just want to get healthy again and improve as a player . you 're considered a natural talent .
but how much of that is hard work ? i have some natural ability , but i also work hard on my weaknesses . what are your weaknesses ? above all : staying calm in front of the goal .
sometimes i also let my opponent get the better of me in one-on-one situations .

there have been reports of offers from foreign clubs , for example , juventus and ac milan . of course i 'm staying at stuttgart .
i just extended my contract to 2011 . so you do n't dream of playing in spain 's primera division ? my favorite club is barcelona .
it would be a dream come true to play for them . you come from a mixed german-spanish background and have two mexican teammates at stuttgart , ricardo osorio and pavel pardo .
do you speak to them in spanish ? both of them speak good german , and they 're getting better every day .

according to a survey conducted for the german transport ministry , over 80 percent of drivers on german roads say other drivers have become increasingly rude , and the government has decided to take action . the people polled said drivers are more inconsiderate than they used to be , with women and older drivers feeling particularly annoyed by impolite drivers and those who drive very fast , the transport ministry 's survey showed . germany is famed for its fast cars and high speed highways - the autobahn , stretches of which do not have speed limits . the country even attracts international auto-tourists , who book special vacation packages to enjoy the freedom of driving as fast as they want . off the autobahn , germans unhappy on the road bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new safety campaign aims to get people to be more polite on highways and other roads it 's not so much road rage that is getting on everyone 's nerves , as " road rudeness . "
germany 's transport minister wolfgang tiefensee said the results of the poll are a warning signal , adding that action needed to be taken soon . tiefensee has launched a new campaign encouraging people more consideration to fellow drivers .
to kick off global road safety week , tiefensee unveiled a poster in berlin on this week bearing the slogan : " do you have strength of character ?
drive responsibly . " some 800 posters will go up on billboards along highways around the country .
one of the faces of the campaign is high-profile german soccer international philipp lahm .
in using celebrities to present their message , the ministry is hoping to get through to young drivers in particular . new drivers are dangerous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower blood-alcohol limits will apply to new drivers the transport ministry study showed young men who have just received their driver 's licenses are primarily responsible for the increasing aggression on the road .
they are also the drivers involved in or responsible for serious or fatal accidents in disproportionately high numbers . over 1,000 out of 5,000 people who died in traffic accidents in 2005 were young drivers .
drivers between 18 and 25 years old make up over 30 percent of alcohol-related accidents . tiefensee also said stricter drinking limits are now in place for new drivers .
a new law to go into effect at the end of the summer bans any drinking for drivers in their first two years . harsh penalties to send a message offenders caught with traces of alcohol in their blood will face a fine of 125 euros -lrb- $ 160 -rrb- and have their names registered in an index of traffic offenders .
in addition , they will have their license probation period extended by four years and will have to complete a course on behavior in traffic at a cost of 450 euros . for drivers who 've had their licenses for longer than two years , a blood alcohol limit of 0.5 milligrams per milliliter of blood will apply .
that is about two small beers or a shot of hard liquor . dw staff -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de angry german drivers take revenge on speed cameras german motorists bent on revenge have begun setting speed cameras mounted on poles on fire .

dw-world.de talked to the 21-year-old about his meteoric rise and his future ambitions . dw-world.de : mario , when are we going to see you on the pitch again ? mario gomez : i ca n't say at the moment .
i 'm working up to seven hours a day to get my fitness back .
but i 'm definitely not going to rush things . before you suffered a knee injury on march 11 , everything was going great .
you were the top goal-getter in the bundesliga , stuttgart was at the top of the table , and you had made your debut in the german national team .
will you have to start from scratch ? i definitely wo n't have to start from scratch .
but it would be arrogant to think that i 'll have the same form i had before i got hurt . you teammates in stuttgart have been scoring lots of goals in your absence .
do you feel like the team needs you less ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gomez 's is one of germany 's most technically proficient strikers not at all .
i 'm happy for them .
it does n't matter who scores the goals .
the main thing is that we 're successful as a team . next season you could be playing with stuttgart in the champions league and with the german national team at euro 2008 .
are you hoping to make a name for yourself on the european stage ? if someone had told me before the start of this season that i 'd score 13 goals and play for germany , i would have laughed in his face .
i do n't like putting myself under pressure .
i just want to get healthy again and improve as a player . you 're considered a natural talent .
but how much of that is hard work ? i have some natural ability , but i also work hard on my weaknesses . what are your weaknesses ? above all : staying calm in front of the goal .
sometimes i also let my opponent get the better of me in one-on-one situations .
i try to address these deficiencies every time i practice . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gomez got stuttgart off to a good start - now they 're bidding for the champions league do you think you have a guaranteed spot in germany 's euro 2008 squad ? getting injured has shown me how fast things can change .
so i 'm not thinking ahead at all to the european championship next year . are you staying in stuttgart ?
there have been reports of offers from foreign clubs , for example , juventus and ac milan . of course i 'm staying at stuttgart .
i just extended my contract to 2011 . so you do n't dream of playing in spain 's primera division ? my favorite club is barcelona .
it would be a dream come true to play for them . you come from a mixed german-spanish background and have two mexican teammates at stuttgart , ricardo osorio and pavel pardo .
do you speak to them in spanish ? both of them speak good german , and they 're getting better every day .
but sometimes we do talk to each other in spanish . so where will stuttgart end up this season .
will you win the league or the german cup ? if only i knew -lrb- laughs -rrb- … mario gomez was interviewed by daniel martinez send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stuttgart beat wolves to keep double chances alive a 1-0 win at wolfsburg on wednesday put stuttgart in the german cup final in may and boosted their momentum going into a must-win league match against bayern munich this weekend .

" those foreigners who are well-integrated , speak the german language and have an income of their own should be offered german citizenship , " stegner told the weekly bild am sonntag .
" and that without the precondition of having to relinquish their original nationality first . "
latest available statistics show that in 2005 only about 110,000 foreigners applied to become german nationals - a drop by almost 60 percent compared with the year 2000 when figures peaked in postwar germany .
at that time the previous spd-led government made it easier for germany 's four million foreigners to become citizens of this country .
conservative backlash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ralf stegner wants to make it easier for foreigners to become german citizens the introduction of dual citizenship , however , was prevented by the country 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
a nationwide signature campaign spearheaded by cdu state premier roland koch stopped a more far-reaching citizenship reform .
the powerful regional leader is again stonewalling against softening citizenship laws .
" the conditions for granting german citizenship must remain crystal clear , " koch said .
" the majority population must be sure that applicants integrate and accept german life as it is .
citizenship is a manifestation that should not be made easy and dual citizenship must remain an exception rather than the rule . "
bloodlines and ethnicity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conservatives such as roland koch are generally opposed to a far-reaching citizenship reform nationality in germany is still largely based on bloodlines .
critics denounce this arguing that ethnic germans from the former soviet union who know just little about life here automatically receive citizenship while children of immigrants born in germany are technically foreigners .
current laws , they say , are a slap in the face especially of turks here who have strong links to their country and religion .
" certainly , the more muslims have a german passport the better they know who to vote for , " said abdul hadi hoffmann , deputy head of the berlin-based muslim academy .
" so we do encourage muslims to participate in german society and politics , " he added .
" however , if someone decides to lead his family life , earn a living and not spend his evenings in a bar drinking beer , this is not a sign of isolation and of being against the german state . "
the debate unleashed by germany 's social democrats comes at a time when less turkish nationals living in germany opt to become citizens of their host country .
this number has dropped by amore than half recently from 103,000 applicants in 1999 to merely 44,000 last year .

the federal commissioner for data protection has accused the german government of " culpable neglect " in protecting data privacy .
he said the government should halt plans for greater access to phone and internet records . fundamental civil liberties in germany are increasingly under attack from state authorities and private businesses seeking to snoop into peoples ' lives , said german federal commissioner for data protection peter schaar during an annual data protection presentation in berlin on tuesday . schaar accused security officials of violating the law in their attempts to fight terror , adding that the federal criminal police office had passed on information to germany 's domestic intelligence agency - the federal office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- - that was unnecessary for its fight against terrorism . out of step with technology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commissioner schaar was displeased about government access to personal data schaar said modern technology provides plenty of opportunities for unauthorized access to personal data that had previously been protected under stringent laws .
" data protection laws have not kept up with the advance of technology , " schaar said , calling for an update of data privacy laws .
" complete surveillance is already technologically possible today . "
in addition to technology making it possible to observe people 's actions in the privacy of their homes and offices , he said " businesses can access and exploit that personal data . "
though thorough in his criticism of the government , schaar also put some of the blame for deteriorating privacy at the feet of private individuals , many of whom willing share private information . " there is an exhibitionist tendency among people themselves that makes it easy to glean specific data about them from the internet , " he said .
complaints about violations schaar warned that germany has embarked on the road to an orwellian-style surveillance state that runs counter to the principle of individual freedom and a state based on the rule of law .
the introduction of new anti-terror laws in the wake of the sept .
11 terrorist attacks on the united states , he argued , has led to a situation in which law enforcement officials and intelligence services are illegally exchanging data that should be kept separate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plans to give police automatic access to fingerprints have been scrapped in addition , the commissioner strongly criticized plans for a new law to give authorities greater access to phone and internet records and enabling authorities to access a computer 's contents without the owner 's knowledge .
schaar also criticized a government plan to store the fingerprints of all adult germans in a central database .
after intense debate within the government , german media reported tuesday that plans to store digital fingerprints had been scrapped .
fighting terrorism vs. personal freedoms proponents , including interior minister wolfgang schäuble , have argued the measures schaar criticized are needed to fight terrorism .
the anti-terror measures and wider pre-emptive police powers have met with resistance in germany , which remains particularly sensitive to state surveillance due to the legacy of the nazi regime and former east german secret police . " we must not allow the government to upset the balance between people 's right to security and their freedoms , " schaar said .
" unfortunately , i have the impression that the government is bent on tipping the scale against civil liberties . " uwe hessler -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german interior minister described as " security risk " interior minister schäuble 's plans to do away with the presumption of innocence for terror suspects have caused consternation in germany , with some politicians saying the proposed measures are reaching draconian levels .
-lrb- 19.04.2007 -rrb- eu watchdog criticizes police data-sharing plan the european union 's data protection watchdog has criticized plans to introduce a bloc-wide system of sharing police data , warning the public would have insufficient protection .
-lrb- 12.04.2007 -rrb- in germany , new anti-terrorism database stirs controversy germany 's first single database from which both police and intelligence officials can tap information about terrorism suspects went into operation friday .
but critics say the measure could erode civil liberties .

" we can not stagnate now , " said merkel , who currently holds the presidency of both the g8 and european union , titles that lend her a wide degree of international agenda-setting power .
" we have made clear there will be continuity .
we are going to take things up where gleneagles ended . " one of the targets that emerged from the gleneagles summit was a promise to double development aid to africa by 2010 .

" now we need to make a certain amount of progress .

" there has been an immense amount of progress , but we know there 's a tremendous amount that has yet to be done , " blair said .
" there are far too many africans who die when their death is preventable with the right help . " annan said international efforts to aid africa needed to continue and pointed out that many of the continent 's nations broke free of their past military rulers .
the former un head is now leading the african progress panel , which is set up to monitor industrialized nations progress on reaching development targets .

" it 's fairly obvious that in europe there are different perspectives and different positions , " the outgoing prime minister said .
" we 've got to see whether it 's possible to reach agreement to allow europe to work effectively and move forward .

by calling it a " treaty , " the current german eu presidency has begun reviving the stalled approval process for a new constitution for the union .
but not everyone is happy about the strategy . chancellor angela merkel and other german officials are currently in talks with representatives from the bloc 's other 26 members to try and hammer out an agreement before the german presidency ends at the end of june .
by leaving the word " constitution " out of the discussion , merkel hopes to get her colleagues to agree on a document that lacks the grave connotations and still manages to give the eu an improved voting system based largely on population size , a president and a foreign minister - even though they might not be called that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been discussing the idea with euroskeptics such as klaus " i consider it likely that symbolic elements like the words ' constitution ' or ' constitutional ' or the title ' foreign minister ' will not be in the new treaty , " czech negotiator jan zahradil told reuters news service after merkel met czech president vaclav klaus , a euroskeptic , last week .
" maybe the position will be there without the title of minister , " he added .
points of dispute according to zahradil , german officials have come up with 12 so-called " points of dispute " that will be the focus of any further discussions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could this dutch cow be convinced of the benefits of a treaty ?
according to diplomats cited by reuters , these points include the future of a charter of fundamental rights , which britain and the netherlands do not support .
also up for debate are plans to extend majority decision-making to justice and security issues .
german officials also want to include stronger references to energy security and climate change and give greater importance to social issues - a french request .
merkel 's efforts are backed by people such as outgoing british premier tony blair , who has been talking about a " simplified treaty " that would allow eu members to reach a swift agreement .
no mini-treaty but supporters of an eu consitution , such as belgian premier guy verhofstadt , have said that they are unwilling to back a watered-down document .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guy verhofstadt wants the real thing " we ca n't just follow the proposal of some states and wipe the slate clean of the constitutional treaty , " verhofstadt said in a speech at the egmont institute , a foreign policy think-tank , according to reuters .
" let there be no mistake : a mini-treaty is unacceptable , " he added .

by calling it a " treaty , " the current german eu presidency has begun reviving the stalled approval process for a new constitution for the union .
but not everyone is happy about the strategy . chancellor angela merkel and other german officials are currently in talks with representatives from the bloc 's other 26 members to try and hammer out an agreement before the german presidency ends at the end of june .
by leaving the word " constitution " out of the discussion , merkel hopes to get her colleagues to agree on a document that lacks the grave connotations and still manages to give the eu an improved voting system based largely on population size , a president and a foreign minister - even though they might not be called that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been discussing the idea with euroskeptics such as klaus " i consider it likely that symbolic elements like the words ' constitution ' or ' constitutional ' or the title ' foreign minister ' will not be in the new treaty , " czech negotiator jan zahradil told reuters news service after merkel met czech president vaclav klaus , a euroskeptic , last week .
" maybe the position will be there without the title of minister , " he added .
points of dispute according to zahradil , german officials have come up with 12 so-called " points of dispute " that will be the focus of any further discussions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could this dutch cow be convinced of the benefits of a treaty ?
according to diplomats cited by reuters , these points include the future of a charter of fundamental rights , which britain and the netherlands do not support .
also up for debate are plans to extend majority decision-making to justice and security issues .
german officials also want to include stronger references to energy security and climate change and give greater importance to social issues - a french request .
merkel 's efforts are backed by people such as outgoing british premier tony blair , who has been talking about a " simplified treaty " that would allow eu members to reach a swift agreement .
no mini-treaty but supporters of an eu consitution , such as belgian premier guy verhofstadt , have said that they are unwilling to back a watered-down document .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guy verhofstadt wants the real thing " we ca n't just follow the proposal of some states and wipe the slate clean of the constitutional treaty , " verhofstadt said in a speech at the egmont institute , a foreign policy think-tank , according to reuters .
" let there be no mistake : a mini-treaty is unacceptable , " he added .
it 's unlikely that merkel will be able to go beyond initial talks during her time as eu president , however : diplomats expect an intergovernmental conference to take place under the portuguese eu presidency in october , reuters reported .

according to a survey conducted for the german transport ministry , over 80 percent of drivers on german roads say other drivers have become increasingly rude , and the government has decided to take action . the people polled said drivers are more inconsiderate than they used to be , with women and older drivers feeling particularly annoyed by impolite drivers and those who drive very fast , the transport ministry 's survey showed . germany is famed for its fast cars and high speed highways - the autobahn , stretches of which do not have speed limits . the country even attracts international auto-tourists , who book special vacation packages to enjoy the freedom of driving as fast as they want . off the autobahn , germans unhappy on the road bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new safety campaign aims to get people to be more polite on highways and other roads it 's not so much road rage that is getting on everyone 's nerves , as " road rudeness . "
germany 's transport minister wolfgang tiefensee said the results of the poll are a warning signal , adding that action needed to be taken soon . tiefensee has launched a new campaign encouraging people more consideration to fellow drivers .
to kick off global road safety week , tiefensee unveiled a poster in berlin on this week bearing the slogan : " do you have strength of character ?
drive responsibly . " some 800 posters will go up on billboards along highways around the country .
one of the faces of the campaign is high-profile german soccer international philipp lahm .
in using celebrities to present their message , the ministry is hoping to get through to young drivers in particular . new drivers are dangerous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lower blood-alcohol limits will apply to new drivers the transport ministry study showed young men who have just received their driver 's licenses are primarily responsible for the increasing aggression on the road .
they are also the drivers involved in or responsible for serious or fatal accidents in disproportionately high numbers . over 1,000 out of 5,000 people who died in traffic accidents in 2005 were young drivers .
drivers between 18 and 25 years old make up over 30 percent of alcohol-related accidents . tiefensee also said stricter drinking limits are now in place for new drivers .
a new law to go into effect at the end of the summer bans any drinking for drivers in their first two years . harsh penalties to send a message offenders caught with traces of alcohol in their blood will face a fine of 125 euros -lrb- $ 160 -rrb- and have their names registered in an index of traffic offenders .
in addition , they will have their license probation period extended by four years and will have to complete a course on behavior in traffic at a cost of 450 euros . for drivers who 've had their licenses for longer than two years , a blood alcohol limit of 0.5 milligrams per milliliter of blood will apply .

they will sit on the front , close to the sandcastle water park , and will be joined by a third in may .
although the turbines cost £ 147,000 , councillors hope they will cut £ 13,250 off the town 's annual energy bill .
julian kearsley , blackpool council 's executive director , said people would be able to comment on the designs .
the resort is testing two types of turbine to harness the seafront wind .
existing turbines the first ones to arrive will be three-blade turbines mounted on 15m -lrb- 49ft -rrb- poles .
they have 9m -lrb- 29ft -rrb- blades - making them 19.5m -lrb- 64ft -rrb- high in total .
they will be joined in early may by a smaller 14m -lrb- 46ft -rrb- " helical " turbine which has " s " shaped blades .
the council expects them to last for 25 years .
there are already two wind turbines at the solaris centre in the resort and this pilot will extend the project .
" our initial experience of the two wind turbines at the solaris centre has been good , " said mr kearsley .
" geographically , blackpool is in a tremendous position to harness the power of the wind and turn it to our advantage .
" this pilot will enable us to confirm wind speeds , turbine output and the number of turbines required . "
the council said the illuminations , although a " key element " of the town , means it uses more power than other councils .
powering street lighting , traffic signs , municipal buildings and the resort 's light show costs about £ 1m a year , it has said .

pembrokeshire council is considering selling the current town centre site for new homes and moving its allotments to fields on tenby 's outskirts .
it said the move would double the number of gardening plots available and provide land for affordable housing .
but the allotment holders say the town would lose an important green area and claim to have the backing of many .
the allotments are currently at a site at st john 's hill and it is proposed that they move to fields at bryn hir .
allotment gardener barbara morris said : " it 's one of our few urban green spaces left in the centre of tenby . "
it would allow us to develop a larger allotment site " pembrokeshire council " in addition to being an allotment holder i 'm also a local resident and i know quite a few of my near neighbours who do not want to see this happen .
" they are offering us an alternative site on the edge of town but it is rather isolated . "
a spokeswoman for pembrokeshire council said it had a duty to make the best use of all its assets .
it said there were only five allotments at the existing site but there was demand for many more .
" it would allow us to develop a larger allotment site , " said the spokeswoman .
" the present site would be released to enable residential development which would include affordable housing for local people . "
she said the authority would have to seek the consent of the welsh assembly government after may 's election and people would have an opportunity to object as part of the planning process .

pembrokeshire council is considering selling the current town centre site for new homes and moving its allotments to fields on tenby 's outskirts .
it said the move would double the number of gardening plots available and provide land for affordable housing .
but the allotment holders say the town would lose an important green area and claim to have the backing of many .
the allotments are currently at a site at st john 's hill and it is proposed that they move to fields at bryn hir .
allotment gardener barbara morris said : " it 's one of our few urban green spaces left in the centre of tenby .
it would allow us to develop a larger allotment site pembrokeshire council " in addition to being an allotment holder i 'm also a local resident and i know quite a few of my near neighbours who do not want to see this happen .
" they are offering us an alternative site on the edge of town but it is rather isolated . "
a spokeswoman for pembrokeshire council said it had a duty to make the best use of all its assets .
it said there were only five allotments at the existing site but there was demand for many more .
" it would allow us to develop a larger allotment site , " said the spokeswoman .
" the present site would be released to enable residential development which would include affordable housing for local people . "
she said the authority would have to seek the consent of the welsh assembly government after may 's election and people would have an opportunity to object as part of the planning process .

' proactive ' to boost domestic sales and meet its target of selling 4.2 million cars by 2009 , nissan will release 11 new or resdesigned vehicles in the current fiscal year .
in the meantime , it will look to cut costs and the early retirement package will be available to full-time employees in non-managerial positions over the age of 45 with at least five years of service .

it should come as no surprise to learn that the firm behind star wars has a robot cleaning the floors of its data centre , at the heart of the letterman digital arts center , in san francisco .
peter hricak , senior manager for network and telecoms at lucasfilm , says : " we have a small roomba vacuum cleaner for the data centre - it 's about half operational right now .
" we usually have a wireless webcam on its head so we can watch it cleaning the room from our desks . "
it may not be r2d2 - who tends to mess things up rather than clean them - but it is a reminder of lucasfilm 's rich heritage .
the data centre at lucasfilm is mammoth - scores of racks holding number crunching processors and hard drives filled with special effects - stretch off into the distance .
space battles it is easy to get lost in the room .
that power is harnessed to provide visual effects for films such as star wars : revenge of the sith and pirates of the caribbean : dead man 's chest .
bill nighy 's startling genesis as davy jones and the epic space battles in the final star wars film were created on machines in this room .
all of our render farms are named death star peter hricak a tour of ilm 's motion capture studio " at the time it was built , in 2004 , it was the world 's largest 10-gigabit backbone network in the world , " explains mr hricak .
" we have a theoretical network capacity of 11.38 terabits per second , " he adds .
that means at any given second 11 trillion bits of data can be sent and exchanged over the network at lucasfilm .
the company has the processing power equivalent to 10,000 home pcs at its disposal , rendering computer graphics , and powering the work of industrial light and magic , lucasfilm and lucasarts - four times the power it had just three years ago .
but that kind of horsepower comes at a cost , explains mr hricak .
' unfortunate truth ' " the unfortunate truth is that there is a financial restriction to keeping the film with budget - if we had an unlimited budget we would have unlimited processing power .
that 's not the reality .
" we pride ourselves on using every processor we have - we turn the artists workstations into part of the rendering farm at night . "
each 3rd generation rack has the processing power of 500 machines he adds : " so we do distributed rendering not only in the data centre - the entire facility will light up at night and add their cpus to the rendering power . "
the centre has gone through three generations of rack-mounted computers in just three years .
in 2004 , one rack was the equivalent of 60 home pcs , but now each one has the same processing power as 500 machines .
the data centre bears more than just a passing resemblance to the innards of the death star , the emperor 's battle star in the star wars films .
the racks are suitably black , forbidding and each blade in the rack is labelled death star .
" all of our render farms are named death stars - we have also silk screened the imperial logo on all of the nodes , regardless of the vendor that provides them , " explains mr hricak .
growing need that increase in processing power has also been reflected in the growing need for ever more storage .
three years ago there was 32 terabytes of storage available online to the artists , while today there is more than 250 terabytes of storage .
you can easily get lost in the data center " although we have 250 terabytes , one year from now none of the data on these discs will be here anymore , " says mr hricak .
" the data will be archived to tape , sent to studios and kept in our vaults .
we 're generating 10 terabytes of new data each day . "
and keeping those systems running at the right temperate is 25-tonnes of coolant in 32 air conditioning units , flanking the centre itself .
megawatts feeding the data centre is more than 2.4 megawatts of power .
mr hricak says the need for ever more processing power and storage has stemmed from requests from directors and the demands of the industry .
" if you build it , they will come .
as you do one movie for one director who wanted one wave one year , another director will want to do a movie entirely underwater .
" the needs are constantly increasing .
poseidon had more visual effects elements than any other film we have ever done .
" that initial pan sequence around the ship in the opening scene - everything was cg ; there were cigarettes burning in ashtrays , bubbles in hot tubs .
" every one of the those objects hand to be rendered individually - it really taxed this room quite heavily . "
on wednesday , we will be speaking to roger guyett , visual effects supervisor at industrial light and magic .

the company has the processing power equivalent to 10,000 home pcs at its disposal , rendering computer graphics , and powering the work of industrial light and magic , lucasfilm and lucasarts - four times the power it had just three years ago .
but that kind of horsepower comes at a cost , explains mr hricak .
' unfortunate truth ' " the unfortunate truth is that there is a financial restriction to keeping the film with budget - if we had an unlimited budget we would have unlimited processing power .
that 's not the reality .
" we pride ourselves on using every processor we have - we turn the artists workstations into part of the rendering farm at night . "
each 3rd generation rack has the processing power of 500 machines he adds : " so we do distributed rendering not only in the data centre - the entire facility will light up at night and add their cpus to the rendering power . "
the centre has gone through three generations of rack-mounted computers in just three years .
in 2004 , one rack was the equivalent of 60 home pcs , but now each one has the same processing power as 500 machines .
the data centre bears more than just a passing resemblance to the innards of the death star , the emperor 's battle star in the star wars films .
the racks are suitably black , forbidding and each blade in the rack is labelled death star .
" all of our render farms are named death stars - we have also silk screened the imperial logo on all of the nodes , regardless of the vendor that provides them , " explains mr hricak .
growing need that increase in processing power has also been reflected in the growing need for ever more storage .
three years ago there was 32 terabytes of storage available online to the artists , while today there is more than 250 terabytes of storage .
you can easily get lost in the data center " although we have 250 terabytes , one year from now none of the data on these discs will be here anymore , " says mr hricak .
" the data will be archived to tape , sent to studios and kept in our vaults .
we 're generating 10 terabytes of new data each day . "
and keeping those systems running at the right temperate is 25-tonnes of coolant in 32 air conditioning units , flanking the centre itself .
megawatts feeding the data centre is more than 2.4 megawatts of power .
mr hricak says the need for ever more processing power and storage has stemmed from requests from directors and the demands of the industry .
" if you build it , they will come .
as you do one movie for one director who wanted one wave one year , another director will want to do a movie entirely underwater .
" the needs are constantly increasing .
poseidon had more visual effects elements than any other film we have ever done .
" that initial pan sequence around the ship in the opening scene - everything was cg ; there were cigarettes burning in ashtrays , bubbles in hot tubs .
" every one of the those objects hand to be rendered individually - it really taxed this room quite heavily . "
on wednesday , we will be speaking to roger guyett , visual effects supervisor at industrial light and magic .

it should come as no surprise to learn that the firm behind star wars has a robot cleaning the floors of its data centre , at the heart of the letterman digital arts center , in san francisco .
peter hricak , senior manager for network and telecoms at lucasfilm , says : " we have a small roomba vacuum cleaner for the data centre - it 's about half operational right now .
" we usually have a wireless webcam on its head so we can watch it cleaning the room from our desks . "
it may not be r2d2 - who tends to mess things up rather than clean them - but it is a reminder of lucasfilm 's rich heritage .
the data centre at lucasfilm is mammoth - scores of racks holding number crunching processors and hard drives filled with special effects - stretch off into the distance .
space battles it is easy to get lost in the room .
that power is harnessed to provide visual effects for films such as star wars : revenge of the sith and pirates of the caribbean : dead man 's chest .
bill nighy 's startling genesis as davy jones and the epic space battles in the final star wars film were created on machines in this room .
all of our render farms are named death star peter hricak a tour of ilm 's motion capture studio " at the time it was built , in 2004 , it was the world 's largest 10-gigabit backbone network in the world , " explains mr hricak .
" we have a theoretical network capacity of 11.38 terabits per second , " he adds .
that means at any given second 11 trillion bits of data can be sent and exchanged over the network at lucasfilm .
the company has the processing power equivalent to 10,000 home pcs at its disposal , rendering computer graphics , and powering the work of industrial light and magic , lucasfilm and lucasarts - four times the power it had just three years ago .
but that kind of horsepower comes at a cost , explains mr hricak .
' unfortunate truth ' " the unfortunate truth is that there is a financial restriction to keeping the film with budget - if we had an unlimited budget we would have unlimited processing power .
that 's not the reality .
" we pride ourselves on using every processor we have - we turn the artists workstations into part of the rendering farm at night . "
each 3rd generation rack has the processing power of 500 machines he adds : " so we do distributed rendering not only in the data centre - the entire facility will light up at night and add their cpus to the rendering power . "
the centre has gone through three generations of rack-mounted computers in just three years .
in 2004 , one rack was the equivalent of 60 home pcs , but now each one has the same processing power as 500 machines .
the data centre bears more than just a passing resemblance to the innards of the death star , the emperor 's battle star in the star wars films .
the racks are suitably black , forbidding and each blade in the rack is labelled death star .
" all of our render farms are named death stars - we have also silk screened the imperial logo on all of the nodes , regardless of the vendor that provides them , " explains mr hricak .
growing need that increase in processing power has also been reflected in the growing need for ever more storage .
three years ago there was 32 terabytes of storage available online to the artists , while today there is more than 250 terabytes of storage .
you can easily get lost in the data center " although we have 250 terabytes , one year from now none of the data on these discs will be here anymore , " says mr hricak .
" the data will be archived to tape , sent to studios and kept in our vaults .
we 're generating 10 terabytes of new data each day . "
and keeping those systems running at the right temperate is 25-tonnes of coolant in 32 air conditioning units , flanking the centre itself .
megawatts feeding the data centre is more than 2.4 megawatts of power .
mr hricak says the need for ever more processing power and storage has stemmed from requests from directors and the demands of the industry .
" if you build it , they will come .
as you do one movie for one director who wanted one wave one year , another director will want to do a movie entirely underwater .
" the needs are constantly increasing .
poseidon had more visual effects elements than any other film we have ever done .
" that initial pan sequence around the ship in the opening scene - everything was cg ; there were cigarettes burning in ashtrays , bubbles in hot tubs .
" every one of the those objects hand to be rendered individually - it really taxed this room quite heavily . "

it may not be r2d2 - who tends to mess things up rather than clean them - but it is a reminder of lucasfilm 's rich heritage .
the data centre at lucasfilm is mammoth - scores of racks holding number crunching processors and hard drives filled with special effects - stretch off into the distance .
space battles it is easy to get lost in the room .
that power is harnessed to provide visual effects for films such as star wars : revenge of the sith and pirates of the caribbean : dead man 's chest .
bill nighy 's startling genesis as davy jones and the epic space battles in the final star wars film were created on machines in this room .
all of our render farms are named death star peter hricak a tour of ilm 's motion capture studio " at the time it was built , in 2004 , it was the world 's largest 10-gigabit backbone network in the world , " explains mr hricak .
" we have a theoretical network capacity of 11.38 terabits per second , " he adds .
that means at any given second 11 trillion bits of data can be sent and exchanged over the network at lucasfilm .
the company has the processing power equivalent to 10,000 home pcs at its disposal , rendering computer graphics , and powering the work of industrial light and magic , lucasfilm and lucasarts - four times the power it had just three years ago .
but that kind of horsepower comes at a cost , explains mr hricak .
' unfortunate truth ' " the unfortunate truth is that there is a financial restriction to keeping the film with budget - if we had an unlimited budget we would have unlimited processing power .
that 's not the reality .
" we pride ourselves on using every processor we have - we turn the artists workstations into part of the rendering farm at night . "
each 3rd generation rack has the processing power of 500 machines he adds : " so we do distributed rendering not only in the data centre - the entire facility will light up at night and add their cpus to the rendering power . "
the centre has gone through three generations of rack-mounted computers in just three years .
in 2004 , one rack was the equivalent of 60 home pcs , but now each one has the same processing power as 500 machines .
the data centre bears more than just a passing resemblance to the innards of the death star , the emperor 's battle star in the star wars films .
the racks are suitably black , forbidding and each blade in the rack is labelled death star .
" all of our render farms are named death stars - we have also silk screened the imperial logo on all of the nodes , regardless of the vendor that provides them , " explains mr hricak .
growing need that increase in processing power has also been reflected in the growing need for ever more storage .
three years ago there was 32 terabytes of storage available online to the artists , while today there is more than 250 terabytes of storage .
you can easily get lost in the data center " although we have 250 terabytes , one year from now none of the data on these discs will be here anymore , " says mr hricak .
" the data will be archived to tape , sent to studios and kept in our vaults .
we 're generating 10 terabytes of new data each day . "
and keeping those systems running at the right temperate is 25-tonnes of coolant in 32 air conditioning units , flanking the centre itself .
megawatts feeding the data centre is more than 2.4 megawatts of power .
mr hricak says the need for ever more processing power and storage has stemmed from requests from directors and the demands of the industry .
" if you build it , they will come .
as you do one movie for one director who wanted one wave one year , another director will want to do a movie entirely underwater .
" the needs are constantly increasing .
poseidon had more visual effects elements than any other film we have ever done .
" that initial pan sequence around the ship in the opening scene - everything was cg ; there were cigarettes burning in ashtrays , bubbles in hot tubs .
" every one of the those objects hand to be rendered individually - it really taxed this room quite heavily . "
on wednesday , we will be speaking to roger guyett , visual effects supervisor at industrial light and magic .

alec holden , from epsom in surrey , is picking up his winnings from bookmaker william hill , which gave him odds of 250/1 that he would reach his century .
the retired engineer , born on 24 april 1907 , joked he had been " very careful " about what he had been doing recently .
mr holden , who also used to work as a teacher and a carpenter , plans to take some friends to a hotel to celebrate . "

what are your chances of living to 100 ?
he placed the bet on 10 december 1997 , when he was aged 90 , with the thought that he " would live forever " .
mr holden , who has two sons aged 70 and 60 , puts his longevity down to porridge for breakfast and " remembering to keep breathing " .
he said it was also important not to worry about anything , do as little work as possible , and go on lots of holidays .
he also plays chess every day , running a local club .
he said in recent months he had been keeping watch for " any hooded groups from william hill standing in the street " , so that he could avoid them .
he also said he had already received his birthday card from the queen .
' mythical landmark ' " in fact , i think i saw her delivering it on her bicycle , " he joked .
bookmakers william hill said they had now raised the target age for bets from 100 to 110 .

" but these age wagers are starting to cost us a fortune and from now on we are going to push out the age to 110 . "
however , he added : " i am sure that alec will get more pleasure from our letter than he will from the queen 's . "

bookmakers william hill said they had now raised the target age for bets from 100 to 110 .
spokesman rupert adams explained : " when we started taking these bets , 100 years old seemed to be an almost mythical landmark and we were prepared to offer massive odds .
" but these age wagers are starting to cost us a fortune and from now on we are going to push out the age to 110 . "
however , he added : " i am sure that alec will get more pleasure from our letter than he will from the queen 's . "
the bookmaker has now paid out three times on the same type of bet .
the two others were rosalyn strover , from suffolk , in november 2004 , and arthur best , from cheltenham , in january 2005 .

captioning is an emerging craft that demands a combination of skills - not least the ability to maintain concentration for long periods . £ 1m is being spent to improve access to performances in theory , captioning a live stage performance should be simplicity itself - all the lines are loaded into a computer so all you have to do is display them at the right time .
if only it were that simple .
roz chalmers was one of the first people to train as a captioner and admits that in the early days , the whole process was a question of trial and error .
" we started off by making - not exactly mistakes - but assumptions that we later looked at and felt needed to be revised , " she told the bbc news website .
these days , the company that provides captioning for theatres , stagetext , has developed a recognised course and is now in the process of training new entrants to the profession which is still short of people .
preparation is everything in the art of captioning , says ms chalmers .
" there is no better way of finding a mistake than seeing it in orange letters three inches high in the middle of a crowded auditorium . "
breaths and pauses captioners not only have to convey the dialogue on the three-line display , they also have to make decisions about whether or not to describe sound effects and other essential elements of the performance .
the first task is to attend a performance of the work and mark up the script , looking for breaths and pauses .
" you are actually marking your script to make sure you are following how the performer actually performs it , " says ms chalmers .
it is also vital to make sure the script has not changed .
it then has to be formatted using specialist software and checked against a further two performances for inconsistencies .
after rehearsing " outputting " the text using a video of the performance , the captioner is then ready for the big night .
during the performance , the trick is to display the text at exactly the right speed .
too early , and an actor 's dramatic line will be pre-empted .
" if you put it up too late then the deaf audience is laughing after everyone else has finished , " says ms chalmers .
skipped lines not all actors are word perfect , and the captioner has to be constantly on the lookout for lines that are skipped so that the words on the display match what is being said on stage .
going on tour provides an additional layer of challenge because lines and even whole songs are sometimes changed for local audiences .
pantomime can be even more demanding because there are often ad-libs to be conveyed .
hours of preparation are needed before the show " the software i use means that i can put in a variety of possibles and then jump to the right one on the night .
" until i started working here , i did n't realise just how ' live ' live theatre really is . "
the alternative to the hours of preparation work would be to put up the text in real time - something which , according to ms chalmers , would not serve the audience well because they would be seeing the words a few seconds after they were spoken .
heather jackson became profoundly deaf in just a few days when , aged 35 , a virus killed the nerve endings in both ears .
now chairman of the national association of deafened people , she mainly uses lip-reading but she was unable to tell what was happening on stage and so stopped going to the theatre .
but seven years ago she attended a captioned performance at the barbican in london and was delighted by the experience .
" suddenly , there i was , back in the magical world of the theatre , able to follow everything that was said , " she says .
" thankfully , there 's now a system in the uk that can provide access to the theatre for the large number of deaf people for whom loop systems and sign language interpretation is not an option . "
captioned performances are still few and far between .
but , thanks to almost £ 1m in grants from the arts council and the treasury , more performances in england will be made accessible to deaf audiences through the see a voice project .
over the next three years 60 venues will benefit from new equipment , and trained operators , in order to increase the number of captioned shows as well as performances that are " audio described " .

captioning is an emerging craft that demands a combination of skills - not least the ability to maintain concentration for long periods . £ 1m is being spent to improve access to performances in theory , captioning a live stage performance should be simplicity itself - all the lines are loaded into a computer so all you have to do is display them at the right time .
if only it were that simple .
roz chalmers was one of the first people to train as a captioner and admits that in the early days , the whole process was a question of trial and error .
" we started off by making - not exactly mistakes - but assumptions that we later looked at and felt needed to be revised , " she told the bbc news website .
these days , the company that provides captioning for theatres , stagetext , has developed a recognised course and is now in the process of training new entrants to the profession which is still short of people .
preparation is everything in the art of captioning , says ms chalmers .
" there is no better way of finding a mistake than seeing it in orange letters three inches high in the middle of a crowded auditorium . "
breaths and pauses captioners not only have to convey the dialogue on the three-line display , they also have to make decisions about whether or not to describe sound effects and other essential elements of the performance .
the first task is to attend a performance of the work and mark up the script , looking for breaths and pauses .
" you are actually marking your script to make sure you are following how the performer actually performs it , " says ms chalmers .
it is also vital to make sure the script has not changed .
it then has to be formatted using specialist software and checked against a further two performances for inconsistencies .
after rehearsing " outputting " the text using a video of the performance , the captioner is then ready for the big night .
during the performance , the trick is to display the text at exactly the right speed .
too early , and an actor 's dramatic line will be pre-empted .
" if you put it up too late then the deaf audience is laughing after everyone else has finished , " says ms chalmers .
skipped lines not all actors are word perfect , and the captioner has to be constantly on the lookout for lines that are skipped so that the words on the display match what is being said on stage .
going on tour provides an additional layer of challenge because lines and even whole songs are sometimes changed for local audiences .
pantomime can be even more demanding because there are often ad-libs to be conveyed .
hours of preparation are needed before the show " the software i use means that i can put in a variety of possibles and then jump to the right one on the night .

why worry ?
scare stories about the dangers of wireless networks lack credibility , argues bill thompson " students at canada 's lakehead university have to be careful how they connect to the internet because wi-fi is banned on large parts of the campus .
university president fred gilbert , whose academic interests include wildlife management , environmental studies and natural resources science , is worried about the health impact of the 2.4ghz radio waves used by wireless networks last year he decided to adopt the precautionary principle and refused to allow wi-fi in those areas that have what he calls " hard wire connectivity " until it is proved to be safe .
mr gilbert believes that " microwave radiation in the frequency range of wi-fi has been shown to increase permeability of the blood-brain barrier , cause behavioural changes , alter cognitive functions , activate a stress response , interfere with brain waves , cell growth , cell communication , calcium ion balance , etc . , and cause single and double strand dna breaks " .
unfortunately the science says he is wrong , and his students are suffering as a result .
smog talk while the heating effects of high exposures to electromagnetic radiation can be damaging , the power levels of wireless connections are much lower than the microwave ovens and mobile phones which share the frequency range , and treating them in the same way is the worst sort of scaremongering .
yet mr gilbert is not alone . "
while those who want to limit the use of wi-fi argue that they need evidence that is it safe , the problem with trying to prove that something is safe is that you ca n't . "
in 2003 parents sued a primary school in chicago because it had dared to provide children with easy access to computing resources over a wireless network .
and there are a number of pressure groups , campaigning organisations and ill-informed individuals who believe that wireless networks pose a threat to health and want to see them closed down .
now it seems they have been joined by the editor of the uk newspaper the independent on sunday , which this weekend filled its front page with a call for research into the " electronic smog " that is permeating the nation 's schools and damaging growing children 's ' brains .
an accompanying editorial with the even-handed headline " high-tech horrors " called for an official inquiry , while the article outlining the perceived dangers asked " is the wi-fi revolution a health time bomb ? "
the answer , of course , is " no " .
that will not stop the newspaper stoking up a wave of opposition to one of the most liberating technologies to have come out of the hi-tech revolution , limiting children 's access to networked computers at schools and even blocking plans to develop municipal wireless networks in our towns and cities .
if the journalists were really concerned about the dangers of radio frequency electromagnetic radiation on the sensitive brains of the young , they should be calling for the closure of tv and radio transmission towers rather than asking us to turn off our wi-fi laptops .
the modulated frequencies that carry radio 4 and itv into our homes are just as powerful as the wireless networks , and a lot more pervasive .
and my wireless network is only carrying data when i 'm online , while radio 3 burbles all day long , possibly exciting electrons in my brain and causing headaches .
then there is the danger from photons of visible light streaming down onto us as we work , since these carry more energy than microwaves and could surely do more damage .
perhaps we should demand that our children work in the dark .
test programme the fuss over wi-fi is the latest manifestation of a general worry about electromagnetic radiation , one whose concerns have ranged over the years from the fields around power transmission lines to the radiation emitted by computer monitors to the microwaves put out by mobile phones .
campaigners are often supported by those who claim to be so sensitive to electromagnetic radiation that they can not bear to have a radio turned on in the same room because the fields affect their brains , or those who claim that using a mobile phone gives them headaches .
unfortunately studies like that of james rubin from the institute of psychiatry indicate that such people are just as likely to get a headache when they believe there is a phone signal present even if it is in fact absent , and other research into electromagnetic sensitivity is equally negative .
there is no evidence that electromagnetic radiation at radio frequencies , where the energy levels are too low to dislodge electrons and affect molecular bonding , can cause health effects except by heating tissues .
while those who want to limit the use of wi-fi argue that they need evidence that is it safe , the problem with trying to prove that something is safe is that you ca n't .
karl popper , the great philosopher of science , helped us to understand that science is about falsification , about setting up hypotheses and theories and proving them wrong , because you can never prove them right .
any theory can be overturned by new evidence , and any claim that wireless networks are completely safe could be thrown out tomorrow if we find good evidence that it is n't .
we may come up with a hitherto unsuspected mechanism that explains a previously disregarded effect , or the evidence may be statistical and require detailed investigation .
were that to happen we should take it seriously , but it has not happened and there is no reason to believe it will .
the precautionary principle , of avoiding exposure to unnecessary risk , does not apply here because there is no known mechanism by which wireless networks could cause damage .
we have a sound model of the interaction between electromagnetic radiation and organic matter that gives us little reason to believe that there will be any dangers .
for william stewart , chairman of the health protection agency and a former chief scientific adviser to the government , to argue for an investigation on the basis of no real evidence that there is an effect , and in the absence of any plausible physical mechanism , is indefensible .
cellphones heat the brain and could cause problems .
wi-fi does n't , and it is safe .
my daughter is sitting here as i write , her new wireless laptop beside her , and i 'm a lot more worried about the damage she would do if she dropped it on her foot than i am about the impact of the low power radio waves it emits . "

scare stories about the dangers of wireless networks lack credibility , argues bill thompson wireless working is becoming more popular students at canada 's lakehead university have to be careful how they connect to the internet because wi-fi is banned on large parts of the campus .
university president fred gilbert , whose academic interests include wildlife management , environmental studies and natural resources science , is worried about the health impact of the 2.4ghz radio waves used by wireless networks last year he decided to adopt the precautionary principle and refused to allow wi-fi in those areas that have what he calls " hard wire connectivity " until it is proved to be safe .
mr gilbert believes that " microwave radiation in the frequency range of wi-fi has been shown to increase permeability of the blood-brain barrier , cause behavioural changes , alter cognitive functions , activate a stress response , interfere with brain waves , cell growth , cell communication , calcium ion balance , etc . , and cause single and double strand dna breaks " .
unfortunately the science says he is wrong , and his students are suffering as a result .
smog talk while the heating effects of high exposures to electromagnetic radiation can be damaging , the power levels of wireless connections are much lower than the microwave ovens and mobile phones which share the frequency range , and treating them in the same way is the worst sort of scaremongering .
yet mr gilbert is not alone .
while those who want to limit the use of wi-fi argue that they need evidence that is it safe , the problem with trying to prove that something is safe is that you ca n't .
in 2003 parents sued a primary school in chicago because it had dared to provide children with easy access to computing resources over a wireless network .
and there are a number of pressure groups , campaigning organisations and ill-informed individuals who believe that wireless networks pose a threat to health and want to see them closed down .
now it seems they have been joined by the editor of the uk newspaper the independent on sunday , which this weekend filled its front page with a call for research into the " electronic smog " that is permeating the nation 's schools and damaging growing children 's ' brains .
an accompanying editorial with the even-handed headline " high-tech horrors " called for an official inquiry , while the article outlining the perceived dangers asked " is the wi-fi revolution a health time bomb ? "
the answer , of course , is " no " .
that will not stop the newspaper stoking up a wave of opposition to one of the most liberating technologies to have come out of the hi-tech revolution , limiting children 's access to networked computers at schools and even blocking plans to develop municipal wireless networks in our towns and cities .
wi-fi has been removed from some uk schools if the journalists were really concerned about the dangers of radio frequency electromagnetic radiation on the sensitive brains of the young , they should be calling for the closure of tv and radio transmission towers rather than asking us to turn off our wi-fi laptops .

scare stories about the dangers of wireless networks lack credibility , argues bill thompson wireless working is becoming more popular students at canada 's lakehead university have to be careful how they connect to the internet because wi-fi is banned on large parts of the campus .
university president fred gilbert , whose academic interests include wildlife management , environmental studies and natural resources science , is worried about the health impact of the 2.4ghz radio waves used by wireless networks last year he decided to adopt the precautionary principle and refused to allow wi-fi in those areas that have what he calls " hard wire connectivity " until it is proved to be safe .
mr gilbert believes that " microwave radiation in the frequency range of wi-fi has been shown to increase permeability of the blood-brain barrier , cause behavioural changes , alter cognitive functions , activate a stress response , interfere with brain waves , cell growth , cell communication , calcium ion balance , etc . , and cause single and double strand dna breaks " .
unfortunately the science says he is wrong , and his students are suffering as a result .
smog talk while the heating effects of high exposures to electromagnetic radiation can be damaging , the power levels of wireless connections are much lower than the microwave ovens and mobile phones which share the frequency range , and treating them in the same way is the worst sort of scaremongering .
yet mr gilbert is not alone .
while those who want to limit the use of wi-fi argue that they need evidence that is it safe , the problem with trying to prove that something is safe is that you ca n't .
in 2003 parents sued a primary school in chicago because it had dared to provide children with easy access to computing resources over a wireless network .
and there are a number of pressure groups , campaigning organisations and ill-informed individuals who believe that wireless networks pose a threat to health and want to see them closed down .
now it seems they have been joined by the editor of the uk newspaper the independent on sunday , which this weekend filled its front page with a call for research into the " electronic smog " that is permeating the nation 's schools and damaging growing children 's ' brains .
an accompanying editorial with the even-handed headline " high-tech horrors " called for an official inquiry , while the article outlining the perceived dangers asked " is the wi-fi revolution a health time bomb ? "
the answer , of course , is " no " .
that will not stop the newspaper stoking up a wave of opposition to one of the most liberating technologies to have come out of the hi-tech revolution , limiting children 's access to networked computers at schools and even blocking plans to develop municipal wireless networks in our towns and cities .
wi-fi has been removed from some uk schools if the journalists were really concerned about the dangers of radio frequency electromagnetic radiation on the sensitive brains of the young , they should be calling for the closure of tv and radio transmission towers rather than asking us to turn off our wi-fi laptops .
the modulated frequencies that carry radio 4 and itv into our homes are just as powerful as the wireless networks , and a lot more pervasive .
and my wireless network is only carrying data when i 'm online , while radio 3 burbles all day long , possibly exciting electrons in my brain and causing headaches .
then there is the danger from photons of visible light streaming down onto us as we work , since these carry more energy than microwaves and could surely do more damage .
perhaps we should demand that our children work in the dark .
test programme the fuss over wi-fi is the latest manifestation of a general worry about electromagnetic radiation , one whose concerns have ranged over the years from the fields around power transmission lines to the radiation emitted by computer monitors to the microwaves put out by mobile phones .
campaigners are often supported by those who claim to be so sensitive to electromagnetic radiation that they can not bear to have a radio turned on in the same room because the fields affect their brains , or those who claim that using a mobile phone gives them headaches .
science is about proving theories wrong , not right said karl popper unfortunately studies like that of james rubin from the institute of psychiatry indicate that such people are just as likely to get a headache when they believe there is a phone signal present even if it is in fact absent , and other research into electromagnetic sensitivity is equally negative .
there is no evidence that electromagnetic radiation at radio frequencies , where the energy levels are too low to dislodge electrons and affect molecular bonding , can cause health effects except by heating tissues .

why worry ?
scare stories about the dangers of wireless networks lack credibility , argues bill thompson wireless working is becoming more popular students at canada 's lakehead university have to be careful how they connect to the internet because wi-fi is banned on large parts of the campus .
university president fred gilbert , whose academic interests include wildlife management , environmental studies and natural resources science , is worried about the health impact of the 2.4ghz radio waves used by wireless networks last year he decided to adopt the precautionary principle and refused to allow wi-fi in those areas that have what he calls " hard wire connectivity " until it is proved to be safe .
mr gilbert believes that " microwave radiation in the frequency range of wi-fi has been shown to increase permeability of the blood-brain barrier , cause behavioural changes , alter cognitive functions , activate a stress response , interfere with brain waves , cell growth , cell communication , calcium ion balance , etc . , and cause single and double strand dna breaks " .
unfortunately the science says he is wrong , and his students are suffering as a result .
smog talk while the heating effects of high exposures to electromagnetic radiation can be damaging , the power levels of wireless connections are much lower than the microwave ovens and mobile phones which share the frequency range , and treating them in the same way is the worst sort of scaremongering .
yet mr gilbert is not alone .
while those who want to limit the use of wi-fi argue that they need evidence that is it safe , the problem with trying to prove that something is safe is that you ca n't .
in 2003 parents sued a primary school in chicago because it had dared to provide children with easy access to computing resources over a wireless network .
and there are a number of pressure groups , campaigning organisations and ill-informed individuals who believe that wireless networks pose a threat to health and want to see them closed down .
now it seems they have been joined by the editor of the uk newspaper the independent on sunday , which this weekend filled its front page with a call for research into the " electronic smog " that is permeating the nation 's schools and damaging growing children 's ' brains .
an accompanying editorial with the even-handed headline " high-tech horrors " called for an official inquiry , while the article outlining the perceived dangers asked " is the wi-fi revolution a health time bomb ? "
the answer , of course , is " no " .
that will not stop the newspaper stoking up a wave of opposition to one of the most liberating technologies to have come out of the hi-tech revolution , limiting children 's access to networked computers at schools and even blocking plans to develop municipal wireless networks in our towns and cities .
wi-fi has been removed from some uk schools if the journalists were really concerned about the dangers of radio frequency electromagnetic radiation on the sensitive brains of the young , they should be calling for the closure of tv and radio transmission towers rather than asking us to turn off our wi-fi laptops .
the modulated frequencies that carry radio 4 and itv into our homes are just as powerful as the wireless networks , and a lot more pervasive .
and my wireless network is only carrying data when i 'm online , while radio 3 burbles all day long , possibly exciting electrons in my brain and causing headaches .
then there is the danger from photons of visible light streaming down onto us as we work , since these carry more energy than microwaves and could surely do more damage .
perhaps we should demand that our children work in the dark .
test programme the fuss over wi-fi is the latest manifestation of a general worry about electromagnetic radiation , one whose concerns have ranged over the years from the fields around power transmission lines to the radiation emitted by computer monitors to the microwaves put out by mobile phones .
campaigners are often supported by those who claim to be so sensitive to electromagnetic radiation that they can not bear to have a radio turned on in the same room because the fields affect their brains , or those who claim that using a mobile phone gives them headaches .
science is about proving theories wrong , not right said karl popper unfortunately studies like that of james rubin from the institute of psychiatry indicate that such people are just as likely to get a headache when they believe there is a phone signal present even if it is in fact absent , and other research into electromagnetic sensitivity is equally negative .
there is no evidence that electromagnetic radiation at radio frequencies , where the energy levels are too low to dislodge electrons and affect molecular bonding , can cause health effects except by heating tissues .
while those who want to limit the use of wi-fi argue that they need evidence that is it safe , the problem with trying to prove that something is safe is that you ca n't .
karl popper , the great philosopher of science , helped us to understand that science is about falsification , about setting up hypotheses and theories and proving them wrong , because you can never prove them right .
any theory can be overturned by new evidence , and any claim that wireless networks are completely safe could be thrown out tomorrow if we find good evidence that it is n't .
we may come up with a hitherto unsuspected mechanism that explains a previously disregarded effect , or the evidence may be statistical and require detailed investigation .
were that to happen we should take it seriously , but it has not happened and there is no reason to believe it will .
the precautionary principle , of avoiding exposure to unnecessary risk , does not apply here because there is no known mechanism by which wireless networks could cause damage .
we have a sound model of the interaction between electromagnetic radiation and organic matter that gives us little reason to believe that there will be any dangers .
for william stewart , chairman of the health protection agency and a former chief scientific adviser to the government , to argue for an investigation on the basis of no real evidence that there is an effect , and in the absence of any plausible physical mechanism , is indefensible .
cellphones heat the brain and could cause problems .
wi-fi does n't , and it is safe .
my daughter is sitting here as i write , her new wireless laptop beside her , and i 'm a lot more worried about the damage she would do if she dropped it on her foot than i am about the impact of the low power radio waves it emits .
bill thompson is an independent journalist and regular commentator on the bbc world service programme digital planet .

the department for constitutional affairs is due to become the ministry of justice and take over probation and prisons from the home office .
in a bbc interview , lord woolf said the reforms , set for 9 may , raised " concerns about our liberty " .
but lord chancellor lord falconer said there would be " proper safeguards " .
when he announced the changes at the end of march , home secretary john reid said they were needed to meet the changing threats to the world .
after the split , the home office will concentrate on dealing with terrorism , security and immigration .
lord woolf told radio 4 's today programme that , with added responsibility for prisons and probation , the lord chancellor could find it harder to safeguard the integrity of the court service and judiciary .
he said : " we should work it out beforehand and not wait until we have created the change and then somehow or other try to scramble to get it into place .
" this is a very big change for our constitution . "
" i hope that the planning of these changes is going to be very , very carefully worked out " lord woolf lord woolf airs fears to mps he added : " my concern in relation to this new ministry of justice is that it might , if it is absorbing what was previously the bulk of matters that the home office dealt with , be unable to have the sort of relationship we hitherto have had with the lord chancellor .
" there is close cooperation on matters where this is appropriate between the lord chancellor of the day and the judiciary .
" this arises from what is now history , but is still an important influence - the fact that the lord chancellor was head of the judiciary - so it is natural that the judiciary should listen to what he has to say and talk to him in confidence about their concerns .
" if the lord chancellor is watered down as to his traditional roles because of these new responsibilities he is being given , that would be worrying from this regard . "
' more careful ' he said : " there has been no debate .
parliament has not considered this , but it is going to apparently happen on 9 may .
" i really think with our constitutional arrangements , we should be more careful about how these matters are dealt with .
" we have no written constitution which is entrenched and our constitution works through checks and balances and it is very important that if we are starting to alter the framework of checks and balances , that the matter is looked at carefully . "
lord woolf also warned : " our constitution protects our individual liberties - and these are not matters of concern of a financial nature , they are concerns about our liberty . "
his words come a week after he said the plans to split the home office should be planned carefully to avoid repeating old problems in the new department .
' better justice ' but lord falconer told bbc radio 4 's today programme : " this is do-able .
we have got to understand the serious concerns raised and deal with them and that 's what we are doing . "
the plan would mean " better justice outcomes for the public " , he added .
lord falconer said any delay to the home office split would " blight " the proposals , adding : " if we have a long period building up to a change , then what happens to the various organisations is they become paralysed leading up to the change . "
he added : " these are things that have been carefully thought through .
the issue about whether or not there should be a ministry of justice has been a public discussion over a long time . "

but helston community college says despite its complaints about the comments , they have remained online .
the comments have caused concern at the school which has now asked the police to take action .
bebo says it has an abuse report system and will freeze accounts when they are used inappropriately .
it is an awful thing to spread a hate campaign head teacher dr patrick mcgovern the college has banned social networking sites such as bebo from school computers .
it has also called on parents to monitor what their children are doing on their computers outside school time .
bebo was set up as a photo sharing site in january 2005 , then turned to social networking later that year .
it is thought to be the sixth biggest site in the uk , with 30m users worldwide .
head teacher dr patrick mcgovern said : " we have tried to have them blocked , but nothing has happened .
" we have now put the matters in the hands of the police .
it is an awful thing to spread a hate campaign .
" we take it very seriously . "
abusive comments about pupils at another school in cornwall were removed this week from bebo after intervention by police .
devon and cornwall police confirmed they were investigating the complaints .
the school started an it awareness campaign for parents a year ago and school councillor karen harvey monitors social networking sites regularly for abuse .
bebo , which launched an anti-bullying tool on its website last year , said anyone who uses its site must comply with its rules and regulations .
members can highlight inappropriate content or behaviour and members can check what other people are posting .
education secretary alan johnson earlier this year called on website publishers to prevent " cruel and relentless " harassment of teachers .
the devon and cornwall force has six community safety teams in cornwall trying to counter cyber bullying .
pc dave thompson , youth intervention officer in restormel , said : " the internet is a growing area and as it develops i think we are likely to see a lot more of this kind of problem . "

all agree that yeltsin was a larger-than-life figure who strode the political stage at a crucial period in the country 's recent history .
they also highlight the strongly contrasting feelings russians have about the man who presided over the demise of the soviet union and russia 's turbulent transition to democracy and capitalism .
correspondent on rossiya tv whatever people may say or think about him , boris yeltsin will forever remain one of the most prominent and colourful russian politicians of the 20th century ...
the person who has just left us played an outstanding role , a colossal role that is not as yet fully understood by us , in the history of russia .
at one of the sharpest turns in russian history , he managed to avoid bloodshed , although many predicted that blood would be shed without fail .
presenter on ntv " at the dawn of his political career , some would call him a bulldozer amiably , while others would call him the same with distaste " channel one tv correspondent for russians he became a symbol of the struggle against the soviet system for democracy and freedom .
boris yeltsin was , perhaps , a figure who provoked the most conflicting feelings among russians ...
for some he was the hope and symbol of a new , democratic russia , a person who was n't frightened of speaking out against what appeared to be an indestructible system .
for others , it was under yeltsin that the soviet union collapsed , their customary lifestyle changed forever and society was broken up and divided into rich and poor .
commentary in gazeta newspaper in russia heads of state are almost always contradictory figures , but against the background of his predecessors boris yeltsin was an extraordinary figure .
in his beliefs he was a communist but a liberal ; in style of rule - an authoritarian leader but a democrat ; in the way he was perceived by the people - much-liked but also a hate figure .
commentary in nezavisimaya gazeta newspaper no recognition in one 's lifetime is the lot of political reformers .
the man who gave people a new life and new opportunities for self-realisation also - and it was important for him - removed fear from people 's hearts .
citizens interpreted their own difficulties in adapting to a new way of life as the blunders of the country 's leader .
and as people no longer had fear , the head of state was ostracised by just about everyone .
yeltsin ' undemocratically ' took unpopular decisions .
still it was yeltsin who saved democracy , which is now ready to fall victim to a soviet restoration .

history again and again made people understand that someone like yeltsin , with his bulldozer character , was precisely what russia needed .
correspondent on ren tv no-one knows in which country we would now be living if at the time boris yeltsin did n't front the public resistance and , climbing onto a tank , read the text of his decree on the illegality of the putsch .
however , the nationwide support and love for yeltsin did not last long .
in december of that year -lsb- 1991 -rsb- , along with the leaders of the ukrainian and belarusian soviet socialist republics , yeltsin disbanded the soviet union .
it 's one of the decisions for which millions of people , especially from the older generation , still ca n't forgive him .

they did when communist party secretary-general konstantin chernenko died in 1984 .
the period of national mourning did nothing to stop people queuing for the few goods that state-owned shops had available .
in those days , there were no other legitimate outlets for commerce .
any private economic activity was regarded as a criminal offence and a mere buying of a 10-dollar bill could have resulted in 10 years in prison .
more than two decades on , the shopping continues - but the economic landscape is altered beyond recognition .
with the body of former president boris yeltsin about to lie in state , moscow 's stock exchange is trading as normal , banks are open , private shops are full of goods and streets are clogged by new cars .
this is yeltsin 's legacy : the result of the turbulent years of his rule .
dire situation russia 's first president came to power with the words " business freedom " and " economic reforms " written on his banners .
it is difficult to imagine today the state of the russian economy in 1991 when the soviet union collapsed .
all goods were scarce : food , soap and even cigarettes were rationed .
the nation 's entire industrial base was crumbling .
early reforms during the soviet union 's later years resulted in the widespread takeover of production units by their current managers , which in turn led to a colossal siphoning-off of funds and assets .
the rouble weakened against other currencies and inflation soared .
economic reforms in 1992 mr yeltsin took on board a group of young economists and gave them a free hand in reforming the country 's economy .
their first step , something that many russians still recall with dread , was to abandon price controls and open the market for everyone .
the policy immediately sparked galloping inflation , and as prices soared the gap between haves and have-nots widened .
the gap became a chasm when mr yeltsin started the privatisation of the state property .
everything from state-owned small shops to large factories was sold off .
still , those reforms also laid the foundation for future economic developments , which ultimately gave the country something it had not enjoyed for many years : economic freedom .
yet mr yeltsin came under fire .
those on the left argued that his economic reforms were unnecessary and criminal .
those on the right criticised their slow pace and said the reforms were not tough enough .
the oligarchs arrive the russians had to learn quickly , as their vocabulary expanded to embrace new words such as marketing , advertising and exchange rates ; or barter , leasing and - not least - profits .
those who were unable to adapt quickly suffered .
in particular , those employed by the state - including teachers , doctors , professors and policemen - learned to hate the " new russians " who were flocking to the newly-opened restaurants , night clubs and casinos .
the disparity of wealth sparked a powerful revival of the communists .
in 1995 , they led the polls and the demise of yeltsin looked imminent .
in order to secure his own survival and the continuation of the capitalist reforms , boris yeltsin took one of his most controversial economic steps .
he succumbed to the pressure of a dozen bankers and promised them a hefty prize for their financial support .
those bankers , known as " oligarchs " , provided the state with loans , taking oil and metal shares as collateral .
soon they became the owners of some of russia 's most profitable assets , which made them the de facto rulers of the country .
mixed views in 1997 , russia 's economy started to grow for the first time in a decade .
" you never had it so good , " was the message of the day .
but the day was short .
sliding oil prices , rising state borrowing and the currency crisis which gripped the asia-pacific region led to economic collapse in 1998 .
even in those days of total despair , however , mr yeltsin was able to stick to his guns , refusing to reverse the reforms he had implemented and return to a soviet-style economy .
he strongly believed in a liberal market orthodoxy : respect for private property , concern about inflation and an emphasis on a strong currency .
in today 's russia , continuing privatisation efforts raise tens of billions of dollars for the government every year , yet its powers are not diminishing .
under president vladimir putin , the russian state has clawed back power from the oligarchs , and business people 's influence with regards to how the government implements economic policy or with regards to new laws being introduced has diminished sharply .
inflation is low and economic growth is strong , yet new imbalances are emerging and the gap between the rich and the poor is widening still .
equally polarised are the views of the russian people when it comes to mr yeltsin 's achievements .
one recent poll found that about half the population blamed him for the collapse of the soviet union and the hardship of the past decade .
the other half , however , said it was mr yeltsin who had built the foundation for russia 's prosperous development .

dire situation russia 's first president came to power with the words " business freedom " and " economic reforms " written on his banners .
it is difficult to imagine today the state of the russian economy in 1991 when the soviet union collapsed .
all goods were scarce : food , soap and even cigarettes were rationed .
the nation 's entire industrial base was crumbling .
early reforms during the soviet union 's later years resulted in the widespread takeover of production units by their current managers , which in turn led to a colossal siphoning-off of funds and assets .
the rouble weakened against other currencies and inflation soared .
economic reforms in 1992 mr yeltsin took on board a group of young economists and gave them a free hand in reforming the country 's economy .
the government has clawed back power from the oligarchs their first step , something that many russians still recall with dread , was to abandon price controls and open the market for everyone .
the policy immediately sparked galloping inflation , and as prices soared the gap between haves and have-nots widened .
the gap became a chasm when mr yeltsin started the privatisation of the state property .
everything from state-owned small shops to large factories was sold off .
still , those reforms also laid the foundation for future economic developments , which ultimately gave the country something it had not enjoyed for many years : economic freedom .
yet mr yeltsin came under fire .
those on the left argued that his economic reforms were unnecessary and criminal .
those on the right criticised their slow pace and said the reforms were not tough enough .
the oligarchs arrive the russians had to learn quickly , as their vocabulary expanded to embrace new words such as marketing , advertising and exchange rates ; or barter , leasing and - not least - profits .
those who were unable to adapt quickly suffered .
in particular , those employed by the state - including teachers , doctors , professors and policemen - learned to hate the " new russians " who were flocking to the newly-opened restaurants , night clubs and casinos .
the disparity of wealth sparked a powerful revival of the communists .
in 1995 , they led the polls and the demise of yeltsin looked imminent .
in order to secure his own survival and the continuation of the capitalist reforms , boris yeltsin took one of his most controversial economic steps .
he succumbed to the pressure of a dozen bankers and promised them a hefty prize for their financial support .
those bankers , known as " oligarchs " , provided the state with loans , taking oil and metal shares as collateral .
soon they became the owners of some of russia 's most profitable assets , which made them the de facto rulers of the country .
mixed views in 1997 , russia 's economy started to grow for the first time in a decade .
" you never had it so good , " was the message of the day .
but the day was short .
sliding oil prices , rising state borrowing and the currency crisis which gripped the asia-pacific region led to economic collapse in 1998 .
even in those days of total despair , however , mr yeltsin was able to stick to his guns , refusing to reverse the reforms he had implemented and return to a soviet-style economy .
he strongly believed in a liberal market orthodoxy : respect for private property , concern about inflation and an emphasis on a strong currency .
in today 's russia , continuing privatisation efforts raise tens of billions of dollars for the government every year , yet its powers are not diminishing .
under president vladimir putin , the russian state has clawed back power from the oligarchs , and business people 's influence with regards to how the government implements economic policy or with regards to new laws being introduced has diminished sharply .
inflation is low and economic growth is strong , yet new imbalances are emerging and the gap between the rich and the poor is widening still .
equally polarised are the views of the russian people when it comes to mr yeltsin 's achievements .
one recent poll found that about half the population blamed him for the collapse of the soviet union and the hardship of the past decade .
the other half , however , said it was mr yeltsin who had built the foundation for russia 's prosperous development .

they used electrodes to stimulate an area of the brain that processes visual information , the proceedings of the national academy of sciences reported .
the results in monkeys increase the chance that people with conditions such as glaucoma will one day have their vision restored with a prosthetic eye .
but experts warned it would be a big hurdle to implant enough electrodes to recreate an entire image in the mind .
researchers have looked at several ways of restoring sight to people who have become blind because of an accident or common diseases such as macular degeneration .
in such patients , the eye has ceased to function but the visual centres in the brain are intact . "
we need to increase the number of electrodes 100-fold before this would be useful in patients " dr john pezaris , lead researcher the goal is to bypass the eye and stimulate the visual parts of the brain to recreate an image in the mind .
visual signal the team used normal-sighted monkeys to test whether stimulating an area of the thalamus deep in the brain could produce a visual signal .
first they trained the monkeys to look at suddenly illuminated points of light .
then they placed one or two very fine electrodes into the appropriate area of the brain to see what their reaction would be .
they found that the monkeys moved their gaze in the same way they would if a point of light appeared .
lead researcher , dr john pezaris , research fellow at harvard medical school , said the experiment was an important step but one of the major hurdles to a human prosthesis would be to get many more electrodes in place .
" we need to increase the number of electrodes 100-fold before this would be useful in patients . "
he explained that lots of electrodes would need to work together for patients to distinguish patterns and therefore full images .
the idea is that eventually a patient would wear a special set of glasses with a small digital camera mounted in the lens .
an external signal processor would translate the image from the camera into impulses and transmit them wirelessly to a stimulator implanted in the brain , which would deliver images to the visual system .
" this research is an important step , " dr pezaris added .
ian andolina , researcher in the ucl institute of ophthalmology in the uk , said the experiment demonstrated the principle worked .
" the way this bit of the brain is structured allows you to stimulate the central part of the vision very well , which would be important for conditions such as macular degeneration , " he said .
" but there is a fairly big problem for the future , which is how they are going to increase the number of stimulating electrodes as it sits deep in the brain . "
