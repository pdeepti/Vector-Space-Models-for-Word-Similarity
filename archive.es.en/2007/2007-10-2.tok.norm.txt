while the flags do represent a show of national unity , it is a statement of allegiance not to a team but to the country itself .
the message in brussels is clear : " we are belgium ; we are one . "
the people of brussels are united behind the flag as the political crisis in belgium continues .
it is now 112 days since elections triggered a deadlock over more self-rule for belgium 's rival linguistic camps and set the dutch and french-speaking sides against each other in a complex row that doomsayers say could tear the country in two .
the belgian political system has been in paralysis since the june 10 election when the country 's christian democrats and liberals won a legislative majority to form a coalition government .
however , both sides then split into dutch and french-speaking parties with the dutch-speaking christian democrats and liberals demanding more autonomy for the northern flanders region .
the francophone politicians accuse the flemish of trying to split the country by demanding increasing independence for flanders , saying that the unity and structure of the state is at risk if the north gets more autonomy .
a bigger say for flanders in areas such as the economy and employment would effectively give the region the power of a small state , they argue , and would have a detrimental effect on the rest of the country .
prosperous flanders wants more autonomy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : split down the middle there has been tension between francophone , wallonia in the south and flanders in the north ever since belgium won its independence in 1830 . but the main problem with modern belgium as far as the flemings are concerned is that their more prosperous region has to continually prop up wallonia , a region which is poorer and has higher unemployment .
the flemings want wallonia to become more accountable and to keep more money in their wealthy dutch-speaking region .
this feeling of disparity has fuelled resurgence in flemish nationalism and , in turn , the rising success of flemish separatist parties . the stand-off has led to almost four months of stalemate over the formation of the government .
while belgian king albert ii has appointing a series of politicians with the unenviable job of hammering out a compromise and forming a coalition , each has so far failed .
" the problem is that we are still stuck in an electoral situation where any movement by one side or the other towards an agreement is seen as a sign of weakness , " johan buelens , a professor of political science at the free university of brussels , told dw-world.de.
" it 's like a game of political chicken .
who will blink first ? "
bildunterschrift : officially bilingual brussels aligns itself with wallonia brussels , wallonia see no reason for split the political split along linguistic lines has generated discussions in many quarters over a possible geographical separation of the nation .
while the general impression outside belgium is of a country on the verge of collapse , the people , at least those in the capital , are far more relaxed .
" this talk of separation comes only from the politicians , " said anne wilmots , a physiotherapist in the predominantly flemish quarter of woluwe sint pieters in brussels .
" the people , at least in brussels and wallonia , do n't want a split and do n't believe there will be one .
it is a tactic , an empty threat in a game of politics .
no one really believes this will happen . "
the opinion of many of those living in the largely francophone but officially bilingual municipality of brussels is much the same as that of the majority of french-speakers in wallonia , including the region 's largest political party .
" this is not a new discussion , " a senior politician with humanist democratic centre -lrb- cdh -rrb- , a christian democratic party , told dw-world.de under the condition of anonymity .
" we have been talking along linguistic lines for over 50 years and the country is still together .
the regions are compatible , whatever people may say .
the cdh supports a unified belgium and will continue to do so .
we do n't foresee any changes in our ideology or the structure of our nation . "
flemish nationalism fuelling independence debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flemish nationalist parties have made gains in flanders however , the view from the north is quite different .
a recent poll in the flemish-language daily het laatste nieuws showed that 46.1 percent of flemings polled wanted belgium to split , compared to 49.6 percent who said they did n't .
" many flemings believe that a split would make them richer , " said buelens .
" every two months vlaams belang -lsb- a flemish nationalist party -rsb- sends out flyers saying that flemings pay enough towards wallonia to buy a walloon family a 15,000-euro car -lrb- $ 21,000 -rrb- every two years .
those who believe that believe that this money would go to them if the country was divided .
it is not as simple as that .
" it is like a child in a quarreling family , " he continued .
" if the parents row all the time , maybe the child thinks it would be better for them to divorce .
but it thinks this without any real knowledge of the consequences .
the child just thinks things would be better than the quarreling .
this is how it is in belgium . "
while the opinions of the people show just how complicated and diverse life in belgium can be , the final decision to split the country - should it come to that - will be made by the politicians .
but just how likely and how possible would it be to dissolve belgium ?
practical problems , lack of will make divorce unlikely " for a start it is really only a small part of the flemish political elite which favors a split , " said buelens .
" but the flemish have a larger federal presence , with about 60 percent of the population .
even so , there would have to be agreement on both sides of the divide to separate the country and we 've seen how hard it is to gain a consensus here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium is rife with political and linguistic divisions buelens believes that there are too many issues involved in breaking up the country to make it a viable option , from the payment of the national debt to the future of brussels .
but , he concluded , it was worth debating the idea as it could lead to the resolution of other long-standing problems in belgium .
" it 's good that the politicians are talking about this , " he said .
" this debate could lead to a reform of the regional structure which would make things fairer for everyone ; how power can be shared and distributed , how wealth and employment can be spread around the whole country . "
" it is better that they resolve their differences over 100 , 200 or even 300 days rather than take up arms against each other and decide it that way . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

2 , in a decision that could spell the beginning of the end of the high-technology venture touted as a rival to the us military 's global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- . galileo , which was supposed to be a showcase for europe 's technical prowess and be in place by 2008 , has stalled as cost overruns pile up , private contractors bicker and member states push their own industrial interests . after funding from a private , international consortium of eight companies involved in creating the satellite navigation system fell through , the eu said it would pump some 2.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- into the european space project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrot has found few supporters for his funding model " i am still convinced that europe needs galileo , " eu transport commissioner jacques barrot said on sept .
19 when he announced a funding plan to save the project .
" galileo is very important for the strategic autonomy of europe . " barrot has suggested the bailout money come from the billions worth of unspent agricultural funds that are returned to national coffers each year . germany to bear brunt of costs barrot 's proposal was initially given a tepid welcome by france , belgium , italy , luxembourg and spain .
germany , the eu 's largest net contributor , is openly opposed to the plan . " we can not support the suggestions proposed by the eu commission , " german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee said monday in an interview with die welt newspaper .
" germany will carry the main financial load .
that 's why the appropriate participation of german companies in galileo 's construction is a matter of course . " tiefensee has received the support of his colleagues in the economic ministry , which is against tapping the bloc 's agriculture budget for other projects . " on its own , the suggestion is coherent , but if you look at the political framework , it becomes very difficult to implement , " deputy economics minister joachim wuermeling said friday . time to decide ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with all the satellites circling the earth , some wonder if the eu needs its own a breakthrough on tuesday is not expected as both britain and the netherlands have also expressed their dissatisfaction with the eu juggling funds away from their intended purposes to pay for the satellite project . barrot has said if eu leaders could n't reach an agreement by the end of the year , the 27-member bloc would be forced to decide if it was prepared to let the project crash before it ever lifts off . while europe has remained divided over galileo , russia and china have been working on similar satellite projects , and the united states is updating its gps , already used widely in cars , boats and planes . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

2 , he surprised many with statements that sounded positively left-leaning for a member of the conservative christian democratic party . last year , when köhler chose to concentrate on domestic education issues , his speech caused barely a ripple .
this time round , he cast his net wider and took the opportunity to warn of the dangers of globalization , the " growing rift " between germany 's haves and the have-nots , and the need for greater regulation of international financial markets .
although köhler was generally viewed as a neo-liberal when he assumed office in 2004 , many saw monday 's talk as further proof of a perceived swing to the left .
ten years after then president roman herzog gave the very first berlin address and famously told the country that it needed to " jolt itself into action , " horst köhler echoed his predecessor 's plea for greater german openness and focused heavily on the issue of globalization and its consequences .
the risks of globalization " does globalization ultimately endanger our entire social model ? " he asked .
" the pressure of global competition is putting much to the test . … a large part of humanity continues to live in deepest poverty .
this has two main causes : not being able to share sufficiently in globalization - mainly because of a lack of economic power and good governance - and being disadvantaged by states and private players who pursue their own interests with no regard for others .
" those who live at the expense of others will at some stage be left standing alone , " he admonished .
but in keeping with the traditionally optimistic spirit of the presidential speeches , his message was broadly upbeat .
" globalization is simply life , " he said .
" it has to be shaped through day-to-day work and imagination , through untiring efforts and cheerful enthusiasm .
it can change the world for the better . "
a social conscience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs to look after the weaker members of society köhler pulled more of a punch when it came to germany , raising many points underlying the social democrats ' new party agenda .
referring to many people 's fear of social destitution , he said germany needed to take better care of its workforce .
" germany is not an effective and future-oriented state based on social justice at present , " he said , pointing out that the country was witnessing a creeping divide between the rich and the poor .
" the inequality in the distribution of income in germany has increased . … job security has diminished and people 's working lives are subject to change and flux . ...
although germany 's broad middle class continues to do quite well , there is an increasing fear of social decline and many people from low-income and less well-educated backgrounds can not advance without assistance , " he said .
continuing the social theme , he reiterated the thrust of last year 's argument and said the country needed to improve school performance .
" germany 's education system is not performing as well as those of some other western industrialized states , " he argued .
in a further echo of social democratic values , he went on to call for greater regulation of global financial markets and proposed the international monetary fund europe increase the involvement of emerging economies and developing countries in its decision-making .
it was time , he said , that europe played a greater role on the international stage .
" i believe that the world expects more of us europeans than we are currently offering , " he said .
" the world would be poorer without the european perspective on things .
and it is therefore our duty to share this perspective with others . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 , was the use of new technology and the sharing of travelers ' data in the fight against terrorism .
eu justice and home affairs commissioner franco frattini called for a register of all non-eu citizens entering and leaving the 27-nation bloc , who would be electronically registered with biometric identifiers .
the register is " extremely necessary " in order to crack down on people who are granted permission to stay for a restricted time but disappear when the period expires , frattini explained , pointing to recent scares in germany , britain and denmark .
under his proposals , which will be published in november , law-enforcement officials in all member states would be allowed to share collected data with colleagues across the eu .
the scheme would operate alongside an airline passenger data recording system apparently modeled on one developed by the us .
officials said they were still debating whether to adopt the system for flights within eu as well as those to and from countries outside the union .
technological crackdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should radical web sites be blocked ?
much of the discussion was geared to finding ways of countering the use of the internet by militants , with participants debating issues such as censorship and freedom of expression .
frattini proposed a technological crackdown on terrorist activities , including a plan to set up a database to provide an early-warning system on lost or stolen explosives , and new provisions to deal with the misuse of the internet by terrorists .
frattini urged sanctions against web sites that disseminate terror propaganda or bomb-building instructions or engage in recruitment for terrorist groups , prompting concerns among ministers about privacy and civil liberties .
such web sites " have nothing to do with freedom of expression , " retaliated frattini , who said he was also considering proposing broader legal definition of conspiracy that would include people who support terrorist acts .
public concerns that european legislators might curb people 's individual freedoms in their attempts to prevent terrorism attacks on their territory were apparent at the press conference after monday 's meeting .
" if your question is whether a sort-of ' big brother ' is arising in europe and calling fundamental rights into question , then the answer is ' no , " ' said rui pereira , portugal 's interior minister , in response to a question , according to news agency dpa .
" but no member state , and the eu as a whole , can avoid fighting terrorism , " he added .
extending the schengen agreement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu justice and home affairs comissioner frattini also discussed was an extension to the eu 's borderless travel zone - as far east as the frontiers with ukraine and belarus - a week before christmas , two weeks ahead of schedule .
according to portuguese home affairs minister rui perreira , nine new member states are poised to join the schengen travel zone , abolishing all land and sea checks along their common borders , although checks at airports will continue until march .
" all of the tests that we have carried out confirm that by the end of the year we will be able to remove the frontiers , " said perreira .
the border-free " schengen " area now includes 13 eu countries , plus norway and iceland .
the latest countries involved are the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia .
cyprus , the 10th nation to join the eu in 2004 , has opted to keep some border checks for a further year .
" i think this will serve as a real incentive for citizens of the new member states to feel that they are full european citizens , " perreira said .
eu justice ministers will decide on giving the final go-ahead to the expansion of schengen during their meeting on nov .

her visit is to focus on a range of issues , including human rights , aids , economic cooperation and the political crisis in zimbabwe . deutsche welle spoke about merkel 's agenda on the africa tour with dominic johnson , an editor at germany 's taz newspaper and an expert on africa . deutsche welle : why did german chancellor angela merkel choose to go to ethiopia , south africa and liberia ? dominic johnson : south africa is the most obvious choice - it is the most important trading partner for germany in africa .
president thabo mbeki , the south african president , attended the g8 summit in heiligendamm in june .
south africa is going to host the soccer world cup in 2010 and there is a lot of cooperation between germany and south africa on that .
so , south africa is the natural place to go for a german chancellor . ethiopia is fairly obvious as well .
it is the head of the african union , the seat of the african union commission , where merkel will visit .
it has become an obligatory stop for every german politician who goes to africa .
german president horst köhler was there recently , and cooperation is quite close . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel liberia is maybe less obvious .

it 's a highly symbolic moment . there 's a large german business delegation that will be accompanying merkel , but surely business issues will not be the only ones on the agenda ? they wo n't be the only ones , but i think they 'll be quite important , even though they are n't being flagged at the moment .
it 's already been announced that , following this africa trip , the german government will try to call an african economic summit to try to encourage german businesses , especially small businesses , to invest in africa , and we know that south africa and liberia are looking for more investments for reconstruction . what are some of the other issues that will be discussed ? one of them will be development aid .
the chancellor has said she will visit development projects in all three countries .
she mentioned her upcoming africa visit during her speech at the un global fund to fight aids conference in berlin last week and she made it clear that this is important to her as well .
so , there will be a lot of the traditional development issues , but there will also be a lot of business items on the agenda during talks .
and , of course , germany is still the president of the g8 , so it still has a political role to play and will be looking at liberia 's foreign debt and cooperation with the african union as a whole . interview : dagmar breitenbach -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

her visit is to focus on a range of issues , including human rights , aids , economic cooperation and the political crisis in zimbabwe . deutsche welle spoke about merkel 's agenda on the africa tour with dominic johnson , an editor at germany 's taz newspaper and an expert on africa . deutsche welle : why did german chancellor angela merkel choose to go to ethiopia , south africa and liberia ? dominic johnson : south africa is the most obvious choice - it is the most important trading partner for germany in africa .
president thabo mbeki , the south african president , attended the g8 summit in heiligendamm in june .
south africa is going to host the soccer world cup in 2010 and there is a lot of cooperation between germany and south africa on that .
so , south africa is the natural place to go for a german chancellor . ethiopia is fairly obvious as well .
it is the head of the african union , the seat of the african union commission , where merkel will visit .
it has become an obligatory stop for every german politician who goes to africa .
german president horst köhler was there recently , and cooperation is quite close . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel liberia is maybe less obvious .
it is a small country in west africa , not particularly important , but it is the only african country headed by a woman -lsb- president ellen johnson sirleaf -rsb- and chancellor merkel is the only female head of government in europe , so in a way , when the most powerful woman in europe goes to meet the most powerful woman in africa .
it 's a highly symbolic moment . there 's a large german business delegation that will be accompanying merkel , but surely business issues will not be the only ones on the agenda ? they wo n't be the only ones , but i think they 'll be quite important , even though they are n't being flagged at the moment .
it 's already been announced that , following this africa trip , the german government will try to call an african economic summit to try to encourage german businesses , especially small businesses , to invest in africa , and we know that south africa and liberia are looking for more investments for reconstruction . what are some of the other issues that will be discussed ? one of them will be development aid .
the chancellor has said she will visit development projects in all three countries .
she mentioned her upcoming africa visit during her speech at the un global fund to fight aids conference in berlin last week and she made it clear that this is important to her as well .
so , there will be a lot of the traditional development issues , but there will also be a lot of business items on the agenda during talks .
and , of course , germany is still the president of the g8 , so it still has a political role to play and will be looking at liberia 's foreign debt and cooperation with the african union as a whole . interview : dagmar breitenbach -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 , to open their 88 billion euro -lrb- $ 125.3 billion -rrb- postal markets to full competition beginning in 2011 , but 11 countries will be given an additional two-year grace period . some countries had wanted to move faster , but the ministers were motivated to reach a compromise that was acceptable of all 27 of the bloc 's nations , herve novelli , french minister of state for businesses and foreign trade , told the afp news agency . " this directive in no way changes the basic rights of the sector and workers in the sector , " portuguese telecoms minister mario lino told reporters , trying to calm the fears of some postal workers concerned about possible job cuts . the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , had originally proposed to strip away the remaining barriers to competition from 2009 .

" in general the parliament is very happy about the result of the council , " markus ferber , the german lawmaker steering the measure through the eu assembly , told reuters . letters under 50 grams still shielded national markets for letters weighing up to 50 grams -lrb- 1.8 ounces -rrb- are currently protected from competition .
mail above that weight has already been liberalized . the european postal sector was liberalized a decade ago for the delivery of packages weighing over 350 grams , then broadened in 2003 to items of more than 100 grams in 2003 and , to letters weighing more than 50 grams in 2006 . the european commission has aimed to expand on the perceived success of britain , finland , and sweden , which have already liberalized their postal markets .
germany is to open up fully open up its market next year . the commission has said that greater competition could lead to lower costs and better or customized service .
as an extra reason to convince countries to open their markets , only former countries who have liberalized their own postal markets will be eligible to become involved in letter delivery in other eu countries . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

2 , in a decision that could spell the beginning of the end of the high-technology venture touted as a rival to the us military 's global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- . galileo , which was supposed to be a showcase for europe 's technical prowess and be in place by 2008 , has stalled as cost overruns pile up , private contractors bicker and member states push their own industrial interests . after funding from a private , international consortium of eight companies involved in creating the satellite navigation system fell through , the eu said it would pump some 2.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- into the european space project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrot has found few supporters for his funding model " i am still convinced that europe needs galileo , " eu transport commissioner jacques barrot said on sept .

" galileo is very important for the strategic autonomy of europe . " barrot has suggested the bailout money come from the billions worth of unspent agricultural funds that are returned to national coffers each year . germany to bear brunt of costs barrot 's proposal was initially given a tepid welcome by france , belgium , italy , luxembourg and spain .
germany , the eu 's largest net contributor , is openly opposed to the plan . " we can not support the suggestions proposed by the eu commission , " german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee said monday in an interview with die welt newspaper .
" germany will carry the main financial load .
that 's why the appropriate participation of german companies in galileo 's construction is a matter of course . " tiefensee has received the support of his colleagues in the economic ministry , which is against tapping the bloc 's agriculture budget for other projects . " on its own , the suggestion is coherent , but if you look at the political framework , it becomes very difficult to implement , " deputy economics minister joachim wuermeling said friday . time to decide ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with all the satellites circling the earth , some wonder if the eu needs its own a breakthrough on tuesday is not expected as both britain and the netherlands have also expressed their dissatisfaction with the eu juggling funds away from their intended purposes to pay for the satellite project . barrot has said if eu leaders could n't reach an agreement by the end of the year , the 27-member bloc would be forced to decide if it was prepared to let the project crash before it ever lifts off . while europe has remained divided over galileo , russia and china have been working on similar satellite projects , and the united states is updating its gps , already used widely in cars , boats and planes . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

2 , he surprised many with statements that sounded positively left-leaning for a member of the conservative christian democratic party . last year , when köhler chose to concentrate on domestic education issues , his speech caused barely a ripple .
this time round , he cast his net wider and took the opportunity to warn of the dangers of globalization , the " growing rift " between germany 's haves and the have-nots , and the need for greater regulation of international financial markets .
although köhler was generally viewed as a neo-liberal when he assumed office in 2004 , many saw monday 's talk as further proof of a perceived swing to the left .
ten years after then president roman herzog gave the very first berlin address and famously told the country that it needed to " jolt itself into action , " horst köhler echoed his predecessor 's plea for greater german openness and focused heavily on the issue of globalization and its consequences .
the risks of globalization " does globalization ultimately endanger our entire social model ? " he asked .
" the pressure of global competition is putting much to the test . … a large part of humanity continues to live in deepest poverty .
this has two main causes : not being able to share sufficiently in globalization - mainly because of a lack of economic power and good governance - and being disadvantaged by states and private players who pursue their own interests with no regard for others .
" those who live at the expense of others will at some stage be left standing alone , " he admonished .
but in keeping with the traditionally optimistic spirit of the presidential speeches , his message was broadly upbeat .
" globalization is simply life , " he said .
" it has to be shaped through day-to-day work and imagination , through untiring efforts and cheerful enthusiasm .
it can change the world for the better . "
a social conscience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs to look after the weaker members of society köhler pulled more of a punch when it came to germany , raising many points underlying the social democrats ' new party agenda .
referring to many people 's fear of social destitution , he said germany needed to take better care of its workforce .
" germany is not an effective and future-oriented state based on social justice at present , " he said , pointing out that the country was witnessing a creeping divide between the rich and the poor .
" the inequality in the distribution of income in germany has increased . … job security has diminished and people 's working lives are subject to change and flux . ...
although germany 's broad middle class continues to do quite well , there is an increasing fear of social decline and many people from low-income and less well-educated backgrounds can not advance without assistance , " he said .
continuing the social theme , he reiterated the thrust of last year 's argument and said the country needed to improve school performance .
" germany 's education system is not performing as well as those of some other western industrialized states , " he argued .
in a further echo of social democratic values , he went on to call for greater regulation of global financial markets and proposed the international monetary fund europe increase the involvement of emerging economies and developing countries in its decision-making .
it was time , he said , that europe played a greater role on the international stage .
" i believe that the world expects more of us europeans than we are currently offering , " he said .
" the world would be poorer without the european perspective on things .
and it is therefore our duty to share this perspective with others . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while the flags do represent a show of national unity , it is a statement of allegiance not to a team but to the country itself .
the message in brussels is clear : " we are belgium ; we are one . "
the people of brussels are united behind the flag as the political crisis in belgium continues .
it is now 112 days since elections triggered a deadlock over more self-rule for belgium 's rival linguistic camps and set the dutch and french-speaking sides against each other in a complex row that doomsayers say could tear the country in two .
the belgian political system has been in paralysis since the june 10 election when the country 's christian democrats and liberals won a legislative majority to form a coalition government .
however , both sides then split into dutch and french-speaking parties with the dutch-speaking christian democrats and liberals demanding more autonomy for the northern flanders region .
the francophone politicians accuse the flemish of trying to split the country by demanding increasing independence for flanders , saying that the unity and structure of the state is at risk if the north gets more autonomy .
a bigger say for flanders in areas such as the economy and employment would effectively give the region the power of a small state , they argue , and would have a detrimental effect on the rest of the country .
prosperous flanders wants more autonomy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : split down the middle there has been tension between francophone , wallonia in the south and flanders in the north ever since belgium won its independence in 1830 . but the main problem with modern belgium as far as the flemings are concerned is that their more prosperous region has to continually prop up wallonia , a region which is poorer and has higher unemployment .
the flemings want wallonia to become more accountable and to keep more money in their wealthy dutch-speaking region .
this feeling of disparity has fuelled resurgence in flemish nationalism and , in turn , the rising success of flemish separatist parties . the stand-off has led to almost four months of stalemate over the formation of the government .
while belgian king albert ii has appointing a series of politicians with the unenviable job of hammering out a compromise and forming a coalition , each has so far failed .
" the problem is that we are still stuck in an electoral situation where any movement by one side or the other towards an agreement is seen as a sign of weakness , " johan buelens , a professor of political science at the free university of brussels , told dw-world.de.
" it 's like a game of political chicken .
who will blink first ? "
bildunterschrift : officially bilingual brussels aligns itself with wallonia brussels , wallonia see no reason for split the political split along linguistic lines has generated discussions in many quarters over a possible geographical separation of the nation .
while the general impression outside belgium is of a country on the verge of collapse , the people , at least those in the capital , are far more relaxed .
" this talk of separation comes only from the politicians , " said anne wilmots , a physiotherapist in the predominantly flemish quarter of woluwe sint pieters in brussels .
" the people , at least in brussels and wallonia , do n't want a split and do n't believe there will be one .
it is a tactic , an empty threat in a game of politics .
no one really believes this will happen . "
the opinion of many of those living in the largely francophone but officially bilingual municipality of brussels is much the same as that of the majority of french-speakers in wallonia , including the region 's largest political party .
" this is not a new discussion , " a senior politician with humanist democratic centre -lrb- cdh -rrb- , a christian democratic party , told dw-world.de under the condition of anonymity .
" we have been talking along linguistic lines for over 50 years and the country is still together .
the regions are compatible , whatever people may say .
the cdh supports a unified belgium and will continue to do so .
we do n't foresee any changes in our ideology or the structure of our nation . "
flemish nationalism fuelling independence debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flemish nationalist parties have made gains in flanders however , the view from the north is quite different .
a recent poll in the flemish-language daily het laatste nieuws showed that 46.1 percent of flemings polled wanted belgium to split , compared to 49.6 percent who said they did n't .
" many flemings believe that a split would make them richer , " said buelens .
" every two months vlaams belang -lsb- a flemish nationalist party -rsb- sends out flyers saying that flemings pay enough towards wallonia to buy a walloon family a 15,000-euro car -lrb- $ 21,000 -rrb- every two years .
those who believe that believe that this money would go to them if the country was divided .
it is not as simple as that .
" it is like a child in a quarreling family , " he continued .
" if the parents row all the time , maybe the child thinks it would be better for them to divorce .
but it thinks this without any real knowledge of the consequences .
the child just thinks things would be better than the quarreling .
this is how it is in belgium . "
while the opinions of the people show just how complicated and diverse life in belgium can be , the final decision to split the country - should it come to that - will be made by the politicians .
but just how likely and how possible would it be to dissolve belgium ?
practical problems , lack of will make divorce unlikely " for a start it is really only a small part of the flemish political elite which favors a split , " said buelens .
" but the flemish have a larger federal presence , with about 60 percent of the population .
even so , there would have to be agreement on both sides of the divide to separate the country and we 've seen how hard it is to gain a consensus here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium is rife with political and linguistic divisions buelens believes that there are too many issues involved in breaking up the country to make it a viable option , from the payment of the national debt to the future of brussels .
but , he concluded , it was worth debating the idea as it could lead to the resolution of other long-standing problems in belgium .

while the flags do represent a show of national unity , it is a statement of allegiance not to a team but to the country itself .
the message in brussels is clear : " we are belgium ; we are one . "
the people of brussels are united behind the flag as the political crisis in belgium continues .
it is now 112 days since elections triggered a deadlock over more self-rule for belgium 's rival linguistic camps and set the dutch and french-speaking sides against each other in a complex row that doomsayers say could tear the country in two .
the belgian political system has been in paralysis since the june 10 election when the country 's christian democrats and liberals won a legislative majority to form a coalition government .
however , both sides then split into dutch and french-speaking parties with the dutch-speaking christian democrats and liberals demanding more autonomy for the northern flanders region .
the francophone politicians accuse the flemish of trying to split the country by demanding increasing independence for flanders , saying that the unity and structure of the state is at risk if the north gets more autonomy .
a bigger say for flanders in areas such as the economy and employment would effectively give the region the power of a small state , they argue , and would have a detrimental effect on the rest of the country .
prosperous flanders wants more autonomy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : split down the middle there has been tension between francophone , wallonia in the south and flanders in the north ever since belgium won its independence in 1830 . but the main problem with modern belgium as far as the flemings are concerned is that their more prosperous region has to continually prop up wallonia , a region which is poorer and has higher unemployment .
the flemings want wallonia to become more accountable and to keep more money in their wealthy dutch-speaking region .
this feeling of disparity has fuelled resurgence in flemish nationalism and , in turn , the rising success of flemish separatist parties . the stand-off has led to almost four months of stalemate over the formation of the government .
while belgian king albert ii has appointing a series of politicians with the unenviable job of hammering out a compromise and forming a coalition , each has so far failed .
" the problem is that we are still stuck in an electoral situation where any movement by one side or the other towards an agreement is seen as a sign of weakness , " johan buelens , a professor of political science at the free university of brussels , told dw-world.de.
" it 's like a game of political chicken .
who will blink first ? "
bildunterschrift : officially bilingual brussels aligns itself with wallonia brussels , wallonia see no reason for split the political split along linguistic lines has generated discussions in many quarters over a possible geographical separation of the nation .
while the general impression outside belgium is of a country on the verge of collapse , the people , at least those in the capital , are far more relaxed .
" this talk of separation comes only from the politicians , " said anne wilmots , a physiotherapist in the predominantly flemish quarter of woluwe sint pieters in brussels .
" the people , at least in brussels and wallonia , do n't want a split and do n't believe there will be one .
it is a tactic , an empty threat in a game of politics .
no one really believes this will happen . "
the opinion of many of those living in the largely francophone but officially bilingual municipality of brussels is much the same as that of the majority of french-speakers in wallonia , including the region 's largest political party .
" this is not a new discussion , " a senior politician with humanist democratic centre -lrb- cdh -rrb- , a christian democratic party , told dw-world.de under the condition of anonymity .
" we have been talking along linguistic lines for over 50 years and the country is still together .
the regions are compatible , whatever people may say .
the cdh supports a unified belgium and will continue to do so .
we do n't foresee any changes in our ideology or the structure of our nation . "
flemish nationalism fuelling independence debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flemish nationalist parties have made gains in flanders however , the view from the north is quite different .
a recent poll in the flemish-language daily het laatste nieuws showed that 46.1 percent of flemings polled wanted belgium to split , compared to 49.6 percent who said they did n't .
" many flemings believe that a split would make them richer , " said buelens .
" every two months vlaams belang -lsb- a flemish nationalist party -rsb- sends out flyers saying that flemings pay enough towards wallonia to buy a walloon family a 15,000-euro car -lrb- $ 21,000 -rrb- every two years .
those who believe that believe that this money would go to them if the country was divided .
it is not as simple as that .
" it is like a child in a quarreling family , " he continued .
" if the parents row all the time , maybe the child thinks it would be better for them to divorce .
but it thinks this without any real knowledge of the consequences .
the child just thinks things would be better than the quarreling .
this is how it is in belgium . "
while the opinions of the people show just how complicated and diverse life in belgium can be , the final decision to split the country - should it come to that - will be made by the politicians .
but just how likely and how possible would it be to dissolve belgium ?
practical problems , lack of will make divorce unlikely " for a start it is really only a small part of the flemish political elite which favors a split , " said buelens .
" but the flemish have a larger federal presence , with about 60 percent of the population .
even so , there would have to be agreement on both sides of the divide to separate the country and we 've seen how hard it is to gain a consensus here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium is rife with political and linguistic divisions buelens believes that there are too many issues involved in breaking up the country to make it a viable option , from the payment of the national debt to the future of brussels .
but , he concluded , it was worth debating the idea as it could lead to the resolution of other long-standing problems in belgium .
" it 's good that the politicians are talking about this , " he said .
" this debate could lead to a reform of the regional structure which would make things fairer for everyone ; how power can be shared and distributed , how wealth and employment can be spread around the whole country . "

1 , was the use of new technology and the sharing of travelers ' data in the fight against terrorism .
eu justice and home affairs commissioner franco frattini called for a register of all non-eu citizens entering and leaving the 27-nation bloc , who would be electronically registered with biometric identifiers .
the register is " extremely necessary " in order to crack down on people who are granted permission to stay for a restricted time but disappear when the period expires , frattini explained , pointing to recent scares in germany , britain and denmark .
under his proposals , which will be published in november , law-enforcement officials in all member states would be allowed to share collected data with colleagues across the eu .
the scheme would operate alongside an airline passenger data recording system apparently modeled on one developed by the us .
officials said they were still debating whether to adopt the system for flights within eu as well as those to and from countries outside the union .
technological crackdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should radical web sites be blocked ?
much of the discussion was geared to finding ways of countering the use of the internet by militants , with participants debating issues such as censorship and freedom of expression .
frattini proposed a technological crackdown on terrorist activities , including a plan to set up a database to provide an early-warning system on lost or stolen explosives , and new provisions to deal with the misuse of the internet by terrorists .
frattini urged sanctions against web sites that disseminate terror propaganda or bomb-building instructions or engage in recruitment for terrorist groups , prompting concerns among ministers about privacy and civil liberties .
such web sites " have nothing to do with freedom of expression , " retaliated frattini , who said he was also considering proposing broader legal definition of conspiracy that would include people who support terrorist acts .
public concerns that european legislators might curb people 's individual freedoms in their attempts to prevent terrorism attacks on their territory were apparent at the press conference after monday 's meeting .
" if your question is whether a sort-of ' big brother ' is arising in europe and calling fundamental rights into question , then the answer is ' no , " ' said rui pereira , portugal 's interior minister , in response to a question , according to news agency dpa .
" but no member state , and the eu as a whole , can avoid fighting terrorism , " he added .
extending the schengen agreement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu justice and home affairs comissioner frattini also discussed was an extension to the eu 's borderless travel zone - as far east as the frontiers with ukraine and belarus - a week before christmas , two weeks ahead of schedule .
according to portuguese home affairs minister rui perreira , nine new member states are poised to join the schengen travel zone , abolishing all land and sea checks along their common borders , although checks at airports will continue until march .
" all of the tests that we have carried out confirm that by the end of the year we will be able to remove the frontiers , " said perreira .
the border-free " schengen " area now includes 13 eu countries , plus norway and iceland .
the latest countries involved are the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia .
cyprus , the 10th nation to join the eu in 2004 , has opted to keep some border checks for a further year .
" i think this will serve as a real incentive for citizens of the new member states to feel that they are full european citizens , " perreira said .
eu justice ministers will decide on giving the final go-ahead to the expansion of schengen during their meeting on nov .

much of the discussion was geared to finding ways of countering the use of the internet by militants , with participants debating issues such as censorship and freedom of expression .
frattini proposed a technological crackdown on terrorist activities , including a plan to set up a database to provide an early-warning system on lost or stolen explosives , and new provisions to deal with the misuse of the internet by terrorists .
frattini urged sanctions against web sites that disseminate terror propaganda or bomb-building instructions or engage in recruitment for terrorist groups , prompting concerns among ministers about privacy and civil liberties .
such web sites " have nothing to do with freedom of expression , " retaliated frattini , who said he was also considering proposing broader legal definition of conspiracy that would include people who support terrorist acts .
public concerns that european legislators might curb people 's individual freedoms in their attempts to prevent terrorism attacks on their territory were apparent at the press conference after monday 's meeting .
" if your question is whether a sort-of ' big brother ' is arising in europe and calling fundamental rights into question , then the answer is ' no , " ' said rui pereira , portugal 's interior minister , in response to a question , according to news agency dpa .
" but no member state , and the eu as a whole , can avoid fighting terrorism , " he added .

according to portuguese home affairs minister rui perreira , nine new member states are poised to join the schengen travel zone , abolishing all land and sea checks along their common borders , although checks at airports will continue until march .
" all of the tests that we have carried out confirm that by the end of the year we will be able to remove the frontiers , " said perreira .
the border-free " schengen " area now includes 13 eu countries , plus norway and iceland .
the latest countries involved are the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia .
cyprus , the 10th nation to join the eu in 2004 , has opted to keep some border checks for a further year .
" i think this will serve as a real incentive for citizens of the new member states to feel that they are full european citizens , " perreira said .
eu justice ministers will decide on giving the final go-ahead to the expansion of schengen during their meeting on nov .

eu justice and home affairs commissioner franco frattini called for a register of all non-eu citizens entering and leaving the 27-nation bloc , who would be electronically registered with biometric identifiers .
the register is " extremely necessary " in order to crack down on people who are granted permission to stay for a restricted time but disappear when the period expires , frattini explained , pointing to recent scares in germany , britain and denmark .
under his proposals , which will be published in november , law-enforcement officials in all member states would be allowed to share collected data with colleagues across the eu .
the scheme would operate alongside an airline passenger data recording system apparently modeled on one developed by the us .
officials said they were still debating whether to adopt the system for flights within eu as well as those to and from countries outside the union .

this time round , he cast his net wider and took the opportunity to warn of the dangers of globalization , the " growing rift " between germany 's haves and the have-nots , and the need for greater regulation of international financial markets .
although köhler was generally viewed as a neo-liberal when he assumed office in 2004 , many saw monday 's talk as further proof of a perceived swing to the left .
ten years after then president roman herzog gave the very first berlin address and famously told the country that it needed to " jolt itself into action , " horst köhler echoed his predecessor 's plea for greater german openness and focused heavily on the issue of globalization and its consequences .
the risks of globalization " does globalization ultimately endanger our entire social model ? " he asked .
" the pressure of global competition is putting much to the test . … a large part of humanity continues to live in deepest poverty .
this has two main causes : not being able to share sufficiently in globalization - mainly because of a lack of economic power and good governance - and being disadvantaged by states and private players who pursue their own interests with no regard for others .
" those who live at the expense of others will at some stage be left standing alone , " he admonished .
but in keeping with the traditionally optimistic spirit of the presidential speeches , his message was broadly upbeat .

her visit is to focus on a range of issues , including human rights , aids , economic cooperation and the political crisis in zimbabwe . deutsche welle spoke about merkel 's agenda on the africa tour with dominic johnson , an editor at germany 's taz newspaper and an expert on africa . deutsche welle : why did german chancellor angela merkel choose to go to ethiopia , south africa and liberia ? dominic johnson : south africa is the most obvious choice - it is the most important trading partner for germany in africa .
president thabo mbeki , the south african president , attended the g8 summit in heiligendamm in june .
south africa is going to host the soccer world cup in 2010 and there is a lot of cooperation between germany and south africa on that .
so , south africa is the natural place to go for a german chancellor . ethiopia is fairly obvious as well .
it is the head of the african union , the seat of the african union commission , where merkel will visit .
it has become an obligatory stop for every german politician who goes to africa .
german president horst köhler was there recently , and cooperation is quite close . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel liberia is maybe less obvious .
it is a small country in west africa , not particularly important , but it is the only african country headed by a woman -lsb- president ellen johnson sirleaf -rsb- and chancellor merkel is the only female head of government in europe , so in a way , when the most powerful woman in europe goes to meet the most powerful woman in africa .
it 's a highly symbolic moment . there 's a large german business delegation that will be accompanying merkel , but surely business issues will not be the only ones on the agenda ? they wo n't be the only ones , but i think they 'll be quite important , even though they are n't being flagged at the moment .
it 's already been announced that , following this africa trip , the german government will try to call an african economic summit to try to encourage german businesses , especially small businesses , to invest in africa , and we know that south africa and liberia are looking for more investments for reconstruction . what are some of the other issues that will be discussed ? one of them will be development aid .
the chancellor has said she will visit development projects in all three countries .
she mentioned her upcoming africa visit during her speech at the un global fund to fight aids conference in berlin last week and she made it clear that this is important to her as well .
so , there will be a lot of the traditional development issues , but there will also be a lot of business items on the agenda during talks .
and , of course , germany is still the president of the g8 , so it still has a political role to play and will be looking at liberia 's foreign debt and cooperation with the african union as a whole . interview : dagmar breitenbach -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" germany is not an effective and future-oriented state based on social justice at present , " he said , pointing out that the country was witnessing a creeping divide between the rich and the poor .
" the inequality in the distribution of income in germany has increased . … job security has diminished and people 's working lives are subject to change and flux . ...
although germany 's broad middle class continues to do quite well , there is an increasing fear of social decline and many people from low-income and less well-educated backgrounds can not advance without assistance , " he said .
continuing the social theme , he reiterated the thrust of last year 's argument and said the country needed to improve school performance .
" germany 's education system is not performing as well as those of some other western industrialized states , " he argued .
in a further echo of social democratic values , he went on to call for greater regulation of global financial markets and proposed the international monetary fund europe increase the involvement of emerging economies and developing countries in its decision-making .
it was time , he said , that europe played a greater role on the international stage .
" i believe that the world expects more of us europeans than we are currently offering , " he said .
" the world would be poorer without the european perspective on things .
and it is therefore our duty to share this perspective with others . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

2 , in a decision that could spell the beginning of the end of the high-technology venture touted as a rival to the us military 's global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- . galileo , which was supposed to be a showcase for europe 's technical prowess and be in place by 2008 , has stalled as cost overruns pile up , private contractors bicker and member states push their own industrial interests . after funding from a private , international consortium of eight companies involved in creating the satellite navigation system fell through , the eu said it would pump some 2.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- into the european space project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrot has found few supporters for his funding model " i am still convinced that europe needs galileo , " eu transport commissioner jacques barrot said on sept .
19 when he announced a funding plan to save the project .
" galileo is very important for the strategic autonomy of europe . " barrot has suggested the bailout money come from the billions worth of unspent agricultural funds that are returned to national coffers each year . germany to bear brunt of costs barrot 's proposal was initially given a tepid welcome by france , belgium , italy , luxembourg and spain .
germany , the eu 's largest net contributor , is openly opposed to the plan . " we can not support the suggestions proposed by the eu commission , " german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee said monday in an interview with die welt newspaper .
" germany will carry the main financial load .
that 's why the appropriate participation of german companies in galileo 's construction is a matter of course . " tiefensee has received the support of his colleagues in the economic ministry , which is against tapping the bloc 's agriculture budget for other projects . " on its own , the suggestion is coherent , but if you look at the political framework , it becomes very difficult to implement , " deputy economics minister joachim wuermeling said friday . time to decide ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with all the satellites circling the earth , some wonder if the eu needs its own a breakthrough on tuesday is not expected as both britain and the netherlands have also expressed their dissatisfaction with the eu juggling funds away from their intended purposes to pay for the satellite project . barrot has said if eu leaders could n't reach an agreement by the end of the year , the 27-member bloc would be forced to decide if it was prepared to let the project crash before it ever lifts off . while europe has remained divided over galileo , russia and china have been working on similar satellite projects , and the united states is updating its gps , already used widely in cars , boats and planes . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 , was the use of new technology and the sharing of travelers ' data in the fight against terrorism .
eu justice and home affairs commissioner franco frattini called for a register of all non-eu citizens entering and leaving the 27-nation bloc , who would be electronically registered with biometric identifiers .
the register is " extremely necessary " in order to crack down on people who are granted permission to stay for a restricted time but disappear when the period expires , frattini explained , pointing to recent scares in germany , britain and denmark .
under his proposals , which will be published in november , law-enforcement officials in all member states would be allowed to share collected data with colleagues across the eu .
the scheme would operate alongside an airline passenger data recording system apparently modeled on one developed by the us .
officials said they were still debating whether to adopt the system for flights within eu as well as those to and from countries outside the union .
technological crackdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should radical web sites be blocked ?
much of the discussion was geared to finding ways of countering the use of the internet by militants , with participants debating issues such as censorship and freedom of expression .
frattini proposed a technological crackdown on terrorist activities , including a plan to set up a database to provide an early-warning system on lost or stolen explosives , and new provisions to deal with the misuse of the internet by terrorists .
frattini urged sanctions against web sites that disseminate terror propaganda or bomb-building instructions or engage in recruitment for terrorist groups , prompting concerns among ministers about privacy and civil liberties .
such web sites " have nothing to do with freedom of expression , " retaliated frattini , who said he was also considering proposing broader legal definition of conspiracy that would include people who support terrorist acts .
public concerns that european legislators might curb people 's individual freedoms in their attempts to prevent terrorism attacks on their territory were apparent at the press conference after monday 's meeting .
" if your question is whether a sort-of ' big brother ' is arising in europe and calling fundamental rights into question , then the answer is ' no , " ' said rui pereira , portugal 's interior minister , in response to a question , according to news agency dpa .
" but no member state , and the eu as a whole , can avoid fighting terrorism , " he added .
extending the schengen agreement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu justice and home affairs comissioner frattini also discussed was an extension to the eu 's borderless travel zone - as far east as the frontiers with ukraine and belarus - a week before christmas , two weeks ahead of schedule .
according to portuguese home affairs minister rui perreira , nine new member states are poised to join the schengen travel zone , abolishing all land and sea checks along their common borders , although checks at airports will continue until march .
" all of the tests that we have carried out confirm that by the end of the year we will be able to remove the frontiers , " said perreira .
the border-free " schengen " area now includes 13 eu countries , plus norway and iceland .
the latest countries involved are the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia .
cyprus , the 10th nation to join the eu in 2004 , has opted to keep some border checks for a further year .
" i think this will serve as a real incentive for citizens of the new member states to feel that they are full european citizens , " perreira said .
eu justice ministers will decide on giving the final go-ahead to the expansion of schengen during their meeting on nov .

2 , in a decision that could spell the beginning of the end of the high-technology venture touted as a rival to the us military 's global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- . galileo , which was supposed to be a showcase for europe 's technical prowess and be in place by 2008 , has stalled as cost overruns pile up , private contractors bicker and member states push their own industrial interests . after funding from a private , international consortium of eight companies involved in creating the satellite navigation system fell through , the eu said it would pump some 2.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- into the european space project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrot has found few supporters for his funding model " i am still convinced that europe needs galileo , " eu transport commissioner jacques barrot said on sept .
19 when he announced a funding plan to save the project .
" galileo is very important for the strategic autonomy of europe . " barrot has suggested the bailout money come from the billions worth of unspent agricultural funds that are returned to national coffers each year . germany to bear brunt of costs barrot 's proposal was initially given a tepid welcome by france , belgium , italy , luxembourg and spain .
germany , the eu 's largest net contributor , is openly opposed to the plan . " we can not support the suggestions proposed by the eu commission , " german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee said monday in an interview with die welt newspaper .
" germany will carry the main financial load .
that 's why the appropriate participation of german companies in galileo 's construction is a matter of course . " tiefensee has received the support of his colleagues in the economic ministry , which is against tapping the bloc 's agriculture budget for other projects . " on its own , the suggestion is coherent , but if you look at the political framework , it becomes very difficult to implement , " deputy economics minister joachim wuermeling said friday . time to decide ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with all the satellites circling the earth , some wonder if the eu needs its own a breakthrough on tuesday is not expected as both britain and the netherlands have also expressed their dissatisfaction with the eu juggling funds away from their intended purposes to pay for the satellite project . barrot has said if eu leaders could n't reach an agreement by the end of the year , the 27-member bloc would be forced to decide if it was prepared to let the project crash before it ever lifts off . while europe has remained divided over galileo , russia and china have been working on similar satellite projects , and the united states is updating its gps , already used widely in cars , boats and planes . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 , was the use of new technology and the sharing of travelers ' data in the fight against terrorism .
eu justice and home affairs commissioner franco frattini called for a register of all non-eu citizens entering and leaving the 27-nation bloc , who would be electronically registered with biometric identifiers .
the register is " extremely necessary " in order to crack down on people who are granted permission to stay for a restricted time but disappear when the period expires , frattini explained , pointing to recent scares in germany , britain and denmark .
under his proposals , which will be published in november , law-enforcement officials in all member states would be allowed to share collected data with colleagues across the eu .
the scheme would operate alongside an airline passenger data recording system apparently modeled on one developed by the us .
officials said they were still debating whether to adopt the system for flights within eu as well as those to and from countries outside the union .
technological crackdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should radical web sites be blocked ?
much of the discussion was geared to finding ways of countering the use of the internet by militants , with participants debating issues such as censorship and freedom of expression .
frattini proposed a technological crackdown on terrorist activities , including a plan to set up a database to provide an early-warning system on lost or stolen explosives , and new provisions to deal with the misuse of the internet by terrorists .
frattini urged sanctions against web sites that disseminate terror propaganda or bomb-building instructions or engage in recruitment for terrorist groups , prompting concerns among ministers about privacy and civil liberties .
such web sites " have nothing to do with freedom of expression , " retaliated frattini , who said he was also considering proposing broader legal definition of conspiracy that would include people who support terrorist acts .
public concerns that european legislators might curb people 's individual freedoms in their attempts to prevent terrorism attacks on their territory were apparent at the press conference after monday 's meeting .
" if your question is whether a sort-of ' big brother ' is arising in europe and calling fundamental rights into question , then the answer is ' no , " ' said rui pereira , portugal 's interior minister , in response to a question , according to news agency dpa .
" but no member state , and the eu as a whole , can avoid fighting terrorism , " he added .
extending the schengen agreement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu justice and home affairs comissioner frattini also discussed was an extension to the eu 's borderless travel zone - as far east as the frontiers with ukraine and belarus - a week before christmas , two weeks ahead of schedule .
according to portuguese home affairs minister rui perreira , nine new member states are poised to join the schengen travel zone , abolishing all land and sea checks along their common borders , although checks at airports will continue until march .
" all of the tests that we have carried out confirm that by the end of the year we will be able to remove the frontiers , " said perreira .
the border-free " schengen " area now includes 13 eu countries , plus norway and iceland .
the latest countries involved are the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia .
cyprus , the 10th nation to join the eu in 2004 , has opted to keep some border checks for a further year .
" i think this will serve as a real incentive for citizens of the new member states to feel that they are full european citizens , " perreira said .
eu justice ministers will decide on giving the final go-ahead to the expansion of schengen during their meeting on nov .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 02.10.2007 germany faces rich-poor divide , says president großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the era of unilateralism is over , said köhler when german president horst köhler gave his second " berlin address " on monday , oct .
2 , he surprised many with statements that sounded positively left-leaning for a member of the conservative christian democratic party . last year , when köhler chose to concentrate on domestic education issues , his speech caused barely a ripple .
this time round , he cast his net wider and took the opportunity to warn of the dangers of globalization , the " growing rift " between germany 's haves and the have-nots , and the need for greater regulation of international financial markets .
although köhler was generally viewed as a neo-liberal when he assumed office in 2004 , many saw monday 's talk as further proof of a perceived swing to the left .
ten years after then president roman herzog gave the very first berlin address and famously told the country that it needed to " jolt itself into action , " horst köhler echoed his predecessor 's plea for greater german openness and focused heavily on the issue of globalization and its consequences .
the risks of globalization " does globalization ultimately endanger our entire social model ? " he asked .
" the pressure of global competition is putting much to the test . … a large part of humanity continues to live in deepest poverty .
this has two main causes : not being able to share sufficiently in globalization - mainly because of a lack of economic power and good governance - and being disadvantaged by states and private players who pursue their own interests with no regard for others .
" those who live at the expense of others will at some stage be left standing alone , " he admonished .
but in keeping with the traditionally optimistic spirit of the presidential speeches , his message was broadly upbeat .
" globalization is simply life , " he said .
" it has to be shaped through day-to-day work and imagination , through untiring efforts and cheerful enthusiasm .
it can change the world for the better . "
a social conscience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs to look after the weaker members of society köhler pulled more of a punch when it came to germany , raising many points underlying the social democrats ' new party agenda .
referring to many people 's fear of social destitution , he said germany needed to take better care of its workforce .
" germany is not an effective and future-oriented state based on social justice at present , " he said , pointing out that the country was witnessing a creeping divide between the rich and the poor .
" the inequality in the distribution of income in germany has increased . … job security has diminished and people 's working lives are subject to change and flux . ...
although germany 's broad middle class continues to do quite well , there is an increasing fear of social decline and many people from low-income and less well-educated backgrounds can not advance without assistance , " he said .
continuing the social theme , he reiterated the thrust of last year 's argument and said the country needed to improve school performance .
" germany 's education system is not performing as well as those of some other western industrialized states , " he argued .
in a further echo of social democratic values , he went on to call for greater regulation of global financial markets and proposed the international monetary fund europe increase the involvement of emerging economies and developing countries in its decision-making .
it was time , he said , that europe played a greater role on the international stage .
" i believe that the world expects more of us europeans than we are currently offering , " he said .
" the world would be poorer without the european perspective on things .
and it is therefore our duty to share this perspective with others . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while the flags do represent a show of national unity , it is a statement of allegiance not to a team but to the country itself .
the message in brussels is clear : " we are belgium ; we are one . "
the people of brussels are united behind the flag as the political crisis in belgium continues .
it is now 112 days since elections triggered a deadlock over more self-rule for belgium 's rival linguistic camps and set the dutch and french-speaking sides against each other in a complex row that doomsayers say could tear the country in two .
the belgian political system has been in paralysis since the june 10 election when the country 's christian democrats and liberals won a legislative majority to form a coalition government .
however , both sides then split into dutch and french-speaking parties with the dutch-speaking christian democrats and liberals demanding more autonomy for the northern flanders region .
the francophone politicians accuse the flemish of trying to split the country by demanding increasing independence for flanders , saying that the unity and structure of the state is at risk if the north gets more autonomy .
a bigger say for flanders in areas such as the economy and employment would effectively give the region the power of a small state , they argue , and would have a detrimental effect on the rest of the country .
prosperous flanders wants more autonomy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : split down the middle there has been tension between francophone , wallonia in the south and flanders in the north ever since belgium won its independence in 1830 . but the main problem with modern belgium as far as the flemings are concerned is that their more prosperous region has to continually prop up wallonia , a region which is poorer and has higher unemployment .
the flemings want wallonia to become more accountable and to keep more money in their wealthy dutch-speaking region .
this feeling of disparity has fuelled resurgence in flemish nationalism and , in turn , the rising success of flemish separatist parties . the stand-off has led to almost four months of stalemate over the formation of the government .
while belgian king albert ii has appointing a series of politicians with the unenviable job of hammering out a compromise and forming a coalition , each has so far failed .
" the problem is that we are still stuck in an electoral situation where any movement by one side or the other towards an agreement is seen as a sign of weakness , " johan buelens , a professor of political science at the free university of brussels , told dw-world.de.
" it 's like a game of political chicken .
who will blink first ? "
bildunterschrift : officially bilingual brussels aligns itself with wallonia brussels , wallonia see no reason for split the political split along linguistic lines has generated discussions in many quarters over a possible geographical separation of the nation .
while the general impression outside belgium is of a country on the verge of collapse , the people , at least those in the capital , are far more relaxed .
" this talk of separation comes only from the politicians , " said anne wilmots , a physiotherapist in the predominantly flemish quarter of woluwe sint pieters in brussels .
" the people , at least in brussels and wallonia , do n't want a split and do n't believe there will be one .
it is a tactic , an empty threat in a game of politics .
no one really believes this will happen . "
the opinion of many of those living in the largely francophone but officially bilingual municipality of brussels is much the same as that of the majority of french-speakers in wallonia , including the region 's largest political party .
" this is not a new discussion , " a senior politician with humanist democratic centre -lrb- cdh -rrb- , a christian democratic party , told dw-world.de under the condition of anonymity .
" we have been talking along linguistic lines for over 50 years and the country is still together .
the regions are compatible , whatever people may say .
the cdh supports a unified belgium and will continue to do so .
we do n't foresee any changes in our ideology or the structure of our nation . "
flemish nationalism fuelling independence debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flemish nationalist parties have made gains in flanders however , the view from the north is quite different .
a recent poll in the flemish-language daily het laatste nieuws showed that 46.1 percent of flemings polled wanted belgium to split , compared to 49.6 percent who said they did n't .
" many flemings believe that a split would make them richer , " said buelens .
" every two months vlaams belang -lsb- a flemish nationalist party -rsb- sends out flyers saying that flemings pay enough towards wallonia to buy a walloon family a 15,000-euro car -lrb- $ 21,000 -rrb- every two years .
those who believe that believe that this money would go to them if the country was divided .
it is not as simple as that .
" it is like a child in a quarreling family , " he continued .
" if the parents row all the time , maybe the child thinks it would be better for them to divorce .
but it thinks this without any real knowledge of the consequences .
the child just thinks things would be better than the quarreling .
this is how it is in belgium . "
while the opinions of the people show just how complicated and diverse life in belgium can be , the final decision to split the country - should it come to that - will be made by the politicians .
but just how likely and how possible would it be to dissolve belgium ?
practical problems , lack of will make divorce unlikely " for a start it is really only a small part of the flemish political elite which favors a split , " said buelens .
" but the flemish have a larger federal presence , with about 60 percent of the population .
even so , there would have to be agreement on both sides of the divide to separate the country and we 've seen how hard it is to gain a consensus here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium is rife with political and linguistic divisions buelens believes that there are too many issues involved in breaking up the country to make it a viable option , from the payment of the national debt to the future of brussels .
but , he concluded , it was worth debating the idea as it could lead to the resolution of other long-standing problems in belgium .
" it 's good that the politicians are talking about this , " he said .
" this debate could lead to a reform of the regional structure which would make things fairer for everyone ; how power can be shared and distributed , how wealth and employment can be spread around the whole country . "
" it is better that they resolve their differences over 100 , 200 or even 300 days rather than take up arms against each other and decide it that way . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the people of brussels are united behind the flag as the political crisis in belgium continues .
it is now 112 days since elections triggered a deadlock over more self-rule for belgium 's rival linguistic camps and set the dutch and french-speaking sides against each other in a complex row that doomsayers say could tear the country in two .
the belgian political system has been in paralysis since the june 10 election when the country 's christian democrats and liberals won a legislative majority to form a coalition government .
however , both sides then split into dutch and french-speaking parties with the dutch-speaking christian democrats and liberals demanding more autonomy for the northern flanders region .
the francophone politicians accuse the flemish of trying to split the country by demanding increasing independence for flanders , saying that the unity and structure of the state is at risk if the north gets more autonomy .
a bigger say for flanders in areas such as the economy and employment would effectively give the region the power of a small state , they argue , and would have a detrimental effect on the rest of the country .
prosperous flanders wants more autonomy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : split down the middle there has been tension between francophone , wallonia in the south and flanders in the north ever since belgium won its independence in 1830 . but the main problem with modern belgium as far as the flemings are concerned is that their more prosperous region has to continually prop up wallonia , a region which is poorer and has higher unemployment .
the flemings want wallonia to become more accountable and to keep more money in their wealthy dutch-speaking region .
this feeling of disparity has fuelled resurgence in flemish nationalism and , in turn , the rising success of flemish separatist parties . the stand-off has led to almost four months of stalemate over the formation of the government .
while belgian king albert ii has appointing a series of politicians with the unenviable job of hammering out a compromise and forming a coalition , each has so far failed .
" the problem is that we are still stuck in an electoral situation where any movement by one side or the other towards an agreement is seen as a sign of weakness , " johan buelens , a professor of political science at the free university of brussels , told dw-world.de.
" it 's like a game of political chicken .
who will blink first ? "
bildunterschrift : officially bilingual brussels aligns itself with wallonia brussels , wallonia see no reason for split the political split along linguistic lines has generated discussions in many quarters over a possible geographical separation of the nation .
while the general impression outside belgium is of a country on the verge of collapse , the people , at least those in the capital , are far more relaxed .
" this talk of separation comes only from the politicians , " said anne wilmots , a physiotherapist in the predominantly flemish quarter of woluwe sint pieters in brussels .
" the people , at least in brussels and wallonia , do n't want a split and do n't believe there will be one .
it is a tactic , an empty threat in a game of politics .
no one really believes this will happen . "
the opinion of many of those living in the largely francophone but officially bilingual municipality of brussels is much the same as that of the majority of french-speakers in wallonia , including the region 's largest political party .
" this is not a new discussion , " a senior politician with humanist democratic centre -lrb- cdh -rrb- , a christian democratic party , told dw-world.de under the condition of anonymity .
" we have been talking along linguistic lines for over 50 years and the country is still together .
the regions are compatible , whatever people may say .
the cdh supports a unified belgium and will continue to do so .
we do n't foresee any changes in our ideology or the structure of our nation . "
flemish nationalism fuelling independence debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flemish nationalist parties have made gains in flanders however , the view from the north is quite different .
a recent poll in the flemish-language daily het laatste nieuws showed that 46.1 percent of flemings polled wanted belgium to split , compared to 49.6 percent who said they did n't .
" many flemings believe that a split would make them richer , " said buelens .
" every two months vlaams belang -lsb- a flemish nationalist party -rsb- sends out flyers saying that flemings pay enough towards wallonia to buy a walloon family a 15,000-euro car -lrb- $ 21,000 -rrb- every two years .
those who believe that believe that this money would go to them if the country was divided .
it is not as simple as that .
" it is like a child in a quarreling family , " he continued .
" if the parents row all the time , maybe the child thinks it would be better for them to divorce .
but it thinks this without any real knowledge of the consequences .
the child just thinks things would be better than the quarreling .
this is how it is in belgium . "
while the opinions of the people show just how complicated and diverse life in belgium can be , the final decision to split the country - should it come to that - will be made by the politicians .
but just how likely and how possible would it be to dissolve belgium ?
practical problems , lack of will make divorce unlikely " for a start it is really only a small part of the flemish political elite which favors a split , " said buelens .
" but the flemish have a larger federal presence , with about 60 percent of the population .
even so , there would have to be agreement on both sides of the divide to separate the country and we 've seen how hard it is to gain a consensus here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium is rife with political and linguistic divisions buelens believes that there are too many issues involved in breaking up the country to make it a viable option , from the payment of the national debt to the future of brussels .
but , he concluded , it was worth debating the idea as it could lead to the resolution of other long-standing problems in belgium .
" it 's good that the politicians are talking about this , " he said .
" this debate could lead to a reform of the regional structure which would make things fairer for everyone ; how power can be shared and distributed , how wealth and employment can be spread around the whole country . "

2 , he surprised many with statements that sounded positively left-leaning for a member of the conservative christian democratic party . last year , when köhler chose to concentrate on domestic education issues , his speech caused barely a ripple .
this time round , he cast his net wider and took the opportunity to warn of the dangers of globalization , the " growing rift " between germany 's haves and the have-nots , and the need for greater regulation of international financial markets .
although köhler was generally viewed as a neo-liberal when he assumed office in 2004 , many saw monday 's talk as further proof of a perceived swing to the left .
ten years after then president roman herzog gave the very first berlin address and famously told the country that it needed to " jolt itself into action , " horst köhler echoed his predecessor 's plea for greater german openness and focused heavily on the issue of globalization and its consequences .
the risks of globalization " does globalization ultimately endanger our entire social model ? " he asked .
" the pressure of global competition is putting much to the test . … a large part of humanity continues to live in deepest poverty .
this has two main causes : not being able to share sufficiently in globalization - mainly because of a lack of economic power and good governance - and being disadvantaged by states and private players who pursue their own interests with no regard for others .
" those who live at the expense of others will at some stage be left standing alone , " he admonished .
but in keeping with the traditionally optimistic spirit of the presidential speeches , his message was broadly upbeat .
" globalization is simply life , " he said .
" it has to be shaped through day-to-day work and imagination , through untiring efforts and cheerful enthusiasm .
it can change the world for the better . "
a social conscience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs to look after the weaker members of society köhler pulled more of a punch when it came to germany , raising many points underlying the social democrats ' new party agenda .
referring to many people 's fear of social destitution , he said germany needed to take better care of its workforce .
" germany is not an effective and future-oriented state based on social justice at present , " he said , pointing out that the country was witnessing a creeping divide between the rich and the poor .
" the inequality in the distribution of income in germany has increased . … job security has diminished and people 's working lives are subject to change and flux . ...
although germany 's broad middle class continues to do quite well , there is an increasing fear of social decline and many people from low-income and less well-educated backgrounds can not advance without assistance , " he said .
continuing the social theme , he reiterated the thrust of last year 's argument and said the country needed to improve school performance .
" germany 's education system is not performing as well as those of some other western industrialized states , " he argued .
in a further echo of social democratic values , he went on to call for greater regulation of global financial markets and proposed the international monetary fund europe increase the involvement of emerging economies and developing countries in its decision-making .
it was time , he said , that europe played a greater role on the international stage .
" i believe that the world expects more of us europeans than we are currently offering , " he said .
" the world would be poorer without the european perspective on things .
and it is therefore our duty to share this perspective with others . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this directive in no way changes the basic rights of the sector and workers in the sector , " portuguese telecoms minister mario lino told reporters , trying to calm the fears of some postal workers concerned about possible job cuts . the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , had originally proposed to strip away the remaining barriers to competition from 2009 .

germany is to open up fully open up its market next year . the commission has said that greater competition could lead to lower costs and better or customized service .
as an extra reason to convince countries to open their markets , only former countries who have liberalized their own postal markets will be eligible to become involved in letter delivery in other eu countries . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

2 , he surprised many with statements that sounded positively left-leaning for a member of the conservative christian democratic party . last year , when köhler chose to concentrate on domestic education issues , his speech caused barely a ripple .
this time round , he cast his net wider and took the opportunity to warn of the dangers of globalization , the " growing rift " between germany 's haves and the have-nots , and the need for greater regulation of international financial markets .
although köhler was generally viewed as a neo-liberal when he assumed office in 2004 , many saw monday 's talk as further proof of a perceived swing to the left .
ten years after then president roman herzog gave the very first berlin address and famously told the country that it needed to " jolt itself into action , " horst köhler echoed his predecessor 's plea for greater german openness and focused heavily on the issue of globalization and its consequences .
the risks of globalization " does globalization ultimately endanger our entire social model ? " he asked .
" the pressure of global competition is putting much to the test . … a large part of humanity continues to live in deepest poverty .
this has two main causes : not being able to share sufficiently in globalization - mainly because of a lack of economic power and good governance - and being disadvantaged by states and private players who pursue their own interests with no regard for others .
" those who live at the expense of others will at some stage be left standing alone , " he admonished .
but in keeping with the traditionally optimistic spirit of the presidential speeches , his message was broadly upbeat .
" globalization is simply life , " he said .
" it has to be shaped through day-to-day work and imagination , through untiring efforts and cheerful enthusiasm .
it can change the world for the better . "
a social conscience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs to look after the weaker members of society köhler pulled more of a punch when it came to germany , raising many points underlying the social democrats ' new party agenda .
referring to many people 's fear of social destitution , he said germany needed to take better care of its workforce .
" germany is not an effective and future-oriented state based on social justice at present , " he said , pointing out that the country was witnessing a creeping divide between the rich and the poor .
" the inequality in the distribution of income in germany has increased . … job security has diminished and people 's working lives are subject to change and flux . ...
although germany 's broad middle class continues to do quite well , there is an increasing fear of social decline and many people from low-income and less well-educated backgrounds can not advance without assistance , " he said .
continuing the social theme , he reiterated the thrust of last year 's argument and said the country needed to improve school performance .
" germany 's education system is not performing as well as those of some other western industrialized states , " he argued .
in a further echo of social democratic values , he went on to call for greater regulation of global financial markets and proposed the international monetary fund europe increase the involvement of emerging economies and developing countries in its decision-making .
it was time , he said , that europe played a greater role on the international stage .
" i believe that the world expects more of us europeans than we are currently offering , " he said .
" the world would be poorer without the european perspective on things .
and it is therefore our duty to share this perspective with others . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ten years after then president roman herzog gave the very first berlin address and famously told the country that it needed to " jolt itself into action , " horst köhler echoed his predecessor 's plea for greater german openness and focused heavily on the issue of globalization and its consequences .
the risks of globalization " does globalization ultimately endanger our entire social model ? " he asked .
" the pressure of global competition is putting much to the test . … a large part of humanity continues to live in deepest poverty .
this has two main causes : not being able to share sufficiently in globalization - mainly because of a lack of economic power and good governance - and being disadvantaged by states and private players who pursue their own interests with no regard for others .
" those who live at the expense of others will at some stage be left standing alone , " he admonished .
but in keeping with the traditionally optimistic spirit of the presidential speeches , his message was broadly upbeat .
" globalization is simply life , " he said .
" it has to be shaped through day-to-day work and imagination , through untiring efforts and cheerful enthusiasm .
it can change the world for the better . "
a social conscience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs to look after the weaker members of society köhler pulled more of a punch when it came to germany , raising many points underlying the social democrats ' new party agenda .
referring to many people 's fear of social destitution , he said germany needed to take better care of its workforce .
" germany is not an effective and future-oriented state based on social justice at present , " he said , pointing out that the country was witnessing a creeping divide between the rich and the poor .
" the inequality in the distribution of income in germany has increased . … job security has diminished and people 's working lives are subject to change and flux . ...
although germany 's broad middle class continues to do quite well , there is an increasing fear of social decline and many people from low-income and less well-educated backgrounds can not advance without assistance , " he said .
continuing the social theme , he reiterated the thrust of last year 's argument and said the country needed to improve school performance .
" germany 's education system is not performing as well as those of some other western industrialized states , " he argued .
in a further echo of social democratic values , he went on to call for greater regulation of global financial markets and proposed the international monetary fund europe increase the involvement of emerging economies and developing countries in its decision-making .
it was time , he said , that europe played a greater role on the international stage .
" i believe that the world expects more of us europeans than we are currently offering , " he said .
" the world would be poorer without the european perspective on things .
and it is therefore our duty to share this perspective with others . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eu justice and home affairs commissioner franco frattini called for a register of all non-eu citizens entering and leaving the 27-nation bloc , who would be electronically registered with biometric identifiers .
the register is " extremely necessary " in order to crack down on people who are granted permission to stay for a restricted time but disappear when the period expires , frattini explained , pointing to recent scares in germany , britain and denmark .
under his proposals , which will be published in november , law-enforcement officials in all member states would be allowed to share collected data with colleagues across the eu .
the scheme would operate alongside an airline passenger data recording system apparently modeled on one developed by the us .
officials said they were still debating whether to adopt the system for flights within eu as well as those to and from countries outside the union .
technological crackdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should radical web sites be blocked ?
much of the discussion was geared to finding ways of countering the use of the internet by militants , with participants debating issues such as censorship and freedom of expression .
frattini proposed a technological crackdown on terrorist activities , including a plan to set up a database to provide an early-warning system on lost or stolen explosives , and new provisions to deal with the misuse of the internet by terrorists .
frattini urged sanctions against web sites that disseminate terror propaganda or bomb-building instructions or engage in recruitment for terrorist groups , prompting concerns among ministers about privacy and civil liberties .
such web sites " have nothing to do with freedom of expression , " retaliated frattini , who said he was also considering proposing broader legal definition of conspiracy that would include people who support terrorist acts .
public concerns that european legislators might curb people 's individual freedoms in their attempts to prevent terrorism attacks on their territory were apparent at the press conference after monday 's meeting .
" if your question is whether a sort-of ' big brother ' is arising in europe and calling fundamental rights into question , then the answer is ' no , " ' said rui pereira , portugal 's interior minister , in response to a question , according to news agency dpa .
" but no member state , and the eu as a whole , can avoid fighting terrorism , " he added .
extending the schengen agreement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu justice and home affairs comissioner frattini also discussed was an extension to the eu 's borderless travel zone - as far east as the frontiers with ukraine and belarus - a week before christmas , two weeks ahead of schedule .
according to portuguese home affairs minister rui perreira , nine new member states are poised to join the schengen travel zone , abolishing all land and sea checks along their common borders , although checks at airports will continue until march .
" all of the tests that we have carried out confirm that by the end of the year we will be able to remove the frontiers , " said perreira .
the border-free " schengen " area now includes 13 eu countries , plus norway and iceland .
the latest countries involved are the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia .
cyprus , the 10th nation to join the eu in 2004 , has opted to keep some border checks for a further year .
" i think this will serve as a real incentive for citizens of the new member states to feel that they are full european citizens , " perreira said .
eu justice ministers will decide on giving the final go-ahead to the expansion of schengen during their meeting on nov .

while the flags do represent a show of national unity , it is a statement of allegiance not to a team but to the country itself .
the message in brussels is clear : " we are belgium ; we are one . "
the people of brussels are united behind the flag as the political crisis in belgium continues .
it is now 112 days since elections triggered a deadlock over more self-rule for belgium 's rival linguistic camps and set the dutch and french-speaking sides against each other in a complex row that doomsayers say could tear the country in two .
the belgian political system has been in paralysis since the june 10 election when the country 's christian democrats and liberals won a legislative majority to form a coalition government .
however , both sides then split into dutch and french-speaking parties with the dutch-speaking christian democrats and liberals demanding more autonomy for the northern flanders region .
the francophone politicians accuse the flemish of trying to split the country by demanding increasing independence for flanders , saying that the unity and structure of the state is at risk if the north gets more autonomy .
a bigger say for flanders in areas such as the economy and employment would effectively give the region the power of a small state , they argue , and would have a detrimental effect on the rest of the country .
prosperous flanders wants more autonomy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : split down the middle there has been tension between francophone , wallonia in the south and flanders in the north ever since belgium won its independence in 1830 . but the main problem with modern belgium as far as the flemings are concerned is that their more prosperous region has to continually prop up wallonia , a region which is poorer and has higher unemployment .
the flemings want wallonia to become more accountable and to keep more money in their wealthy dutch-speaking region .
this feeling of disparity has fuelled resurgence in flemish nationalism and , in turn , the rising success of flemish separatist parties . the stand-off has led to almost four months of stalemate over the formation of the government .
while belgian king albert ii has appointing a series of politicians with the unenviable job of hammering out a compromise and forming a coalition , each has so far failed .
" the problem is that we are still stuck in an electoral situation where any movement by one side or the other towards an agreement is seen as a sign of weakness , " johan buelens , a professor of political science at the free university of brussels , told dw-world.de.
" it 's like a game of political chicken .
who will blink first ? "
bildunterschrift : officially bilingual brussels aligns itself with wallonia brussels , wallonia see no reason for split the political split along linguistic lines has generated discussions in many quarters over a possible geographical separation of the nation .
while the general impression outside belgium is of a country on the verge of collapse , the people , at least those in the capital , are far more relaxed .
" this talk of separation comes only from the politicians , " said anne wilmots , a physiotherapist in the predominantly flemish quarter of woluwe sint pieters in brussels .
" the people , at least in brussels and wallonia , do n't want a split and do n't believe there will be one .
it is a tactic , an empty threat in a game of politics .
no one really believes this will happen . "
the opinion of many of those living in the largely francophone but officially bilingual municipality of brussels is much the same as that of the majority of french-speakers in wallonia , including the region 's largest political party .
" this is not a new discussion , " a senior politician with humanist democratic centre -lrb- cdh -rrb- , a christian democratic party , told dw-world.de under the condition of anonymity .
" we have been talking along linguistic lines for over 50 years and the country is still together .
the regions are compatible , whatever people may say .
the cdh supports a unified belgium and will continue to do so .
we do n't foresee any changes in our ideology or the structure of our nation . "
flemish nationalism fuelling independence debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flemish nationalist parties have made gains in flanders however , the view from the north is quite different .
a recent poll in the flemish-language daily het laatste nieuws showed that 46.1 percent of flemings polled wanted belgium to split , compared to 49.6 percent who said they did n't .
" many flemings believe that a split would make them richer , " said buelens .
" every two months vlaams belang -lsb- a flemish nationalist party -rsb- sends out flyers saying that flemings pay enough towards wallonia to buy a walloon family a 15,000-euro car -lrb- $ 21,000 -rrb- every two years .
those who believe that believe that this money would go to them if the country was divided .
it is not as simple as that .
" it is like a child in a quarreling family , " he continued .
" if the parents row all the time , maybe the child thinks it would be better for them to divorce .
but it thinks this without any real knowledge of the consequences .
the child just thinks things would be better than the quarreling .
this is how it is in belgium . "
while the opinions of the people show just how complicated and diverse life in belgium can be , the final decision to split the country - should it come to that - will be made by the politicians .
but just how likely and how possible would it be to dissolve belgium ?
practical problems , lack of will make divorce unlikely " for a start it is really only a small part of the flemish political elite which favors a split , " said buelens .
" but the flemish have a larger federal presence , with about 60 percent of the population .
even so , there would have to be agreement on both sides of the divide to separate the country and we 've seen how hard it is to gain a consensus here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium is rife with political and linguistic divisions buelens believes that there are too many issues involved in breaking up the country to make it a viable option , from the payment of the national debt to the future of brussels .
but , he concluded , it was worth debating the idea as it could lead to the resolution of other long-standing problems in belgium .
" it 's good that the politicians are talking about this , " he said .
" this debate could lead to a reform of the regional structure which would make things fairer for everyone ; how power can be shared and distributed , how wealth and employment can be spread around the whole country . "
" it is better that they resolve their differences over 100 , 200 or even 300 days rather than take up arms against each other and decide it that way . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

prosperous flanders wants more autonomy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : split down the middle there has been tension between francophone , wallonia in the south and flanders in the north ever since belgium won its independence in 1830 . but the main problem with modern belgium as far as the flemings are concerned is that their more prosperous region has to continually prop up wallonia , a region which is poorer and has higher unemployment .
the flemings want wallonia to become more accountable and to keep more money in their wealthy dutch-speaking region .
this feeling of disparity has fuelled resurgence in flemish nationalism and , in turn , the rising success of flemish separatist parties . the stand-off has led to almost four months of stalemate over the formation of the government .
while belgian king albert ii has appointing a series of politicians with the unenviable job of hammering out a compromise and forming a coalition , each has so far failed .
" the problem is that we are still stuck in an electoral situation where any movement by one side or the other towards an agreement is seen as a sign of weakness , " johan buelens , a professor of political science at the free university of brussels , told dw-world.de.
" it 's like a game of political chicken .
who will blink first ? "
bildunterschrift : officially bilingual brussels aligns itself with wallonia brussels , wallonia see no reason for split the political split along linguistic lines has generated discussions in many quarters over a possible geographical separation of the nation .
while the general impression outside belgium is of a country on the verge of collapse , the people , at least those in the capital , are far more relaxed .
" this talk of separation comes only from the politicians , " said anne wilmots , a physiotherapist in the predominantly flemish quarter of woluwe sint pieters in brussels .
" the people , at least in brussels and wallonia , do n't want a split and do n't believe there will be one .
it is a tactic , an empty threat in a game of politics .
no one really believes this will happen . "
the opinion of many of those living in the largely francophone but officially bilingual municipality of brussels is much the same as that of the majority of french-speakers in wallonia , including the region 's largest political party .
" this is not a new discussion , " a senior politician with humanist democratic centre -lrb- cdh -rrb- , a christian democratic party , told dw-world.de under the condition of anonymity .
" we have been talking along linguistic lines for over 50 years and the country is still together .
the regions are compatible , whatever people may say .
the cdh supports a unified belgium and will continue to do so .
we do n't foresee any changes in our ideology or the structure of our nation . "
flemish nationalism fuelling independence debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flemish nationalist parties have made gains in flanders however , the view from the north is quite different .
a recent poll in the flemish-language daily het laatste nieuws showed that 46.1 percent of flemings polled wanted belgium to split , compared to 49.6 percent who said they did n't .
" many flemings believe that a split would make them richer , " said buelens .
" every two months vlaams belang -lsb- a flemish nationalist party -rsb- sends out flyers saying that flemings pay enough towards wallonia to buy a walloon family a 15,000-euro car -lrb- $ 21,000 -rrb- every two years .
those who believe that believe that this money would go to them if the country was divided .
it is not as simple as that .
" it is like a child in a quarreling family , " he continued .
" if the parents row all the time , maybe the child thinks it would be better for them to divorce .
but it thinks this without any real knowledge of the consequences .
the child just thinks things would be better than the quarreling .
this is how it is in belgium . "
while the opinions of the people show just how complicated and diverse life in belgium can be , the final decision to split the country - should it come to that - will be made by the politicians .
but just how likely and how possible would it be to dissolve belgium ?
practical problems , lack of will make divorce unlikely " for a start it is really only a small part of the flemish political elite which favors a split , " said buelens .
" but the flemish have a larger federal presence , with about 60 percent of the population .
even so , there would have to be agreement on both sides of the divide to separate the country and we 've seen how hard it is to gain a consensus here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium is rife with political and linguistic divisions buelens believes that there are too many issues involved in breaking up the country to make it a viable option , from the payment of the national debt to the future of brussels .
but , he concluded , it was worth debating the idea as it could lead to the resolution of other long-standing problems in belgium .
" it 's good that the politicians are talking about this , " he said .
" this debate could lead to a reform of the regional structure which would make things fairer for everyone ; how power can be shared and distributed , how wealth and employment can be spread around the whole country . "

while the flags do represent a show of national unity , it is a statement of allegiance not to a team but to the country itself .
the message in brussels is clear : " we are belgium ; we are one . "
the people of brussels are united behind the flag as the political crisis in belgium continues .
it is now 112 days since elections triggered a deadlock over more self-rule for belgium 's rival linguistic camps and set the dutch and french-speaking sides against each other in a complex row that doomsayers say could tear the country in two .
the belgian political system has been in paralysis since the june 10 election when the country 's christian democrats and liberals won a legislative majority to form a coalition government .
however , both sides then split into dutch and french-speaking parties with the dutch-speaking christian democrats and liberals demanding more autonomy for the northern flanders region .
the francophone politicians accuse the flemish of trying to split the country by demanding increasing independence for flanders , saying that the unity and structure of the state is at risk if the north gets more autonomy .
a bigger say for flanders in areas such as the economy and employment would effectively give the region the power of a small state , they argue , and would have a detrimental effect on the rest of the country .

1 , to open their 88 billion euro -lrb- $ 125.3 billion -rrb- postal markets to full competition beginning in 2011 , but 11 countries will be given an additional two-year grace period . some countries had wanted to move faster , but the ministers were motivated to reach a compromise that was acceptable of all 27 of the bloc 's nations , herve novelli , french minister of state for businesses and foreign trade , told the afp news agency . " this directive in no way changes the basic rights of the sector and workers in the sector , " portuguese telecoms minister mario lino told reporters , trying to calm the fears of some postal workers concerned about possible job cuts . the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , had originally proposed to strip away the remaining barriers to competition from 2009 .
if a member state wishes to end the state monopoly earlier , as has been the case in some countries , they are permitted to do so . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission says competition will bring down prices the 11 nations who may take advantage of the grace period include : cyprus , the czech republic , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , romania and slovakia - all eu newcomers who have joined since 2004 - plus greece and luxembourg . the european parliament still needs to approve the measure , a final step that is seen as likely to occur in february or march as the deal ministers agreed to was largely put together by parliament members . " in general the parliament is very happy about the result of the council , " markus ferber , the german lawmaker steering the measure through the eu assembly , told reuters . letters under 50 grams still shielded national markets for letters weighing up to 50 grams -lrb- 1.8 ounces -rrb- are currently protected from competition .
mail above that weight has already been liberalized . the european postal sector was liberalized a decade ago for the delivery of packages weighing over 350 grams , then broadened in 2003 to items of more than 100 grams in 2003 and , to letters weighing more than 50 grams in 2006 . the european commission has aimed to expand on the perceived success of britain , finland , and sweden , which have already liberalized their postal markets .
germany is to open up fully open up its market next year . the commission has said that greater competition could lead to lower costs and better or customized service .
as an extra reason to convince countries to open their markets , only former countries who have liberalized their own postal markets will be eligible to become involved in letter delivery in other eu countries . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

her visit is to focus on a range of issues , including human rights , aids , economic cooperation and the political crisis in zimbabwe . deutsche welle spoke about merkel 's agenda on the africa tour with dominic johnson , an editor at germany 's taz newspaper and an expert on africa . deutsche welle : why did german chancellor angela merkel choose to go to ethiopia , south africa and liberia ? dominic johnson : south africa is the most obvious choice - it is the most important trading partner for germany in africa .
president thabo mbeki , the south african president , attended the g8 summit in heiligendamm in june .
south africa is going to host the soccer world cup in 2010 and there is a lot of cooperation between germany and south africa on that .
so , south africa is the natural place to go for a german chancellor . ethiopia is fairly obvious as well .
it is the head of the african union , the seat of the african union commission , where merkel will visit .
it has become an obligatory stop for every german politician who goes to africa .
german president horst köhler was there recently , and cooperation is quite close . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel liberia is maybe less obvious .
it is a small country in west africa , not particularly important , but it is the only african country headed by a woman -lsb- president ellen johnson sirleaf -rsb- and chancellor merkel is the only female head of government in europe , so in a way , when the most powerful woman in europe goes to meet the most powerful woman in africa .
it 's a highly symbolic moment . there 's a large german business delegation that will be accompanying merkel , but surely business issues will not be the only ones on the agenda ? they wo n't be the only ones , but i think they 'll be quite important , even though they are n't being flagged at the moment .
it 's already been announced that , following this africa trip , the german government will try to call an african economic summit to try to encourage german businesses , especially small businesses , to invest in africa , and we know that south africa and liberia are looking for more investments for reconstruction . what are some of the other issues that will be discussed ? one of them will be development aid .
the chancellor has said she will visit development projects in all three countries .
she mentioned her upcoming africa visit during her speech at the un global fund to fight aids conference in berlin last week and she made it clear that this is important to her as well .
so , there will be a lot of the traditional development issues , but there will also be a lot of business items on the agenda during talks .
and , of course , germany is still the president of the g8 , so it still has a political role to play and will be looking at liberia 's foreign debt and cooperation with the african union as a whole . interview : dagmar breitenbach -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 02.10.2007 new proposals let more people into eu , keep others out großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more countries are set to benefit from the schengen agreement while eu justice and interior ministers meeting in lisbon discussed tightening border controls of non-eu citizens , the bloc 's internal borderless travel zone is set to be extended . among the raft of new anti-terror measures up for discussion at the two-day informal meeting , which began monday , oct .
1 , was the use of new technology and the sharing of travelers ' data in the fight against terrorism .
eu justice and home affairs commissioner franco frattini called for a register of all non-eu citizens entering and leaving the 27-nation bloc , who would be electronically registered with biometric identifiers .
the register is " extremely necessary " in order to crack down on people who are granted permission to stay for a restricted time but disappear when the period expires , frattini explained , pointing to recent scares in germany , britain and denmark .
under his proposals , which will be published in november , law-enforcement officials in all member states would be allowed to share collected data with colleagues across the eu .
the scheme would operate alongside an airline passenger data recording system apparently modeled on one developed by the us .
officials said they were still debating whether to adopt the system for flights within eu as well as those to and from countries outside the union .
technological crackdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should radical web sites be blocked ?
much of the discussion was geared to finding ways of countering the use of the internet by militants , with participants debating issues such as censorship and freedom of expression .
frattini proposed a technological crackdown on terrorist activities , including a plan to set up a database to provide an early-warning system on lost or stolen explosives , and new provisions to deal with the misuse of the internet by terrorists .
frattini urged sanctions against web sites that disseminate terror propaganda or bomb-building instructions or engage in recruitment for terrorist groups , prompting concerns among ministers about privacy and civil liberties .
such web sites " have nothing to do with freedom of expression , " retaliated frattini , who said he was also considering proposing broader legal definition of conspiracy that would include people who support terrorist acts .
public concerns that european legislators might curb people 's individual freedoms in their attempts to prevent terrorism attacks on their territory were apparent at the press conference after monday 's meeting .
" if your question is whether a sort-of ' big brother ' is arising in europe and calling fundamental rights into question , then the answer is ' no , " ' said rui pereira , portugal 's interior minister , in response to a question , according to news agency dpa .
" but no member state , and the eu as a whole , can avoid fighting terrorism , " he added .
extending the schengen agreement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu justice and home affairs comissioner frattini also discussed was an extension to the eu 's borderless travel zone - as far east as the frontiers with ukraine and belarus - a week before christmas , two weeks ahead of schedule .
according to portuguese home affairs minister rui perreira , nine new member states are poised to join the schengen travel zone , abolishing all land and sea checks along their common borders , although checks at airports will continue until march .
" all of the tests that we have carried out confirm that by the end of the year we will be able to remove the frontiers , " said perreira .
the border-free " schengen " area now includes 13 eu countries , plus norway and iceland .
the latest countries involved are the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia .
cyprus , the 10th nation to join the eu in 2004 , has opted to keep some border checks for a further year .
" i think this will serve as a real incentive for citizens of the new member states to feel that they are full european citizens , " perreira said .
eu justice ministers will decide on giving the final go-ahead to the expansion of schengen during their meeting on nov .

2 , he surprised many with statements that sounded positively left-leaning for a member of the conservative christian democratic party . last year , when köhler chose to concentrate on domestic education issues , his speech caused barely a ripple .
this time round , he cast his net wider and took the opportunity to warn of the dangers of globalization , the " growing rift " between germany 's haves and the have-nots , and the need for greater regulation of international financial markets .
although köhler was generally viewed as a neo-liberal when he assumed office in 2004 , many saw monday 's talk as further proof of a perceived swing to the left .
ten years after then president roman herzog gave the very first berlin address and famously told the country that it needed to " jolt itself into action , " horst köhler echoed his predecessor 's plea for greater german openness and focused heavily on the issue of globalization and its consequences .
the risks of globalization " does globalization ultimately endanger our entire social model ? " he asked .
" the pressure of global competition is putting much to the test . … a large part of humanity continues to live in deepest poverty .
this has two main causes : not being able to share sufficiently in globalization - mainly because of a lack of economic power and good governance - and being disadvantaged by states and private players who pursue their own interests with no regard for others .
" those who live at the expense of others will at some stage be left standing alone , " he admonished .
but in keeping with the traditionally optimistic spirit of the presidential speeches , his message was broadly upbeat .
" globalization is simply life , " he said .
" it has to be shaped through day-to-day work and imagination , through untiring efforts and cheerful enthusiasm .
it can change the world for the better . "
a social conscience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs to look after the weaker members of society köhler pulled more of a punch when it came to germany , raising many points underlying the social democrats ' new party agenda .
referring to many people 's fear of social destitution , he said germany needed to take better care of its workforce .
" germany is not an effective and future-oriented state based on social justice at present , " he said , pointing out that the country was witnessing a creeping divide between the rich and the poor .
" the inequality in the distribution of income in germany has increased . … job security has diminished and people 's working lives are subject to change and flux . ...
although germany 's broad middle class continues to do quite well , there is an increasing fear of social decline and many people from low-income and less well-educated backgrounds can not advance without assistance , " he said .
continuing the social theme , he reiterated the thrust of last year 's argument and said the country needed to improve school performance .
" germany 's education system is not performing as well as those of some other western industrialized states , " he argued .
in a further echo of social democratic values , he went on to call for greater regulation of global financial markets and proposed the international monetary fund europe increase the involvement of emerging economies and developing countries in its decision-making .
it was time , he said , that europe played a greater role on the international stage .

her visit is to focus on a range of issues , including human rights , aids , economic cooperation and the political crisis in zimbabwe . deutsche welle spoke about merkel 's agenda on the africa tour with dominic johnson , an editor at germany 's taz newspaper and an expert on africa . deutsche welle : why did german chancellor angela merkel choose to go to ethiopia , south africa and liberia ? dominic johnson : south africa is the most obvious choice - it is the most important trading partner for germany in africa .
president thabo mbeki , the south african president , attended the g8 summit in heiligendamm in june .
south africa is going to host the soccer world cup in 2010 and there is a lot of cooperation between germany and south africa on that .
so , south africa is the natural place to go for a german chancellor . ethiopia is fairly obvious as well .
it is the head of the african union , the seat of the african union commission , where merkel will visit .
it has become an obligatory stop for every german politician who goes to africa .
german president horst köhler was there recently , and cooperation is quite close . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel liberia is maybe less obvious .
it is a small country in west africa , not particularly important , but it is the only african country headed by a woman -lsb- president ellen johnson sirleaf -rsb- and chancellor merkel is the only female head of government in europe , so in a way , when the most powerful woman in europe goes to meet the most powerful woman in africa .
it 's a highly symbolic moment . there 's a large german business delegation that will be accompanying merkel , but surely business issues will not be the only ones on the agenda ? they wo n't be the only ones , but i think they 'll be quite important , even though they are n't being flagged at the moment .
it 's already been announced that , following this africa trip , the german government will try to call an african economic summit to try to encourage german businesses , especially small businesses , to invest in africa , and we know that south africa and liberia are looking for more investments for reconstruction . what are some of the other issues that will be discussed ? one of them will be development aid .
the chancellor has said she will visit development projects in all three countries .
she mentioned her upcoming africa visit during her speech at the un global fund to fight aids conference in berlin last week and she made it clear that this is important to her as well .
so , there will be a lot of the traditional development issues , but there will also be a lot of business items on the agenda during talks .
and , of course , germany is still the president of the g8 , so it still has a political role to play and will be looking at liberia 's foreign debt and cooperation with the african union as a whole . interview : dagmar breitenbach -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

2 , in a decision that could spell the beginning of the end of the high-technology venture touted as a rival to the us military 's global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- . galileo , which was supposed to be a showcase for europe 's technical prowess and be in place by 2008 , has stalled as cost overruns pile up , private contractors bicker and member states push their own industrial interests . after funding from a private , international consortium of eight companies involved in creating the satellite navigation system fell through , the eu said it would pump some 2.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- into the european space project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrot has found few supporters for his funding model " i am still convinced that europe needs galileo , " eu transport commissioner jacques barrot said on sept .

2 , he surprised many with statements that sounded positively left-leaning for a member of the conservative christian democratic party . last year , when köhler chose to concentrate on domestic education issues , his speech caused barely a ripple .
this time round , he cast his net wider and took the opportunity to warn of the dangers of globalization , the " growing rift " between germany 's haves and the have-nots , and the need for greater regulation of international financial markets .
although köhler was generally viewed as a neo-liberal when he assumed office in 2004 , many saw monday 's talk as further proof of a perceived swing to the left .
ten years after then president roman herzog gave the very first berlin address and famously told the country that it needed to " jolt itself into action , " horst köhler echoed his predecessor 's plea for greater german openness and focused heavily on the issue of globalization and its consequences .
the risks of globalization " does globalization ultimately endanger our entire social model ? " he asked .
" the pressure of global competition is putting much to the test . … a large part of humanity continues to live in deepest poverty .
this has two main causes : not being able to share sufficiently in globalization - mainly because of a lack of economic power and good governance - and being disadvantaged by states and private players who pursue their own interests with no regard for others .
" those who live at the expense of others will at some stage be left standing alone , " he admonished .
but in keeping with the traditionally optimistic spirit of the presidential speeches , his message was broadly upbeat .
" globalization is simply life , " he said .
" it has to be shaped through day-to-day work and imagination , through untiring efforts and cheerful enthusiasm .
it can change the world for the better . "
a social conscience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs to look after the weaker members of society köhler pulled more of a punch when it came to germany , raising many points underlying the social democrats ' new party agenda .
referring to many people 's fear of social destitution , he said germany needed to take better care of its workforce .
" germany is not an effective and future-oriented state based on social justice at present , " he said , pointing out that the country was witnessing a creeping divide between the rich and the poor .
" the inequality in the distribution of income in germany has increased . … job security has diminished and people 's working lives are subject to change and flux . ...
although germany 's broad middle class continues to do quite well , there is an increasing fear of social decline and many people from low-income and less well-educated backgrounds can not advance without assistance , " he said .
continuing the social theme , he reiterated the thrust of last year 's argument and said the country needed to improve school performance .
" germany 's education system is not performing as well as those of some other western industrialized states , " he argued .
in a further echo of social democratic values , he went on to call for greater regulation of global financial markets and proposed the international monetary fund europe increase the involvement of emerging economies and developing countries in its decision-making .
it was time , he said , that europe played a greater role on the international stage .
" i believe that the world expects more of us europeans than we are currently offering , " he said .
" the world would be poorer without the european perspective on things .
and it is therefore our duty to share this perspective with others . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 , was the use of new technology and the sharing of travelers ' data in the fight against terrorism .
eu justice and home affairs commissioner franco frattini called for a register of all non-eu citizens entering and leaving the 27-nation bloc , who would be electronically registered with biometric identifiers .
the register is " extremely necessary " in order to crack down on people who are granted permission to stay for a restricted time but disappear when the period expires , frattini explained , pointing to recent scares in germany , britain and denmark .
under his proposals , which will be published in november , law-enforcement officials in all member states would be allowed to share collected data with colleagues across the eu .
the scheme would operate alongside an airline passenger data recording system apparently modeled on one developed by the us .
officials said they were still debating whether to adopt the system for flights within eu as well as those to and from countries outside the union .
technological crackdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should radical web sites be blocked ?
much of the discussion was geared to finding ways of countering the use of the internet by militants , with participants debating issues such as censorship and freedom of expression .
frattini proposed a technological crackdown on terrorist activities , including a plan to set up a database to provide an early-warning system on lost or stolen explosives , and new provisions to deal with the misuse of the internet by terrorists .
frattini urged sanctions against web sites that disseminate terror propaganda or bomb-building instructions or engage in recruitment for terrorist groups , prompting concerns among ministers about privacy and civil liberties .
such web sites " have nothing to do with freedom of expression , " retaliated frattini , who said he was also considering proposing broader legal definition of conspiracy that would include people who support terrorist acts .
public concerns that european legislators might curb people 's individual freedoms in their attempts to prevent terrorism attacks on their territory were apparent at the press conference after monday 's meeting .
" if your question is whether a sort-of ' big brother ' is arising in europe and calling fundamental rights into question , then the answer is ' no , " ' said rui pereira , portugal 's interior minister , in response to a question , according to news agency dpa .
" but no member state , and the eu as a whole , can avoid fighting terrorism , " he added .
extending the schengen agreement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu justice and home affairs comissioner frattini also discussed was an extension to the eu 's borderless travel zone - as far east as the frontiers with ukraine and belarus - a week before christmas , two weeks ahead of schedule .
according to portuguese home affairs minister rui perreira , nine new member states are poised to join the schengen travel zone , abolishing all land and sea checks along their common borders , although checks at airports will continue until march .
" all of the tests that we have carried out confirm that by the end of the year we will be able to remove the frontiers , " said perreira .
the border-free " schengen " area now includes 13 eu countries , plus norway and iceland .
the latest countries involved are the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia .
cyprus , the 10th nation to join the eu in 2004 , has opted to keep some border checks for a further year .
" i think this will serve as a real incentive for citizens of the new member states to feel that they are full european citizens , " perreira said .
eu justice ministers will decide on giving the final go-ahead to the expansion of schengen during their meeting on nov .

much of the discussion was geared to finding ways of countering the use of the internet by militants , with participants debating issues such as censorship and freedom of expression .
frattini proposed a technological crackdown on terrorist activities , including a plan to set up a database to provide an early-warning system on lost or stolen explosives , and new provisions to deal with the misuse of the internet by terrorists .
frattini urged sanctions against web sites that disseminate terror propaganda or bomb-building instructions or engage in recruitment for terrorist groups , prompting concerns among ministers about privacy and civil liberties .
such web sites " have nothing to do with freedom of expression , " retaliated frattini , who said he was also considering proposing broader legal definition of conspiracy that would include people who support terrorist acts .
public concerns that european legislators might curb people 's individual freedoms in their attempts to prevent terrorism attacks on their territory were apparent at the press conference after monday 's meeting .
" if your question is whether a sort-of ' big brother ' is arising in europe and calling fundamental rights into question , then the answer is ' no , " ' said rui pereira , portugal 's interior minister , in response to a question , according to news agency dpa .
" but no member state , and the eu as a whole , can avoid fighting terrorism , " he added .
extending the schengen agreement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu justice and home affairs comissioner frattini also discussed was an extension to the eu 's borderless travel zone - as far east as the frontiers with ukraine and belarus - a week before christmas , two weeks ahead of schedule .
according to portuguese home affairs minister rui perreira , nine new member states are poised to join the schengen travel zone , abolishing all land and sea checks along their common borders , although checks at airports will continue until march .
" all of the tests that we have carried out confirm that by the end of the year we will be able to remove the frontiers , " said perreira .
the border-free " schengen " area now includes 13 eu countries , plus norway and iceland .
the latest countries involved are the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia .
cyprus , the 10th nation to join the eu in 2004 , has opted to keep some border checks for a further year .
" i think this will serve as a real incentive for citizens of the new member states to feel that they are full european citizens , " perreira said .
eu justice ministers will decide on giving the final go-ahead to the expansion of schengen during their meeting on nov .

2 , he surprised many with statements that sounded positively left-leaning for a member of the conservative christian democratic party . last year , when köhler chose to concentrate on domestic education issues , his speech caused barely a ripple .
this time round , he cast his net wider and took the opportunity to warn of the dangers of globalization , the " growing rift " between germany 's haves and the have-nots , and the need for greater regulation of international financial markets .
although köhler was generally viewed as a neo-liberal when he assumed office in 2004 , many saw monday 's talk as further proof of a perceived swing to the left .
ten years after then president roman herzog gave the very first berlin address and famously told the country that it needed to " jolt itself into action , " horst köhler echoed his predecessor 's plea for greater german openness and focused heavily on the issue of globalization and its consequences .
the risks of globalization " does globalization ultimately endanger our entire social model ? " he asked .
" the pressure of global competition is putting much to the test . … a large part of humanity continues to live in deepest poverty .
this has two main causes : not being able to share sufficiently in globalization - mainly because of a lack of economic power and good governance - and being disadvantaged by states and private players who pursue their own interests with no regard for others .
" those who live at the expense of others will at some stage be left standing alone , " he admonished .
but in keeping with the traditionally optimistic spirit of the presidential speeches , his message was broadly upbeat .
" globalization is simply life , " he said .
" it has to be shaped through day-to-day work and imagination , through untiring efforts and cheerful enthusiasm .
it can change the world for the better . "
a social conscience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs to look after the weaker members of society köhler pulled more of a punch when it came to germany , raising many points underlying the social democrats ' new party agenda .
referring to many people 's fear of social destitution , he said germany needed to take better care of its workforce .
" germany is not an effective and future-oriented state based on social justice at present , " he said , pointing out that the country was witnessing a creeping divide between the rich and the poor .
" the inequality in the distribution of income in germany has increased . … job security has diminished and people 's working lives are subject to change and flux . ...
although germany 's broad middle class continues to do quite well , there is an increasing fear of social decline and many people from low-income and less well-educated backgrounds can not advance without assistance , " he said .
continuing the social theme , he reiterated the thrust of last year 's argument and said the country needed to improve school performance .
" germany 's education system is not performing as well as those of some other western industrialized states , " he argued .
in a further echo of social democratic values , he went on to call for greater regulation of global financial markets and proposed the international monetary fund europe increase the involvement of emerging economies and developing countries in its decision-making .
it was time , he said , that europe played a greater role on the international stage .

while the flags do represent a show of national unity , it is a statement of allegiance not to a team but to the country itself .
the message in brussels is clear : " we are belgium ; we are one . "
the people of brussels are united behind the flag as the political crisis in belgium continues .
it is now 112 days since elections triggered a deadlock over more self-rule for belgium 's rival linguistic camps and set the dutch and french-speaking sides against each other in a complex row that doomsayers say could tear the country in two .
the belgian political system has been in paralysis since the june 10 election when the country 's christian democrats and liberals won a legislative majority to form a coalition government .
however , both sides then split into dutch and french-speaking parties with the dutch-speaking christian democrats and liberals demanding more autonomy for the northern flanders region .
the francophone politicians accuse the flemish of trying to split the country by demanding increasing independence for flanders , saying that the unity and structure of the state is at risk if the north gets more autonomy .
a bigger say for flanders in areas such as the economy and employment would effectively give the region the power of a small state , they argue , and would have a detrimental effect on the rest of the country .
prosperous flanders wants more autonomy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : split down the middle there has been tension between francophone , wallonia in the south and flanders in the north ever since belgium won its independence in 1830 . but the main problem with modern belgium as far as the flemings are concerned is that their more prosperous region has to continually prop up wallonia , a region which is poorer and has higher unemployment .
the flemings want wallonia to become more accountable and to keep more money in their wealthy dutch-speaking region .
this feeling of disparity has fuelled resurgence in flemish nationalism and , in turn , the rising success of flemish separatist parties . the stand-off has led to almost four months of stalemate over the formation of the government .
while belgian king albert ii has appointing a series of politicians with the unenviable job of hammering out a compromise and forming a coalition , each has so far failed .
" the problem is that we are still stuck in an electoral situation where any movement by one side or the other towards an agreement is seen as a sign of weakness , " johan buelens , a professor of political science at the free university of brussels , told dw-world.de.
" it 's like a game of political chicken .
who will blink first ? "
bildunterschrift : officially bilingual brussels aligns itself with wallonia brussels , wallonia see no reason for split the political split along linguistic lines has generated discussions in many quarters over a possible geographical separation of the nation .
while the general impression outside belgium is of a country on the verge of collapse , the people , at least those in the capital , are far more relaxed .
" this talk of separation comes only from the politicians , " said anne wilmots , a physiotherapist in the predominantly flemish quarter of woluwe sint pieters in brussels .
" the people , at least in brussels and wallonia , do n't want a split and do n't believe there will be one .
it is a tactic , an empty threat in a game of politics .
no one really believes this will happen . "
the opinion of many of those living in the largely francophone but officially bilingual municipality of brussels is much the same as that of the majority of french-speakers in wallonia , including the region 's largest political party .
" this is not a new discussion , " a senior politician with humanist democratic centre -lrb- cdh -rrb- , a christian democratic party , told dw-world.de under the condition of anonymity .
" we have been talking along linguistic lines for over 50 years and the country is still together .
the regions are compatible , whatever people may say .
the cdh supports a unified belgium and will continue to do so .
we do n't foresee any changes in our ideology or the structure of our nation . "
flemish nationalism fuelling independence debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flemish nationalist parties have made gains in flanders however , the view from the north is quite different .
a recent poll in the flemish-language daily het laatste nieuws showed that 46.1 percent of flemings polled wanted belgium to split , compared to 49.6 percent who said they did n't .
" many flemings believe that a split would make them richer , " said buelens .
" every two months vlaams belang -lsb- a flemish nationalist party -rsb- sends out flyers saying that flemings pay enough towards wallonia to buy a walloon family a 15,000-euro car -lrb- $ 21,000 -rrb- every two years .
those who believe that believe that this money would go to them if the country was divided .
it is not as simple as that .
" it is like a child in a quarreling family , " he continued .
" if the parents row all the time , maybe the child thinks it would be better for them to divorce .
but it thinks this without any real knowledge of the consequences .
the child just thinks things would be better than the quarreling .
this is how it is in belgium . "
while the opinions of the people show just how complicated and diverse life in belgium can be , the final decision to split the country - should it come to that - will be made by the politicians .
but just how likely and how possible would it be to dissolve belgium ?
practical problems , lack of will make divorce unlikely " for a start it is really only a small part of the flemish political elite which favors a split , " said buelens .
" but the flemish have a larger federal presence , with about 60 percent of the population .
even so , there would have to be agreement on both sides of the divide to separate the country and we 've seen how hard it is to gain a consensus here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium is rife with political and linguistic divisions buelens believes that there are too many issues involved in breaking up the country to make it a viable option , from the payment of the national debt to the future of brussels .
but , he concluded , it was worth debating the idea as it could lead to the resolution of other long-standing problems in belgium .
" it 's good that the politicians are talking about this , " he said .
" this debate could lead to a reform of the regional structure which would make things fairer for everyone ; how power can be shared and distributed , how wealth and employment can be spread around the whole country . "
" it is better that they resolve their differences over 100 , 200 or even 300 days rather than take up arms against each other and decide it that way . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this talk of separation comes only from the politicians , " said anne wilmots , a physiotherapist in the predominantly flemish quarter of woluwe sint pieters in brussels .
" the people , at least in brussels and wallonia , do n't want a split and do n't believe there will be one .
it is a tactic , an empty threat in a game of politics .
no one really believes this will happen . "
the opinion of many of those living in the largely francophone but officially bilingual municipality of brussels is much the same as that of the majority of french-speakers in wallonia , including the region 's largest political party .
" this is not a new discussion , " a senior politician with humanist democratic centre -lrb- cdh -rrb- , a christian democratic party , told dw-world.de under the condition of anonymity .
" we have been talking along linguistic lines for over 50 years and the country is still together .
the regions are compatible , whatever people may say .
the cdh supports a unified belgium and will continue to do so .
we do n't foresee any changes in our ideology or the structure of our nation . "

a recent poll in the flemish-language daily het laatste nieuws showed that 46.1 percent of flemings polled wanted belgium to split , compared to 49.6 percent who said they did n't .
" many flemings believe that a split would make them richer , " said buelens .
" every two months vlaams belang -lsb- a flemish nationalist party -rsb- sends out flyers saying that flemings pay enough towards wallonia to buy a walloon family a 15,000-euro car -lrb- $ 21,000 -rrb- every two years .
those who believe that believe that this money would go to them if the country was divided .
it is not as simple as that .
" it is like a child in a quarreling family , " he continued .
" if the parents row all the time , maybe the child thinks it would be better for them to divorce .
but it thinks this without any real knowledge of the consequences .
the child just thinks things would be better than the quarreling .
this is how it is in belgium . "
while the opinions of the people show just how complicated and diverse life in belgium can be , the final decision to split the country - should it come to that - will be made by the politicians .
but just how likely and how possible would it be to dissolve belgium ?
practical problems , lack of will make divorce unlikely " for a start it is really only a small part of the flemish political elite which favors a split , " said buelens .
" but the flemish have a larger federal presence , with about 60 percent of the population .

while the flags do represent a show of national unity , it is a statement of allegiance not to a team but to the country itself .
the message in brussels is clear : " we are belgium ; we are one . "
the people of brussels are united behind the flag as the political crisis in belgium continues .
it is now 112 days since elections triggered a deadlock over more self-rule for belgium 's rival linguistic camps and set the dutch and french-speaking sides against each other in a complex row that doomsayers say could tear the country in two .
the belgian political system has been in paralysis since the june 10 election when the country 's christian democrats and liberals won a legislative majority to form a coalition government .
however , both sides then split into dutch and french-speaking parties with the dutch-speaking christian democrats and liberals demanding more autonomy for the northern flanders region .
the francophone politicians accuse the flemish of trying to split the country by demanding increasing independence for flanders , saying that the unity and structure of the state is at risk if the north gets more autonomy .
a bigger say for flanders in areas such as the economy and employment would effectively give the region the power of a small state , they argue , and would have a detrimental effect on the rest of the country .
prosperous flanders wants more autonomy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : split down the middle there has been tension between francophone , wallonia in the south and flanders in the north ever since belgium won its independence in 1830 . but the main problem with modern belgium as far as the flemings are concerned is that their more prosperous region has to continually prop up wallonia , a region which is poorer and has higher unemployment .
the flemings want wallonia to become more accountable and to keep more money in their wealthy dutch-speaking region .
this feeling of disparity has fuelled resurgence in flemish nationalism and , in turn , the rising success of flemish separatist parties . the stand-off has led to almost four months of stalemate over the formation of the government .
while belgian king albert ii has appointing a series of politicians with the unenviable job of hammering out a compromise and forming a coalition , each has so far failed .
" the problem is that we are still stuck in an electoral situation where any movement by one side or the other towards an agreement is seen as a sign of weakness , " johan buelens , a professor of political science at the free university of brussels , told dw-world.de.
" it 's like a game of political chicken .

while the flags do represent a show of national unity , it is a statement of allegiance not to a team but to the country itself .
the message in brussels is clear : " we are belgium ; we are one . "
the people of brussels are united behind the flag as the political crisis in belgium continues .
it is now 112 days since elections triggered a deadlock over more self-rule for belgium 's rival linguistic camps and set the dutch and french-speaking sides against each other in a complex row that doomsayers say could tear the country in two .
the belgian political system has been in paralysis since the june 10 election when the country 's christian democrats and liberals won a legislative majority to form a coalition government .
however , both sides then split into dutch and french-speaking parties with the dutch-speaking christian democrats and liberals demanding more autonomy for the northern flanders region .
the francophone politicians accuse the flemish of trying to split the country by demanding increasing independence for flanders , saying that the unity and structure of the state is at risk if the north gets more autonomy .
a bigger say for flanders in areas such as the economy and employment would effectively give the region the power of a small state , they argue , and would have a detrimental effect on the rest of the country .
prosperous flanders wants more autonomy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : split down the middle there has been tension between francophone , wallonia in the south and flanders in the north ever since belgium won its independence in 1830 . but the main problem with modern belgium as far as the flemings are concerned is that their more prosperous region has to continually prop up wallonia , a region which is poorer and has higher unemployment .
the flemings want wallonia to become more accountable and to keep more money in their wealthy dutch-speaking region .
this feeling of disparity has fuelled resurgence in flemish nationalism and , in turn , the rising success of flemish separatist parties . the stand-off has led to almost four months of stalemate over the formation of the government .
while belgian king albert ii has appointing a series of politicians with the unenviable job of hammering out a compromise and forming a coalition , each has so far failed .
" the problem is that we are still stuck in an electoral situation where any movement by one side or the other towards an agreement is seen as a sign of weakness , " johan buelens , a professor of political science at the free university of brussels , told dw-world.de.
" it 's like a game of political chicken .
who will blink first ? "
bildunterschrift : officially bilingual brussels aligns itself with wallonia brussels , wallonia see no reason for split the political split along linguistic lines has generated discussions in many quarters over a possible geographical separation of the nation .
while the general impression outside belgium is of a country on the verge of collapse , the people , at least those in the capital , are far more relaxed .
" this talk of separation comes only from the politicians , " said anne wilmots , a physiotherapist in the predominantly flemish quarter of woluwe sint pieters in brussels .
" the people , at least in brussels and wallonia , do n't want a split and do n't believe there will be one .
it is a tactic , an empty threat in a game of politics .
no one really believes this will happen . "
the opinion of many of those living in the largely francophone but officially bilingual municipality of brussels is much the same as that of the majority of french-speakers in wallonia , including the region 's largest political party .
" this is not a new discussion , " a senior politician with humanist democratic centre -lrb- cdh -rrb- , a christian democratic party , told dw-world.de under the condition of anonymity .
" we have been talking along linguistic lines for over 50 years and the country is still together .
the regions are compatible , whatever people may say .
the cdh supports a unified belgium and will continue to do so .
we do n't foresee any changes in our ideology or the structure of our nation . "

eu justice and home affairs commissioner franco frattini called for a register of all non-eu citizens entering and leaving the 27-nation bloc , who would be electronically registered with biometric identifiers .
the register is " extremely necessary " in order to crack down on people who are granted permission to stay for a restricted time but disappear when the period expires , frattini explained , pointing to recent scares in germany , britain and denmark .
under his proposals , which will be published in november , law-enforcement officials in all member states would be allowed to share collected data with colleagues across the eu .
the scheme would operate alongside an airline passenger data recording system apparently modeled on one developed by the us .
officials said they were still debating whether to adopt the system for flights within eu as well as those to and from countries outside the union .
technological crackdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should radical web sites be blocked ?
much of the discussion was geared to finding ways of countering the use of the internet by militants , with participants debating issues such as censorship and freedom of expression .
frattini proposed a technological crackdown on terrorist activities , including a plan to set up a database to provide an early-warning system on lost or stolen explosives , and new provisions to deal with the misuse of the internet by terrorists .
frattini urged sanctions against web sites that disseminate terror propaganda or bomb-building instructions or engage in recruitment for terrorist groups , prompting concerns among ministers about privacy and civil liberties .
such web sites " have nothing to do with freedom of expression , " retaliated frattini , who said he was also considering proposing broader legal definition of conspiracy that would include people who support terrorist acts .
public concerns that european legislators might curb people 's individual freedoms in their attempts to prevent terrorism attacks on their territory were apparent at the press conference after monday 's meeting .
" if your question is whether a sort-of ' big brother ' is arising in europe and calling fundamental rights into question , then the answer is ' no , " ' said rui pereira , portugal 's interior minister , in response to a question , according to news agency dpa .
" but no member state , and the eu as a whole , can avoid fighting terrorism , " he added .

according to portuguese home affairs minister rui perreira , nine new member states are poised to join the schengen travel zone , abolishing all land and sea checks along their common borders , although checks at airports will continue until march .
" all of the tests that we have carried out confirm that by the end of the year we will be able to remove the frontiers , " said perreira .
the border-free " schengen " area now includes 13 eu countries , plus norway and iceland .
the latest countries involved are the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia .
cyprus , the 10th nation to join the eu in 2004 , has opted to keep some border checks for a further year .

frattini proposed a technological crackdown on terrorist activities , including a plan to set up a database to provide an early-warning system on lost or stolen explosives , and new provisions to deal with the misuse of the internet by terrorists .
frattini urged sanctions against web sites that disseminate terror propaganda or bomb-building instructions or engage in recruitment for terrorist groups , prompting concerns among ministers about privacy and civil liberties .
such web sites " have nothing to do with freedom of expression , " retaliated frattini , who said he was also considering proposing broader legal definition of conspiracy that would include people who support terrorist acts .
public concerns that european legislators might curb people 's individual freedoms in their attempts to prevent terrorism attacks on their territory were apparent at the press conference after monday 's meeting .
" if your question is whether a sort-of ' big brother ' is arising in europe and calling fundamental rights into question , then the answer is ' no , " ' said rui pereira , portugal 's interior minister , in response to a question , according to news agency dpa .
" but no member state , and the eu as a whole , can avoid fighting terrorism , " he added .
extending the schengen agreement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu justice and home affairs comissioner frattini also discussed was an extension to the eu 's borderless travel zone - as far east as the frontiers with ukraine and belarus - a week before christmas , two weeks ahead of schedule .
according to portuguese home affairs minister rui perreira , nine new member states are poised to join the schengen travel zone , abolishing all land and sea checks along their common borders , although checks at airports will continue until march .
" all of the tests that we have carried out confirm that by the end of the year we will be able to remove the frontiers , " said perreira .
the border-free " schengen " area now includes 13 eu countries , plus norway and iceland .
the latest countries involved are the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia .
cyprus , the 10th nation to join the eu in 2004 , has opted to keep some border checks for a further year .
" i think this will serve as a real incentive for citizens of the new member states to feel that they are full european citizens , " perreira said .
eu justice ministers will decide on giving the final go-ahead to the expansion of schengen during their meeting on nov .

the register is " extremely necessary " in order to crack down on people who are granted permission to stay for a restricted time but disappear when the period expires , frattini explained , pointing to recent scares in germany , britain and denmark .
under his proposals , which will be published in november , law-enforcement officials in all member states would be allowed to share collected data with colleagues across the eu .
the scheme would operate alongside an airline passenger data recording system apparently modeled on one developed by the us .
officials said they were still debating whether to adopt the system for flights within eu as well as those to and from countries outside the union .
technological crackdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should radical web sites be blocked ?
much of the discussion was geared to finding ways of countering the use of the internet by militants , with participants debating issues such as censorship and freedom of expression .
frattini proposed a technological crackdown on terrorist activities , including a plan to set up a database to provide an early-warning system on lost or stolen explosives , and new provisions to deal with the misuse of the internet by terrorists .
frattini urged sanctions against web sites that disseminate terror propaganda or bomb-building instructions or engage in recruitment for terrorist groups , prompting concerns among ministers about privacy and civil liberties .
such web sites " have nothing to do with freedom of expression , " retaliated frattini , who said he was also considering proposing broader legal definition of conspiracy that would include people who support terrorist acts .
public concerns that european legislators might curb people 's individual freedoms in their attempts to prevent terrorism attacks on their territory were apparent at the press conference after monday 's meeting .
" if your question is whether a sort-of ' big brother ' is arising in europe and calling fundamental rights into question , then the answer is ' no , " ' said rui pereira , portugal 's interior minister , in response to a question , according to news agency dpa .
" but no member state , and the eu as a whole , can avoid fighting terrorism , " he added .

according to portuguese home affairs minister rui perreira , nine new member states are poised to join the schengen travel zone , abolishing all land and sea checks along their common borders , although checks at airports will continue until march .
" all of the tests that we have carried out confirm that by the end of the year we will be able to remove the frontiers , " said perreira .
the border-free " schengen " area now includes 13 eu countries , plus norway and iceland .
the latest countries involved are the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia .
cyprus , the 10th nation to join the eu in 2004 , has opted to keep some border checks for a further year .
" i think this will serve as a real incentive for citizens of the new member states to feel that they are full european citizens , " perreira said .
eu justice ministers will decide on giving the final go-ahead to the expansion of schengen during their meeting on nov .

while the flags do represent a show of national unity , it is a statement of allegiance not to a team but to the country itself .
the message in brussels is clear : " we are belgium ; we are one . "
the people of brussels are united behind the flag as the political crisis in belgium continues .
it is now 112 days since elections triggered a deadlock over more self-rule for belgium 's rival linguistic camps and set the dutch and french-speaking sides against each other in a complex row that doomsayers say could tear the country in two .
the belgian political system has been in paralysis since the june 10 election when the country 's christian democrats and liberals won a legislative majority to form a coalition government .
however , both sides then split into dutch and french-speaking parties with the dutch-speaking christian democrats and liberals demanding more autonomy for the northern flanders region .
the francophone politicians accuse the flemish of trying to split the country by demanding increasing independence for flanders , saying that the unity and structure of the state is at risk if the north gets more autonomy .
a bigger say for flanders in areas such as the economy and employment would effectively give the region the power of a small state , they argue , and would have a detrimental effect on the rest of the country .
prosperous flanders wants more autonomy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : split down the middle there has been tension between francophone , wallonia in the south and flanders in the north ever since belgium won its independence in 1830 . but the main problem with modern belgium as far as the flemings are concerned is that their more prosperous region has to continually prop up wallonia , a region which is poorer and has higher unemployment .
the flemings want wallonia to become more accountable and to keep more money in their wealthy dutch-speaking region .
this feeling of disparity has fuelled resurgence in flemish nationalism and , in turn , the rising success of flemish separatist parties . the stand-off has led to almost four months of stalemate over the formation of the government .
while belgian king albert ii has appointing a series of politicians with the unenviable job of hammering out a compromise and forming a coalition , each has so far failed .
" the problem is that we are still stuck in an electoral situation where any movement by one side or the other towards an agreement is seen as a sign of weakness , " johan buelens , a professor of political science at the free university of brussels , told dw-world.de.
" it 's like a game of political chicken .
who will blink first ? "
bildunterschrift : officially bilingual brussels aligns itself with wallonia brussels , wallonia see no reason for split the political split along linguistic lines has generated discussions in many quarters over a possible geographical separation of the nation .
while the general impression outside belgium is of a country on the verge of collapse , the people , at least those in the capital , are far more relaxed .
" this talk of separation comes only from the politicians , " said anne wilmots , a physiotherapist in the predominantly flemish quarter of woluwe sint pieters in brussels .
" the people , at least in brussels and wallonia , do n't want a split and do n't believe there will be one .
it is a tactic , an empty threat in a game of politics .
no one really believes this will happen . "
the opinion of many of those living in the largely francophone but officially bilingual municipality of brussels is much the same as that of the majority of french-speakers in wallonia , including the region 's largest political party .
" this is not a new discussion , " a senior politician with humanist democratic centre -lrb- cdh -rrb- , a christian democratic party , told dw-world.de under the condition of anonymity .
" we have been talking along linguistic lines for over 50 years and the country is still together .
the regions are compatible , whatever people may say .
the cdh supports a unified belgium and will continue to do so .
we do n't foresee any changes in our ideology or the structure of our nation . "
flemish nationalism fuelling independence debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flemish nationalist parties have made gains in flanders however , the view from the north is quite different .
a recent poll in the flemish-language daily het laatste nieuws showed that 46.1 percent of flemings polled wanted belgium to split , compared to 49.6 percent who said they did n't .
" many flemings believe that a split would make them richer , " said buelens .
" every two months vlaams belang -lsb- a flemish nationalist party -rsb- sends out flyers saying that flemings pay enough towards wallonia to buy a walloon family a 15,000-euro car -lrb- $ 21,000 -rrb- every two years .
those who believe that believe that this money would go to them if the country was divided .
it is not as simple as that .
" it is like a child in a quarreling family , " he continued .
" if the parents row all the time , maybe the child thinks it would be better for them to divorce .
but it thinks this without any real knowledge of the consequences .
the child just thinks things would be better than the quarreling .
this is how it is in belgium . "
while the opinions of the people show just how complicated and diverse life in belgium can be , the final decision to split the country - should it come to that - will be made by the politicians .
but just how likely and how possible would it be to dissolve belgium ?
practical problems , lack of will make divorce unlikely " for a start it is really only a small part of the flemish political elite which favors a split , " said buelens .
" but the flemish have a larger federal presence , with about 60 percent of the population .
even so , there would have to be agreement on both sides of the divide to separate the country and we 've seen how hard it is to gain a consensus here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium is rife with political and linguistic divisions buelens believes that there are too many issues involved in breaking up the country to make it a viable option , from the payment of the national debt to the future of brussels .
but , he concluded , it was worth debating the idea as it could lead to the resolution of other long-standing problems in belgium .
" it 's good that the politicians are talking about this , " he said .
" this debate could lead to a reform of the regional structure which would make things fairer for everyone ; how power can be shared and distributed , how wealth and employment can be spread around the whole country . "

2 , he surprised many with statements that sounded positively left-leaning for a member of the conservative christian democratic party . last year , when köhler chose to concentrate on domestic education issues , his speech caused barely a ripple .
this time round , he cast his net wider and took the opportunity to warn of the dangers of globalization , the " growing rift " between germany 's haves and the have-nots , and the need for greater regulation of international financial markets .
although köhler was generally viewed as a neo-liberal when he assumed office in 2004 , many saw monday 's talk as further proof of a perceived swing to the left .
ten years after then president roman herzog gave the very first berlin address and famously told the country that it needed to " jolt itself into action , " horst köhler echoed his predecessor 's plea for greater german openness and focused heavily on the issue of globalization and its consequences .
the risks of globalization " does globalization ultimately endanger our entire social model ? " he asked .
" the pressure of global competition is putting much to the test . … a large part of humanity continues to live in deepest poverty .
this has two main causes : not being able to share sufficiently in globalization - mainly because of a lack of economic power and good governance - and being disadvantaged by states and private players who pursue their own interests with no regard for others .
" those who live at the expense of others will at some stage be left standing alone , " he admonished .
but in keeping with the traditionally optimistic spirit of the presidential speeches , his message was broadly upbeat .
" globalization is simply life , " he said .
" it has to be shaped through day-to-day work and imagination , through untiring efforts and cheerful enthusiasm .
it can change the world for the better . "
a social conscience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs to look after the weaker members of society köhler pulled more of a punch when it came to germany , raising many points underlying the social democrats ' new party agenda .
referring to many people 's fear of social destitution , he said germany needed to take better care of its workforce .
" germany is not an effective and future-oriented state based on social justice at present , " he said , pointing out that the country was witnessing a creeping divide between the rich and the poor .
" the inequality in the distribution of income in germany has increased . … job security has diminished and people 's working lives are subject to change and flux . ...
although germany 's broad middle class continues to do quite well , there is an increasing fear of social decline and many people from low-income and less well-educated backgrounds can not advance without assistance , " he said .
continuing the social theme , he reiterated the thrust of last year 's argument and said the country needed to improve school performance .
" germany 's education system is not performing as well as those of some other western industrialized states , " he argued .
in a further echo of social democratic values , he went on to call for greater regulation of global financial markets and proposed the international monetary fund europe increase the involvement of emerging economies and developing countries in its decision-making .

her visit is to focus on a range of issues , including human rights , aids , economic cooperation and the political crisis in zimbabwe . deutsche welle spoke about merkel 's agenda on the africa tour with dominic johnson , an editor at germany 's taz newspaper and an expert on africa . deutsche welle : why did german chancellor angela merkel choose to go to ethiopia , south africa and liberia ? dominic johnson : south africa is the most obvious choice - it is the most important trading partner for germany in africa .
president thabo mbeki , the south african president , attended the g8 summit in heiligendamm in june .
south africa is going to host the soccer world cup in 2010 and there is a lot of cooperation between germany and south africa on that .
so , south africa is the natural place to go for a german chancellor . ethiopia is fairly obvious as well .
it is the head of the african union , the seat of the african union commission , where merkel will visit .
it has become an obligatory stop for every german politician who goes to africa .
german president horst köhler was there recently , and cooperation is quite close . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel liberia is maybe less obvious .
it is a small country in west africa , not particularly important , but it is the only african country headed by a woman -lsb- president ellen johnson sirleaf -rsb- and chancellor merkel is the only female head of government in europe , so in a way , when the most powerful woman in europe goes to meet the most powerful woman in africa .
it 's a highly symbolic moment . there 's a large german business delegation that will be accompanying merkel , but surely business issues will not be the only ones on the agenda ? they wo n't be the only ones , but i think they 'll be quite important , even though they are n't being flagged at the moment .
it 's already been announced that , following this africa trip , the german government will try to call an african economic summit to try to encourage german businesses , especially small businesses , to invest in africa , and we know that south africa and liberia are looking for more investments for reconstruction . what are some of the other issues that will be discussed ? one of them will be development aid .
the chancellor has said she will visit development projects in all three countries .
she mentioned her upcoming africa visit during her speech at the un global fund to fight aids conference in berlin last week and she made it clear that this is important to her as well .
so , there will be a lot of the traditional development issues , but there will also be a lot of business items on the agenda during talks .
and , of course , germany is still the president of the g8 , so it still has a political role to play and will be looking at liberia 's foreign debt and cooperation with the african union as a whole . interview : dagmar breitenbach -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

2 , he surprised many with statements that sounded positively left-leaning for a member of the conservative christian democratic party . last year , when köhler chose to concentrate on domestic education issues , his speech caused barely a ripple .
this time round , he cast his net wider and took the opportunity to warn of the dangers of globalization , the " growing rift " between germany 's haves and the have-nots , and the need for greater regulation of international financial markets .
although köhler was generally viewed as a neo-liberal when he assumed office in 2004 , many saw monday 's talk as further proof of a perceived swing to the left .
ten years after then president roman herzog gave the very first berlin address and famously told the country that it needed to " jolt itself into action , " horst köhler echoed his predecessor 's plea for greater german openness and focused heavily on the issue of globalization and its consequences .
the risks of globalization " does globalization ultimately endanger our entire social model ? " he asked .
" the pressure of global competition is putting much to the test . … a large part of humanity continues to live in deepest poverty .
this has two main causes : not being able to share sufficiently in globalization - mainly because of a lack of economic power and good governance - and being disadvantaged by states and private players who pursue their own interests with no regard for others .
" those who live at the expense of others will at some stage be left standing alone , " he admonished .
but in keeping with the traditionally optimistic spirit of the presidential speeches , his message was broadly upbeat .
" globalization is simply life , " he said .
" it has to be shaped through day-to-day work and imagination , through untiring efforts and cheerful enthusiasm .
it can change the world for the better . "
a social conscience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs to look after the weaker members of society köhler pulled more of a punch when it came to germany , raising many points underlying the social democrats ' new party agenda .
referring to many people 's fear of social destitution , he said germany needed to take better care of its workforce .
" germany is not an effective and future-oriented state based on social justice at present , " he said , pointing out that the country was witnessing a creeping divide between the rich and the poor .
" the inequality in the distribution of income in germany has increased . … job security has diminished and people 's working lives are subject to change and flux . ...
although germany 's broad middle class continues to do quite well , there is an increasing fear of social decline and many people from low-income and less well-educated backgrounds can not advance without assistance , " he said .
continuing the social theme , he reiterated the thrust of last year 's argument and said the country needed to improve school performance .
" germany 's education system is not performing as well as those of some other western industrialized states , " he argued .
in a further echo of social democratic values , he went on to call for greater regulation of global financial markets and proposed the international monetary fund europe increase the involvement of emerging economies and developing countries in its decision-making .
it was time , he said , that europe played a greater role on the international stage .
" i believe that the world expects more of us europeans than we are currently offering , " he said .
" the world would be poorer without the european perspective on things .
and it is therefore our duty to share this perspective with others . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

2 , in a decision that could spell the beginning of the end of the high-technology venture touted as a rival to the us military 's global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- . galileo , which was supposed to be a showcase for europe 's technical prowess and be in place by 2008 , has stalled as cost overruns pile up , private contractors bicker and member states push their own industrial interests . after funding from a private , international consortium of eight companies involved in creating the satellite navigation system fell through , the eu said it would pump some 2.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- into the european space project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrot has found few supporters for his funding model " i am still convinced that europe needs galileo , " eu transport commissioner jacques barrot said on sept .
19 when he announced a funding plan to save the project .
" galileo is very important for the strategic autonomy of europe . " barrot has suggested the bailout money come from the billions worth of unspent agricultural funds that are returned to national coffers each year . germany to bear brunt of costs barrot 's proposal was initially given a tepid welcome by france , belgium , italy , luxembourg and spain .
germany , the eu 's largest net contributor , is openly opposed to the plan . " we can not support the suggestions proposed by the eu commission , " german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee said monday in an interview with die welt newspaper .
" germany will carry the main financial load .
that 's why the appropriate participation of german companies in galileo 's construction is a matter of course . " tiefensee has received the support of his colleagues in the economic ministry , which is against tapping the bloc 's agriculture budget for other projects . " on its own , the suggestion is coherent , but if you look at the political framework , it becomes very difficult to implement , " deputy economics minister joachim wuermeling said friday . time to decide ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with all the satellites circling the earth , some wonder if the eu needs its own a breakthrough on tuesday is not expected as both britain and the netherlands have also expressed their dissatisfaction with the eu juggling funds away from their intended purposes to pay for the satellite project . barrot has said if eu leaders could n't reach an agreement by the end of the year , the 27-member bloc would be forced to decide if it was prepared to let the project crash before it ever lifts off . while europe has remained divided over galileo , russia and china have been working on similar satellite projects , and the united states is updating its gps , already used widely in cars , boats and planes . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

her visit is to focus on a range of issues , including human rights , aids , economic cooperation and the political crisis in zimbabwe . deutsche welle spoke about merkel 's agenda on the africa tour with dominic johnson , an editor at germany 's taz newspaper and an expert on africa . deutsche welle : why did german chancellor angela merkel choose to go to ethiopia , south africa and liberia ? dominic johnson : south africa is the most obvious choice - it is the most important trading partner for germany in africa .
president thabo mbeki , the south african president , attended the g8 summit in heiligendamm in june .
south africa is going to host the soccer world cup in 2010 and there is a lot of cooperation between germany and south africa on that .
so , south africa is the natural place to go for a german chancellor . ethiopia is fairly obvious as well .
it is the head of the african union , the seat of the african union commission , where merkel will visit .
it has become an obligatory stop for every german politician who goes to africa .
german president horst köhler was there recently , and cooperation is quite close . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel liberia is maybe less obvious .
it is a small country in west africa , not particularly important , but it is the only african country headed by a woman -lsb- president ellen johnson sirleaf -rsb- and chancellor merkel is the only female head of government in europe , so in a way , when the most powerful woman in europe goes to meet the most powerful woman in africa .
it 's a highly symbolic moment . there 's a large german business delegation that will be accompanying merkel , but surely business issues will not be the only ones on the agenda ? they wo n't be the only ones , but i think they 'll be quite important , even though they are n't being flagged at the moment .
it 's already been announced that , following this africa trip , the german government will try to call an african economic summit to try to encourage german businesses , especially small businesses , to invest in africa , and we know that south africa and liberia are looking for more investments for reconstruction . what are some of the other issues that will be discussed ? one of them will be development aid .
the chancellor has said she will visit development projects in all three countries .
she mentioned her upcoming africa visit during her speech at the un global fund to fight aids conference in berlin last week and she made it clear that this is important to her as well .
so , there will be a lot of the traditional development issues , but there will also be a lot of business items on the agenda during talks .
and , of course , germany is still the president of the g8 , so it still has a political role to play and will be looking at liberia 's foreign debt and cooperation with the african union as a whole . interview : dagmar breitenbach -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while the flags do represent a show of national unity , it is a statement of allegiance not to a team but to the country itself .
the message in brussels is clear : " we are belgium ; we are one . "
the people of brussels are united behind the flag as the political crisis in belgium continues .
it is now 112 days since elections triggered a deadlock over more self-rule for belgium 's rival linguistic camps and set the dutch and french-speaking sides against each other in a complex row that doomsayers say could tear the country in two .
the belgian political system has been in paralysis since the june 10 election when the country 's christian democrats and liberals won a legislative majority to form a coalition government .
however , both sides then split into dutch and french-speaking parties with the dutch-speaking christian democrats and liberals demanding more autonomy for the northern flanders region .
the francophone politicians accuse the flemish of trying to split the country by demanding increasing independence for flanders , saying that the unity and structure of the state is at risk if the north gets more autonomy .
a bigger say for flanders in areas such as the economy and employment would effectively give the region the power of a small state , they argue , and would have a detrimental effect on the rest of the country .
prosperous flanders wants more autonomy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : split down the middle there has been tension between francophone , wallonia in the south and flanders in the north ever since belgium won its independence in 1830 . but the main problem with modern belgium as far as the flemings are concerned is that their more prosperous region has to continually prop up wallonia , a region which is poorer and has higher unemployment .
the flemings want wallonia to become more accountable and to keep more money in their wealthy dutch-speaking region .
this feeling of disparity has fuelled resurgence in flemish nationalism and , in turn , the rising success of flemish separatist parties . the stand-off has led to almost four months of stalemate over the formation of the government .
while belgian king albert ii has appointing a series of politicians with the unenviable job of hammering out a compromise and forming a coalition , each has so far failed .
" the problem is that we are still stuck in an electoral situation where any movement by one side or the other towards an agreement is seen as a sign of weakness , " johan buelens , a professor of political science at the free university of brussels , told dw-world.de.
" it 's like a game of political chicken .
who will blink first ? "
bildunterschrift : officially bilingual brussels aligns itself with wallonia brussels , wallonia see no reason for split the political split along linguistic lines has generated discussions in many quarters over a possible geographical separation of the nation .
while the general impression outside belgium is of a country on the verge of collapse , the people , at least those in the capital , are far more relaxed .
" this talk of separation comes only from the politicians , " said anne wilmots , a physiotherapist in the predominantly flemish quarter of woluwe sint pieters in brussels .
" the people , at least in brussels and wallonia , do n't want a split and do n't believe there will be one .
it is a tactic , an empty threat in a game of politics .
no one really believes this will happen . "
the opinion of many of those living in the largely francophone but officially bilingual municipality of brussels is much the same as that of the majority of french-speakers in wallonia , including the region 's largest political party .
" this is not a new discussion , " a senior politician with humanist democratic centre -lrb- cdh -rrb- , a christian democratic party , told dw-world.de under the condition of anonymity .
" we have been talking along linguistic lines for over 50 years and the country is still together .
the regions are compatible , whatever people may say .
the cdh supports a unified belgium and will continue to do so .
we do n't foresee any changes in our ideology or the structure of our nation . "
flemish nationalism fuelling independence debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flemish nationalist parties have made gains in flanders however , the view from the north is quite different .
a recent poll in the flemish-language daily het laatste nieuws showed that 46.1 percent of flemings polled wanted belgium to split , compared to 49.6 percent who said they did n't .
" many flemings believe that a split would make them richer , " said buelens .
" every two months vlaams belang -lsb- a flemish nationalist party -rsb- sends out flyers saying that flemings pay enough towards wallonia to buy a walloon family a 15,000-euro car -lrb- $ 21,000 -rrb- every two years .
those who believe that believe that this money would go to them if the country was divided .
it is not as simple as that .
" it is like a child in a quarreling family , " he continued .
" if the parents row all the time , maybe the child thinks it would be better for them to divorce .
but it thinks this without any real knowledge of the consequences .
the child just thinks things would be better than the quarreling .
this is how it is in belgium . "
while the opinions of the people show just how complicated and diverse life in belgium can be , the final decision to split the country - should it come to that - will be made by the politicians .
but just how likely and how possible would it be to dissolve belgium ?
practical problems , lack of will make divorce unlikely " for a start it is really only a small part of the flemish political elite which favors a split , " said buelens .
" but the flemish have a larger federal presence , with about 60 percent of the population .
even so , there would have to be agreement on both sides of the divide to separate the country and we 've seen how hard it is to gain a consensus here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium is rife with political and linguistic divisions buelens believes that there are too many issues involved in breaking up the country to make it a viable option , from the payment of the national debt to the future of brussels .
but , he concluded , it was worth debating the idea as it could lead to the resolution of other long-standing problems in belgium .
" it 's good that the politicians are talking about this , " he said .
" this debate could lead to a reform of the regional structure which would make things fairer for everyone ; how power can be shared and distributed , how wealth and employment can be spread around the whole country . "
" it is better that they resolve their differences over 100 , 200 or even 300 days rather than take up arms against each other and decide it that way . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while the flags do represent a show of national unity , it is a statement of allegiance not to a team but to the country itself .
the message in brussels is clear : " we are belgium ; we are one . "
the people of brussels are united behind the flag as the political crisis in belgium continues .
it is now 112 days since elections triggered a deadlock over more self-rule for belgium 's rival linguistic camps and set the dutch and french-speaking sides against each other in a complex row that doomsayers say could tear the country in two .
the belgian political system has been in paralysis since the june 10 election when the country 's christian democrats and liberals won a legislative majority to form a coalition government .
however , both sides then split into dutch and french-speaking parties with the dutch-speaking christian democrats and liberals demanding more autonomy for the northern flanders region .
the francophone politicians accuse the flemish of trying to split the country by demanding increasing independence for flanders , saying that the unity and structure of the state is at risk if the north gets more autonomy .
a bigger say for flanders in areas such as the economy and employment would effectively give the region the power of a small state , they argue , and would have a detrimental effect on the rest of the country .
prosperous flanders wants more autonomy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : split down the middle there has been tension between francophone , wallonia in the south and flanders in the north ever since belgium won its independence in 1830 . but the main problem with modern belgium as far as the flemings are concerned is that their more prosperous region has to continually prop up wallonia , a region which is poorer and has higher unemployment .
the flemings want wallonia to become more accountable and to keep more money in their wealthy dutch-speaking region .
this feeling of disparity has fuelled resurgence in flemish nationalism and , in turn , the rising success of flemish separatist parties . the stand-off has led to almost four months of stalemate over the formation of the government .
while belgian king albert ii has appointing a series of politicians with the unenviable job of hammering out a compromise and forming a coalition , each has so far failed .
" the problem is that we are still stuck in an electoral situation where any movement by one side or the other towards an agreement is seen as a sign of weakness , " johan buelens , a professor of political science at the free university of brussels , told dw-world.de.
" it 's like a game of political chicken .
who will blink first ? "
bildunterschrift : officially bilingual brussels aligns itself with wallonia brussels , wallonia see no reason for split the political split along linguistic lines has generated discussions in many quarters over a possible geographical separation of the nation .
while the general impression outside belgium is of a country on the verge of collapse , the people , at least those in the capital , are far more relaxed .
" this talk of separation comes only from the politicians , " said anne wilmots , a physiotherapist in the predominantly flemish quarter of woluwe sint pieters in brussels .
" the people , at least in brussels and wallonia , do n't want a split and do n't believe there will be one .
it is a tactic , an empty threat in a game of politics .
no one really believes this will happen . "
the opinion of many of those living in the largely francophone but officially bilingual municipality of brussels is much the same as that of the majority of french-speakers in wallonia , including the region 's largest political party .
" this is not a new discussion , " a senior politician with humanist democratic centre -lrb- cdh -rrb- , a christian democratic party , told dw-world.de under the condition of anonymity .
" we have been talking along linguistic lines for over 50 years and the country is still together .
the regions are compatible , whatever people may say .
the cdh supports a unified belgium and will continue to do so .
we do n't foresee any changes in our ideology or the structure of our nation . "
flemish nationalism fuelling independence debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flemish nationalist parties have made gains in flanders however , the view from the north is quite different .
a recent poll in the flemish-language daily het laatste nieuws showed that 46.1 percent of flemings polled wanted belgium to split , compared to 49.6 percent who said they did n't .
" many flemings believe that a split would make them richer , " said buelens .
" every two months vlaams belang -lsb- a flemish nationalist party -rsb- sends out flyers saying that flemings pay enough towards wallonia to buy a walloon family a 15,000-euro car -lrb- $ 21,000 -rrb- every two years .
those who believe that believe that this money would go to them if the country was divided .
it is not as simple as that .
" it is like a child in a quarreling family , " he continued .
" if the parents row all the time , maybe the child thinks it would be better for them to divorce .
but it thinks this without any real knowledge of the consequences .
the child just thinks things would be better than the quarreling .
this is how it is in belgium . "
while the opinions of the people show just how complicated and diverse life in belgium can be , the final decision to split the country - should it come to that - will be made by the politicians .
but just how likely and how possible would it be to dissolve belgium ?
practical problems , lack of will make divorce unlikely " for a start it is really only a small part of the flemish political elite which favors a split , " said buelens .
" but the flemish have a larger federal presence , with about 60 percent of the population .
even so , there would have to be agreement on both sides of the divide to separate the country and we 've seen how hard it is to gain a consensus here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium is rife with political and linguistic divisions buelens believes that there are too many issues involved in breaking up the country to make it a viable option , from the payment of the national debt to the future of brussels .
but , he concluded , it was worth debating the idea as it could lead to the resolution of other long-standing problems in belgium .
" it 's good that the politicians are talking about this , " he said .
" this debate could lead to a reform of the regional structure which would make things fairer for everyone ; how power can be shared and distributed , how wealth and employment can be spread around the whole country . "
" it is better that they resolve their differences over 100 , 200 or even 300 days rather than take up arms against each other and decide it that way . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

2 , in a decision that could spell the beginning of the end of the high-technology venture touted as a rival to the us military 's global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- . galileo , which was supposed to be a showcase for europe 's technical prowess and be in place by 2008 , has stalled as cost overruns pile up , private contractors bicker and member states push their own industrial interests . after funding from a private , international consortium of eight companies involved in creating the satellite navigation system fell through , the eu said it would pump some 2.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- into the european space project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrot has found few supporters for his funding model " i am still convinced that europe needs galileo , " eu transport commissioner jacques barrot said on sept .
19 when he announced a funding plan to save the project .
" galileo is very important for the strategic autonomy of europe . " barrot has suggested the bailout money come from the billions worth of unspent agricultural funds that are returned to national coffers each year . germany to bear brunt of costs barrot 's proposal was initially given a tepid welcome by france , belgium , italy , luxembourg and spain .
germany , the eu 's largest net contributor , is openly opposed to the plan . " we can not support the suggestions proposed by the eu commission , " german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee said monday in an interview with die welt newspaper .
" germany will carry the main financial load .
that 's why the appropriate participation of german companies in galileo 's construction is a matter of course . " tiefensee has received the support of his colleagues in the economic ministry , which is against tapping the bloc 's agriculture budget for other projects . " on its own , the suggestion is coherent , but if you look at the political framework , it becomes very difficult to implement , " deputy economics minister joachim wuermeling said friday . time to decide ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with all the satellites circling the earth , some wonder if the eu needs its own a breakthrough on tuesday is not expected as both britain and the netherlands have also expressed their dissatisfaction with the eu juggling funds away from their intended purposes to pay for the satellite project . barrot has said if eu leaders could n't reach an agreement by the end of the year , the 27-member bloc would be forced to decide if it was prepared to let the project crash before it ever lifts off . while europe has remained divided over galileo , russia and china have been working on similar satellite projects , and the united states is updating its gps , already used widely in cars , boats and planes . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

2 , he surprised many with statements that sounded positively left-leaning for a member of the conservative christian democratic party . last year , when köhler chose to concentrate on domestic education issues , his speech caused barely a ripple .
this time round , he cast his net wider and took the opportunity to warn of the dangers of globalization , the " growing rift " between germany 's haves and the have-nots , and the need for greater regulation of international financial markets .
although köhler was generally viewed as a neo-liberal when he assumed office in 2004 , many saw monday 's talk as further proof of a perceived swing to the left .
ten years after then president roman herzog gave the very first berlin address and famously told the country that it needed to " jolt itself into action , " horst köhler echoed his predecessor 's plea for greater german openness and focused heavily on the issue of globalization and its consequences .
the risks of globalization " does globalization ultimately endanger our entire social model ? " he asked .
" the pressure of global competition is putting much to the test . … a large part of humanity continues to live in deepest poverty .
this has two main causes : not being able to share sufficiently in globalization - mainly because of a lack of economic power and good governance - and being disadvantaged by states and private players who pursue their own interests with no regard for others .
" those who live at the expense of others will at some stage be left standing alone , " he admonished .
but in keeping with the traditionally optimistic spirit of the presidential speeches , his message was broadly upbeat .
" globalization is simply life , " he said .
" it has to be shaped through day-to-day work and imagination , through untiring efforts and cheerful enthusiasm .
it can change the world for the better . "
a social conscience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs to look after the weaker members of society köhler pulled more of a punch when it came to germany , raising many points underlying the social democrats ' new party agenda .
referring to many people 's fear of social destitution , he said germany needed to take better care of its workforce .
" germany is not an effective and future-oriented state based on social justice at present , " he said , pointing out that the country was witnessing a creeping divide between the rich and the poor .
" the inequality in the distribution of income in germany has increased . … job security has diminished and people 's working lives are subject to change and flux . ...
although germany 's broad middle class continues to do quite well , there is an increasing fear of social decline and many people from low-income and less well-educated backgrounds can not advance without assistance , " he said .
continuing the social theme , he reiterated the thrust of last year 's argument and said the country needed to improve school performance .
" germany 's education system is not performing as well as those of some other western industrialized states , " he argued .
in a further echo of social democratic values , he went on to call for greater regulation of global financial markets and proposed the international monetary fund europe increase the involvement of emerging economies and developing countries in its decision-making .
it was time , he said , that europe played a greater role on the international stage .
" i believe that the world expects more of us europeans than we are currently offering , " he said .
" the world would be poorer without the european perspective on things .
and it is therefore our duty to share this perspective with others . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

her visit is to focus on a range of issues , including human rights , aids , economic cooperation and the political crisis in zimbabwe . deutsche welle spoke about merkel 's agenda on the africa tour with dominic johnson , an editor at germany 's taz newspaper and an expert on africa . deutsche welle : why did german chancellor angela merkel choose to go to ethiopia , south africa and liberia ? dominic johnson : south africa is the most obvious choice - it is the most important trading partner for germany in africa .
president thabo mbeki , the south african president , attended the g8 summit in heiligendamm in june .
south africa is going to host the soccer world cup in 2010 and there is a lot of cooperation between germany and south africa on that .
so , south africa is the natural place to go for a german chancellor . ethiopia is fairly obvious as well .
it is the head of the african union , the seat of the african union commission , where merkel will visit .

while the flags do represent a show of national unity , it is a statement of allegiance not to a team but to the country itself .
the message in brussels is clear : " we are belgium ; we are one . "
the people of brussels are united behind the flag as the political crisis in belgium continues .
it is now 112 days since elections triggered a deadlock over more self-rule for belgium 's rival linguistic camps and set the dutch and french-speaking sides against each other in a complex row that doomsayers say could tear the country in two .
the belgian political system has been in paralysis since the june 10 election when the country 's christian democrats and liberals won a legislative majority to form a coalition government .
however , both sides then split into dutch and french-speaking parties with the dutch-speaking christian democrats and liberals demanding more autonomy for the northern flanders region .
the francophone politicians accuse the flemish of trying to split the country by demanding increasing independence for flanders , saying that the unity and structure of the state is at risk if the north gets more autonomy .
a bigger say for flanders in areas such as the economy and employment would effectively give the region the power of a small state , they argue , and would have a detrimental effect on the rest of the country .
prosperous flanders wants more autonomy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : split down the middle there has been tension between francophone , wallonia in the south and flanders in the north ever since belgium won its independence in 1830 . but the main problem with modern belgium as far as the flemings are concerned is that their more prosperous region has to continually prop up wallonia , a region which is poorer and has higher unemployment .
the flemings want wallonia to become more accountable and to keep more money in their wealthy dutch-speaking region .
this feeling of disparity has fuelled resurgence in flemish nationalism and , in turn , the rising success of flemish separatist parties . the stand-off has led to almost four months of stalemate over the formation of the government .
while belgian king albert ii has appointing a series of politicians with the unenviable job of hammering out a compromise and forming a coalition , each has so far failed .
" the problem is that we are still stuck in an electoral situation where any movement by one side or the other towards an agreement is seen as a sign of weakness , " johan buelens , a professor of political science at the free university of brussels , told dw-world.de.
" it 's like a game of political chicken .
who will blink first ? "
bildunterschrift : officially bilingual brussels aligns itself with wallonia brussels , wallonia see no reason for split the political split along linguistic lines has generated discussions in many quarters over a possible geographical separation of the nation .
while the general impression outside belgium is of a country on the verge of collapse , the people , at least those in the capital , are far more relaxed .
" this talk of separation comes only from the politicians , " said anne wilmots , a physiotherapist in the predominantly flemish quarter of woluwe sint pieters in brussels .
" the people , at least in brussels and wallonia , do n't want a split and do n't believe there will be one .
it is a tactic , an empty threat in a game of politics .
no one really believes this will happen . "
the opinion of many of those living in the largely francophone but officially bilingual municipality of brussels is much the same as that of the majority of french-speakers in wallonia , including the region 's largest political party .
" this is not a new discussion , " a senior politician with humanist democratic centre -lrb- cdh -rrb- , a christian democratic party , told dw-world.de under the condition of anonymity .
" we have been talking along linguistic lines for over 50 years and the country is still together .
the regions are compatible , whatever people may say .
the cdh supports a unified belgium and will continue to do so .
we do n't foresee any changes in our ideology or the structure of our nation . "
flemish nationalism fuelling independence debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flemish nationalist parties have made gains in flanders however , the view from the north is quite different .
a recent poll in the flemish-language daily het laatste nieuws showed that 46.1 percent of flemings polled wanted belgium to split , compared to 49.6 percent who said they did n't .
" many flemings believe that a split would make them richer , " said buelens .
" every two months vlaams belang -lsb- a flemish nationalist party -rsb- sends out flyers saying that flemings pay enough towards wallonia to buy a walloon family a 15,000-euro car -lrb- $ 21,000 -rrb- every two years .
those who believe that believe that this money would go to them if the country was divided .
it is not as simple as that .
" it is like a child in a quarreling family , " he continued .
" if the parents row all the time , maybe the child thinks it would be better for them to divorce .
but it thinks this without any real knowledge of the consequences .
the child just thinks things would be better than the quarreling .
this is how it is in belgium . "
while the opinions of the people show just how complicated and diverse life in belgium can be , the final decision to split the country - should it come to that - will be made by the politicians .
but just how likely and how possible would it be to dissolve belgium ?
practical problems , lack of will make divorce unlikely " for a start it is really only a small part of the flemish political elite which favors a split , " said buelens .
" but the flemish have a larger federal presence , with about 60 percent of the population .
even so , there would have to be agreement on both sides of the divide to separate the country and we 've seen how hard it is to gain a consensus here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium is rife with political and linguistic divisions buelens believes that there are too many issues involved in breaking up the country to make it a viable option , from the payment of the national debt to the future of brussels .
but , he concluded , it was worth debating the idea as it could lead to the resolution of other long-standing problems in belgium .
" it 's good that the politicians are talking about this , " he said .
" this debate could lead to a reform of the regional structure which would make things fairer for everyone ; how power can be shared and distributed , how wealth and employment can be spread around the whole country . "
" it is better that they resolve their differences over 100 , 200 or even 300 days rather than take up arms against each other and decide it that way . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 , to open their 88 billion euro -lrb- $ 125.3 billion -rrb- postal markets to full competition beginning in 2011 , but 11 countries will be given an additional two-year grace period . some countries had wanted to move faster , but the ministers were motivated to reach a compromise that was acceptable of all 27 of the bloc 's nations , herve novelli , french minister of state for businesses and foreign trade , told the afp news agency . " this directive in no way changes the basic rights of the sector and workers in the sector , " portuguese telecoms minister mario lino told reporters , trying to calm the fears of some postal workers concerned about possible job cuts . the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , had originally proposed to strip away the remaining barriers to competition from 2009 .
if a member state wishes to end the state monopoly earlier , as has been the case in some countries , they are permitted to do so . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission says competition will bring down prices the 11 nations who may take advantage of the grace period include : cyprus , the czech republic , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , romania and slovakia - all eu newcomers who have joined since 2004 - plus greece and luxembourg . the european parliament still needs to approve the measure , a final step that is seen as likely to occur in february or march as the deal ministers agreed to was largely put together by parliament members . " in general the parliament is very happy about the result of the council , " markus ferber , the german lawmaker steering the measure through the eu assembly , told reuters . letters under 50 grams still shielded national markets for letters weighing up to 50 grams -lrb- 1.8 ounces -rrb- are currently protected from competition .
mail above that weight has already been liberalized . the european postal sector was liberalized a decade ago for the delivery of packages weighing over 350 grams , then broadened in 2003 to items of more than 100 grams in 2003 and , to letters weighing more than 50 grams in 2006 . the european commission has aimed to expand on the perceived success of britain , finland , and sweden , which have already liberalized their postal markets .
germany is to open up fully open up its market next year . the commission has said that greater competition could lead to lower costs and better or customized service .
as an extra reason to convince countries to open their markets , only former countries who have liberalized their own postal markets will be eligible to become involved in letter delivery in other eu countries . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 02.10.2007 germany faces rich-poor divide , says president großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the era of unilateralism is over , said köhler when german president horst köhler gave his second " berlin address " on monday , oct .
2 , he surprised many with statements that sounded positively left-leaning for a member of the conservative christian democratic party . last year , when köhler chose to concentrate on domestic education issues , his speech caused barely a ripple .
this time round , he cast his net wider and took the opportunity to warn of the dangers of globalization , the " growing rift " between germany 's haves and the have-nots , and the need for greater regulation of international financial markets .
although köhler was generally viewed as a neo-liberal when he assumed office in 2004 , many saw monday 's talk as further proof of a perceived swing to the left .
ten years after then president roman herzog gave the very first berlin address and famously told the country that it needed to " jolt itself into action , " horst köhler echoed his predecessor 's plea for greater german openness and focused heavily on the issue of globalization and its consequences .
the risks of globalization " does globalization ultimately endanger our entire social model ? " he asked .
" the pressure of global competition is putting much to the test . … a large part of humanity continues to live in deepest poverty .
this has two main causes : not being able to share sufficiently in globalization - mainly because of a lack of economic power and good governance - and being disadvantaged by states and private players who pursue their own interests with no regard for others .
" those who live at the expense of others will at some stage be left standing alone , " he admonished .
but in keeping with the traditionally optimistic spirit of the presidential speeches , his message was broadly upbeat .
" globalization is simply life , " he said .
" it has to be shaped through day-to-day work and imagination , through untiring efforts and cheerful enthusiasm .
it can change the world for the better . "
a social conscience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs to look after the weaker members of society köhler pulled more of a punch when it came to germany , raising many points underlying the social democrats ' new party agenda .
referring to many people 's fear of social destitution , he said germany needed to take better care of its workforce .
" germany is not an effective and future-oriented state based on social justice at present , " he said , pointing out that the country was witnessing a creeping divide between the rich and the poor .
" the inequality in the distribution of income in germany has increased . … job security has diminished and people 's working lives are subject to change and flux . ...
although germany 's broad middle class continues to do quite well , there is an increasing fear of social decline and many people from low-income and less well-educated backgrounds can not advance without assistance , " he said .
continuing the social theme , he reiterated the thrust of last year 's argument and said the country needed to improve school performance .
" germany 's education system is not performing as well as those of some other western industrialized states , " he argued .
in a further echo of social democratic values , he went on to call for greater regulation of global financial markets and proposed the international monetary fund europe increase the involvement of emerging economies and developing countries in its decision-making .
it was time , he said , that europe played a greater role on the international stage .
" i believe that the world expects more of us europeans than we are currently offering , " he said .
" the world would be poorer without the european perspective on things .
and it is therefore our duty to share this perspective with others . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 , to open their 88 billion euro -lrb- $ 125.3 billion -rrb- postal markets to full competition beginning in 2011 , but 11 countries will be given an additional two-year grace period . some countries had wanted to move faster , but the ministers were motivated to reach a compromise that was acceptable of all 27 of the bloc 's nations , herve novelli , french minister of state for businesses and foreign trade , told the afp news agency . " this directive in no way changes the basic rights of the sector and workers in the sector , " portuguese telecoms minister mario lino told reporters , trying to calm the fears of some postal workers concerned about possible job cuts . the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , had originally proposed to strip away the remaining barriers to competition from 2009 .
if a member state wishes to end the state monopoly earlier , as has been the case in some countries , they are permitted to do so . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission says competition will bring down prices the 11 nations who may take advantage of the grace period include : cyprus , the czech republic , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , romania and slovakia - all eu newcomers who have joined since 2004 - plus greece and luxembourg . the european parliament still needs to approve the measure , a final step that is seen as likely to occur in february or march as the deal ministers agreed to was largely put together by parliament members . " in general the parliament is very happy about the result of the council , " markus ferber , the german lawmaker steering the measure through the eu assembly , told reuters . letters under 50 grams still shielded national markets for letters weighing up to 50 grams -lrb- 1.8 ounces -rrb- are currently protected from competition .
mail above that weight has already been liberalized . the european postal sector was liberalized a decade ago for the delivery of packages weighing over 350 grams , then broadened in 2003 to items of more than 100 grams in 2003 and , to letters weighing more than 50 grams in 2006 . the european commission has aimed to expand on the perceived success of britain , finland , and sweden , which have already liberalized their postal markets .
germany is to open up fully open up its market next year . the commission has said that greater competition could lead to lower costs and better or customized service .
as an extra reason to convince countries to open their markets , only former countries who have liberalized their own postal markets will be eligible to become involved in letter delivery in other eu countries . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 02.10.2007 belgian political crisis and talk of linguistic divisions continue großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgians show their support for national unity at a time of concern over the country 's future as the belgian government remains locked in a stalemate over the formation of a coalition , the divisions along linguistic lines have fuelled fears that the flemish and french-speaking regions may go their separate ways . to the casual observer or tourist , the thousands of belgian flags that hang from the balconies of brussels could be a show of support for one of the country 's national teams .
while the flags do represent a show of national unity , it is a statement of allegiance not to a team but to the country itself .
the message in brussels is clear : " we are belgium ; we are one . "
the people of brussels are united behind the flag as the political crisis in belgium continues .
it is now 112 days since elections triggered a deadlock over more self-rule for belgium 's rival linguistic camps and set the dutch and french-speaking sides against each other in a complex row that doomsayers say could tear the country in two .
the belgian political system has been in paralysis since the june 10 election when the country 's christian democrats and liberals won a legislative majority to form a coalition government .
however , both sides then split into dutch and french-speaking parties with the dutch-speaking christian democrats and liberals demanding more autonomy for the northern flanders region .
the francophone politicians accuse the flemish of trying to split the country by demanding increasing independence for flanders , saying that the unity and structure of the state is at risk if the north gets more autonomy .
a bigger say for flanders in areas such as the economy and employment would effectively give the region the power of a small state , they argue , and would have a detrimental effect on the rest of the country .
prosperous flanders wants more autonomy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : split down the middle there has been tension between francophone , wallonia in the south and flanders in the north ever since belgium won its independence in 1830 . but the main problem with modern belgium as far as the flemings are concerned is that their more prosperous region has to continually prop up wallonia , a region which is poorer and has higher unemployment .
the flemings want wallonia to become more accountable and to keep more money in their wealthy dutch-speaking region .
this feeling of disparity has fuelled resurgence in flemish nationalism and , in turn , the rising success of flemish separatist parties . the stand-off has led to almost four months of stalemate over the formation of the government .
while belgian king albert ii has appointing a series of politicians with the unenviable job of hammering out a compromise and forming a coalition , each has so far failed .
" the problem is that we are still stuck in an electoral situation where any movement by one side or the other towards an agreement is seen as a sign of weakness , " johan buelens , a professor of political science at the free university of brussels , told dw-world.de.
" it 's like a game of political chicken .
who will blink first ? "
bildunterschrift : officially bilingual brussels aligns itself with wallonia brussels , wallonia see no reason for split the political split along linguistic lines has generated discussions in many quarters over a possible geographical separation of the nation .
while the general impression outside belgium is of a country on the verge of collapse , the people , at least those in the capital , are far more relaxed .
" this talk of separation comes only from the politicians , " said anne wilmots , a physiotherapist in the predominantly flemish quarter of woluwe sint pieters in brussels .
" the people , at least in brussels and wallonia , do n't want a split and do n't believe there will be one .
it is a tactic , an empty threat in a game of politics .
no one really believes this will happen . "
the opinion of many of those living in the largely francophone but officially bilingual municipality of brussels is much the same as that of the majority of french-speakers in wallonia , including the region 's largest political party .
" this is not a new discussion , " a senior politician with humanist democratic centre -lrb- cdh -rrb- , a christian democratic party , told dw-world.de under the condition of anonymity .
" we have been talking along linguistic lines for over 50 years and the country is still together .
the regions are compatible , whatever people may say .
the cdh supports a unified belgium and will continue to do so .
we do n't foresee any changes in our ideology or the structure of our nation . "
flemish nationalism fuelling independence debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flemish nationalist parties have made gains in flanders however , the view from the north is quite different .
a recent poll in the flemish-language daily het laatste nieuws showed that 46.1 percent of flemings polled wanted belgium to split , compared to 49.6 percent who said they did n't .
" many flemings believe that a split would make them richer , " said buelens .
" every two months vlaams belang -lsb- a flemish nationalist party -rsb- sends out flyers saying that flemings pay enough towards wallonia to buy a walloon family a 15,000-euro car -lrb- $ 21,000 -rrb- every two years .
those who believe that believe that this money would go to them if the country was divided .
it is not as simple as that .
" it is like a child in a quarreling family , " he continued .
" if the parents row all the time , maybe the child thinks it would be better for them to divorce .
but it thinks this without any real knowledge of the consequences .
the child just thinks things would be better than the quarreling .
this is how it is in belgium . "
while the opinions of the people show just how complicated and diverse life in belgium can be , the final decision to split the country - should it come to that - will be made by the politicians .
but just how likely and how possible would it be to dissolve belgium ?

while the flags do represent a show of national unity , it is a statement of allegiance not to a team but to the country itself .
the message in brussels is clear : " we are belgium ; we are one . "
the people of brussels are united behind the flag as the political crisis in belgium continues .
it is now 112 days since elections triggered a deadlock over more self-rule for belgium 's rival linguistic camps and set the dutch and french-speaking sides against each other in a complex row that doomsayers say could tear the country in two .
the belgian political system has been in paralysis since the june 10 election when the country 's christian democrats and liberals won a legislative majority to form a coalition government .
however , both sides then split into dutch and french-speaking parties with the dutch-speaking christian democrats and liberals demanding more autonomy for the northern flanders region .
the francophone politicians accuse the flemish of trying to split the country by demanding increasing independence for flanders , saying that the unity and structure of the state is at risk if the north gets more autonomy .
a bigger say for flanders in areas such as the economy and employment would effectively give the region the power of a small state , they argue , and would have a detrimental effect on the rest of the country .
prosperous flanders wants more autonomy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : split down the middle there has been tension between francophone , wallonia in the south and flanders in the north ever since belgium won its independence in 1830 . but the main problem with modern belgium as far as the flemings are concerned is that their more prosperous region has to continually prop up wallonia , a region which is poorer and has higher unemployment .
the flemings want wallonia to become more accountable and to keep more money in their wealthy dutch-speaking region .
this feeling of disparity has fuelled resurgence in flemish nationalism and , in turn , the rising success of flemish separatist parties . the stand-off has led to almost four months of stalemate over the formation of the government .
while belgian king albert ii has appointing a series of politicians with the unenviable job of hammering out a compromise and forming a coalition , each has so far failed .
" the problem is that we are still stuck in an electoral situation where any movement by one side or the other towards an agreement is seen as a sign of weakness , " johan buelens , a professor of political science at the free university of brussels , told dw-world.de.
" it 's like a game of political chicken .
who will blink first ? "
bildunterschrift : officially bilingual brussels aligns itself with wallonia brussels , wallonia see no reason for split the political split along linguistic lines has generated discussions in many quarters over a possible geographical separation of the nation .
while the general impression outside belgium is of a country on the verge of collapse , the people , at least those in the capital , are far more relaxed .
" this talk of separation comes only from the politicians , " said anne wilmots , a physiotherapist in the predominantly flemish quarter of woluwe sint pieters in brussels .
" the people , at least in brussels and wallonia , do n't want a split and do n't believe there will be one .
it is a tactic , an empty threat in a game of politics .
no one really believes this will happen . "
the opinion of many of those living in the largely francophone but officially bilingual municipality of brussels is much the same as that of the majority of french-speakers in wallonia , including the region 's largest political party .
" this is not a new discussion , " a senior politician with humanist democratic centre -lrb- cdh -rrb- , a christian democratic party , told dw-world.de under the condition of anonymity .
" we have been talking along linguistic lines for over 50 years and the country is still together .
the regions are compatible , whatever people may say .
the cdh supports a unified belgium and will continue to do so .
we do n't foresee any changes in our ideology or the structure of our nation . "
flemish nationalism fuelling independence debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flemish nationalist parties have made gains in flanders however , the view from the north is quite different .
a recent poll in the flemish-language daily het laatste nieuws showed that 46.1 percent of flemings polled wanted belgium to split , compared to 49.6 percent who said they did n't .
" many flemings believe that a split would make them richer , " said buelens .
" every two months vlaams belang -lsb- a flemish nationalist party -rsb- sends out flyers saying that flemings pay enough towards wallonia to buy a walloon family a 15,000-euro car -lrb- $ 21,000 -rrb- every two years .
those who believe that believe that this money would go to them if the country was divided .
it is not as simple as that .
" it is like a child in a quarreling family , " he continued .
" if the parents row all the time , maybe the child thinks it would be better for them to divorce .
but it thinks this without any real knowledge of the consequences .
the child just thinks things would be better than the quarreling .
this is how it is in belgium . "
while the opinions of the people show just how complicated and diverse life in belgium can be , the final decision to split the country - should it come to that - will be made by the politicians .
but just how likely and how possible would it be to dissolve belgium ?

while the flags do represent a show of national unity , it is a statement of allegiance not to a team but to the country itself .
the message in brussels is clear : " we are belgium ; we are one . "
the people of brussels are united behind the flag as the political crisis in belgium continues .
it is now 112 days since elections triggered a deadlock over more self-rule for belgium 's rival linguistic camps and set the dutch and french-speaking sides against each other in a complex row that doomsayers say could tear the country in two .
the belgian political system has been in paralysis since the june 10 election when the country 's christian democrats and liberals won a legislative majority to form a coalition government .
however , both sides then split into dutch and french-speaking parties with the dutch-speaking christian democrats and liberals demanding more autonomy for the northern flanders region .
the francophone politicians accuse the flemish of trying to split the country by demanding increasing independence for flanders , saying that the unity and structure of the state is at risk if the north gets more autonomy .
a bigger say for flanders in areas such as the economy and employment would effectively give the region the power of a small state , they argue , and would have a detrimental effect on the rest of the country .
prosperous flanders wants more autonomy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : split down the middle there has been tension between francophone , wallonia in the south and flanders in the north ever since belgium won its independence in 1830 . but the main problem with modern belgium as far as the flemings are concerned is that their more prosperous region has to continually prop up wallonia , a region which is poorer and has higher unemployment .
the flemings want wallonia to become more accountable and to keep more money in their wealthy dutch-speaking region .
this feeling of disparity has fuelled resurgence in flemish nationalism and , in turn , the rising success of flemish separatist parties . the stand-off has led to almost four months of stalemate over the formation of the government .
while belgian king albert ii has appointing a series of politicians with the unenviable job of hammering out a compromise and forming a coalition , each has so far failed .
" the problem is that we are still stuck in an electoral situation where any movement by one side or the other towards an agreement is seen as a sign of weakness , " johan buelens , a professor of political science at the free university of brussels , told dw-world.de.
" it 's like a game of political chicken .
who will blink first ? "
bildunterschrift : officially bilingual brussels aligns itself with wallonia brussels , wallonia see no reason for split the political split along linguistic lines has generated discussions in many quarters over a possible geographical separation of the nation .
while the general impression outside belgium is of a country on the verge of collapse , the people , at least those in the capital , are far more relaxed .
" this talk of separation comes only from the politicians , " said anne wilmots , a physiotherapist in the predominantly flemish quarter of woluwe sint pieters in brussels .
" the people , at least in brussels and wallonia , do n't want a split and do n't believe there will be one .
it is a tactic , an empty threat in a game of politics .
no one really believes this will happen . "
the opinion of many of those living in the largely francophone but officially bilingual municipality of brussels is much the same as that of the majority of french-speakers in wallonia , including the region 's largest political party .
" this is not a new discussion , " a senior politician with humanist democratic centre -lrb- cdh -rrb- , a christian democratic party , told dw-world.de under the condition of anonymity .
" we have been talking along linguistic lines for over 50 years and the country is still together .
the regions are compatible , whatever people may say .
the cdh supports a unified belgium and will continue to do so .
we do n't foresee any changes in our ideology or the structure of our nation . "
flemish nationalism fuelling independence debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flemish nationalist parties have made gains in flanders however , the view from the north is quite different .
a recent poll in the flemish-language daily het laatste nieuws showed that 46.1 percent of flemings polled wanted belgium to split , compared to 49.6 percent who said they did n't .
" many flemings believe that a split would make them richer , " said buelens .
" every two months vlaams belang -lsb- a flemish nationalist party -rsb- sends out flyers saying that flemings pay enough towards wallonia to buy a walloon family a 15,000-euro car -lrb- $ 21,000 -rrb- every two years .
those who believe that believe that this money would go to them if the country was divided .
it is not as simple as that .
" it is like a child in a quarreling family , " he continued .
" if the parents row all the time , maybe the child thinks it would be better for them to divorce .
but it thinks this without any real knowledge of the consequences .
the child just thinks things would be better than the quarreling .
this is how it is in belgium . "
while the opinions of the people show just how complicated and diverse life in belgium can be , the final decision to split the country - should it come to that - will be made by the politicians .
but just how likely and how possible would it be to dissolve belgium ?
practical problems , lack of will make divorce unlikely " for a start it is really only a small part of the flemish political elite which favors a split , " said buelens .
" but the flemish have a larger federal presence , with about 60 percent of the population .
even so , there would have to be agreement on both sides of the divide to separate the country and we 've seen how hard it is to gain a consensus here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium is rife with political and linguistic divisions buelens believes that there are too many issues involved in breaking up the country to make it a viable option , from the payment of the national debt to the future of brussels .
but , he concluded , it was worth debating the idea as it could lead to the resolution of other long-standing problems in belgium .
" it 's good that the politicians are talking about this , " he said .
" this debate could lead to a reform of the regional structure which would make things fairer for everyone ; how power can be shared and distributed , how wealth and employment can be spread around the whole country . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 02.10.2007 germany faces rich-poor divide , says president großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the era of unilateralism is over , said köhler when german president horst köhler gave his second " berlin address " on monday , oct .
2 , he surprised many with statements that sounded positively left-leaning for a member of the conservative christian democratic party . last year , when köhler chose to concentrate on domestic education issues , his speech caused barely a ripple .
this time round , he cast his net wider and took the opportunity to warn of the dangers of globalization , the " growing rift " between germany 's haves and the have-nots , and the need for greater regulation of international financial markets .
although köhler was generally viewed as a neo-liberal when he assumed office in 2004 , many saw monday 's talk as further proof of a perceived swing to the left .
ten years after then president roman herzog gave the very first berlin address and famously told the country that it needed to " jolt itself into action , " horst köhler echoed his predecessor 's plea for greater german openness and focused heavily on the issue of globalization and its consequences .
the risks of globalization " does globalization ultimately endanger our entire social model ? " he asked .
" the pressure of global competition is putting much to the test . … a large part of humanity continues to live in deepest poverty .
this has two main causes : not being able to share sufficiently in globalization - mainly because of a lack of economic power and good governance - and being disadvantaged by states and private players who pursue their own interests with no regard for others .
" those who live at the expense of others will at some stage be left standing alone , " he admonished .
but in keeping with the traditionally optimistic spirit of the presidential speeches , his message was broadly upbeat .
" globalization is simply life , " he said .
" it has to be shaped through day-to-day work and imagination , through untiring efforts and cheerful enthusiasm .
it can change the world for the better . "
a social conscience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs to look after the weaker members of society köhler pulled more of a punch when it came to germany , raising many points underlying the social democrats ' new party agenda .
referring to many people 's fear of social destitution , he said germany needed to take better care of its workforce .
" germany is not an effective and future-oriented state based on social justice at present , " he said , pointing out that the country was witnessing a creeping divide between the rich and the poor .
" the inequality in the distribution of income in germany has increased . … job security has diminished and people 's working lives are subject to change and flux . ...
although germany 's broad middle class continues to do quite well , there is an increasing fear of social decline and many people from low-income and less well-educated backgrounds can not advance without assistance , " he said .
continuing the social theme , he reiterated the thrust of last year 's argument and said the country needed to improve school performance .
" germany 's education system is not performing as well as those of some other western industrialized states , " he argued .
in a further echo of social democratic values , he went on to call for greater regulation of global financial markets and proposed the international monetary fund europe increase the involvement of emerging economies and developing countries in its decision-making .
it was time , he said , that europe played a greater role on the international stage .
" i believe that the world expects more of us europeans than we are currently offering , " he said .
" the world would be poorer without the european perspective on things .
and it is therefore our duty to share this perspective with others . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

her visit is to focus on a range of issues , including human rights , aids , economic cooperation and the political crisis in zimbabwe . deutsche welle spoke about merkel 's agenda on the africa tour with dominic johnson , an editor at germany 's taz newspaper and an expert on africa . deutsche welle : why did german chancellor angela merkel choose to go to ethiopia , south africa and liberia ? dominic johnson : south africa is the most obvious choice - it is the most important trading partner for germany in africa .
president thabo mbeki , the south african president , attended the g8 summit in heiligendamm in june .
south africa is going to host the soccer world cup in 2010 and there is a lot of cooperation between germany and south africa on that .
so , south africa is the natural place to go for a german chancellor . ethiopia is fairly obvious as well .
it is the head of the african union , the seat of the african union commission , where merkel will visit .
it has become an obligatory stop for every german politician who goes to africa .
german president horst köhler was there recently , and cooperation is quite close . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel liberia is maybe less obvious .
it is a small country in west africa , not particularly important , but it is the only african country headed by a woman -lsb- president ellen johnson sirleaf -rsb- and chancellor merkel is the only female head of government in europe , so in a way , when the most powerful woman in europe goes to meet the most powerful woman in africa .
it 's a highly symbolic moment . there 's a large german business delegation that will be accompanying merkel , but surely business issues will not be the only ones on the agenda ? they wo n't be the only ones , but i think they 'll be quite important , even though they are n't being flagged at the moment .
it 's already been announced that , following this africa trip , the german government will try to call an african economic summit to try to encourage german businesses , especially small businesses , to invest in africa , and we know that south africa and liberia are looking for more investments for reconstruction . what are some of the other issues that will be discussed ? one of them will be development aid .
the chancellor has said she will visit development projects in all three countries .
she mentioned her upcoming africa visit during her speech at the un global fund to fight aids conference in berlin last week and she made it clear that this is important to her as well .
so , there will be a lot of the traditional development issues , but there will also be a lot of business items on the agenda during talks .
and , of course , germany is still the president of the g8 , so it still has a political role to play and will be looking at liberia 's foreign debt and cooperation with the african union as a whole . interview : dagmar breitenbach -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 , was the use of new technology and the sharing of travelers ' data in the fight against terrorism .
eu justice and home affairs commissioner franco frattini called for a register of all non-eu citizens entering and leaving the 27-nation bloc , who would be electronically registered with biometric identifiers .
the register is " extremely necessary " in order to crack down on people who are granted permission to stay for a restricted time but disappear when the period expires , frattini explained , pointing to recent scares in germany , britain and denmark .
under his proposals , which will be published in november , law-enforcement officials in all member states would be allowed to share collected data with colleagues across the eu .
the scheme would operate alongside an airline passenger data recording system apparently modeled on one developed by the us .
officials said they were still debating whether to adopt the system for flights within eu as well as those to and from countries outside the union .
technological crackdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should radical web sites be blocked ?
much of the discussion was geared to finding ways of countering the use of the internet by militants , with participants debating issues such as censorship and freedom of expression .
frattini proposed a technological crackdown on terrorist activities , including a plan to set up a database to provide an early-warning system on lost or stolen explosives , and new provisions to deal with the misuse of the internet by terrorists .
frattini urged sanctions against web sites that disseminate terror propaganda or bomb-building instructions or engage in recruitment for terrorist groups , prompting concerns among ministers about privacy and civil liberties .
such web sites " have nothing to do with freedom of expression , " retaliated frattini , who said he was also considering proposing broader legal definition of conspiracy that would include people who support terrorist acts .
public concerns that european legislators might curb people 's individual freedoms in their attempts to prevent terrorism attacks on their territory were apparent at the press conference after monday 's meeting .
" if your question is whether a sort-of ' big brother ' is arising in europe and calling fundamental rights into question , then the answer is ' no , " ' said rui pereira , portugal 's interior minister , in response to a question , according to news agency dpa .
" but no member state , and the eu as a whole , can avoid fighting terrorism , " he added .
extending the schengen agreement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu justice and home affairs comissioner frattini also discussed was an extension to the eu 's borderless travel zone - as far east as the frontiers with ukraine and belarus - a week before christmas , two weeks ahead of schedule .
according to portuguese home affairs minister rui perreira , nine new member states are poised to join the schengen travel zone , abolishing all land and sea checks along their common borders , although checks at airports will continue until march .
" all of the tests that we have carried out confirm that by the end of the year we will be able to remove the frontiers , " said perreira .
the border-free " schengen " area now includes 13 eu countries , plus norway and iceland .
the latest countries involved are the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia .
cyprus , the 10th nation to join the eu in 2004 , has opted to keep some border checks for a further year .
" i think this will serve as a real incentive for citizens of the new member states to feel that they are full european citizens , " perreira said .
eu justice ministers will decide on giving the final go-ahead to the expansion of schengen during their meeting on nov .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 02.10.2007 new proposals let more people into eu , keep others out großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more countries are set to benefit from the schengen agreement while eu justice and interior ministers meeting in lisbon discussed tightening border controls of non-eu citizens , the bloc 's internal borderless travel zone is set to be extended . among the raft of new anti-terror measures up for discussion at the two-day informal meeting , which began monday , oct .
1 , was the use of new technology and the sharing of travelers ' data in the fight against terrorism .
eu justice and home affairs commissioner franco frattini called for a register of all non-eu citizens entering and leaving the 27-nation bloc , who would be electronically registered with biometric identifiers .
the register is " extremely necessary " in order to crack down on people who are granted permission to stay for a restricted time but disappear when the period expires , frattini explained , pointing to recent scares in germany , britain and denmark .
under his proposals , which will be published in november , law-enforcement officials in all member states would be allowed to share collected data with colleagues across the eu .
the scheme would operate alongside an airline passenger data recording system apparently modeled on one developed by the us .
officials said they were still debating whether to adopt the system for flights within eu as well as those to and from countries outside the union .
technological crackdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should radical web sites be blocked ?
much of the discussion was geared to finding ways of countering the use of the internet by militants , with participants debating issues such as censorship and freedom of expression .
frattini proposed a technological crackdown on terrorist activities , including a plan to set up a database to provide an early-warning system on lost or stolen explosives , and new provisions to deal with the misuse of the internet by terrorists .
frattini urged sanctions against web sites that disseminate terror propaganda or bomb-building instructions or engage in recruitment for terrorist groups , prompting concerns among ministers about privacy and civil liberties .
such web sites " have nothing to do with freedom of expression , " retaliated frattini , who said he was also considering proposing broader legal definition of conspiracy that would include people who support terrorist acts .
public concerns that european legislators might curb people 's individual freedoms in their attempts to prevent terrorism attacks on their territory were apparent at the press conference after monday 's meeting .
" if your question is whether a sort-of ' big brother ' is arising in europe and calling fundamental rights into question , then the answer is ' no , " ' said rui pereira , portugal 's interior minister , in response to a question , according to news agency dpa .
" but no member state , and the eu as a whole , can avoid fighting terrorism , " he added .
extending the schengen agreement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu justice and home affairs comissioner frattini also discussed was an extension to the eu 's borderless travel zone - as far east as the frontiers with ukraine and belarus - a week before christmas , two weeks ahead of schedule .
according to portuguese home affairs minister rui perreira , nine new member states are poised to join the schengen travel zone , abolishing all land and sea checks along their common borders , although checks at airports will continue until march .
" all of the tests that we have carried out confirm that by the end of the year we will be able to remove the frontiers , " said perreira .
the border-free " schengen " area now includes 13 eu countries , plus norway and iceland .
the latest countries involved are the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia .
cyprus , the 10th nation to join the eu in 2004 , has opted to keep some border checks for a further year .
" i think this will serve as a real incentive for citizens of the new member states to feel that they are full european citizens , " perreira said .
eu justice ministers will decide on giving the final go-ahead to the expansion of schengen during their meeting on nov .

her visit is to focus on a range of issues , including human rights , aids , economic cooperation and the political crisis in zimbabwe . deutsche welle spoke about merkel 's agenda on the africa tour with dominic johnson , an editor at germany 's taz newspaper and an expert on africa . deutsche welle : why did german chancellor angela merkel choose to go to ethiopia , south africa and liberia ? dominic johnson : south africa is the most obvious choice - it is the most important trading partner for germany in africa .
president thabo mbeki , the south african president , attended the g8 summit in heiligendamm in june .
south africa is going to host the soccer world cup in 2010 and there is a lot of cooperation between germany and south africa on that .
so , south africa is the natural place to go for a german chancellor . ethiopia is fairly obvious as well .
it is the head of the african union , the seat of the african union commission , where merkel will visit .
it has become an obligatory stop for every german politician who goes to africa .
german president horst köhler was there recently , and cooperation is quite close . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel liberia is maybe less obvious .
it is a small country in west africa , not particularly important , but it is the only african country headed by a woman -lsb- president ellen johnson sirleaf -rsb- and chancellor merkel is the only female head of government in europe , so in a way , when the most powerful woman in europe goes to meet the most powerful woman in africa .
it 's a highly symbolic moment . there 's a large german business delegation that will be accompanying merkel , but surely business issues will not be the only ones on the agenda ? they wo n't be the only ones , but i think they 'll be quite important , even though they are n't being flagged at the moment .
it 's already been announced that , following this africa trip , the german government will try to call an african economic summit to try to encourage german businesses , especially small businesses , to invest in africa , and we know that south africa and liberia are looking for more investments for reconstruction . what are some of the other issues that will be discussed ? one of them will be development aid .
the chancellor has said she will visit development projects in all three countries .
she mentioned her upcoming africa visit during her speech at the un global fund to fight aids conference in berlin last week and she made it clear that this is important to her as well .
so , there will be a lot of the traditional development issues , but there will also be a lot of business items on the agenda during talks .
and , of course , germany is still the president of the g8 , so it still has a political role to play and will be looking at liberia 's foreign debt and cooperation with the african union as a whole . interview : dagmar breitenbach -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

2 , he surprised many with statements that sounded positively left-leaning for a member of the conservative christian democratic party . last year , when köhler chose to concentrate on domestic education issues , his speech caused barely a ripple .
this time round , he cast his net wider and took the opportunity to warn of the dangers of globalization , the " growing rift " between germany 's haves and the have-nots , and the need for greater regulation of international financial markets .
although köhler was generally viewed as a neo-liberal when he assumed office in 2004 , many saw monday 's talk as further proof of a perceived swing to the left .
ten years after then president roman herzog gave the very first berlin address and famously told the country that it needed to " jolt itself into action , " horst köhler echoed his predecessor 's plea for greater german openness and focused heavily on the issue of globalization and its consequences .
the risks of globalization " does globalization ultimately endanger our entire social model ? " he asked .
" the pressure of global competition is putting much to the test . … a large part of humanity continues to live in deepest poverty .
this has two main causes : not being able to share sufficiently in globalization - mainly because of a lack of economic power and good governance - and being disadvantaged by states and private players who pursue their own interests with no regard for others .
" those who live at the expense of others will at some stage be left standing alone , " he admonished .
but in keeping with the traditionally optimistic spirit of the presidential speeches , his message was broadly upbeat .
" globalization is simply life , " he said .
" it has to be shaped through day-to-day work and imagination , through untiring efforts and cheerful enthusiasm .
it can change the world for the better . "
a social conscience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs to look after the weaker members of society köhler pulled more of a punch when it came to germany , raising many points underlying the social democrats ' new party agenda .
referring to many people 's fear of social destitution , he said germany needed to take better care of its workforce .
" germany is not an effective and future-oriented state based on social justice at present , " he said , pointing out that the country was witnessing a creeping divide between the rich and the poor .
" the inequality in the distribution of income in germany has increased . … job security has diminished and people 's working lives are subject to change and flux . ...
although germany 's broad middle class continues to do quite well , there is an increasing fear of social decline and many people from low-income and less well-educated backgrounds can not advance without assistance , " he said .
continuing the social theme , he reiterated the thrust of last year 's argument and said the country needed to improve school performance .
" germany 's education system is not performing as well as those of some other western industrialized states , " he argued .
in a further echo of social democratic values , he went on to call for greater regulation of global financial markets and proposed the international monetary fund europe increase the involvement of emerging economies and developing countries in its decision-making .
it was time , he said , that europe played a greater role on the international stage .
" i believe that the world expects more of us europeans than we are currently offering , " he said .

1 , was the use of new technology and the sharing of travelers ' data in the fight against terrorism .
eu justice and home affairs commissioner franco frattini called for a register of all non-eu citizens entering and leaving the 27-nation bloc , who would be electronically registered with biometric identifiers .
the register is " extremely necessary " in order to crack down on people who are granted permission to stay for a restricted time but disappear when the period expires , frattini explained , pointing to recent scares in germany , britain and denmark .
under his proposals , which will be published in november , law-enforcement officials in all member states would be allowed to share collected data with colleagues across the eu .
the scheme would operate alongside an airline passenger data recording system apparently modeled on one developed by the us .
officials said they were still debating whether to adopt the system for flights within eu as well as those to and from countries outside the union .
technological crackdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should radical web sites be blocked ?
much of the discussion was geared to finding ways of countering the use of the internet by militants , with participants debating issues such as censorship and freedom of expression .
frattini proposed a technological crackdown on terrorist activities , including a plan to set up a database to provide an early-warning system on lost or stolen explosives , and new provisions to deal with the misuse of the internet by terrorists .
frattini urged sanctions against web sites that disseminate terror propaganda or bomb-building instructions or engage in recruitment for terrorist groups , prompting concerns among ministers about privacy and civil liberties .
such web sites " have nothing to do with freedom of expression , " retaliated frattini , who said he was also considering proposing broader legal definition of conspiracy that would include people who support terrorist acts .
public concerns that european legislators might curb people 's individual freedoms in their attempts to prevent terrorism attacks on their territory were apparent at the press conference after monday 's meeting .
" if your question is whether a sort-of ' big brother ' is arising in europe and calling fundamental rights into question , then the answer is ' no , " ' said rui pereira , portugal 's interior minister , in response to a question , according to news agency dpa .
" but no member state , and the eu as a whole , can avoid fighting terrorism , " he added .
extending the schengen agreement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu justice and home affairs comissioner frattini also discussed was an extension to the eu 's borderless travel zone - as far east as the frontiers with ukraine and belarus - a week before christmas , two weeks ahead of schedule .
according to portuguese home affairs minister rui perreira , nine new member states are poised to join the schengen travel zone , abolishing all land and sea checks along their common borders , although checks at airports will continue until march .
" all of the tests that we have carried out confirm that by the end of the year we will be able to remove the frontiers , " said perreira .
the border-free " schengen " area now includes 13 eu countries , plus norway and iceland .
the latest countries involved are the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia .
cyprus , the 10th nation to join the eu in 2004 , has opted to keep some border checks for a further year .
" i think this will serve as a real incentive for citizens of the new member states to feel that they are full european citizens , " perreira said .
eu justice ministers will decide on giving the final go-ahead to the expansion of schengen during their meeting on nov .

1 , was the use of new technology and the sharing of travelers ' data in the fight against terrorism .
eu justice and home affairs commissioner franco frattini called for a register of all non-eu citizens entering and leaving the 27-nation bloc , who would be electronically registered with biometric identifiers .
the register is " extremely necessary " in order to crack down on people who are granted permission to stay for a restricted time but disappear when the period expires , frattini explained , pointing to recent scares in germany , britain and denmark .
under his proposals , which will be published in november , law-enforcement officials in all member states would be allowed to share collected data with colleagues across the eu .
the scheme would operate alongside an airline passenger data recording system apparently modeled on one developed by the us .
officials said they were still debating whether to adopt the system for flights within eu as well as those to and from countries outside the union .
technological crackdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should radical web sites be blocked ?
much of the discussion was geared to finding ways of countering the use of the internet by militants , with participants debating issues such as censorship and freedom of expression .
frattini proposed a technological crackdown on terrorist activities , including a plan to set up a database to provide an early-warning system on lost or stolen explosives , and new provisions to deal with the misuse of the internet by terrorists .
frattini urged sanctions against web sites that disseminate terror propaganda or bomb-building instructions or engage in recruitment for terrorist groups , prompting concerns among ministers about privacy and civil liberties .
such web sites " have nothing to do with freedom of expression , " retaliated frattini , who said he was also considering proposing broader legal definition of conspiracy that would include people who support terrorist acts .
public concerns that european legislators might curb people 's individual freedoms in their attempts to prevent terrorism attacks on their territory were apparent at the press conference after monday 's meeting .
" if your question is whether a sort-of ' big brother ' is arising in europe and calling fundamental rights into question , then the answer is ' no , " ' said rui pereira , portugal 's interior minister , in response to a question , according to news agency dpa .
" but no member state , and the eu as a whole , can avoid fighting terrorism , " he added .
extending the schengen agreement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu justice and home affairs comissioner frattini also discussed was an extension to the eu 's borderless travel zone - as far east as the frontiers with ukraine and belarus - a week before christmas , two weeks ahead of schedule .
according to portuguese home affairs minister rui perreira , nine new member states are poised to join the schengen travel zone , abolishing all land and sea checks along their common borders , although checks at airports will continue until march .
" all of the tests that we have carried out confirm that by the end of the year we will be able to remove the frontiers , " said perreira .
the border-free " schengen " area now includes 13 eu countries , plus norway and iceland .
the latest countries involved are the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia .
cyprus , the 10th nation to join the eu in 2004 , has opted to keep some border checks for a further year .

2 , he surprised many with statements that sounded positively left-leaning for a member of the conservative christian democratic party . last year , when köhler chose to concentrate on domestic education issues , his speech caused barely a ripple .
this time round , he cast his net wider and took the opportunity to warn of the dangers of globalization , the " growing rift " between germany 's haves and the have-nots , and the need for greater regulation of international financial markets .
although köhler was generally viewed as a neo-liberal when he assumed office in 2004 , many saw monday 's talk as further proof of a perceived swing to the left .
ten years after then president roman herzog gave the very first berlin address and famously told the country that it needed to " jolt itself into action , " horst köhler echoed his predecessor 's plea for greater german openness and focused heavily on the issue of globalization and its consequences .
the risks of globalization " does globalization ultimately endanger our entire social model ? " he asked .
" the pressure of global competition is putting much to the test . … a large part of humanity continues to live in deepest poverty .
this has two main causes : not being able to share sufficiently in globalization - mainly because of a lack of economic power and good governance - and being disadvantaged by states and private players who pursue their own interests with no regard for others .
" those who live at the expense of others will at some stage be left standing alone , " he admonished .
but in keeping with the traditionally optimistic spirit of the presidential speeches , his message was broadly upbeat .

referring to many people 's fear of social destitution , he said germany needed to take better care of its workforce .
" germany is not an effective and future-oriented state based on social justice at present , " he said , pointing out that the country was witnessing a creeping divide between the rich and the poor .
" the inequality in the distribution of income in germany has increased . … job security has diminished and people 's working lives are subject to change and flux . ...
although germany 's broad middle class continues to do quite well , there is an increasing fear of social decline and many people from low-income and less well-educated backgrounds can not advance without assistance , " he said .
continuing the social theme , he reiterated the thrust of last year 's argument and said the country needed to improve school performance .
" germany 's education system is not performing as well as those of some other western industrialized states , " he argued .

2 , he surprised many with statements that sounded positively left-leaning for a member of the conservative christian democratic party . last year , when köhler chose to concentrate on domestic education issues , his speech caused barely a ripple .
this time round , he cast his net wider and took the opportunity to warn of the dangers of globalization , the " growing rift " between germany 's haves and the have-nots , and the need for greater regulation of international financial markets .
although köhler was generally viewed as a neo-liberal when he assumed office in 2004 , many saw monday 's talk as further proof of a perceived swing to the left .
ten years after then president roman herzog gave the very first berlin address and famously told the country that it needed to " jolt itself into action , " horst köhler echoed his predecessor 's plea for greater german openness and focused heavily on the issue of globalization and its consequences .
the risks of globalization " does globalization ultimately endanger our entire social model ? " he asked .
" the pressure of global competition is putting much to the test . … a large part of humanity continues to live in deepest poverty .
this has two main causes : not being able to share sufficiently in globalization - mainly because of a lack of economic power and good governance - and being disadvantaged by states and private players who pursue their own interests with no regard for others .
" those who live at the expense of others will at some stage be left standing alone , " he admonished .
but in keeping with the traditionally optimistic spirit of the presidential speeches , his message was broadly upbeat .
" globalization is simply life , " he said .
" it has to be shaped through day-to-day work and imagination , through untiring efforts and cheerful enthusiasm .
it can change the world for the better . "

2 , in a decision that could spell the beginning of the end of the high-technology venture touted as a rival to the us military 's global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- . galileo , which was supposed to be a showcase for europe 's technical prowess and be in place by 2008 , has stalled as cost overruns pile up , private contractors bicker and member states push their own industrial interests . after funding from a private , international consortium of eight companies involved in creating the satellite navigation system fell through , the eu said it would pump some 2.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- into the european space project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrot has found few supporters for his funding model " i am still convinced that europe needs galileo , " eu transport commissioner jacques barrot said on sept .
19 when he announced a funding plan to save the project .
" galileo is very important for the strategic autonomy of europe . " barrot has suggested the bailout money come from the billions worth of unspent agricultural funds that are returned to national coffers each year . germany to bear brunt of costs barrot 's proposal was initially given a tepid welcome by france , belgium , italy , luxembourg and spain .
germany , the eu 's largest net contributor , is openly opposed to the plan . " we can not support the suggestions proposed by the eu commission , " german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee said monday in an interview with die welt newspaper .
" germany will carry the main financial load .
that 's why the appropriate participation of german companies in galileo 's construction is a matter of course . " tiefensee has received the support of his colleagues in the economic ministry , which is against tapping the bloc 's agriculture budget for other projects . " on its own , the suggestion is coherent , but if you look at the political framework , it becomes very difficult to implement , " deputy economics minister joachim wuermeling said friday . time to decide ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with all the satellites circling the earth , some wonder if the eu needs its own a breakthrough on tuesday is not expected as both britain and the netherlands have also expressed their dissatisfaction with the eu juggling funds away from their intended purposes to pay for the satellite project . barrot has said if eu leaders could n't reach an agreement by the end of the year , the 27-member bloc would be forced to decide if it was prepared to let the project crash before it ever lifts off . while europe has remained divided over galileo , russia and china have been working on similar satellite projects , and the united states is updating its gps , already used widely in cars , boats and planes . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

2 , in a decision that could spell the beginning of the end of the high-technology venture touted as a rival to the us military 's global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- . galileo , which was supposed to be a showcase for europe 's technical prowess and be in place by 2008 , has stalled as cost overruns pile up , private contractors bicker and member states push their own industrial interests . after funding from a private , international consortium of eight companies involved in creating the satellite navigation system fell through , the eu said it would pump some 2.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- into the european space project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrot has found few supporters for his funding model " i am still convinced that europe needs galileo , " eu transport commissioner jacques barrot said on sept .
19 when he announced a funding plan to save the project .
" galileo is very important for the strategic autonomy of europe . " barrot has suggested the bailout money come from the billions worth of unspent agricultural funds that are returned to national coffers each year . germany to bear brunt of costs barrot 's proposal was initially given a tepid welcome by france , belgium , italy , luxembourg and spain .
germany , the eu 's largest net contributor , is openly opposed to the plan . " we can not support the suggestions proposed by the eu commission , " german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee said monday in an interview with die welt newspaper .
" germany will carry the main financial load .
that 's why the appropriate participation of german companies in galileo 's construction is a matter of course . " tiefensee has received the support of his colleagues in the economic ministry , which is against tapping the bloc 's agriculture budget for other projects . " on its own , the suggestion is coherent , but if you look at the political framework , it becomes very difficult to implement , " deputy economics minister joachim wuermeling said friday . time to decide ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with all the satellites circling the earth , some wonder if the eu needs its own a breakthrough on tuesday is not expected as both britain and the netherlands have also expressed their dissatisfaction with the eu juggling funds away from their intended purposes to pay for the satellite project . barrot has said if eu leaders could n't reach an agreement by the end of the year , the 27-member bloc would be forced to decide if it was prepared to let the project crash before it ever lifts off . while europe has remained divided over galileo , russia and china have been working on similar satellite projects , and the united states is updating its gps , already used widely in cars , boats and planes . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while the flags do represent a show of national unity , it is a statement of allegiance not to a team but to the country itself .
the message in brussels is clear : " we are belgium ; we are one . "
the people of brussels are united behind the flag as the political crisis in belgium continues .
it is now 112 days since elections triggered a deadlock over more self-rule for belgium 's rival linguistic camps and set the dutch and french-speaking sides against each other in a complex row that doomsayers say could tear the country in two .
the belgian political system has been in paralysis since the june 10 election when the country 's christian democrats and liberals won a legislative majority to form a coalition government .
however , both sides then split into dutch and french-speaking parties with the dutch-speaking christian democrats and liberals demanding more autonomy for the northern flanders region .
the francophone politicians accuse the flemish of trying to split the country by demanding increasing independence for flanders , saying that the unity and structure of the state is at risk if the north gets more autonomy .
a bigger say for flanders in areas such as the economy and employment would effectively give the region the power of a small state , they argue , and would have a detrimental effect on the rest of the country .
prosperous flanders wants more autonomy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : split down the middle there has been tension between francophone , wallonia in the south and flanders in the north ever since belgium won its independence in 1830 . but the main problem with modern belgium as far as the flemings are concerned is that their more prosperous region has to continually prop up wallonia , a region which is poorer and has higher unemployment .
the flemings want wallonia to become more accountable and to keep more money in their wealthy dutch-speaking region .
this feeling of disparity has fuelled resurgence in flemish nationalism and , in turn , the rising success of flemish separatist parties . the stand-off has led to almost four months of stalemate over the formation of the government .
while belgian king albert ii has appointing a series of politicians with the unenviable job of hammering out a compromise and forming a coalition , each has so far failed .
" the problem is that we are still stuck in an electoral situation where any movement by one side or the other towards an agreement is seen as a sign of weakness , " johan buelens , a professor of political science at the free university of brussels , told dw-world.de.
" it 's like a game of political chicken .
who will blink first ? "
bildunterschrift : officially bilingual brussels aligns itself with wallonia brussels , wallonia see no reason for split the political split along linguistic lines has generated discussions in many quarters over a possible geographical separation of the nation .
while the general impression outside belgium is of a country on the verge of collapse , the people , at least those in the capital , are far more relaxed .
" this talk of separation comes only from the politicians , " said anne wilmots , a physiotherapist in the predominantly flemish quarter of woluwe sint pieters in brussels .
" the people , at least in brussels and wallonia , do n't want a split and do n't believe there will be one .
it is a tactic , an empty threat in a game of politics .
no one really believes this will happen . "
the opinion of many of those living in the largely francophone but officially bilingual municipality of brussels is much the same as that of the majority of french-speakers in wallonia , including the region 's largest political party .
" this is not a new discussion , " a senior politician with humanist democratic centre -lrb- cdh -rrb- , a christian democratic party , told dw-world.de under the condition of anonymity .
" we have been talking along linguistic lines for over 50 years and the country is still together .
the regions are compatible , whatever people may say .
the cdh supports a unified belgium and will continue to do so .
we do n't foresee any changes in our ideology or the structure of our nation . "
flemish nationalism fuelling independence debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flemish nationalist parties have made gains in flanders however , the view from the north is quite different .
a recent poll in the flemish-language daily het laatste nieuws showed that 46.1 percent of flemings polled wanted belgium to split , compared to 49.6 percent who said they did n't .
" many flemings believe that a split would make them richer , " said buelens .
" every two months vlaams belang -lsb- a flemish nationalist party -rsb- sends out flyers saying that flemings pay enough towards wallonia to buy a walloon family a 15,000-euro car -lrb- $ 21,000 -rrb- every two years .
those who believe that believe that this money would go to them if the country was divided .
it is not as simple as that .
" it is like a child in a quarreling family , " he continued .
" if the parents row all the time , maybe the child thinks it would be better for them to divorce .
but it thinks this without any real knowledge of the consequences .
the child just thinks things would be better than the quarreling .
this is how it is in belgium . "
while the opinions of the people show just how complicated and diverse life in belgium can be , the final decision to split the country - should it come to that - will be made by the politicians .
but just how likely and how possible would it be to dissolve belgium ?
practical problems , lack of will make divorce unlikely " for a start it is really only a small part of the flemish political elite which favors a split , " said buelens .
" but the flemish have a larger federal presence , with about 60 percent of the population .
even so , there would have to be agreement on both sides of the divide to separate the country and we 've seen how hard it is to gain a consensus here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium is rife with political and linguistic divisions buelens believes that there are too many issues involved in breaking up the country to make it a viable option , from the payment of the national debt to the future of brussels .
but , he concluded , it was worth debating the idea as it could lead to the resolution of other long-standing problems in belgium .
" it 's good that the politicians are talking about this , " he said .
" this debate could lead to a reform of the regional structure which would make things fairer for everyone ; how power can be shared and distributed , how wealth and employment can be spread around the whole country . "
" it is better that they resolve their differences over 100 , 200 or even 300 days rather than take up arms against each other and decide it that way . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

prosperous flanders wants more autonomy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : split down the middle there has been tension between francophone , wallonia in the south and flanders in the north ever since belgium won its independence in 1830 . but the main problem with modern belgium as far as the flemings are concerned is that their more prosperous region has to continually prop up wallonia , a region which is poorer and has higher unemployment .
the flemings want wallonia to become more accountable and to keep more money in their wealthy dutch-speaking region .
this feeling of disparity has fuelled resurgence in flemish nationalism and , in turn , the rising success of flemish separatist parties . the stand-off has led to almost four months of stalemate over the formation of the government .
while belgian king albert ii has appointing a series of politicians with the unenviable job of hammering out a compromise and forming a coalition , each has so far failed .
" the problem is that we are still stuck in an electoral situation where any movement by one side or the other towards an agreement is seen as a sign of weakness , " johan buelens , a professor of political science at the free university of brussels , told dw-world.de.
" it 's like a game of political chicken .
who will blink first ? "
bildunterschrift : officially bilingual brussels aligns itself with wallonia brussels , wallonia see no reason for split the political split along linguistic lines has generated discussions in many quarters over a possible geographical separation of the nation .
while the general impression outside belgium is of a country on the verge of collapse , the people , at least those in the capital , are far more relaxed .
" this talk of separation comes only from the politicians , " said anne wilmots , a physiotherapist in the predominantly flemish quarter of woluwe sint pieters in brussels .
" the people , at least in brussels and wallonia , do n't want a split and do n't believe there will be one .
it is a tactic , an empty threat in a game of politics .
no one really believes this will happen . "
the opinion of many of those living in the largely francophone but officially bilingual municipality of brussels is much the same as that of the majority of french-speakers in wallonia , including the region 's largest political party .
" this is not a new discussion , " a senior politician with humanist democratic centre -lrb- cdh -rrb- , a christian democratic party , told dw-world.de under the condition of anonymity .
" we have been talking along linguistic lines for over 50 years and the country is still together .
the regions are compatible , whatever people may say .
the cdh supports a unified belgium and will continue to do so .
we do n't foresee any changes in our ideology or the structure of our nation . "
flemish nationalism fuelling independence debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flemish nationalist parties have made gains in flanders however , the view from the north is quite different .
a recent poll in the flemish-language daily het laatste nieuws showed that 46.1 percent of flemings polled wanted belgium to split , compared to 49.6 percent who said they did n't .
" many flemings believe that a split would make them richer , " said buelens .
" every two months vlaams belang -lsb- a flemish nationalist party -rsb- sends out flyers saying that flemings pay enough towards wallonia to buy a walloon family a 15,000-euro car -lrb- $ 21,000 -rrb- every two years .
those who believe that believe that this money would go to them if the country was divided .
it is not as simple as that .
" it is like a child in a quarreling family , " he continued .
" if the parents row all the time , maybe the child thinks it would be better for them to divorce .
but it thinks this without any real knowledge of the consequences .
the child just thinks things would be better than the quarreling .
this is how it is in belgium . "
while the opinions of the people show just how complicated and diverse life in belgium can be , the final decision to split the country - should it come to that - will be made by the politicians .
but just how likely and how possible would it be to dissolve belgium ?
practical problems , lack of will make divorce unlikely " for a start it is really only a small part of the flemish political elite which favors a split , " said buelens .
" but the flemish have a larger federal presence , with about 60 percent of the population .
even so , there would have to be agreement on both sides of the divide to separate the country and we 've seen how hard it is to gain a consensus here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium is rife with political and linguistic divisions buelens believes that there are too many issues involved in breaking up the country to make it a viable option , from the payment of the national debt to the future of brussels .

" it 's good that the politicians are talking about this , " he said .
" this debate could lead to a reform of the regional structure which would make things fairer for everyone ; how power can be shared and distributed , how wealth and employment can be spread around the whole country . "

bildunterschrift : officially bilingual brussels aligns itself with wallonia brussels , wallonia see no reason for split the political split along linguistic lines has generated discussions in many quarters over a possible geographical separation of the nation .
while the general impression outside belgium is of a country on the verge of collapse , the people , at least those in the capital , are far more relaxed .
" this talk of separation comes only from the politicians , " said anne wilmots , a physiotherapist in the predominantly flemish quarter of woluwe sint pieters in brussels .
" the people , at least in brussels and wallonia , do n't want a split and do n't believe there will be one .
it is a tactic , an empty threat in a game of politics .
no one really believes this will happen . "
the opinion of many of those living in the largely francophone but officially bilingual municipality of brussels is much the same as that of the majority of french-speakers in wallonia , including the region 's largest political party .
" this is not a new discussion , " a senior politician with humanist democratic centre -lrb- cdh -rrb- , a christian democratic party , told dw-world.de under the condition of anonymity .
" we have been talking along linguistic lines for over 50 years and the country is still together .
the regions are compatible , whatever people may say .

a recent poll in the flemish-language daily het laatste nieuws showed that 46.1 percent of flemings polled wanted belgium to split , compared to 49.6 percent who said they did n't .
" many flemings believe that a split would make them richer , " said buelens .
" every two months vlaams belang -lsb- a flemish nationalist party -rsb- sends out flyers saying that flemings pay enough towards wallonia to buy a walloon family a 15,000-euro car -lrb- $ 21,000 -rrb- every two years .
those who believe that believe that this money would go to them if the country was divided .
it is not as simple as that .
" it is like a child in a quarreling family , " he continued .
" if the parents row all the time , maybe the child thinks it would be better for them to divorce .
but it thinks this without any real knowledge of the consequences .
the child just thinks things would be better than the quarreling .
this is how it is in belgium . "
while the opinions of the people show just how complicated and diverse life in belgium can be , the final decision to split the country - should it come to that - will be made by the politicians .
but just how likely and how possible would it be to dissolve belgium ?
practical problems , lack of will make divorce unlikely " for a start it is really only a small part of the flemish political elite which favors a split , " said buelens .

while the flags do represent a show of national unity , it is a statement of allegiance not to a team but to the country itself .
the message in brussels is clear : " we are belgium ; we are one . "
the people of brussels are united behind the flag as the political crisis in belgium continues .
it is now 112 days since elections triggered a deadlock over more self-rule for belgium 's rival linguistic camps and set the dutch and french-speaking sides against each other in a complex row that doomsayers say could tear the country in two .
the belgian political system has been in paralysis since the june 10 election when the country 's christian democrats and liberals won a legislative majority to form a coalition government .
however , both sides then split into dutch and french-speaking parties with the dutch-speaking christian democrats and liberals demanding more autonomy for the northern flanders region .
the francophone politicians accuse the flemish of trying to split the country by demanding increasing independence for flanders , saying that the unity and structure of the state is at risk if the north gets more autonomy .
a bigger say for flanders in areas such as the economy and employment would effectively give the region the power of a small state , they argue , and would have a detrimental effect on the rest of the country .
prosperous flanders wants more autonomy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : split down the middle there has been tension between francophone , wallonia in the south and flanders in the north ever since belgium won its independence in 1830 . but the main problem with modern belgium as far as the flemings are concerned is that their more prosperous region has to continually prop up wallonia , a region which is poorer and has higher unemployment .
the flemings want wallonia to become more accountable and to keep more money in their wealthy dutch-speaking region .
this feeling of disparity has fuelled resurgence in flemish nationalism and , in turn , the rising success of flemish separatist parties . the stand-off has led to almost four months of stalemate over the formation of the government .
while belgian king albert ii has appointing a series of politicians with the unenviable job of hammering out a compromise and forming a coalition , each has so far failed .
" the problem is that we are still stuck in an electoral situation where any movement by one side or the other towards an agreement is seen as a sign of weakness , " johan buelens , a professor of political science at the free university of brussels , told dw-world.de.

2 , in a decision that could spell the beginning of the end of the high-technology venture touted as a rival to the us military 's global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- . galileo , which was supposed to be a showcase for europe 's technical prowess and be in place by 2008 , has stalled as cost overruns pile up , private contractors bicker and member states push their own industrial interests . after funding from a private , international consortium of eight companies involved in creating the satellite navigation system fell through , the eu said it would pump some 2.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- into the european space project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrot has found few supporters for his funding model " i am still convinced that europe needs galileo , " eu transport commissioner jacques barrot said on sept .
19 when he announced a funding plan to save the project .
" galileo is very important for the strategic autonomy of europe . " barrot has suggested the bailout money come from the billions worth of unspent agricultural funds that are returned to national coffers each year . germany to bear brunt of costs barrot 's proposal was initially given a tepid welcome by france , belgium , italy , luxembourg and spain .
germany , the eu 's largest net contributor , is openly opposed to the plan . " we can not support the suggestions proposed by the eu commission , " german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee said monday in an interview with die welt newspaper .
" germany will carry the main financial load .
that 's why the appropriate participation of german companies in galileo 's construction is a matter of course . " tiefensee has received the support of his colleagues in the economic ministry , which is against tapping the bloc 's agriculture budget for other projects . " on its own , the suggestion is coherent , but if you look at the political framework , it becomes very difficult to implement , " deputy economics minister joachim wuermeling said friday . time to decide ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with all the satellites circling the earth , some wonder if the eu needs its own a breakthrough on tuesday is not expected as both britain and the netherlands have also expressed their dissatisfaction with the eu juggling funds away from their intended purposes to pay for the satellite project . barrot has said if eu leaders could n't reach an agreement by the end of the year , the 27-member bloc would be forced to decide if it was prepared to let the project crash before it ever lifts off . while europe has remained divided over galileo , russia and china have been working on similar satellite projects , and the united states is updating its gps , already used widely in cars , boats and planes . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

her visit is to focus on a range of issues , including human rights , aids , economic cooperation and the political crisis in zimbabwe . deutsche welle spoke about merkel 's agenda on the africa tour with dominic johnson , an editor at germany 's taz newspaper and an expert on africa . deutsche welle : why did german chancellor angela merkel choose to go to ethiopia , south africa and liberia ? dominic johnson : south africa is the most obvious choice - it is the most important trading partner for germany in africa .
president thabo mbeki , the south african president , attended the g8 summit in heiligendamm in june .
south africa is going to host the soccer world cup in 2010 and there is a lot of cooperation between germany and south africa on that .
so , south africa is the natural place to go for a german chancellor . ethiopia is fairly obvious as well .
it is the head of the african union , the seat of the african union commission , where merkel will visit .

it 's already been announced that , following this africa trip , the german government will try to call an african economic summit to try to encourage german businesses , especially small businesses , to invest in africa , and we know that south africa and liberia are looking for more investments for reconstruction . what are some of the other issues that will be discussed ? one of them will be development aid .
the chancellor has said she will visit development projects in all three countries .
she mentioned her upcoming africa visit during her speech at the un global fund to fight aids conference in berlin last week and she made it clear that this is important to her as well .
so , there will be a lot of the traditional development issues , but there will also be a lot of business items on the agenda during talks .
and , of course , germany is still the president of the g8 , so it still has a political role to play and will be looking at liberia 's foreign debt and cooperation with the african union as a whole . interview : dagmar breitenbach -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

2 , in a decision that could spell the beginning of the end of the high-technology venture touted as a rival to the us military 's global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- . galileo , which was supposed to be a showcase for europe 's technical prowess and be in place by 2008 , has stalled as cost overruns pile up , private contractors bicker and member states push their own industrial interests . after funding from a private , international consortium of eight companies involved in creating the satellite navigation system fell through , the eu said it would pump some 2.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- into the european space project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrot has found few supporters for his funding model " i am still convinced that europe needs galileo , " eu transport commissioner jacques barrot said on sept .
19 when he announced a funding plan to save the project .
" galileo is very important for the strategic autonomy of europe . " barrot has suggested the bailout money come from the billions worth of unspent agricultural funds that are returned to national coffers each year . germany to bear brunt of costs barrot 's proposal was initially given a tepid welcome by france , belgium , italy , luxembourg and spain .
germany , the eu 's largest net contributor , is openly opposed to the plan . " we can not support the suggestions proposed by the eu commission , " german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee said monday in an interview with die welt newspaper .
" germany will carry the main financial load .
that 's why the appropriate participation of german companies in galileo 's construction is a matter of course . " tiefensee has received the support of his colleagues in the economic ministry , which is against tapping the bloc 's agriculture budget for other projects . " on its own , the suggestion is coherent , but if you look at the political framework , it becomes very difficult to implement , " deputy economics minister joachim wuermeling said friday . time to decide ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with all the satellites circling the earth , some wonder if the eu needs its own a breakthrough on tuesday is not expected as both britain and the netherlands have also expressed their dissatisfaction with the eu juggling funds away from their intended purposes to pay for the satellite project . barrot has said if eu leaders could n't reach an agreement by the end of the year , the 27-member bloc would be forced to decide if it was prepared to let the project crash before it ever lifts off . while europe has remained divided over galileo , russia and china have been working on similar satellite projects , and the united states is updating its gps , already used widely in cars , boats and planes . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

her visit is to focus on a range of issues , including human rights , aids , economic cooperation and the political crisis in zimbabwe . deutsche welle spoke about merkel 's agenda on the africa tour with dominic johnson , an editor at germany 's taz newspaper and an expert on africa . deutsche welle : why did german chancellor angela merkel choose to go to ethiopia , south africa and liberia ? dominic johnson : south africa is the most obvious choice - it is the most important trading partner for germany in africa .
president thabo mbeki , the south african president , attended the g8 summit in heiligendamm in june .
south africa is going to host the soccer world cup in 2010 and there is a lot of cooperation between germany and south africa on that .
so , south africa is the natural place to go for a german chancellor . ethiopia is fairly obvious as well .
it is the head of the african union , the seat of the african union commission , where merkel will visit .
it has become an obligatory stop for every german politician who goes to africa .
german president horst köhler was there recently , and cooperation is quite close . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel liberia is maybe less obvious .
it is a small country in west africa , not particularly important , but it is the only african country headed by a woman -lsb- president ellen johnson sirleaf -rsb- and chancellor merkel is the only female head of government in europe , so in a way , when the most powerful woman in europe goes to meet the most powerful woman in africa .
it 's a highly symbolic moment . there 's a large german business delegation that will be accompanying merkel , but surely business issues will not be the only ones on the agenda ? they wo n't be the only ones , but i think they 'll be quite important , even though they are n't being flagged at the moment .
it 's already been announced that , following this africa trip , the german government will try to call an african economic summit to try to encourage german businesses , especially small businesses , to invest in africa , and we know that south africa and liberia are looking for more investments for reconstruction . what are some of the other issues that will be discussed ? one of them will be development aid .
the chancellor has said she will visit development projects in all three countries .
she mentioned her upcoming africa visit during her speech at the un global fund to fight aids conference in berlin last week and she made it clear that this is important to her as well .
so , there will be a lot of the traditional development issues , but there will also be a lot of business items on the agenda during talks .
and , of course , germany is still the president of the g8 , so it still has a political role to play and will be looking at liberia 's foreign debt and cooperation with the african union as a whole . interview : dagmar breitenbach -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

her visit is to focus on a range of issues , including human rights , aids , economic cooperation and the political crisis in zimbabwe . deutsche welle spoke about merkel 's agenda on the africa tour with dominic johnson , an editor at germany 's taz newspaper and an expert on africa . deutsche welle : why did german chancellor angela merkel choose to go to ethiopia , south africa and liberia ? dominic johnson : south africa is the most obvious choice - it is the most important trading partner for germany in africa .
president thabo mbeki , the south african president , attended the g8 summit in heiligendamm in june .
south africa is going to host the soccer world cup in 2010 and there is a lot of cooperation between germany and south africa on that .
so , south africa is the natural place to go for a german chancellor . ethiopia is fairly obvious as well .
it is the head of the african union , the seat of the african union commission , where merkel will visit .
it has become an obligatory stop for every german politician who goes to africa .
german president horst köhler was there recently , and cooperation is quite close . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel liberia is maybe less obvious .
it is a small country in west africa , not particularly important , but it is the only african country headed by a woman -lsb- president ellen johnson sirleaf -rsb- and chancellor merkel is the only female head of government in europe , so in a way , when the most powerful woman in europe goes to meet the most powerful woman in africa .
it 's a highly symbolic moment . there 's a large german business delegation that will be accompanying merkel , but surely business issues will not be the only ones on the agenda ? they wo n't be the only ones , but i think they 'll be quite important , even though they are n't being flagged at the moment .
it 's already been announced that , following this africa trip , the german government will try to call an african economic summit to try to encourage german businesses , especially small businesses , to invest in africa , and we know that south africa and liberia are looking for more investments for reconstruction . what are some of the other issues that will be discussed ? one of them will be development aid .
the chancellor has said she will visit development projects in all three countries .
she mentioned her upcoming africa visit during her speech at the un global fund to fight aids conference in berlin last week and she made it clear that this is important to her as well .
so , there will be a lot of the traditional development issues , but there will also be a lot of business items on the agenda during talks .
and , of course , germany is still the president of the g8 , so it still has a political role to play and will be looking at liberia 's foreign debt and cooperation with the african union as a whole . interview : dagmar breitenbach -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 02.10.2007 new proposals let more people into eu , keep others out großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more countries are set to benefit from the schengen agreement while eu justice and interior ministers meeting in lisbon discussed tightening border controls of non-eu citizens , the bloc 's internal borderless travel zone is set to be extended . among the raft of new anti-terror measures up for discussion at the two-day informal meeting , which began monday , oct .
1 , was the use of new technology and the sharing of travelers ' data in the fight against terrorism .
eu justice and home affairs commissioner franco frattini called for a register of all non-eu citizens entering and leaving the 27-nation bloc , who would be electronically registered with biometric identifiers .
the register is " extremely necessary " in order to crack down on people who are granted permission to stay for a restricted time but disappear when the period expires , frattini explained , pointing to recent scares in germany , britain and denmark .
under his proposals , which will be published in november , law-enforcement officials in all member states would be allowed to share collected data with colleagues across the eu .
the scheme would operate alongside an airline passenger data recording system apparently modeled on one developed by the us .
officials said they were still debating whether to adopt the system for flights within eu as well as those to and from countries outside the union .
technological crackdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should radical web sites be blocked ?
much of the discussion was geared to finding ways of countering the use of the internet by militants , with participants debating issues such as censorship and freedom of expression .
frattini proposed a technological crackdown on terrorist activities , including a plan to set up a database to provide an early-warning system on lost or stolen explosives , and new provisions to deal with the misuse of the internet by terrorists .
frattini urged sanctions against web sites that disseminate terror propaganda or bomb-building instructions or engage in recruitment for terrorist groups , prompting concerns among ministers about privacy and civil liberties .
such web sites " have nothing to do with freedom of expression , " retaliated frattini , who said he was also considering proposing broader legal definition of conspiracy that would include people who support terrorist acts .
public concerns that european legislators might curb people 's individual freedoms in their attempts to prevent terrorism attacks on their territory were apparent at the press conference after monday 's meeting .
" if your question is whether a sort-of ' big brother ' is arising in europe and calling fundamental rights into question , then the answer is ' no , " ' said rui pereira , portugal 's interior minister , in response to a question , according to news agency dpa .
" but no member state , and the eu as a whole , can avoid fighting terrorism , " he added .
extending the schengen agreement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu justice and home affairs comissioner frattini also discussed was an extension to the eu 's borderless travel zone - as far east as the frontiers with ukraine and belarus - a week before christmas , two weeks ahead of schedule .
according to portuguese home affairs minister rui perreira , nine new member states are poised to join the schengen travel zone , abolishing all land and sea checks along their common borders , although checks at airports will continue until march .
" all of the tests that we have carried out confirm that by the end of the year we will be able to remove the frontiers , " said perreira .
the border-free " schengen " area now includes 13 eu countries , plus norway and iceland .
the latest countries involved are the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia .
cyprus , the 10th nation to join the eu in 2004 , has opted to keep some border checks for a further year .
" i think this will serve as a real incentive for citizens of the new member states to feel that they are full european citizens , " perreira said .
eu justice ministers will decide on giving the final go-ahead to the expansion of schengen during their meeting on nov .

this time round , he cast his net wider and took the opportunity to warn of the dangers of globalization , the " growing rift " between germany 's haves and the have-nots , and the need for greater regulation of international financial markets .
although köhler was generally viewed as a neo-liberal when he assumed office in 2004 , many saw monday 's talk as further proof of a perceived swing to the left .
ten years after then president roman herzog gave the very first berlin address and famously told the country that it needed to " jolt itself into action , " horst köhler echoed his predecessor 's plea for greater german openness and focused heavily on the issue of globalization and its consequences .
the risks of globalization " does globalization ultimately endanger our entire social model ? " he asked .
" the pressure of global competition is putting much to the test . … a large part of humanity continues to live in deepest poverty .
this has two main causes : not being able to share sufficiently in globalization - mainly because of a lack of economic power and good governance - and being disadvantaged by states and private players who pursue their own interests with no regard for others .
" those who live at the expense of others will at some stage be left standing alone , " he admonished .
but in keeping with the traditionally optimistic spirit of the presidential speeches , his message was broadly upbeat .

" germany is not an effective and future-oriented state based on social justice at present , " he said , pointing out that the country was witnessing a creeping divide between the rich and the poor .
" the inequality in the distribution of income in germany has increased . … job security has diminished and people 's working lives are subject to change and flux . ...

eu justice and home affairs commissioner franco frattini called for a register of all non-eu citizens entering and leaving the 27-nation bloc , who would be electronically registered with biometric identifiers .
the register is " extremely necessary " in order to crack down on people who are granted permission to stay for a restricted time but disappear when the period expires , frattini explained , pointing to recent scares in germany , britain and denmark .
under his proposals , which will be published in november , law-enforcement officials in all member states would be allowed to share collected data with colleagues across the eu .
the scheme would operate alongside an airline passenger data recording system apparently modeled on one developed by the us .

frattini proposed a technological crackdown on terrorist activities , including a plan to set up a database to provide an early-warning system on lost or stolen explosives , and new provisions to deal with the misuse of the internet by terrorists .
frattini urged sanctions against web sites that disseminate terror propaganda or bomb-building instructions or engage in recruitment for terrorist groups , prompting concerns among ministers about privacy and civil liberties .
such web sites " have nothing to do with freedom of expression , " retaliated frattini , who said he was also considering proposing broader legal definition of conspiracy that would include people who support terrorist acts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 02.10.2007 new proposals let more people into eu , keep others out großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more countries are set to benefit from the schengen agreement while eu justice and interior ministers meeting in lisbon discussed tightening border controls of non-eu citizens , the bloc 's internal borderless travel zone is set to be extended . among the raft of new anti-terror measures up for discussion at the two-day informal meeting , which began monday , oct .
1 , was the use of new technology and the sharing of travelers ' data in the fight against terrorism .
eu justice and home affairs commissioner franco frattini called for a register of all non-eu citizens entering and leaving the 27-nation bloc , who would be electronically registered with biometric identifiers .
the register is " extremely necessary " in order to crack down on people who are granted permission to stay for a restricted time but disappear when the period expires , frattini explained , pointing to recent scares in germany , britain and denmark .
under his proposals , which will be published in november , law-enforcement officials in all member states would be allowed to share collected data with colleagues across the eu .
the scheme would operate alongside an airline passenger data recording system apparently modeled on one developed by the us .
officials said they were still debating whether to adopt the system for flights within eu as well as those to and from countries outside the union .
technological crackdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should radical web sites be blocked ?
much of the discussion was geared to finding ways of countering the use of the internet by militants , with participants debating issues such as censorship and freedom of expression .
frattini proposed a technological crackdown on terrorist activities , including a plan to set up a database to provide an early-warning system on lost or stolen explosives , and new provisions to deal with the misuse of the internet by terrorists .
frattini urged sanctions against web sites that disseminate terror propaganda or bomb-building instructions or engage in recruitment for terrorist groups , prompting concerns among ministers about privacy and civil liberties .
such web sites " have nothing to do with freedom of expression , " retaliated frattini , who said he was also considering proposing broader legal definition of conspiracy that would include people who support terrorist acts .
public concerns that european legislators might curb people 's individual freedoms in their attempts to prevent terrorism attacks on their territory were apparent at the press conference after monday 's meeting .
" if your question is whether a sort-of ' big brother ' is arising in europe and calling fundamental rights into question , then the answer is ' no , " ' said rui pereira , portugal 's interior minister , in response to a question , according to news agency dpa .
" but no member state , and the eu as a whole , can avoid fighting terrorism , " he added .
extending the schengen agreement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu justice and home affairs comissioner frattini also discussed was an extension to the eu 's borderless travel zone - as far east as the frontiers with ukraine and belarus - a week before christmas , two weeks ahead of schedule .
according to portuguese home affairs minister rui perreira , nine new member states are poised to join the schengen travel zone , abolishing all land and sea checks along their common borders , although checks at airports will continue until march .
" all of the tests that we have carried out confirm that by the end of the year we will be able to remove the frontiers , " said perreira .
the border-free " schengen " area now includes 13 eu countries , plus norway and iceland .
the latest countries involved are the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia .
cyprus , the 10th nation to join the eu in 2004 , has opted to keep some border checks for a further year .
" i think this will serve as a real incentive for citizens of the new member states to feel that they are full european citizens , " perreira said .
eu justice ministers will decide on giving the final go-ahead to the expansion of schengen during their meeting on nov .

2 , he surprised many with statements that sounded positively left-leaning for a member of the conservative christian democratic party . last year , when köhler chose to concentrate on domestic education issues , his speech caused barely a ripple .
this time round , he cast his net wider and took the opportunity to warn of the dangers of globalization , the " growing rift " between germany 's haves and the have-nots , and the need for greater regulation of international financial markets .
although köhler was generally viewed as a neo-liberal when he assumed office in 2004 , many saw monday 's talk as further proof of a perceived swing to the left .
ten years after then president roman herzog gave the very first berlin address and famously told the country that it needed to " jolt itself into action , " horst köhler echoed his predecessor 's plea for greater german openness and focused heavily on the issue of globalization and its consequences .
the risks of globalization " does globalization ultimately endanger our entire social model ? " he asked .
" the pressure of global competition is putting much to the test . … a large part of humanity continues to live in deepest poverty .
this has two main causes : not being able to share sufficiently in globalization - mainly because of a lack of economic power and good governance - and being disadvantaged by states and private players who pursue their own interests with no regard for others .
" those who live at the expense of others will at some stage be left standing alone , " he admonished .
but in keeping with the traditionally optimistic spirit of the presidential speeches , his message was broadly upbeat .
" globalization is simply life , " he said .
" it has to be shaped through day-to-day work and imagination , through untiring efforts and cheerful enthusiasm .
it can change the world for the better . "
a social conscience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs to look after the weaker members of society köhler pulled more of a punch when it came to germany , raising many points underlying the social democrats ' new party agenda .
referring to many people 's fear of social destitution , he said germany needed to take better care of its workforce .
" germany is not an effective and future-oriented state based on social justice at present , " he said , pointing out that the country was witnessing a creeping divide between the rich and the poor .
" the inequality in the distribution of income in germany has increased . … job security has diminished and people 's working lives are subject to change and flux . ...
although germany 's broad middle class continues to do quite well , there is an increasing fear of social decline and many people from low-income and less well-educated backgrounds can not advance without assistance , " he said .
continuing the social theme , he reiterated the thrust of last year 's argument and said the country needed to improve school performance .
" germany 's education system is not performing as well as those of some other western industrialized states , " he argued .
in a further echo of social democratic values , he went on to call for greater regulation of global financial markets and proposed the international monetary fund europe increase the involvement of emerging economies and developing countries in its decision-making .
it was time , he said , that europe played a greater role on the international stage .

a social conscience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs to look after the weaker members of society köhler pulled more of a punch when it came to germany , raising many points underlying the social democrats ' new party agenda .
referring to many people 's fear of social destitution , he said germany needed to take better care of its workforce .
" germany is not an effective and future-oriented state based on social justice at present , " he said , pointing out that the country was witnessing a creeping divide between the rich and the poor .
" the inequality in the distribution of income in germany has increased . … job security has diminished and people 's working lives are subject to change and flux . ...
although germany 's broad middle class continues to do quite well , there is an increasing fear of social decline and many people from low-income and less well-educated backgrounds can not advance without assistance , " he said .
continuing the social theme , he reiterated the thrust of last year 's argument and said the country needed to improve school performance .
" germany 's education system is not performing as well as those of some other western industrialized states , " he argued .
in a further echo of social democratic values , he went on to call for greater regulation of global financial markets and proposed the international monetary fund europe increase the involvement of emerging economies and developing countries in its decision-making .
it was time , he said , that europe played a greater role on the international stage .
" i believe that the world expects more of us europeans than we are currently offering , " he said .
" the world would be poorer without the european perspective on things .
and it is therefore our duty to share this perspective with others . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 , was the use of new technology and the sharing of travelers ' data in the fight against terrorism .
eu justice and home affairs commissioner franco frattini called for a register of all non-eu citizens entering and leaving the 27-nation bloc , who would be electronically registered with biometric identifiers .
the register is " extremely necessary " in order to crack down on people who are granted permission to stay for a restricted time but disappear when the period expires , frattini explained , pointing to recent scares in germany , britain and denmark .
under his proposals , which will be published in november , law-enforcement officials in all member states would be allowed to share collected data with colleagues across the eu .
the scheme would operate alongside an airline passenger data recording system apparently modeled on one developed by the us .
officials said they were still debating whether to adopt the system for flights within eu as well as those to and from countries outside the union .
technological crackdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : should radical web sites be blocked ?
much of the discussion was geared to finding ways of countering the use of the internet by militants , with participants debating issues such as censorship and freedom of expression .
frattini proposed a technological crackdown on terrorist activities , including a plan to set up a database to provide an early-warning system on lost or stolen explosives , and new provisions to deal with the misuse of the internet by terrorists .
frattini urged sanctions against web sites that disseminate terror propaganda or bomb-building instructions or engage in recruitment for terrorist groups , prompting concerns among ministers about privacy and civil liberties .
such web sites " have nothing to do with freedom of expression , " retaliated frattini , who said he was also considering proposing broader legal definition of conspiracy that would include people who support terrorist acts .
public concerns that european legislators might curb people 's individual freedoms in their attempts to prevent terrorism attacks on their territory were apparent at the press conference after monday 's meeting .
" if your question is whether a sort-of ' big brother ' is arising in europe and calling fundamental rights into question , then the answer is ' no , " ' said rui pereira , portugal 's interior minister , in response to a question , according to news agency dpa .
" but no member state , and the eu as a whole , can avoid fighting terrorism , " he added .
extending the schengen agreement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu justice and home affairs comissioner frattini also discussed was an extension to the eu 's borderless travel zone - as far east as the frontiers with ukraine and belarus - a week before christmas , two weeks ahead of schedule .
according to portuguese home affairs minister rui perreira , nine new member states are poised to join the schengen travel zone , abolishing all land and sea checks along their common borders , although checks at airports will continue until march .
" all of the tests that we have carried out confirm that by the end of the year we will be able to remove the frontiers , " said perreira .
the border-free " schengen " area now includes 13 eu countries , plus norway and iceland .
the latest countries involved are the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia .
cyprus , the 10th nation to join the eu in 2004 , has opted to keep some border checks for a further year .
" i think this will serve as a real incentive for citizens of the new member states to feel that they are full european citizens , " perreira said .
eu justice ministers will decide on giving the final go-ahead to the expansion of schengen during their meeting on nov .

2 , in a decision that could spell the beginning of the end of the high-technology venture touted as a rival to the us military 's global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- . galileo , which was supposed to be a showcase for europe 's technical prowess and be in place by 2008 , has stalled as cost overruns pile up , private contractors bicker and member states push their own industrial interests . after funding from a private , international consortium of eight companies involved in creating the satellite navigation system fell through , the eu said it would pump some 2.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- into the european space project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrot has found few supporters for his funding model " i am still convinced that europe needs galileo , " eu transport commissioner jacques barrot said on sept .
19 when he announced a funding plan to save the project .
" galileo is very important for the strategic autonomy of europe . " barrot has suggested the bailout money come from the billions worth of unspent agricultural funds that are returned to national coffers each year . germany to bear brunt of costs barrot 's proposal was initially given a tepid welcome by france , belgium , italy , luxembourg and spain .
germany , the eu 's largest net contributor , is openly opposed to the plan . " we can not support the suggestions proposed by the eu commission , " german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee said monday in an interview with die welt newspaper .

2 , in a decision that could spell the beginning of the end of the high-technology venture touted as a rival to the us military 's global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- . galileo , which was supposed to be a showcase for europe 's technical prowess and be in place by 2008 , has stalled as cost overruns pile up , private contractors bicker and member states push their own industrial interests . after funding from a private , international consortium of eight companies involved in creating the satellite navigation system fell through , the eu said it would pump some 2.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- into the european space project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barrot has found few supporters for his funding model " i am still convinced that europe needs galileo , " eu transport commissioner jacques barrot said on sept .
19 when he announced a funding plan to save the project .
" galileo is very important for the strategic autonomy of europe . " barrot has suggested the bailout money come from the billions worth of unspent agricultural funds that are returned to national coffers each year . germany to bear brunt of costs barrot 's proposal was initially given a tepid welcome by france , belgium , italy , luxembourg and spain .
germany , the eu 's largest net contributor , is openly opposed to the plan . " we can not support the suggestions proposed by the eu commission , " german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee said monday in an interview with die welt newspaper .
" germany will carry the main financial load .
that 's why the appropriate participation of german companies in galileo 's construction is a matter of course .

while the flags do represent a show of national unity , it is a statement of allegiance not to a team but to the country itself .
the message in brussels is clear : " we are belgium ; we are one . "
the people of brussels are united behind the flag as the political crisis in belgium continues .
it is now 112 days since elections triggered a deadlock over more self-rule for belgium 's rival linguistic camps and set the dutch and french-speaking sides against each other in a complex row that doomsayers say could tear the country in two .
the belgian political system has been in paralysis since the june 10 election when the country 's christian democrats and liberals won a legislative majority to form a coalition government .
however , both sides then split into dutch and french-speaking parties with the dutch-speaking christian democrats and liberals demanding more autonomy for the northern flanders region .
the francophone politicians accuse the flemish of trying to split the country by demanding increasing independence for flanders , saying that the unity and structure of the state is at risk if the north gets more autonomy .
a bigger say for flanders in areas such as the economy and employment would effectively give the region the power of a small state , they argue , and would have a detrimental effect on the rest of the country .
prosperous flanders wants more autonomy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : split down the middle there has been tension between francophone , wallonia in the south and flanders in the north ever since belgium won its independence in 1830 . but the main problem with modern belgium as far as the flemings are concerned is that their more prosperous region has to continually prop up wallonia , a region which is poorer and has higher unemployment .
the flemings want wallonia to become more accountable and to keep more money in their wealthy dutch-speaking region .
this feeling of disparity has fuelled resurgence in flemish nationalism and , in turn , the rising success of flemish separatist parties . the stand-off has led to almost four months of stalemate over the formation of the government .
while belgian king albert ii has appointing a series of politicians with the unenviable job of hammering out a compromise and forming a coalition , each has so far failed .
" the problem is that we are still stuck in an electoral situation where any movement by one side or the other towards an agreement is seen as a sign of weakness , " johan buelens , a professor of political science at the free university of brussels , told dw-world.de.
" it 's like a game of political chicken .
who will blink first ? "
bildunterschrift : officially bilingual brussels aligns itself with wallonia brussels , wallonia see no reason for split the political split along linguistic lines has generated discussions in many quarters over a possible geographical separation of the nation .
while the general impression outside belgium is of a country on the verge of collapse , the people , at least those in the capital , are far more relaxed .
" this talk of separation comes only from the politicians , " said anne wilmots , a physiotherapist in the predominantly flemish quarter of woluwe sint pieters in brussels .
" the people , at least in brussels and wallonia , do n't want a split and do n't believe there will be one .
it is a tactic , an empty threat in a game of politics .
no one really believes this will happen . "
the opinion of many of those living in the largely francophone but officially bilingual municipality of brussels is much the same as that of the majority of french-speakers in wallonia , including the region 's largest political party .
" this is not a new discussion , " a senior politician with humanist democratic centre -lrb- cdh -rrb- , a christian democratic party , told dw-world.de under the condition of anonymity .
" we have been talking along linguistic lines for over 50 years and the country is still together .
the regions are compatible , whatever people may say .
the cdh supports a unified belgium and will continue to do so .
we do n't foresee any changes in our ideology or the structure of our nation . "
flemish nationalism fuelling independence debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flemish nationalist parties have made gains in flanders however , the view from the north is quite different .
a recent poll in the flemish-language daily het laatste nieuws showed that 46.1 percent of flemings polled wanted belgium to split , compared to 49.6 percent who said they did n't .
" many flemings believe that a split would make them richer , " said buelens .
" every two months vlaams belang -lsb- a flemish nationalist party -rsb- sends out flyers saying that flemings pay enough towards wallonia to buy a walloon family a 15,000-euro car -lrb- $ 21,000 -rrb- every two years .
those who believe that believe that this money would go to them if the country was divided .
it is not as simple as that .
" it is like a child in a quarreling family , " he continued .
" if the parents row all the time , maybe the child thinks it would be better for them to divorce .
but it thinks this without any real knowledge of the consequences .
the child just thinks things would be better than the quarreling .
this is how it is in belgium . "
while the opinions of the people show just how complicated and diverse life in belgium can be , the final decision to split the country - should it come to that - will be made by the politicians .
but just how likely and how possible would it be to dissolve belgium ?
practical problems , lack of will make divorce unlikely " for a start it is really only a small part of the flemish political elite which favors a split , " said buelens .
" but the flemish have a larger federal presence , with about 60 percent of the population .
even so , there would have to be agreement on both sides of the divide to separate the country and we 've seen how hard it is to gain a consensus here . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium is rife with political and linguistic divisions buelens believes that there are too many issues involved in breaking up the country to make it a viable option , from the payment of the national debt to the future of brussels .
but , he concluded , it was worth debating the idea as it could lead to the resolution of other long-standing problems in belgium .
" it 's good that the politicians are talking about this , " he said .
" this debate could lead to a reform of the regional structure which would make things fairer for everyone ; how power can be shared and distributed , how wealth and employment can be spread around the whole country . "
" it is better that they resolve their differences over 100 , 200 or even 300 days rather than take up arms against each other and decide it that way . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- ebay cuts back its value of skype bbc news / business graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- business contents : your money -pipe- economy companies tuesday , 2 october 2007 , 06:16 gmt 07:16 uk ebay cuts back its value of skype ebay has conceded that it paid too much for internet telephony service skype - dramatically writing down the value of its investment .
the online auction firm said skype was worth $ 900m -lrb- £ 450m -rrb- less than it paid for it and set aside $ 530m to meet future pay-outs to some shareholders .
together that amounts to a loss of value of $ 1.43bn , compared to the $ 2.6bn price paid for skype in 2005 .
skype founders niklas zennstrom and janus friis have quit as executives .

the 39-year-old , who was not injured , said he was being followed by a photographer when the accident happened near his home in sydney , australia .
" i sped up , and in an effort to elude an oncoming car , which was making an illegal u-turn , saw no choice but to drop my bike , " he said in a statement .
urban added that his pursuer came to his assistance " without taking photos " .
the new zealand-born singer , who grew up in australia , completed a three-month stint in rehabilitation for alcohol abuse earlier this year .
he checked himself into the betty ford center in rancho mirage , california , last october , less than four months after his wedding to actress nicole kidman .
while in the clinic he missed the release of his latest album , love , pain and the whole crazy thing , and was not present to accept his second male vocalist of the year honour at the country music association awards .
the singer put his accident down to " one person 's desire to do his job and my desire to maintain my privacy . "

kevin federline , who had been sharing joint custody with the star , will now take full responsibility of sean preston , two , and jayden james , one , until further notice given from the court .
spears 's parenting skills were called into question last month when a judge in los angeles ordered her to undergo drug and alcohol tests twice a week .
a former bodyguard has also spoken out , claiming the singer is a danger to her children .
it is just the latest disaster to have struck the pop star after a string of public spats , paparazzi run-ins and family feuds .
the 25-year-old was also recently charged with hit-and-run after an incident in an la car park , and dropped by her management company .
the princess of pop , who shaved her head in front of onlookers in february , appears to be losing control of her empire .
the singer 's recent performance at the mtv video music awards definitely helped fuel the scathing headlines .
britney 's latest haircut was snapped by paparazzi britney 's makeover her first major performance in three years had been billed as her big comeback .
but the stumbling dance routine and struggle to lip-sync left many wondering if spears 's much-vaunted return was over before it began .
the singer 's troubles began last november , when she filed for divorce from her husband kevin federline , citing " irreconcilable differences " .
many fans , who had barely concealed their contempt for federline , thought the split would mark a re-birth for spears - whose recording career had been on hold since the 2004 marriage .
instead , she embarked on a prolonged period of partying with other young celebrities , including heiress paris hilton .
she also drew a storm of criticism for paparazzi photographs which seemed to show her without underwear .
in february , several us media outlets reported spears had checked in to a rehabilitation centre in the caribbean .
britney spears was only 17 when she made global success but she left after just 24 hours and the paparazzi tracked her down to a los angeles tattoo parlour - where they discovered she was completely bald .
squeaky-clean spears 's erratic behaviour is a far cry from the squeaky-clean image she presented on the all new mickey mouse club in 1994 .
the show led to a deal with jive records and she shot to global fame with her debut single , baby one more time , in 1998 .
helped by a raunchy video , featuring the 17-year-old dressed in school uniform , the single topped the charts on both sides of the atlantic .

she also courted the tabloids at the 2003 mtv awards , where she locked lips with madonna during a risque performance of like a virgin .

spears ' relationships attract intense media interest britney singing shortly before her divorce , spears gave a rambling television interview , in which she tearfully proclaimed her marriage " awesome " , and blamed the media for making her an " emotional wreck " .
recent events show the pop star is still struggling with her public image .

kevin federline , who had been sharing joint custody with the star , will now take full responsibility of sean preston , two , and jayden james , one , until further notice given from the court .
spears 's parenting skills were called into question last month when a judge in los angeles ordered her to undergo drug and alcohol tests twice a week .
a former bodyguard has also spoken out , claiming the singer is a danger to her children .
it is just the latest disaster to have struck the pop star after a string of public spats , paparazzi run-ins and family feuds .
the 25-year-old was also recently charged with hit-and-run after an incident in an la car park , and dropped by her management company .
the princess of pop , who shaved her head in front of onlookers in february , appears to be losing control of her empire .
the singer 's recent performance at the mtv video music awards definitely helped fuel the scathing headlines .

many fans , who had barely concealed their contempt for federline , thought the split would mark a re-birth for spears - whose recording career had been on hold since the 2004 marriage .
instead , she embarked on a prolonged period of partying with other young celebrities , including heiress paris hilton .
she also drew a storm of criticism for paparazzi photographs which seemed to show her without underwear .

britney spears was only 17 when she made global success but she left after just 24 hours and the paparazzi tracked her down to a los angeles tattoo parlour - where they discovered she was completely bald .
squeaky-clean spears 's erratic behaviour is a far cry from the squeaky-clean image she presented on the all new mickey mouse club in 1994 .
the show led to a deal with jive records and she shot to global fame with her debut single , baby one more time , in 1998 .
helped by a raunchy video , featuring the 17-year-old dressed in school uniform , the single topped the charts on both sides of the atlantic .

bbc director general mark thompson said sherrin , who died at home in chelsea , south-west london , would be remembered with " affection and gratitude " .
" i am deeply saddened by the news of the death of ned sherrin , " mr thompson said .

sherrin joined the bbc as a producer on the tonight programme sherrin was born into a farming family in somerset in 1931 and became involved in the theatre whilst reading law at oxford university .

fellow broadcaster stephen fry paid tribute to his friend and colleague .
" i remember him as a man of exquisite taste and pleasure in life , " he said .
" a man who in many ways resembled a gigantic cat who found an enormous vat of cream . "
" he inspired immense affection , partly because he was very old-fashioned - despite the fact that he might be regarded as single-handedly responsible for the end of deference and the beginning of the attacks on the establishment that marked the 60s . "
comedian arthur smith , a regular guest on loose ends , recalled sherrin as " a man who went out there and grabbed life " .

" he was an impresario as well as a great raconteur .
