but can the french- and flemish-speaking parts of the country truly get along ? the breakthrough came when a centre-left party from french-speaking belgium agreed to join a coalition led by acting prime minister guy verhofstadt .
an interim , five-party government coalition could be formed by the end of the week .
the alliance includes christian democrats and liberals from both parts of belgium as well as francophone socialists .
the agreement puts a temporary end to the political gridlock that has kept belgium without a government since june 10 , when a national election failed to yield a clear winner .
belgium 's nominal head of state king albert ii had asked verhofstadt to try to form an alliance to overcome the stalemate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although voted out of power in june , verhofstadt is again in charge " the prime minister has unblocked the situation , " said a spokesman for verhofstadt .
if a new government passes a parliamentary vote of confidence , it would only govern until march 23 , at which point flemish christian democrat leader yves leterme would take over .
but it would be able to pass a budget for the coming year and take decisions on other pressing issues ranging from inflation to security .
" for europe , this means the crisis is over for belgium , " said long-serving finance minister didier reynders , head of the french-speaking liberals - one of the five coalition parties . deep divisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two halves of belgium at often at odds the split between flemish and wallonian -lrb- french-speaking -rrb- belgians is both cultural and economic .
flemish speakers , who account for some 58 percent of the population , have traditionally squabbled with their francophone countrymen over the relationship of belgium 's two main languages .
the conflict has hindered long overdue reforms of the belgian state .
the more affluent flemish north of the country also wants to devolve control of the labor market and corporate tax rates from the national to the regional level .
french-speaking wallonia , where unemployment runs twice as high as in flemish-speaking flanders , fears that the northern belgian region would use such powers to lure companies away from the south with lower corporate tax rates .
the impasse has given rise to speculations that the 177-year-old state could split in two .
but an opinion poll published on monday showed that the vast majority of belgians wanted the country to remain intact . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but , that did n't stop the german translation from cracking the 2007 bestseller lists .
he talked about prussia 's appeal . dw-world.de : are you surprised that an academic book on prussia could make the german bestseller lists ? christopher clark : i certainly did n't expect success on that level .
i think it 's a case of timing .
the fall of the berlin wall and german re-unification have triggered a process of re-imagining the german past in general and prussia in particular .
so much of what was left of the old prussian state was in former communist east germany , so it was kind of locked away .
with the re-unification of germany , it all became visible and got reconnected to the larger german national entity .
that and the opening up of archives of the former east germany prompted a rethink .
let 's try to sum up your thesis .
prussia was a relatively enlightened , progressive state that inadvertently destroyed itself when it enlisted the force of german nationalism .
is that close ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prussian culture , including architecture , blossomed in the 19th century that 's exactly it .
nationalism was prussia 's downfall .
in older historical literature , nationalism was seen as the culmination of prussian history .
prussia 's task in history had been to create the german nation .
just as we today tend to see the rise of the third reich in 1933 as the end of an era and explain how germany got to that point , previous generations tried to explain how german history had got to 1871 and the creation of the german empire .
and the answer was that prussia was the steering , shaping and sometimes manipulative power that would bring the german nation into existence .
the emergence of the german nation is the thing that gives meaning to the whole history of prussia . that , in my view , is completely and utterly wrong .
throughout its history prussia had been the most un-national state you can imagine , partly because it contained such large numbers of non-germans , but also because the whole idea of its existence was that of the sovereign , monarchical state , interwoven with the idea of the sovereignty of law . these were ideas that had nothing to do with the uprising of a national movement .
prussia responded very hostilely to early german nationalism because the hohenzollern rulers rightly recognized that it would act like a kind of corrosive acid eating away at everything the prussian state stood for . it was only during the unstable period of the 1850s , 60s and 70s that prussian statesmen , particularly prussian prime minister and german chancellor otto von bismarck , began to imagine that they could tame nationalism .
but that was something they failed to do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hohenzollern kings ruled first prussia , then germany from 1701 to 1918 you mention bismarck .
he plays less of a role in your book than in most works of prussian history .
why is that ? in some ways i think bismarck turned his back on prussia .
king friedrich wilhelm iv of prussia said in 1848 : " prussia will be henceforth merged into germany . "
and i think he got it right that the process of national consolidation that bismarck saw as a continuation of prussian security policy would ultimately not prussianize germany , but germanize prussia , and that everything the old prussia stood for would be lost .
so in some ways i see bismarck as the first executor of a kind of closing-down sale of prussia and prussian tradition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historian christopher clark says prussia was never the bad guy of europe but was n't nationalism something inevitable that was going to happen sooner or later ?
or can one imagine a scenario in which prussia would still exist today ? that 's a really good question and a difficult one to answer .
although historians usually rear up in horror at the notion , i think it was probably inevitable .
if you think about the other multi-national states that existed in the 19th century , russia , for example , or the austro-hungarian empire , both of them disappeared in the course of the world war i and were replaced by something radically different .
it seems to me that these pre-national , multi-ethnic commonwealths that were such a feature of europe in the early modern period were probably doomed to go under . let 's backtrack now and talk about the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries and prussia under friedrich the great .
you describe especially the prussian capital berlin as a vibrant , even libidinous place during his reign .
would you have liked to live there ? i think there would have been wonderful things about being in berlin in the 1780s and 90s .
berlin , if you compare it with london or paris , has the reputation of being boring .
but , that does n't mean berlin was dead or lacked an urbane identity .
and this identity was not driven by the projection of power through the dynasty and its monumental public buildings .
the new culture that emerged was driven by voluntary impulses from civil society .
there was a proliferation of clubs and organizations for all sorts of purposes - cultivating the sciences , for instance , or looking at economical ways of using fuel .
there were literary societies and freemason lodges .
it was an endless cornucopia of little voluntary initiatives .
the point i was trying to make is that this created a city that was n't just about courts or courtliness but about courtesy and civility of a very middle-class , bourgeois kind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arrogance of emperor wilhelm ii and his generals led to defeat in world war i many historians draw links between prussia and nazism .
although no one would claim prussia was the cradle of the ideology , some people see connections between prussian militarism and subservience and the third reich .
but , you portray prussia more as a source of opposition . if it were true that prussia created an environment that deadened the will of ordinary citizens and turned them into instruments of state power , thereby blazing a trail for a totalitarian dictatorship in which people would do anything they were told , it would be very easy to test that hypothesis .
all you 'd have to show is that germans of prussian provenance made better and more obedient nazis than people from austria , baden-württemberg and so on .
if that had been the case , it would be more than obvious .
but it is n't .
there is simply no evidence .
on the contrary , people from baden-württemberg and especially austria made for equally keen nazis , with austrians , for example , being hugely overrepresented in the machinery of nazi genocide .
it 's just simply not the case that you can map out a relationship between prussia and nazism that made people into better tools of the regime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president paul von hindenburg appointed hitler as chancellor in 1933 of course , prussia is implicated in the story of the events that brought hitler to power .
the old prussian elites played a key role in cooking up the plan to put hitler into power as german chancellor in 1933 .
not because they wanted the third reich , but because they thought they could use hitler in a kind of conservative coup against the weimar republic .
of course , they were disastrously wrong .
the corporate arrogance of the prussian nobility helps to explain why some perfectly intelligent people failed to recognize the danger hitler presented . but national socialism was in many respects the exact opposite pole of prussiandom .
the old prussian state had been about the authority of government and the rule of law , but the new nazi reich was about the people .
it was an ethnic entity .
the nazis did n't care about laws .
to them , laws were utterly secondary .
what mattered was the führer as the expression of the will of the volk .
this was an idea that had no precedent in prussian history whatsoever .
so i see a very strong antipathy between the two forms of state . christopher clark is senior lecturer in modern european history at st. catharine 's college , university of cambridge . interview by jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern germany -pipe- 19.12.2007 east germany forges path independent of west , says minister großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tiefensee grew up in communist east germany germany 's eastern states are n't out to mimic the west , german minister wolfgang tiefensee told deutsche welle .
but solving chronic high unemployment and xenophobic tendencies may take a while . deutsche welle : minister tiefensee , you not only serve as transport minister but also oversee the development of eastern germany .
what are your duties in this position ? wolfgang tiefensee : the new german states are still a part of our country that requires special attention and devotion .
that 's why the government has set up a post to coordinate these tasks .
the commissioner works together with ministers from all departments - labor market policy , economic policy , education , research and many other areas are all important for eastern germany .
the commissioner coordinates , gives ideas and advocates the interests of the new states . germany 's reunification happened in 1990 .
how much longer will it be necessary to have a commissioner of this kind ? i think it makes sense to coordinate these tasks .
they are connected , and i think the job will exist for a while .
financial support for the eastern states continues until 2019 - perhaps that 's the point by which things will have to have normalized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany is becoming a leader in renewable energies , said tiefensee will the standards of living in the east and west be similar by then ? actually , in the eastern states , we do n't want to imitate the western ones or become like other western european cities .
it 's more about taking a similar approach in the east and west to the challenges that confront germany and europe .
the pre-existing conditions vary .
i think that the eastern states have a natural advantage - especially in new industrial sectors like renewable energy , it and biotechnology , for example . investing late in new sectors means a more modern approach to investing , and that 's already become apparent .
as far as renewable energy goes , every second job in germany is in eastern germany . nevertheless , unemployment in the new states is still twice as high as in western germany .
when do you think this will even out ? that 's the most difficult question .
in the eastern states , unemployment is way above 13 percent , while it 's at 6 percent in the western states .
in addition , those without jobs in eastern germany are unemployed for long periods of time - for 12 or even 24 months - and get stuck in this chronic unemployment with no chance of breaking back into the job market . how long will this continue ?
we have to think long-term , because chronic unemployment can only be reduced very slowly .
the eastern regions of the new states are experiencing an economic upswing .
but this has n't yet had enough of an effect on the job market .
i think it will take at least another 10 years to reduce unemployment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremism has a larger following in eastern germany people from minority or foreign backgrounds tend to shy away from the eastern states .
some decide not to work or study there because they 're afraid of being assaulted by neo-nazis .
can you understand these concerns ? yes , unfortunately it is the case that the number of xenophobic crimes is higher in the east than in the west .
on the other hand , the big cities and many of the medium-sized cities are great places for foreigners to study or work as engineers or skilled laborers . many people actually prefer the eastern german states because they can also be particularly hospitable .
this is left over from communist east germany , when people had a totally different way of interacting with each other . there are many initiatives in place that are committed to breaking down xenophobia .
often , because there are too few foreigners , people often do n't know what they 're talking about and arrive at negative judgments .
if the number of foreign residents were to increase gradually , then i 'm sure that reservations about them would gradually decrease . you mentioned traditional hospitality in the east .
does eastern germany have a different value system than western germany ? i do n't think so , but of course 40 years of the gdr did n't go by without having an effect on the population and on individuals .
for 40 years , we could n't travel where we wanted to .
studying abroad was out of the question .
we could n't freely organize clubs or political parties like people in the western states and in western europe could .
all of that has left its mark . on the other hand , we ca n't forget that these were the people - just like in poland or czechoslovakia - who prepared the peaceful revolution and the globalchange that came with it .
the forces involved developed under a dictatorship , and the will to create something is still evident today .
people are very happy about finally being able to take responsibility . i do n't think that 's a different value system , particularly since the younger generation is assimilating anyway . interview : miodrag soric -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and that , he told dw-world , is all he wants from his german club . dw-world.de : oliver kahn got himself suspended from the last league game of 2007 and has feuded with much of the squad .
could you see yourself taking over from him as bayern 's regular captain ?
lucio : i would n't dream of becoming bayern munich 's captain .
it 's not my life 's goal , and i would n't fight for the position .
as far as i 'm concerned there 'll be no squabbling with my teammates over it .
the coach decides who 's captain .
i wo n't lie and say it would n't be flattering to be singled out for this responsibility , but i 'm not concerned with having a special status - that means nothing to me .
i 'll keep on the way i always have .
i 'm not looking to inherit the captaincy .
but you have served as bayern 's captain for the odd game .
did you not like it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strikers beware - lucio is one of the league most hard-nosed defenders of course it was a great experience .
but it did n't change me or the way i work with the team .
the best part was the feeling that the coach trusts me , that he and the team have faith in me .
in the period when i was captain , the atmosphere was great , really relaxed .
the team assistants and physiotherapists were in a good mood , always making jokes with me .
is the position first and foremost a matter of discipline ?
discipline is important , but a captain needs other qualities as well .
he has to lead by example .
he has to be someone who works hard , who shows respect for the coach and his teammates and who always gives his best for the club .
at bayern i 've always stood for these qualities .
that 's why i was allowed to be captain on occasion .
but as the captain of the brazilian national team , you surely must feel you 're entitled to the same position at bayern munich .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strikers beware - lucio is one of the league most hard-nosed defenders of course it was a great experience .

is the position first and foremost a matter of discipline ?
discipline is important , but a captain needs other qualities as well .
he has to lead by example .
he has to be someone who works hard , who shows respect for the coach and his teammates and who always gives his best for the club .

turkey came a small step closer towards european union membership on wednesday , dec .

ankara seized the opportunity to attack some states ' attempts to block its entry . this means that six chapters have been opened until now .
to conclude the accession process , talks have to be completed in thirty-five different fields . speaking after a different meeting in brussels , the eu commissioner in charge of enlargement , finland 's olli rehn , said that all member states had reaffirmed their wish to see accession talks continue , adding that the opening of the two chapters on wednesday should be taken as proof that " the eu sticks to its commitments and keeps its word . " ankara began eu entry talks in 2005 , but they have moved forward very slowly because of rows over cyprus and human rights .
eight negotiating chapters have been blocked since the end of last year because of turkey 's refusal to open its ports and airports to traffic from eu member cyprus .
turkey 's negotiations are expected to last at least a decade , with no guarantee of membership at the end of it all .

" it is obvious that certain eu member states are trying to erode political and legal aspects of the accession process , " he said .
babacan did not name any names , but french prime minister nicolas sarkozy has been leading the lobby to keep turkey out of the european union . he favors a special partnership with the mainly muslim country instead of full membership .
babacan also stressed that all eu heads of state had agreed in december 2004 to the start of accession talks with turkey .
he said a change of government should not have an impact on this promise .

turkey came a small step closer towards european union membership on wednesday , dec .
19 , starting negotiations on two new policy areas .
ankara seized the opportunity to attack some states ' attempts to block its entry . this means that six chapters have been opened until now .
to conclude the accession process , talks have to be completed in thirty-five different fields . speaking after a different meeting in brussels , the eu commissioner in charge of enlargement , finland 's olli rehn , said that all member states had reaffirmed their wish to see accession talks continue , adding that the opening of the two chapters on wednesday should be taken as proof that " the eu sticks to its commitments and keeps its word . " ankara began eu entry talks in 2005 , but they have moved forward very slowly because of rows over cyprus and human rights .
eight negotiating chapters have been blocked since the end of last year because of turkey 's refusal to open its ports and airports to traffic from eu member cyprus .
turkey 's negotiations are expected to last at least a decade , with no guarantee of membership at the end of it all .
ankara criticizes blocking maneuver bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french prime minister is the most vociferous opponent of turkish membership after the formal opening of talks on health and consumer protection and trans-european transport networks , turkish foreign minister ali babacan criticized attempts by individual eu member states to block turkey 's entry bid .
" it is obvious that certain eu member states are trying to erode political and legal aspects of the accession process , " he said .
babacan did not name any names , but french prime minister nicolas sarkozy has been leading the lobby to keep turkey out of the european union . he favors a special partnership with the mainly muslim country instead of full membership .
babacan also stressed that all eu heads of state had agreed in december 2004 to the start of accession talks with turkey .
he said a change of government should not have an impact on this promise .
" we expect all eu member states to stick to that , " he said .
eu states look into the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu member states are divided over whether turkey belongs in the bloc at last friday 's eu summit , members agreed to create a group to study the long-term future of europe .
european union leaders named former spanish prime minister felipe gonzales , a past critic of turkey 's entry bid , to head the group .
a spokesman said gonzales had modified his position and now says the eu should honor any commitments it has made to turkey .
spain , britain , italy and sweden are among the eu states keenest to keep its membership bid on track .

19 .
western countries have offered their help to the breakaway province . serbia and kosovo were at loggerheads at a united nations security council meeting in new york .
kosovo 's 90-percent albanian majority is ready to declare independence within weeks , but serbia insists that the province must remain part of its territory . neither side was willing to compromise during wednesday 's meeting . " the potential for a negotiated solution is now exhausted , " a joint statement by eu ambassadors on the security council and the united states said following the meeting . the us and key european union nations back kosovo 's call for independence , and have pledged their future support . but on wednesday , russia said it stood behind its close ally serbia 's call for further negotiations on autonomy for the province . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the presence of un police , clashes still occur in kosovo the us and eu statement said that as irreconcilable efforts stand in the way , " the eu stands ready to play a leading role in implementing a settlement defining kosovo 's future status . " listening to both sides the 15-member security council met in a closed-door session to hear serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica and kosovo 's president fatmir sejdiu make their respective cases . it was the first council debate since a " troika " of mediators - the eu , russia and the united states - said on dec .
10 that four months of talks between belgrade and kosovo 's albanian separatists had failed to reach a compromise on the issue of sovereignty . kostunica said that a unilateral declaration of independence supported by western nations would undermine the un charter and mark the beginning of a new era " in which might is above right . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : live goes on in pristina he said it would trigger a " serious crisis , " but did not comment on what action serbia might take . sejdiu , president of the un-run province , told the council that the collapse of the former yugoslavia was " one of the great tragedies of the modern era . " " we are exhausted after nearly two decades of isolation , war and political limbo , " he said , referring to the ethnic cleansing of kosovo albanians in the 1990s .
he stressed that co-existence of serbia and kosovo in the same state was impossible . still in limbo wednesday 's meeting ended with no action taken - which the eu and the united states said was equivalent to closing the door on un efforts to resolve the province 's status . last week , eu leaders said they were prepared to send around 1,800 police and prosecutors to kosovo as part of a un proposal to grant the province " supervised independence . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former un mediator for kosovo , martti ahtisaari at the same time , eu leaders also offered serbia " accelerated " entry into the european union . russia has said that the eu police mission would be illegal without un approval , but western diplomats at the united nations refuted that notion . in april , then un special envoy martti ahtisaari presented a plan offering kosovo " supervised independence . " under the proposal , international agencies would guide kosovo toward full independence and membership to the united nations .
the agencies , however , would also have the power to prevent the province from merging with albania as well as keep serb areas from splitting off to become part of serbia . western ambassadors have said that un security council resolution 1244 - passed after nato pushed serbian forces out of kosovo in 1999 - allowed for the implementation of ahtisaari 's plan . many serbs consider kosovo the cultural cradle of their identity .
the province has been administered by the united nations since 1999 , when nato ended serbia 's crackdown on and ethnic cleansing of separatist ethnic-albanians . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

19 .
western countries have offered their help to the breakaway province . serbia and kosovo were at loggerheads at a united nations security council meeting in new york .
kosovo 's 90-percent albanian majority is ready to declare independence within weeks , but serbia insists that the province must remain part of its territory . neither side was willing to compromise during wednesday 's meeting . " the potential for a negotiated solution is now exhausted , " a joint statement by eu ambassadors on the security council and the united states said following the meeting . the us and key european union nations back kosovo 's call for independence , and have pledged their future support . but on wednesday , russia said it stood behind its close ally serbia 's call for further negotiations on autonomy for the province . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the presence of un police , clashes still occur in kosovo the us and eu statement said that as irreconcilable efforts stand in the way , " the eu stands ready to play a leading role in implementing a settlement defining kosovo 's future status . " listening to both sides the 15-member security council met in a closed-door session to hear serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica and kosovo 's president fatmir sejdiu make their respective cases . it was the first council debate since a " troika " of mediators - the eu , russia and the united states - said on dec .
10 that four months of talks between belgrade and kosovo 's albanian separatists had failed to reach a compromise on the issue of sovereignty . kostunica said that a unilateral declaration of independence supported by western nations would undermine the un charter and mark the beginning of a new era " in which might is above right . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : live goes on in pristina he said it would trigger a " serious crisis , " but did not comment on what action serbia might take . sejdiu , president of the un-run province , told the council that the collapse of the former yugoslavia was " one of the great tragedies of the modern era . " " we are exhausted after nearly two decades of isolation , war and political limbo , " he said , referring to the ethnic cleansing of kosovo albanians in the 1990s .
he stressed that co-existence of serbia and kosovo in the same state was impossible . still in limbo wednesday 's meeting ended with no action taken - which the eu and the united states said was equivalent to closing the door on un efforts to resolve the province 's status . last week , eu leaders said they were prepared to send around 1,800 police and prosecutors to kosovo as part of a un proposal to grant the province " supervised independence . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former un mediator for kosovo , martti ahtisaari at the same time , eu leaders also offered serbia " accelerated " entry into the european union . russia has said that the eu police mission would be illegal without un approval , but western diplomats at the united nations refuted that notion . in april , then un special envoy martti ahtisaari presented a plan offering kosovo " supervised independence . " under the proposal , international agencies would guide kosovo toward full independence and membership to the united nations .
the agencies , however , would also have the power to prevent the province from merging with albania as well as keep serb areas from splitting off to become part of serbia . western ambassadors have said that un security council resolution 1244 - passed after nato pushed serbian forces out of kosovo in 1999 - allowed for the implementation of ahtisaari 's plan . many serbs consider kosovo the cultural cradle of their identity .
the province has been administered by the united nations since 1999 , when nato ended serbia 's crackdown on and ethnic cleansing of separatist ethnic-albanians . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the measures are intended to curb global warming . under the plans , automobile manufacturers would have to reduce carbon emissions produced by their fleets of passenger cars to an average of 120 grams per kilometer by 2012 .
currently , new cars emit some 160 grams on average . should they not comply to the guidelines , automakers are to face steep fines . with several commissioners dissenting , the european commission - the eu 's executive arm - agreed on a four-year phase-in period from 2012 for the fines . " this will send a strong signal to the world about the determination of the european union to take bold measures on climate change , " eu environment commissioner stavros dimas said at a press conference . germany says the plan will not be effective the proposed legislation enraged germany and its carmakers .

steg said that the plans would threaten jobs , hinder innovation and fail to be an effective instrument for climate protection .
environment minister sigmar gabriel also slammed the proposals , saying that they favored italian and french car makers .
speaking on german television , he criticized the fact that the limits would apply to a car manufacturers ' fleet , meaning that a manufacturer such as fiat with its numerous small models would not have to cut the emissions of its high-end cars .
according to the european commission 's plans , penalties on companies will start at 20 euros -lrb- $ 29 -rrb- per excess gram of co2 and rise to 95 euros in 2016 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 19.12.2007 all-star german band puts sgt. pepper 's on stage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the beatles made it , but it took a bunch of germans to put it on stage the beatles never performed their most famous album live .
to rectify that , film director wolfgang becker has formed a band to play sgt. pepper 's lonely hearts club band from start to finish .
but do they pull it off ? four decades on from the release in 1967 of what is arguably the most famous album in pop music , " sgt. pepper 's lonely hearts club band " was set to be performed live at a large musical theater in central berlin on wednesday night .
the concert was the brainchild of german film director and beatles ' fanatic wolfgang becker , best known for his international hit " goodbye lenin . "
it 's the end result of an idea that grew beyond all proportions .
" originally , the plan was to just play acoustically in someone 's kitchen , " becker told dw-world .
" then we thought we 'd do it in a bar .
but it just kept growing and growing . "
and grown it has .
becker 's band now consists of dozens of musicians - some professionals , some gifted amateurs - including directorial colleague tom tykwer .
a forty-person choir sings background vocals , and indian musicians have been enlisted to play george harrison 's raga-inflected " within you , without you . "
with a little help from his friends bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang becker has taken beatlemania to new extremes the ensemble first performed the record at a private party in a berlin club this summer .
word of the gig spread , and a local radio station contacted becker about playing it in public as part of the station 's anniversary celebrations .
" i 'm not really nervous , " becker said ahead of the gig .
" but when people are paying money to get in , you do feel a different sense of responsibility . "
the musicians begin with the title track and continue on through the fab four 's psychedelic opus , concluding with what some consider lennon and mccartney 's finest composition , " a day in life . "
the band 's musical co-leader niko weidemann said playing the full record presents some unusual challenges .
" the individual songs are not all that difficult to play , but if you look at it as a total work , it can be tricky , " he said .
" we listened to the original album , and what we heard was how the beatles really pushed the limits with the restricted means at their disposal .
they never intended to perform the record live - it 's a studio production full of overdubs .
but when it is played live on stage by a big band with a brass section and a choir , it 's really fantastic . "
the one and only billy shears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a four-piece band , there was no way the beatles could perform sgt. pepper 's live whether becker 's band is authentic is anyone 's guess .
but there 's something fittingly ironic about a group of latter-day fab four fanatics covering a concept record about a fictional band as played by the beatles .
and the performance suggests that had the liverpool quartet played " pepper 's " live , it might well have rocked - a good thing since becker has invested considerable time and money in the project .
" if you go to wolfgang 's home , it 's absolutely full of beatles ' records , posters and memoriabilia , " said adrian kennedy , a dw-tv producer and on-air personality who serves as the emcee .
" i do n't think he 's making any money from it .
it 's just for the love of the music . "
even more ironically , " sgt. pepper 's " is n't even becker 's favorite beatles album .
" no , that would be ' revolver ' , " becker said .

to rectify that , film director wolfgang becker has formed a band to play sgt. pepper 's lonely hearts club band from start to finish .
but do they pull it off ? four decades on from the release in 1967 of what is arguably the most famous album in pop music , " sgt. pepper 's lonely hearts club band " was set to be performed live at a large musical theater in central berlin on wednesday night .
the concert was the brainchild of german film director and beatles ' fanatic wolfgang becker , best known for his international hit " goodbye lenin . "
it 's the end result of an idea that grew beyond all proportions .
" originally , the plan was to just play acoustically in someone 's kitchen , " becker told dw-world .
" then we thought we 'd do it in a bar .
but it just kept growing and growing . "
and grown it has .
becker 's band now consists of dozens of musicians - some professionals , some gifted amateurs - including directorial colleague tom tykwer .
a forty-person choir sings background vocals , and indian musicians have been enlisted to play george harrison 's raga-inflected " within you , without you . "
with a little help from his friends bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang becker has taken beatlemania to new extremes the ensemble first performed the record at a private party in a berlin club this summer .
word of the gig spread , and a local radio station contacted becker about playing it in public as part of the station 's anniversary celebrations .
" i 'm not really nervous , " becker said ahead of the gig .
" but when people are paying money to get in , you do feel a different sense of responsibility . "
the musicians begin with the title track and continue on through the fab four 's psychedelic opus , concluding with what some consider lennon and mccartney 's finest composition , " a day in life . "
the band 's musical co-leader niko weidemann said playing the full record presents some unusual challenges .
" the individual songs are not all that difficult to play , but if you look at it as a total work , it can be tricky , " he said .
" we listened to the original album , and what we heard was how the beatles really pushed the limits with the restricted means at their disposal .
they never intended to perform the record live - it 's a studio production full of overdubs .
but when it is played live on stage by a big band with a brass section and a choir , it 's really fantastic . "
the one and only billy shears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a four-piece band , there was no way the beatles could perform sgt. pepper 's live whether becker 's band is authentic is anyone 's guess .
but there 's something fittingly ironic about a group of latter-day fab four fanatics covering a concept record about a fictional band as played by the beatles .
and the performance suggests that had the liverpool quartet played " pepper 's " live , it might well have rocked - a good thing since becker has invested considerable time and money in the project .
" if you go to wolfgang 's home , it 's absolutely full of beatles ' records , posters and memoriabilia , " said adrian kennedy , a dw-tv producer and on-air personality who serves as the emcee .
" i do n't think he 's making any money from it .
it 's just for the love of the music . "
even more ironically , " sgt. pepper 's " is n't even becker 's favorite beatles album .

but putting on a band-aid now wo n't help later , says dw 's karl zawadzky . 2006 was the best year so far in the business cycle .
germany 's economic performance climbed 2.9 percent - the strongest growth in six years .
this year , economic growth is at 2.5 percent . there is a close connection between the growth rates in 2006 and 2007 .
due to the drastic three-percent hike on added-value tax on jan .
1 , many consumers pushed up the purchase of more expensive items - from cars to home decoration items to computers , so it 's no surprise that the 2006 boom could n't continue into 2007 . the tax increase is no longer an issue , but there are plenty of other factors disrupting the economy . us real estate crisis leaves lasting mark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the us , the upswing that followed the real estate and mortgage crisis is now losing steam .
but , it 's even worse : many already see the specter of a recession in the us .
that dampens the mood world-wide since the us is by far the largest economy and a key player in the global financial system . the mortgage crisis hurt business for banks around the world .
everyone wanted to make a profit with the bad mortgages and they all lost - not just the american banks , but also large swiss banks and german savings banks . once again , greed conquered reason .
the result will burden the economy for some time to come . then there are high oil prices and the expensive euro .
the scarcity of raw materials around the world , in part due to strong demand in china , is also driving prices up .
rising prices detract from consumers ' purchasing power and they 're holding on to their money - which , in turn , weakens demand . exports and foreign investment are up nevertheless , " the german economy continues to experience a solid upswing , " said the german federal bank in its most recent report on the state of the economy . there are good reasons for this .
all over the world - especially in the resource-rich emerging nations with high export receipts and , in some cases , huge foreign currency reserves - investments are being made in infrastructure and industry , and the new wealth is being vigorously consumed . germany delivers more high-quality goods than any other country , whether they are machines , manufacturing plants , luxury cars or top-end food products .
what 's more , companies in germany not only have a suitable range of export products , but also offer excellent service . during the last few years of economic decline at home , companies expanded immensely on the world market , which is now paying off .
as a result , not only have exports hit a record high but domestic investment is booming as well , as many companies adjust their production capacity to meet increased demand . otherwise strong economy hurt by external factors however , the economic slump in the us , the problems with the banks , the high oil prices and the expensive euro have dragged down the economy 's upward slope .
respectively , the federal bank has predicted 1.9 percent growth in 2008 , while some economic research institutions foresee only 1.5 to 1.6 percent . hence , the upturn will continue , just with considerably less gusto . no one can reliably predict whether the economy will rebound again in 2009 or whether the current economic cycle is already drawing to a close .
on the one hand , the german economy is resting on a much stronger foundation than in earlier years , but on the other hand , the rising inflation rate is increasingly becoming a reason for concern . in november , price inflation was 3.1 percent higher than what it had been a year earlier , which is significantly greater than the two-percent window tolerated by the european central bank . the currency guardians should respond with an interest rate increase , but that 's not possible due to the bank crisis .
instead , central banks around the world are pumping billions and billions into circulation , which only intensifies inflationary tendencies . what may seem necessary today can strangle the economic upswing in the mid-term . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but putting on a band-aid now wo n't help later , says dw 's karl zawadzky . 2006 was the best year so far in the business cycle .
germany 's economic performance climbed 2.9 percent - the strongest growth in six years .
this year , economic growth is at 2.5 percent . there is a close connection between the growth rates in 2006 and 2007 .
due to the drastic three-percent hike on added-value tax on jan .
1 , many consumers pushed up the purchase of more expensive items - from cars to home decoration items to computers , so it 's no surprise that the 2006 boom could n't continue into 2007 . the tax increase is no longer an issue , but there are plenty of other factors disrupting the economy . us real estate crisis leaves lasting mark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the us , the upswing that followed the real estate and mortgage crisis is now losing steam .
but , it 's even worse : many already see the specter of a recession in the us .
that dampens the mood world-wide since the us is by far the largest economy and a key player in the global financial system . the mortgage crisis hurt business for banks around the world .
everyone wanted to make a profit with the bad mortgages and they all lost - not just the american banks , but also large swiss banks and german savings banks . once again , greed conquered reason .
the result will burden the economy for some time to come . then there are high oil prices and the expensive euro .
the scarcity of raw materials around the world , in part due to strong demand in china , is also driving prices up .
rising prices detract from consumers ' purchasing power and they 're holding on to their money - which , in turn , weakens demand . exports and foreign investment are up nevertheless , " the german economy continues to experience a solid upswing , " said the german federal bank in its most recent report on the state of the economy . there are good reasons for this .
all over the world - especially in the resource-rich emerging nations with high export receipts and , in some cases , huge foreign currency reserves - investments are being made in infrastructure and industry , and the new wealth is being vigorously consumed . germany delivers more high-quality goods than any other country , whether they are machines , manufacturing plants , luxury cars or top-end food products .
what 's more , companies in germany not only have a suitable range of export products , but also offer excellent service . during the last few years of economic decline at home , companies expanded immensely on the world market , which is now paying off .
as a result , not only have exports hit a record high but domestic investment is booming as well , as many companies adjust their production capacity to meet increased demand . otherwise strong economy hurt by external factors however , the economic slump in the us , the problems with the banks , the high oil prices and the expensive euro have dragged down the economy 's upward slope .
respectively , the federal bank has predicted 1.9 percent growth in 2008 , while some economic research institutions foresee only 1.5 to 1.6 percent . hence , the upturn will continue , just with considerably less gusto . no one can reliably predict whether the economy will rebound again in 2009 or whether the current economic cycle is already drawing to a close .
on the one hand , the german economy is resting on a much stronger foundation than in earlier years , but on the other hand , the rising inflation rate is increasingly becoming a reason for concern . in november , price inflation was 3.1 percent higher than what it had been a year earlier , which is significantly greater than the two-percent window tolerated by the european central bank . the currency guardians should respond with an interest rate increase , but that 's not possible due to the bank crisis .
instead , central banks around the world are pumping billions and billions into circulation , which only intensifies inflationary tendencies . what may seem necessary today can strangle the economic upswing in the mid-term . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but , that did n't stop the german translation from cracking the 2007 bestseller lists .
he talked about prussia 's appeal . dw-world.de : are you surprised that an academic book on prussia could make the german bestseller lists ? christopher clark : i certainly did n't expect success on that level .
i think it 's a case of timing .
the fall of the berlin wall and german re-unification have triggered a process of re-imagining the german past in general and prussia in particular .
so much of what was left of the old prussian state was in former communist east germany , so it was kind of locked away .
with the re-unification of germany , it all became visible and got reconnected to the larger german national entity .
that and the opening up of archives of the former east germany prompted a rethink .
let 's try to sum up your thesis .
prussia was a relatively enlightened , progressive state that inadvertently destroyed itself when it enlisted the force of german nationalism .
is that close ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prussian culture , including architecture , blossomed in the 19th century that 's exactly it .
nationalism was prussia 's downfall .
in older historical literature , nationalism was seen as the culmination of prussian history .
prussia 's task in history had been to create the german nation .
just as we today tend to see the rise of the third reich in 1933 as the end of an era and explain how germany got to that point , previous generations tried to explain how german history had got to 1871 and the creation of the german empire .
and the answer was that prussia was the steering , shaping and sometimes manipulative power that would bring the german nation into existence .
the emergence of the german nation is the thing that gives meaning to the whole history of prussia . that , in my view , is completely and utterly wrong .
throughout its history prussia had been the most un-national state you can imagine , partly because it contained such large numbers of non-germans , but also because the whole idea of its existence was that of the sovereign , monarchical state , interwoven with the idea of the sovereignty of law . these were ideas that had nothing to do with the uprising of a national movement .
prussia responded very hostilely to early german nationalism because the hohenzollern rulers rightly recognized that it would act like a kind of corrosive acid eating away at everything the prussian state stood for . it was only during the unstable period of the 1850s , 60s and 70s that prussian statesmen , particularly prussian prime minister and german chancellor otto von bismarck , began to imagine that they could tame nationalism .
but that was something they failed to do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hohenzollern kings ruled first prussia , then germany from 1701 to 1918 you mention bismarck .
he plays less of a role in your book than in most works of prussian history .
why is that ? in some ways i think bismarck turned his back on prussia .
king friedrich wilhelm iv of prussia said in 1848 : " prussia will be henceforth merged into germany . "
and i think he got it right that the process of national consolidation that bismarck saw as a continuation of prussian security policy would ultimately not prussianize germany , but germanize prussia , and that everything the old prussia stood for would be lost .
so in some ways i see bismarck as the first executor of a kind of closing-down sale of prussia and prussian tradition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historian christopher clark says prussia was never the bad guy of europe but was n't nationalism something inevitable that was going to happen sooner or later ?
or can one imagine a scenario in which prussia would still exist today ? that 's a really good question and a difficult one to answer .
although historians usually rear up in horror at the notion , i think it was probably inevitable .
if you think about the other multi-national states that existed in the 19th century , russia , for example , or the austro-hungarian empire , both of them disappeared in the course of the world war i and were replaced by something radically different .
it seems to me that these pre-national , multi-ethnic commonwealths that were such a feature of europe in the early modern period were probably doomed to go under . let 's backtrack now and talk about the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries and prussia under friedrich the great .
you describe especially the prussian capital berlin as a vibrant , even libidinous place during his reign .
would you have liked to live there ? i think there would have been wonderful things about being in berlin in the 1780s and 90s .
berlin , if you compare it with london or paris , has the reputation of being boring .
but , that does n't mean berlin was dead or lacked an urbane identity .
and this identity was not driven by the projection of power through the dynasty and its monumental public buildings .
the new culture that emerged was driven by voluntary impulses from civil society .
there was a proliferation of clubs and organizations for all sorts of purposes - cultivating the sciences , for instance , or looking at economical ways of using fuel .
there were literary societies and freemason lodges .
it was an endless cornucopia of little voluntary initiatives .
the point i was trying to make is that this created a city that was n't just about courts or courtliness but about courtesy and civility of a very middle-class , bourgeois kind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arrogance of emperor wilhelm ii and his generals led to defeat in world war i many historians draw links between prussia and nazism .
although no one would claim prussia was the cradle of the ideology , some people see connections between prussian militarism and subservience and the third reich .
but , you portray prussia more as a source of opposition . if it were true that prussia created an environment that deadened the will of ordinary citizens and turned them into instruments of state power , thereby blazing a trail for a totalitarian dictatorship in which people would do anything they were told , it would be very easy to test that hypothesis .
all you 'd have to show is that germans of prussian provenance made better and more obedient nazis than people from austria , baden-württemberg and so on .
if that had been the case , it would be more than obvious .
but it is n't .
there is simply no evidence .
on the contrary , people from baden-württemberg and especially austria made for equally keen nazis , with austrians , for example , being hugely overrepresented in the machinery of nazi genocide .
it 's just simply not the case that you can map out a relationship between prussia and nazism that made people into better tools of the regime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president paul von hindenburg appointed hitler as chancellor in 1933 of course , prussia is implicated in the story of the events that brought hitler to power .
the old prussian elites played a key role in cooking up the plan to put hitler into power as german chancellor in 1933 .
not because they wanted the third reich , but because they thought they could use hitler in a kind of conservative coup against the weimar republic .
of course , they were disastrously wrong .
the corporate arrogance of the prussian nobility helps to explain why some perfectly intelligent people failed to recognize the danger hitler presented . but national socialism was in many respects the exact opposite pole of prussiandom .
the old prussian state had been about the authority of government and the rule of law , but the new nazi reich was about the people .
it was an ethnic entity .
the nazis did n't care about laws .
to them , laws were utterly secondary .
what mattered was the führer as the expression of the will of the volk .
this was an idea that had no precedent in prussian history whatsoever .
so i see a very strong antipathy between the two forms of state . christopher clark is senior lecturer in modern european history at st. catharine 's college , university of cambridge . interview by jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but , that did n't stop the german translation from cracking the 2007 bestseller lists .
he talked about prussia 's appeal . dw-world.de : are you surprised that an academic book on prussia could make the german bestseller lists ? christopher clark : i certainly did n't expect success on that level .
i think it 's a case of timing .
the fall of the berlin wall and german re-unification have triggered a process of re-imagining the german past in general and prussia in particular .
so much of what was left of the old prussian state was in former communist east germany , so it was kind of locked away .
with the re-unification of germany , it all became visible and got reconnected to the larger german national entity .
that and the opening up of archives of the former east germany prompted a rethink .
let 's try to sum up your thesis .
prussia was a relatively enlightened , progressive state that inadvertently destroyed itself when it enlisted the force of german nationalism .
is that close ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prussian culture , including architecture , blossomed in the 19th century that 's exactly it .
nationalism was prussia 's downfall .
in older historical literature , nationalism was seen as the culmination of prussian history .
prussia 's task in history had been to create the german nation .
just as we today tend to see the rise of the third reich in 1933 as the end of an era and explain how germany got to that point , previous generations tried to explain how german history had got to 1871 and the creation of the german empire .
and the answer was that prussia was the steering , shaping and sometimes manipulative power that would bring the german nation into existence .
the emergence of the german nation is the thing that gives meaning to the whole history of prussia . that , in my view , is completely and utterly wrong .
throughout its history prussia had been the most un-national state you can imagine , partly because it contained such large numbers of non-germans , but also because the whole idea of its existence was that of the sovereign , monarchical state , interwoven with the idea of the sovereignty of law . these were ideas that had nothing to do with the uprising of a national movement .
prussia responded very hostilely to early german nationalism because the hohenzollern rulers rightly recognized that it would act like a kind of corrosive acid eating away at everything the prussian state stood for . it was only during the unstable period of the 1850s , 60s and 70s that prussian statesmen , particularly prussian prime minister and german chancellor otto von bismarck , began to imagine that they could tame nationalism .
but that was something they failed to do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hohenzollern kings ruled first prussia , then germany from 1701 to 1918 you mention bismarck .
he plays less of a role in your book than in most works of prussian history .
why is that ? in some ways i think bismarck turned his back on prussia .
king friedrich wilhelm iv of prussia said in 1848 : " prussia will be henceforth merged into germany . "
and i think he got it right that the process of national consolidation that bismarck saw as a continuation of prussian security policy would ultimately not prussianize germany , but germanize prussia , and that everything the old prussia stood for would be lost .
so in some ways i see bismarck as the first executor of a kind of closing-down sale of prussia and prussian tradition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historian christopher clark says prussia was never the bad guy of europe but was n't nationalism something inevitable that was going to happen sooner or later ?
or can one imagine a scenario in which prussia would still exist today ? that 's a really good question and a difficult one to answer .
although historians usually rear up in horror at the notion , i think it was probably inevitable .
if you think about the other multi-national states that existed in the 19th century , russia , for example , or the austro-hungarian empire , both of them disappeared in the course of the world war i and were replaced by something radically different .
it seems to me that these pre-national , multi-ethnic commonwealths that were such a feature of europe in the early modern period were probably doomed to go under . let 's backtrack now and talk about the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries and prussia under friedrich the great .
you describe especially the prussian capital berlin as a vibrant , even libidinous place during his reign .
would you have liked to live there ? i think there would have been wonderful things about being in berlin in the 1780s and 90s .
berlin , if you compare it with london or paris , has the reputation of being boring .
but , that does n't mean berlin was dead or lacked an urbane identity .
and this identity was not driven by the projection of power through the dynasty and its monumental public buildings .
the new culture that emerged was driven by voluntary impulses from civil society .
there was a proliferation of clubs and organizations for all sorts of purposes - cultivating the sciences , for instance , or looking at economical ways of using fuel .
there were literary societies and freemason lodges .
it was an endless cornucopia of little voluntary initiatives .
the point i was trying to make is that this created a city that was n't just about courts or courtliness but about courtesy and civility of a very middle-class , bourgeois kind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arrogance of emperor wilhelm ii and his generals led to defeat in world war i many historians draw links between prussia and nazism .
although no one would claim prussia was the cradle of the ideology , some people see connections between prussian militarism and subservience and the third reich .
but , you portray prussia more as a source of opposition . if it were true that prussia created an environment that deadened the will of ordinary citizens and turned them into instruments of state power , thereby blazing a trail for a totalitarian dictatorship in which people would do anything they were told , it would be very easy to test that hypothesis .
all you 'd have to show is that germans of prussian provenance made better and more obedient nazis than people from austria , baden-württemberg and so on .
if that had been the case , it would be more than obvious .
but it is n't .
there is simply no evidence .
on the contrary , people from baden-württemberg and especially austria made for equally keen nazis , with austrians , for example , being hugely overrepresented in the machinery of nazi genocide .
it 's just simply not the case that you can map out a relationship between prussia and nazism that made people into better tools of the regime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president paul von hindenburg appointed hitler as chancellor in 1933 of course , prussia is implicated in the story of the events that brought hitler to power .
the old prussian elites played a key role in cooking up the plan to put hitler into power as german chancellor in 1933 .
not because they wanted the third reich , but because they thought they could use hitler in a kind of conservative coup against the weimar republic .
of course , they were disastrously wrong .
the corporate arrogance of the prussian nobility helps to explain why some perfectly intelligent people failed to recognize the danger hitler presented . but national socialism was in many respects the exact opposite pole of prussiandom .
the old prussian state had been about the authority of government and the rule of law , but the new nazi reich was about the people .
it was an ethnic entity .
the nazis did n't care about laws .
to them , laws were utterly secondary .
what mattered was the führer as the expression of the will of the volk .
this was an idea that had no precedent in prussian history whatsoever .
so i see a very strong antipathy between the two forms of state . christopher clark is senior lecturer in modern european history at st. catharine 's college , university of cambridge . interview by jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

19 .
western countries have offered their help to the breakaway province . serbia and kosovo were at loggerheads at a united nations security council meeting in new york .
kosovo 's 90-percent albanian majority is ready to declare independence within weeks , but serbia insists that the province must remain part of its territory . neither side was willing to compromise during wednesday 's meeting . " the potential for a negotiated solution is now exhausted , " a joint statement by eu ambassadors on the security council and the united states said following the meeting . the us and key european union nations back kosovo 's call for independence , and have pledged their future support . but on wednesday , russia said it stood behind its close ally serbia 's call for further negotiations on autonomy for the province . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the presence of un police , clashes still occur in kosovo the us and eu statement said that as irreconcilable efforts stand in the way , " the eu stands ready to play a leading role in implementing a settlement defining kosovo 's future status . " listening to both sides the 15-member security council met in a closed-door session to hear serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica and kosovo 's president fatmir sejdiu make their respective cases . it was the first council debate since a " troika " of mediators - the eu , russia and the united states - said on dec .
10 that four months of talks between belgrade and kosovo 's albanian separatists had failed to reach a compromise on the issue of sovereignty . kostunica said that a unilateral declaration of independence supported by western nations would undermine the un charter and mark the beginning of a new era " in which might is above right . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : live goes on in pristina he said it would trigger a " serious crisis , " but did not comment on what action serbia might take . sejdiu , president of the un-run province , told the council that the collapse of the former yugoslavia was " one of the great tragedies of the modern era . " " we are exhausted after nearly two decades of isolation , war and political limbo , " he said , referring to the ethnic cleansing of kosovo albanians in the 1990s .
he stressed that co-existence of serbia and kosovo in the same state was impossible . still in limbo wednesday 's meeting ended with no action taken - which the eu and the united states said was equivalent to closing the door on un efforts to resolve the province 's status . last week , eu leaders said they were prepared to send around 1,800 police and prosecutors to kosovo as part of a un proposal to grant the province " supervised independence . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former un mediator for kosovo , martti ahtisaari at the same time , eu leaders also offered serbia " accelerated " entry into the european union . russia has said that the eu police mission would be illegal without un approval , but western diplomats at the united nations refuted that notion . in april , then un special envoy martti ahtisaari presented a plan offering kosovo " supervised independence . " under the proposal , international agencies would guide kosovo toward full independence and membership to the united nations .
the agencies , however , would also have the power to prevent the province from merging with albania as well as keep serb areas from splitting off to become part of serbia . western ambassadors have said that un security council resolution 1244 - passed after nato pushed serbian forces out of kosovo in 1999 - allowed for the implementation of ahtisaari 's plan . many serbs consider kosovo the cultural cradle of their identity .
the province has been administered by the united nations since 1999 , when nato ended serbia 's crackdown on and ethnic cleansing of separatist ethnic-albanians . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the pre-existing conditions vary .
i think that the eastern states have a natural advantage - especially in new industrial sectors like renewable energy , it and biotechnology , for example . investing late in new sectors means a more modern approach to investing , and that 's already become apparent .
as far as renewable energy goes , every second job in germany is in eastern germany . nevertheless , unemployment in the new states is still twice as high as in western germany .

in addition , those without jobs in eastern germany are unemployed for long periods of time - for 12 or even 24 months - and get stuck in this chronic unemployment with no chance of breaking back into the job market . how long will this continue ?
we have to think long-term , because chronic unemployment can only be reduced very slowly .

but , that did n't stop the german translation from cracking the 2007 bestseller lists .
he talked about prussia 's appeal . dw-world.de : are you surprised that an academic book on prussia could make the german bestseller lists ? christopher clark : i certainly did n't expect success on that level .
i think it 's a case of timing .
the fall of the berlin wall and german re-unification have triggered a process of re-imagining the german past in general and prussia in particular .
so much of what was left of the old prussian state was in former communist east germany , so it was kind of locked away .
with the re-unification of germany , it all became visible and got reconnected to the larger german national entity .
that and the opening up of archives of the former east germany prompted a rethink .
let 's try to sum up your thesis .
prussia was a relatively enlightened , progressive state that inadvertently destroyed itself when it enlisted the force of german nationalism .
is that close ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prussian culture , including architecture , blossomed in the 19th century that 's exactly it .
nationalism was prussia 's downfall .
in older historical literature , nationalism was seen as the culmination of prussian history .
prussia 's task in history had been to create the german nation .
just as we today tend to see the rise of the third reich in 1933 as the end of an era and explain how germany got to that point , previous generations tried to explain how german history had got to 1871 and the creation of the german empire .
and the answer was that prussia was the steering , shaping and sometimes manipulative power that would bring the german nation into existence .
the emergence of the german nation is the thing that gives meaning to the whole history of prussia . that , in my view , is completely and utterly wrong .
throughout its history prussia had been the most un-national state you can imagine , partly because it contained such large numbers of non-germans , but also because the whole idea of its existence was that of the sovereign , monarchical state , interwoven with the idea of the sovereignty of law . these were ideas that had nothing to do with the uprising of a national movement .
prussia responded very hostilely to early german nationalism because the hohenzollern rulers rightly recognized that it would act like a kind of corrosive acid eating away at everything the prussian state stood for . it was only during the unstable period of the 1850s , 60s and 70s that prussian statesmen , particularly prussian prime minister and german chancellor otto von bismarck , began to imagine that they could tame nationalism .
but that was something they failed to do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hohenzollern kings ruled first prussia , then germany from 1701 to 1918 you mention bismarck .
he plays less of a role in your book than in most works of prussian history .
why is that ? in some ways i think bismarck turned his back on prussia .
king friedrich wilhelm iv of prussia said in 1848 : " prussia will be henceforth merged into germany . "
and i think he got it right that the process of national consolidation that bismarck saw as a continuation of prussian security policy would ultimately not prussianize germany , but germanize prussia , and that everything the old prussia stood for would be lost .
so in some ways i see bismarck as the first executor of a kind of closing-down sale of prussia and prussian tradition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historian christopher clark says prussia was never the bad guy of europe but was n't nationalism something inevitable that was going to happen sooner or later ?
or can one imagine a scenario in which prussia would still exist today ? that 's a really good question and a difficult one to answer .
although historians usually rear up in horror at the notion , i think it was probably inevitable .
if you think about the other multi-national states that existed in the 19th century , russia , for example , or the austro-hungarian empire , both of them disappeared in the course of the world war i and were replaced by something radically different .
it seems to me that these pre-national , multi-ethnic commonwealths that were such a feature of europe in the early modern period were probably doomed to go under . let 's backtrack now and talk about the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries and prussia under friedrich the great .
you describe especially the prussian capital berlin as a vibrant , even libidinous place during his reign .
would you have liked to live there ? i think there would have been wonderful things about being in berlin in the 1780s and 90s .
berlin , if you compare it with london or paris , has the reputation of being boring .
but , that does n't mean berlin was dead or lacked an urbane identity .
and this identity was not driven by the projection of power through the dynasty and its monumental public buildings .
the new culture that emerged was driven by voluntary impulses from civil society .
there was a proliferation of clubs and organizations for all sorts of purposes - cultivating the sciences , for instance , or looking at economical ways of using fuel .
there were literary societies and freemason lodges .
it was an endless cornucopia of little voluntary initiatives .
the point i was trying to make is that this created a city that was n't just about courts or courtliness but about courtesy and civility of a very middle-class , bourgeois kind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arrogance of emperor wilhelm ii and his generals led to defeat in world war i many historians draw links between prussia and nazism .
although no one would claim prussia was the cradle of the ideology , some people see connections between prussian militarism and subservience and the third reich .
but , you portray prussia more as a source of opposition . if it were true that prussia created an environment that deadened the will of ordinary citizens and turned them into instruments of state power , thereby blazing a trail for a totalitarian dictatorship in which people would do anything they were told , it would be very easy to test that hypothesis .
all you 'd have to show is that germans of prussian provenance made better and more obedient nazis than people from austria , baden-württemberg and so on .
if that had been the case , it would be more than obvious .
but it is n't .
there is simply no evidence .
on the contrary , people from baden-württemberg and especially austria made for equally keen nazis , with austrians , for example , being hugely overrepresented in the machinery of nazi genocide .
it 's just simply not the case that you can map out a relationship between prussia and nazism that made people into better tools of the regime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president paul von hindenburg appointed hitler as chancellor in 1933 of course , prussia is implicated in the story of the events that brought hitler to power .
the old prussian elites played a key role in cooking up the plan to put hitler into power as german chancellor in 1933 .
not because they wanted the third reich , but because they thought they could use hitler in a kind of conservative coup against the weimar republic .
of course , they were disastrously wrong .
the corporate arrogance of the prussian nobility helps to explain why some perfectly intelligent people failed to recognize the danger hitler presented . but national socialism was in many respects the exact opposite pole of prussiandom .
the old prussian state had been about the authority of government and the rule of law , but the new nazi reich was about the people .
it was an ethnic entity .
the nazis did n't care about laws .
to them , laws were utterly secondary .
what mattered was the führer as the expression of the will of the volk .
this was an idea that had no precedent in prussian history whatsoever .
so i see a very strong antipathy between the two forms of state . christopher clark is senior lecturer in modern european history at st. catharine 's college , university of cambridge . interview by jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but can the french- and flemish-speaking parts of the country truly get along ? the breakthrough came when a centre-left party from french-speaking belgium agreed to join a coalition led by acting prime minister guy verhofstadt .
an interim , five-party government coalition could be formed by the end of the week .
the alliance includes christian democrats and liberals from both parts of belgium as well as francophone socialists .
the agreement puts a temporary end to the political gridlock that has kept belgium without a government since june 10 , when a national election failed to yield a clear winner .
belgium 's nominal head of state king albert ii had asked verhofstadt to try to form an alliance to overcome the stalemate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although voted out of power in june , verhofstadt is again in charge " the prime minister has unblocked the situation , " said a spokesman for verhofstadt .
if a new government passes a parliamentary vote of confidence , it would only govern until march 23 , at which point flemish christian democrat leader yves leterme would take over .
but it would be able to pass a budget for the coming year and take decisions on other pressing issues ranging from inflation to security .
" for europe , this means the crisis is over for belgium , " said long-serving finance minister didier reynders , head of the french-speaking liberals - one of the five coalition parties . deep divisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two halves of belgium at often at odds the split between flemish and wallonian -lrb- french-speaking -rrb- belgians is both cultural and economic .
flemish speakers , who account for some 58 percent of the population , have traditionally squabbled with their francophone countrymen over the relationship of belgium 's two main languages .
the conflict has hindered long overdue reforms of the belgian state .
the more affluent flemish north of the country also wants to devolve control of the labor market and corporate tax rates from the national to the regional level .
french-speaking wallonia , where unemployment runs twice as high as in flemish-speaking flanders , fears that the northern belgian region would use such powers to lure companies away from the south with lower corporate tax rates .
the impasse has given rise to speculations that the 177-year-old state could split in two .
but an opinion poll published on monday showed that the vast majority of belgians wanted the country to remain intact . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

could you see yourself taking over from him as bayern 's regular captain ?
lucio : i would n't dream of becoming bayern munich 's captain .
it 's not my life 's goal , and i would n't fight for the position .
as far as i 'm concerned there 'll be no squabbling with my teammates over it .
the coach decides who 's captain .
i wo n't lie and say it would n't be flattering to be singled out for this responsibility , but i 'm not concerned with having a special status - that means nothing to me .
i 'll keep on the way i always have .
i 'm not looking to inherit the captaincy .
but you have served as bayern 's captain for the odd game .
did you not like it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strikers beware - lucio is one of the league most hard-nosed defenders of course it was a great experience .
but it did n't change me or the way i work with the team .
the best part was the feeling that the coach trusts me , that he and the team have faith in me .
in the period when i was captain , the atmosphere was great , really relaxed .
the team assistants and physiotherapists were in a good mood , always making jokes with me .
is the position first and foremost a matter of discipline ?
discipline is important , but a captain needs other qualities as well .
he has to lead by example .
he has to be someone who works hard , who shows respect for the coach and his teammates and who always gives his best for the club .
at bayern i 've always stood for these qualities .
that 's why i was allowed to be captain on occasion .
but as the captain of the brazilian national team , you surely must feel you 're entitled to the same position at bayern munich .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio 's season was going wll until he was suspended for four games for elbowing an opponent i did n't try to become captain of brazil .
it just happened , and i 'm very honored to have been given such an enormous responsibility .
thus far it 's gone well .
my teammates like me , and we get along well with one another .
you would n't have too many problems dealing with players like miroslav klose , luca toni or franck ribery , if you can lead a squad with stars like ronaldinho , kaka or robinho .
i 've known stars like kaka or ronaldinho both professionally and personally for quite some time .
they always listened to me and followed my advice , even when i was n't captain .
and when they tell me something , i listen to them too .
that 's why i have no problems fulfilling my responsibilities in the national team .
so ca n't you convince a kaka or ronaldinho to come to bayern ?
i do n't think they 'll be coming any time soon .
why not ?
it 's next to impossible to convince brazilian stars who can play in italy or spain to come to germany .
it 's not a question of the club , but the country .
the culture , lifestyle and language in italy and spain are fairly brazilian .
bayern ca n't compete .
you do n't try to sell bayern munich to your teammates in the brazilian national squad , as luca toni supposedly does with italy ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio won the world cup with brazil in 2002 as i said , for the reasons i 've just mentioned , bayern munich is a product that 's hard to market .
it 's difficult for me to sell the club to superstars like kaka , ronaldinho or robinho .
there are a few who would believe me - but they 're the ones who already play in the bundesliga .

and that , he told dw-world , is all he wants from his german club . dw-world.de : oliver kahn got himself suspended from the last league game of 2007 and has feuded with much of the squad .
could you see yourself taking over from him as bayern 's regular captain ?
lucio : i would n't dream of becoming bayern munich 's captain .
it 's not my life 's goal , and i would n't fight for the position .
as far as i 'm concerned there 'll be no squabbling with my teammates over it .
the coach decides who 's captain .
i wo n't lie and say it would n't be flattering to be singled out for this responsibility , but i 'm not concerned with having a special status - that means nothing to me .
i 'll keep on the way i always have .
i 'm not looking to inherit the captaincy .
but you have served as bayern 's captain for the odd game .
did you not like it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strikers beware - lucio is one of the league most hard-nosed defenders of course it was a great experience .
but it did n't change me or the way i work with the team .
the best part was the feeling that the coach trusts me , that he and the team have faith in me .
in the period when i was captain , the atmosphere was great , really relaxed .
the team assistants and physiotherapists were in a good mood , always making jokes with me .
is the position first and foremost a matter of discipline ?
discipline is important , but a captain needs other qualities as well .
he has to lead by example .
he has to be someone who works hard , who shows respect for the coach and his teammates and who always gives his best for the club .
at bayern i 've always stood for these qualities .
that 's why i was allowed to be captain on occasion .
but as the captain of the brazilian national team , you surely must feel you 're entitled to the same position at bayern munich .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio 's season was going wll until he was suspended for four games for elbowing an opponent i did n't try to become captain of brazil .
it just happened , and i 'm very honored to have been given such an enormous responsibility .
thus far it 's gone well .
my teammates like me , and we get along well with one another .
you would n't have too many problems dealing with players like miroslav klose , luca toni or franck ribery , if you can lead a squad with stars like ronaldinho , kaka or robinho .
i 've known stars like kaka or ronaldinho both professionally and personally for quite some time .
they always listened to me and followed my advice , even when i was n't captain .
and when they tell me something , i listen to them too .
that 's why i have no problems fulfilling my responsibilities in the national team .
so ca n't you convince a kaka or ronaldinho to come to bayern ?
i do n't think they 'll be coming any time soon .
why not ?
it 's next to impossible to convince brazilian stars who can play in italy or spain to come to germany .
it 's not a question of the club , but the country .
the culture , lifestyle and language in italy and spain are fairly brazilian .
bayern ca n't compete .
you do n't try to sell bayern munich to your teammates in the brazilian national squad , as luca toni supposedly does with italy ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio won the world cup with brazil in 2002 as i said , for the reasons i 've just mentioned , bayern munich is a product that 's hard to market .
it 's difficult for me to sell the club to superstars like kaka , ronaldinho or robinho .
there are a few who would believe me - but they 're the ones who already play in the bundesliga .
for example , diego , naldo , gilberto , mineiro and josue .
but not ronaldinho or kaka ?
when we exchange impressions , i have to admit it would be easier for them to convince me to leave germany than for me to convince them to come here .
but they have n't succeeded .
you 're still here .
yes , and i intend to see out my current contract , which runs until 2010 .
i still dream of spain or italy .
i 'd love to play there , and perhaps i can fulfill this dream a bit earlier , if the club and i can reach an agreement .
i transferred from leverkusen to munich two years before my contract back then was set to expire .
in soccer , nothing 's beyond discussion , if the opportunities and the will are there .

it just happened , and i 'm very honored to have been given such an enormous responsibility .
thus far it 's gone well .
my teammates like me , and we get along well with one another .
you would n't have too many problems dealing with players like miroslav klose , luca toni or franck ribery , if you can lead a squad with stars like ronaldinho , kaka or robinho .
i 've known stars like kaka or ronaldinho both professionally and personally for quite some time .
they always listened to me and followed my advice , even when i was n't captain .
and when they tell me something , i listen to them too .
that 's why i have no problems fulfilling my responsibilities in the national team .
so ca n't you convince a kaka or ronaldinho to come to bayern ?
i do n't think they 'll be coming any time soon .
why not ?
it 's next to impossible to convince brazilian stars who can play in italy or spain to come to germany .
it 's not a question of the club , but the country .
the culture , lifestyle and language in italy and spain are fairly brazilian .
bayern ca n't compete .
you do n't try to sell bayern munich to your teammates in the brazilian national squad , as luca toni supposedly does with italy ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio won the world cup with brazil in 2002 as i said , for the reasons i 've just mentioned , bayern munich is a product that 's hard to market .
it 's difficult for me to sell the club to superstars like kaka , ronaldinho or robinho .
there are a few who would believe me - but they 're the ones who already play in the bundesliga .
for example , diego , naldo , gilberto , mineiro and josue .
but not ronaldinho or kaka ?
when we exchange impressions , i have to admit it would be easier for them to convince me to leave germany than for me to convince them to come here .
but they have n't succeeded .
you 're still here .
yes , and i intend to see out my current contract , which runs until 2010 .
i still dream of spain or italy .
i 'd love to play there , and perhaps i can fulfill this dream a bit earlier , if the club and i can reach an agreement .
i transferred from leverkusen to munich two years before my contract back then was set to expire .
in soccer , nothing 's beyond discussion , if the opportunities and the will are there .
so at some point you intend to leave germany and head south .
one thing is for sure : after my time at bayern munich , i 'll definitely leave germany . interview by daniel martinez -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but can the french- and flemish-speaking parts of the country truly get along ? the breakthrough came when a centre-left party from french-speaking belgium agreed to join a coalition led by acting prime minister guy verhofstadt .
an interim , five-party government coalition could be formed by the end of the week .
the alliance includes christian democrats and liberals from both parts of belgium as well as francophone socialists .
the agreement puts a temporary end to the political gridlock that has kept belgium without a government since june 10 , when a national election failed to yield a clear winner .
belgium 's nominal head of state king albert ii had asked verhofstadt to try to form an alliance to overcome the stalemate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although voted out of power in june , verhofstadt is again in charge " the prime minister has unblocked the situation , " said a spokesman for verhofstadt .
if a new government passes a parliamentary vote of confidence , it would only govern until march 23 , at which point flemish christian democrat leader yves leterme would take over .
but it would be able to pass a budget for the coming year and take decisions on other pressing issues ranging from inflation to security .
" for europe , this means the crisis is over for belgium , " said long-serving finance minister didier reynders , head of the french-speaking liberals - one of the five coalition parties . deep divisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two halves of belgium at often at odds the split between flemish and wallonian -lrb- french-speaking -rrb- belgians is both cultural and economic .
flemish speakers , who account for some 58 percent of the population , have traditionally squabbled with their francophone countrymen over the relationship of belgium 's two main languages .
the conflict has hindered long overdue reforms of the belgian state .
the more affluent flemish north of the country also wants to devolve control of the labor market and corporate tax rates from the national to the regional level .
french-speaking wallonia , where unemployment runs twice as high as in flemish-speaking flanders , fears that the northern belgian region would use such powers to lure companies away from the south with lower corporate tax rates .
the impasse has given rise to speculations that the 177-year-old state could split in two .
but an opinion poll published on monday showed that the vast majority of belgians wanted the country to remain intact . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

turkey came a small step closer towards european union membership on wednesday , dec .

ankara seized the opportunity to attack some states ' attempts to block its entry . this means that six chapters have been opened until now .
to conclude the accession process , talks have to be completed in thirty-five different fields . speaking after a different meeting in brussels , the eu commissioner in charge of enlargement , finland 's olli rehn , said that all member states had reaffirmed their wish to see accession talks continue , adding that the opening of the two chapters on wednesday should be taken as proof that " the eu sticks to its commitments and keeps its word . " ankara began eu entry talks in 2005 , but they have moved forward very slowly because of rows over cyprus and human rights .
eight negotiating chapters have been blocked since the end of last year because of turkey 's refusal to open its ports and airports to traffic from eu member cyprus .
turkey 's negotiations are expected to last at least a decade , with no guarantee of membership at the end of it all .

" it is obvious that certain eu member states are trying to erode political and legal aspects of the accession process , " he said .
babacan did not name any names , but french prime minister nicolas sarkozy has been leading the lobby to keep turkey out of the european union . he favors a special partnership with the mainly muslim country instead of full membership .
babacan also stressed that all eu heads of state had agreed in december 2004 to the start of accession talks with turkey .
he said a change of government should not have an impact on this promise .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern germany -pipe- 19.12.2007 east germany forges path independent of west , says minister großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tiefensee grew up in communist east germany germany 's eastern states are n't out to mimic the west , german minister wolfgang tiefensee told deutsche welle .
but solving chronic high unemployment and xenophobic tendencies may take a while . deutsche welle : minister tiefensee , you not only serve as transport minister but also oversee the development of eastern germany .
what are your duties in this position ? wolfgang tiefensee : the new german states are still a part of our country that requires special attention and devotion .
that 's why the government has set up a post to coordinate these tasks .
the commissioner works together with ministers from all departments - labor market policy , economic policy , education , research and many other areas are all important for eastern germany .
the commissioner coordinates , gives ideas and advocates the interests of the new states . germany 's reunification happened in 1990 .
how much longer will it be necessary to have a commissioner of this kind ? i think it makes sense to coordinate these tasks .
they are connected , and i think the job will exist for a while .
financial support for the eastern states continues until 2019 - perhaps that 's the point by which things will have to have normalized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany is becoming a leader in renewable energies , said tiefensee will the standards of living in the east and west be similar by then ? actually , in the eastern states , we do n't want to imitate the western ones or become like other western european cities .
it 's more about taking a similar approach in the east and west to the challenges that confront germany and europe .
the pre-existing conditions vary .
i think that the eastern states have a natural advantage - especially in new industrial sectors like renewable energy , it and biotechnology , for example . investing late in new sectors means a more modern approach to investing , and that 's already become apparent .
as far as renewable energy goes , every second job in germany is in eastern germany . nevertheless , unemployment in the new states is still twice as high as in western germany .
when do you think this will even out ? that 's the most difficult question .
in the eastern states , unemployment is way above 13 percent , while it 's at 6 percent in the western states .
in addition , those without jobs in eastern germany are unemployed for long periods of time - for 12 or even 24 months - and get stuck in this chronic unemployment with no chance of breaking back into the job market . how long will this continue ?
we have to think long-term , because chronic unemployment can only be reduced very slowly .
the eastern regions of the new states are experiencing an economic upswing .
but this has n't yet had enough of an effect on the job market .
i think it will take at least another 10 years to reduce unemployment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremism has a larger following in eastern germany people from minority or foreign backgrounds tend to shy away from the eastern states .
some decide not to work or study there because they 're afraid of being assaulted by neo-nazis .
can you understand these concerns ? yes , unfortunately it is the case that the number of xenophobic crimes is higher in the east than in the west .
on the other hand , the big cities and many of the medium-sized cities are great places for foreigners to study or work as engineers or skilled laborers . many people actually prefer the eastern german states because they can also be particularly hospitable .
this is left over from communist east germany , when people had a totally different way of interacting with each other . there are many initiatives in place that are committed to breaking down xenophobia .
often , because there are too few foreigners , people often do n't know what they 're talking about and arrive at negative judgments .
if the number of foreign residents were to increase gradually , then i 'm sure that reservations about them would gradually decrease . you mentioned traditional hospitality in the east .
does eastern germany have a different value system than western germany ? i do n't think so , but of course 40 years of the gdr did n't go by without having an effect on the population and on individuals .
for 40 years , we could n't travel where we wanted to .
studying abroad was out of the question .
we could n't freely organize clubs or political parties like people in the western states and in western europe could .
all of that has left its mark . on the other hand , we ca n't forget that these were the people - just like in poland or czechoslovakia - who prepared the peaceful revolution and the globalchange that came with it .
the forces involved developed under a dictatorship , and the will to create something is still evident today .
people are very happy about finally being able to take responsibility . i do n't think that 's a different value system , particularly since the younger generation is assimilating anyway . interview : miodrag soric -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but solving chronic high unemployment and xenophobic tendencies may take a while . deutsche welle : minister tiefensee , you not only serve as transport minister but also oversee the development of eastern germany .
what are your duties in this position ? wolfgang tiefensee : the new german states are still a part of our country that requires special attention and devotion .
that 's why the government has set up a post to coordinate these tasks .
the commissioner works together with ministers from all departments - labor market policy , economic policy , education , research and many other areas are all important for eastern germany .
the commissioner coordinates , gives ideas and advocates the interests of the new states . germany 's reunification happened in 1990 .
how much longer will it be necessary to have a commissioner of this kind ? i think it makes sense to coordinate these tasks .
they are connected , and i think the job will exist for a while .
financial support for the eastern states continues until 2019 - perhaps that 's the point by which things will have to have normalized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany is becoming a leader in renewable energies , said tiefensee will the standards of living in the east and west be similar by then ? actually , in the eastern states , we do n't want to imitate the western ones or become like other western european cities .
it 's more about taking a similar approach in the east and west to the challenges that confront germany and europe .
the pre-existing conditions vary .
i think that the eastern states have a natural advantage - especially in new industrial sectors like renewable energy , it and biotechnology , for example . investing late in new sectors means a more modern approach to investing , and that 's already become apparent .
as far as renewable energy goes , every second job in germany is in eastern germany . nevertheless , unemployment in the new states is still twice as high as in western germany .
when do you think this will even out ? that 's the most difficult question .
in the eastern states , unemployment is way above 13 percent , while it 's at 6 percent in the western states .
in addition , those without jobs in eastern germany are unemployed for long periods of time - for 12 or even 24 months - and get stuck in this chronic unemployment with no chance of breaking back into the job market . how long will this continue ?
we have to think long-term , because chronic unemployment can only be reduced very slowly .
the eastern regions of the new states are experiencing an economic upswing .
but this has n't yet had enough of an effect on the job market .
i think it will take at least another 10 years to reduce unemployment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremism has a larger following in eastern germany people from minority or foreign backgrounds tend to shy away from the eastern states .
some decide not to work or study there because they 're afraid of being assaulted by neo-nazis .
can you understand these concerns ? yes , unfortunately it is the case that the number of xenophobic crimes is higher in the east than in the west .
on the other hand , the big cities and many of the medium-sized cities are great places for foreigners to study or work as engineers or skilled laborers . many people actually prefer the eastern german states because they can also be particularly hospitable .
this is left over from communist east germany , when people had a totally different way of interacting with each other . there are many initiatives in place that are committed to breaking down xenophobia .
often , because there are too few foreigners , people often do n't know what they 're talking about and arrive at negative judgments .
if the number of foreign residents were to increase gradually , then i 'm sure that reservations about them would gradually decrease . you mentioned traditional hospitality in the east .
does eastern germany have a different value system than western germany ? i do n't think so , but of course 40 years of the gdr did n't go by without having an effect on the population and on individuals .
for 40 years , we could n't travel where we wanted to .
studying abroad was out of the question .
we could n't freely organize clubs or political parties like people in the western states and in western europe could .
all of that has left its mark . on the other hand , we ca n't forget that these were the people - just like in poland or czechoslovakia - who prepared the peaceful revolution and the globalchange that came with it .
the forces involved developed under a dictatorship , and the will to create something is still evident today .

but solving chronic high unemployment and xenophobic tendencies may take a while . deutsche welle : minister tiefensee , you not only serve as transport minister but also oversee the development of eastern germany .
what are your duties in this position ? wolfgang tiefensee : the new german states are still a part of our country that requires special attention and devotion .
that 's why the government has set up a post to coordinate these tasks .
the commissioner works together with ministers from all departments - labor market policy , economic policy , education , research and many other areas are all important for eastern germany .
the commissioner coordinates , gives ideas and advocates the interests of the new states . germany 's reunification happened in 1990 .
how much longer will it be necessary to have a commissioner of this kind ? i think it makes sense to coordinate these tasks .
they are connected , and i think the job will exist for a while .
financial support for the eastern states continues until 2019 - perhaps that 's the point by which things will have to have normalized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany is becoming a leader in renewable energies , said tiefensee will the standards of living in the east and west be similar by then ? actually , in the eastern states , we do n't want to imitate the western ones or become like other western european cities .
it 's more about taking a similar approach in the east and west to the challenges that confront germany and europe .
the pre-existing conditions vary .
i think that the eastern states have a natural advantage - especially in new industrial sectors like renewable energy , it and biotechnology , for example . investing late in new sectors means a more modern approach to investing , and that 's already become apparent .
as far as renewable energy goes , every second job in germany is in eastern germany . nevertheless , unemployment in the new states is still twice as high as in western germany .
when do you think this will even out ? that 's the most difficult question .
in the eastern states , unemployment is way above 13 percent , while it 's at 6 percent in the western states .
in addition , those without jobs in eastern germany are unemployed for long periods of time - for 12 or even 24 months - and get stuck in this chronic unemployment with no chance of breaking back into the job market . how long will this continue ?
we have to think long-term , because chronic unemployment can only be reduced very slowly .
the eastern regions of the new states are experiencing an economic upswing .
but this has n't yet had enough of an effect on the job market .
i think it will take at least another 10 years to reduce unemployment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremism has a larger following in eastern germany people from minority or foreign backgrounds tend to shy away from the eastern states .
some decide not to work or study there because they 're afraid of being assaulted by neo-nazis .
can you understand these concerns ? yes , unfortunately it is the case that the number of xenophobic crimes is higher in the east than in the west .
on the other hand , the big cities and many of the medium-sized cities are great places for foreigners to study or work as engineers or skilled laborers . many people actually prefer the eastern german states because they can also be particularly hospitable .
this is left over from communist east germany , when people had a totally different way of interacting with each other . there are many initiatives in place that are committed to breaking down xenophobia .
often , because there are too few foreigners , people often do n't know what they 're talking about and arrive at negative judgments .
if the number of foreign residents were to increase gradually , then i 'm sure that reservations about them would gradually decrease . you mentioned traditional hospitality in the east .
does eastern germany have a different value system than western germany ? i do n't think so , but of course 40 years of the gdr did n't go by without having an effect on the population and on individuals .
for 40 years , we could n't travel where we wanted to .
studying abroad was out of the question .
we could n't freely organize clubs or political parties like people in the western states and in western europe could .
all of that has left its mark . on the other hand , we ca n't forget that these were the people - just like in poland or czechoslovakia - who prepared the peaceful revolution and the globalchange that came with it .
the forces involved developed under a dictatorship , and the will to create something is still evident today .

but putting on a band-aid now wo n't help later , says dw 's karl zawadzky . 2006 was the best year so far in the business cycle .
germany 's economic performance climbed 2.9 percent - the strongest growth in six years .
this year , economic growth is at 2.5 percent . there is a close connection between the growth rates in 2006 and 2007 .
due to the drastic three-percent hike on added-value tax on jan .
1 , many consumers pushed up the purchase of more expensive items - from cars to home decoration items to computers , so it 's no surprise that the 2006 boom could n't continue into 2007 . the tax increase is no longer an issue , but there are plenty of other factors disrupting the economy . us real estate crisis leaves lasting mark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the us , the upswing that followed the real estate and mortgage crisis is now losing steam .
but , it 's even worse : many already see the specter of a recession in the us .
that dampens the mood world-wide since the us is by far the largest economy and a key player in the global financial system . the mortgage crisis hurt business for banks around the world .
everyone wanted to make a profit with the bad mortgages and they all lost - not just the american banks , but also large swiss banks and german savings banks . once again , greed conquered reason .
the result will burden the economy for some time to come . then there are high oil prices and the expensive euro .
the scarcity of raw materials around the world , in part due to strong demand in china , is also driving prices up .
rising prices detract from consumers ' purchasing power and they 're holding on to their money - which , in turn , weakens demand . exports and foreign investment are up nevertheless , " the german economy continues to experience a solid upswing , " said the german federal bank in its most recent report on the state of the economy . there are good reasons for this .
all over the world - especially in the resource-rich emerging nations with high export receipts and , in some cases , huge foreign currency reserves - investments are being made in infrastructure and industry , and the new wealth is being vigorously consumed . germany delivers more high-quality goods than any other country , whether they are machines , manufacturing plants , luxury cars or top-end food products .
what 's more , companies in germany not only have a suitable range of export products , but also offer excellent service . during the last few years of economic decline at home , companies expanded immensely on the world market , which is now paying off .
as a result , not only have exports hit a record high but domestic investment is booming as well , as many companies adjust their production capacity to meet increased demand . otherwise strong economy hurt by external factors however , the economic slump in the us , the problems with the banks , the high oil prices and the expensive euro have dragged down the economy 's upward slope .
respectively , the federal bank has predicted 1.9 percent growth in 2008 , while some economic research institutions foresee only 1.5 to 1.6 percent . hence , the upturn will continue , just with considerably less gusto . no one can reliably predict whether the economy will rebound again in 2009 or whether the current economic cycle is already drawing to a close .
on the one hand , the german economy is resting on a much stronger foundation than in earlier years , but on the other hand , the rising inflation rate is increasingly becoming a reason for concern . in november , price inflation was 3.1 percent higher than what it had been a year earlier , which is significantly greater than the two-percent window tolerated by the european central bank . the currency guardians should respond with an interest rate increase , but that 's not possible due to the bank crisis .
instead , central banks around the world are pumping billions and billions into circulation , which only intensifies inflationary tendencies . what may seem necessary today can strangle the economic upswing in the mid-term . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

respectively , the federal bank has predicted 1.9 percent growth in 2008 , while some economic research institutions foresee only 1.5 to 1.6 percent . hence , the upturn will continue , just with considerably less gusto . no one can reliably predict whether the economy will rebound again in 2009 or whether the current economic cycle is already drawing to a close .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 19.12.2007 eu unveils plan to cut auto emissions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how the burden will be shared among carmakers in reducing emissions is unclear industry and environment champions are lining up for a showdown with the european commission on how to cut carbon dioxide emissions from cars without harming europe 's carmakers . the european union has revealed plans for cutting carbon dioxide emissions in eu-made vehicles , but there is dispute among the manufacturers about who should bear the brunt of the cuts . " a climate-change war over cars " was how the business weekly wirtschaftswoche described the standoff between one of germany 's largest and most vital industries and the bureaucrats in brussels . it is up to the european commission - the eu 's executive arm - to set out how carmakers should meet the target of cutting emissions to an average of 130 grams / kilometer -lrb- g / km -rrb- among their passenger vehicles from 2012 , and how parts and fuel-makers should knock a further 10 g / km off the average .

" a climate-change war over cars " was how the business weekly wirtschaftswoche described the standoff between one of germany 's largest and most vital industries and the bureaucrats in brussels . it is up to the european commission - the eu 's executive arm - to set out how carmakers should meet the target of cutting emissions to an average of 130 grams / kilometer -lrb- g / km -rrb- among their passenger vehicles from 2012 , and how parts and fuel-makers should knock a further 10 g / km off the average .

" the potential for a negotiated solution is now exhausted , " a joint statement by eu ambassadors on the security council and the united states said following the meeting . the us and key european union nations back kosovo 's call for independence , and have pledged their future support . but on wednesday , russia said it stood behind its close ally serbia 's call for further negotiations on autonomy for the province . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the presence of un police , clashes still occur in kosovo the us and eu statement said that as irreconcilable efforts stand in the way , " the eu stands ready to play a leading role in implementing a settlement defining kosovo 's future status .

he stressed that co-existence of serbia and kosovo in the same state was impossible . still in limbo wednesday 's meeting ended with no action taken - which the eu and the united states said was equivalent to closing the door on un efforts to resolve the province 's status . last week , eu leaders said they were prepared to send around 1,800 police and prosecutors to kosovo as part of a un proposal to grant the province " supervised independence .

" under the proposal , international agencies would guide kosovo toward full independence and membership to the united nations .
the agencies , however , would also have the power to prevent the province from merging with albania as well as keep serb areas from splitting off to become part of serbia . western ambassadors have said that un security council resolution 1244 - passed after nato pushed serbian forces out of kosovo in 1999 - allowed for the implementation of ahtisaari 's plan . many serbs consider kosovo the cultural cradle of their identity .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 19.12.2007 all-star german band puts sgt. pepper 's on stage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the beatles made it , but it took a bunch of germans to put it on stage the beatles never performed their most famous album live .
to rectify that , film director wolfgang becker has formed a band to play sgt. pepper 's lonely hearts club band from start to finish .
but do they pull it off ? four decades on from the release in 1967 of what is arguably the most famous album in pop music , " sgt. pepper 's lonely hearts club band " was set to be performed live at a large musical theater in central berlin on wednesday night .
the concert was the brainchild of german film director and beatles ' fanatic wolfgang becker , best known for his international hit " goodbye lenin . "
it 's the end result of an idea that grew beyond all proportions .
" originally , the plan was to just play acoustically in someone 's kitchen , " becker told dw-world .
" then we thought we 'd do it in a bar .
but it just kept growing and growing . "
and grown it has .
becker 's band now consists of dozens of musicians - some professionals , some gifted amateurs - including directorial colleague tom tykwer .
a forty-person choir sings background vocals , and indian musicians have been enlisted to play george harrison 's raga-inflected " within you , without you . "
with a little help from his friends bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang becker has taken beatlemania to new extremes the ensemble first performed the record at a private party in a berlin club this summer .
word of the gig spread , and a local radio station contacted becker about playing it in public as part of the station 's anniversary celebrations .
" i 'm not really nervous , " becker said ahead of the gig .
" but when people are paying money to get in , you do feel a different sense of responsibility . "
the musicians begin with the title track and continue on through the fab four 's psychedelic opus , concluding with what some consider lennon and mccartney 's finest composition , " a day in life . "
the band 's musical co-leader niko weidemann said playing the full record presents some unusual challenges .
" the individual songs are not all that difficult to play , but if you look at it as a total work , it can be tricky , " he said .
" we listened to the original album , and what we heard was how the beatles really pushed the limits with the restricted means at their disposal .
they never intended to perform the record live - it 's a studio production full of overdubs .
but when it is played live on stage by a big band with a brass section and a choir , it 's really fantastic . "
the one and only billy shears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a four-piece band , there was no way the beatles could perform sgt. pepper 's live whether becker 's band is authentic is anyone 's guess .
but there 's something fittingly ironic about a group of latter-day fab four fanatics covering a concept record about a fictional band as played by the beatles .
and the performance suggests that had the liverpool quartet played " pepper 's " live , it might well have rocked - a good thing since becker has invested considerable time and money in the project .
" if you go to wolfgang 's home , it 's absolutely full of beatles ' records , posters and memoriabilia , " said adrian kennedy , a dw-tv producer and on-air personality who serves as the emcee .

to rectify that , film director wolfgang becker has formed a band to play sgt. pepper 's lonely hearts club band from start to finish .
but do they pull it off ? four decades on from the release in 1967 of what is arguably the most famous album in pop music , " sgt. pepper 's lonely hearts club band " was set to be performed live at a large musical theater in central berlin on wednesday night .
the concert was the brainchild of german film director and beatles ' fanatic wolfgang becker , best known for his international hit " goodbye lenin . "
it 's the end result of an idea that grew beyond all proportions .
" originally , the plan was to just play acoustically in someone 's kitchen , " becker told dw-world .
" then we thought we 'd do it in a bar .
but it just kept growing and growing . "
and grown it has .
becker 's band now consists of dozens of musicians - some professionals , some gifted amateurs - including directorial colleague tom tykwer .
a forty-person choir sings background vocals , and indian musicians have been enlisted to play george harrison 's raga-inflected " within you , without you . "
with a little help from his friends bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang becker has taken beatlemania to new extremes the ensemble first performed the record at a private party in a berlin club this summer .
word of the gig spread , and a local radio station contacted becker about playing it in public as part of the station 's anniversary celebrations .
" i 'm not really nervous , " becker said ahead of the gig .
" but when people are paying money to get in , you do feel a different sense of responsibility . "
the musicians begin with the title track and continue on through the fab four 's psychedelic opus , concluding with what some consider lennon and mccartney 's finest composition , " a day in life . "
the band 's musical co-leader niko weidemann said playing the full record presents some unusual challenges .
" the individual songs are not all that difficult to play , but if you look at it as a total work , it can be tricky , " he said .
" we listened to the original album , and what we heard was how the beatles really pushed the limits with the restricted means at their disposal .
they never intended to perform the record live - it 's a studio production full of overdubs .
but when it is played live on stage by a big band with a brass section and a choir , it 's really fantastic . "
the one and only billy shears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a four-piece band , there was no way the beatles could perform sgt. pepper 's live whether becker 's band is authentic is anyone 's guess .
but there 's something fittingly ironic about a group of latter-day fab four fanatics covering a concept record about a fictional band as played by the beatles .
and the performance suggests that had the liverpool quartet played " pepper 's " live , it might well have rocked - a good thing since becker has invested considerable time and money in the project .

to rectify that , film director wolfgang becker has formed a band to play sgt. pepper 's lonely hearts club band from start to finish .
but do they pull it off ? four decades on from the release in 1967 of what is arguably the most famous album in pop music , " sgt. pepper 's lonely hearts club band " was set to be performed live at a large musical theater in central berlin on wednesday night .
the concert was the brainchild of german film director and beatles ' fanatic wolfgang becker , best known for his international hit " goodbye lenin . "
it 's the end result of an idea that grew beyond all proportions .
" originally , the plan was to just play acoustically in someone 's kitchen , " becker told dw-world .
" then we thought we 'd do it in a bar .
but it just kept growing and growing . "
and grown it has .
becker 's band now consists of dozens of musicians - some professionals , some gifted amateurs - including directorial colleague tom tykwer .

" i 'm not really nervous , " becker said ahead of the gig .
" but when people are paying money to get in , you do feel a different sense of responsibility . "
the musicians begin with the title track and continue on through the fab four 's psychedelic opus , concluding with what some consider lennon and mccartney 's finest composition , " a day in life . "
the band 's musical co-leader niko weidemann said playing the full record presents some unusual challenges .
" the individual songs are not all that difficult to play , but if you look at it as a total work , it can be tricky , " he said .
" we listened to the original album , and what we heard was how the beatles really pushed the limits with the restricted means at their disposal .
they never intended to perform the record live - it 's a studio production full of overdubs .
but when it is played live on stage by a big band with a brass section and a choir , it 's really fantastic . "
the one and only billy shears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a four-piece band , there was no way the beatles could perform sgt. pepper 's live whether becker 's band is authentic is anyone 's guess .
but there 's something fittingly ironic about a group of latter-day fab four fanatics covering a concept record about a fictional band as played by the beatles .
and the performance suggests that had the liverpool quartet played " pepper 's " live , it might well have rocked - a good thing since becker has invested considerable time and money in the project .
" if you go to wolfgang 's home , it 's absolutely full of beatles ' records , posters and memoriabilia , " said adrian kennedy , a dw-tv producer and on-air personality who serves as the emcee .

the measures are intended to curb global warming . under the plans , automobile manufacturers would have to reduce carbon emissions produced by their fleets of passenger cars to an average of 120 grams per kilometer by 2012 .
currently , new cars emit some 160 grams on average . should they not comply to the guidelines , automakers are to face steep fines . with several commissioners dissenting , the european commission - the eu 's executive arm - agreed on a four-year phase-in period from 2012 for the fines . " this will send a strong signal to the world about the determination of the european union to take bold measures on climate change , " eu environment commissioner stavros dimas said at a press conference . germany says the plan will not be effective the proposed legislation enraged germany and its carmakers .

steg said that the plans would threaten jobs , hinder innovation and fail to be an effective instrument for climate protection .
environment minister sigmar gabriel also slammed the proposals , saying that they favored italian and french car makers .
speaking on german television , he criticized the fact that the limits would apply to a car manufacturers ' fleet , meaning that a manufacturer such as fiat with its numerous small models would not have to cut the emissions of its high-end cars .
according to the european commission 's plans , penalties on companies will start at 20 euros -lrb- $ 29 -rrb- per excess gram of co2 and rise to 95 euros in 2016 .
opinions split on the issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany says firms such as fiat will get off lightly eu commission president jose manuel barroso hailed the new measures , which still need the backing of eu states and the european parliament .
" this proposal demonstrates that the european union is committed to being a world leader in cutting co2 emissions and the development of a low carbon economy , " he said .
" at the same time , we are committed to promoting the competitiveness of our industry and its global technological leadership , " barroso added .
the environmental group greenpeace said the proposals did not go far enough , accusing the eu executive of backing down in the face of lobbying from the auto industry .

western countries have offered their help to the breakaway province . serbia and kosovo were at loggerheads at a united nations security council meeting in new york .
kosovo 's 90-percent albanian majority is ready to declare independence within weeks , but serbia insists that the province must remain part of its territory . neither side was willing to compromise during wednesday 's meeting . " the potential for a negotiated solution is now exhausted , " a joint statement by eu ambassadors on the security council and the united states said following the meeting . the us and key european union nations back kosovo 's call for independence , and have pledged their future support . but on wednesday , russia said it stood behind its close ally serbia 's call for further negotiations on autonomy for the province . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the presence of un police , clashes still occur in kosovo the us and eu statement said that as irreconcilable efforts stand in the way , " the eu stands ready to play a leading role in implementing a settlement defining kosovo 's future status . " listening to both sides the 15-member security council met in a closed-door session to hear serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica and kosovo 's president fatmir sejdiu make their respective cases . it was the first council debate since a " troika " of mediators - the eu , russia and the united states - said on dec .
10 that four months of talks between belgrade and kosovo 's albanian separatists had failed to reach a compromise on the issue of sovereignty . kostunica said that a unilateral declaration of independence supported by western nations would undermine the un charter and mark the beginning of a new era " in which might is above right . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : live goes on in pristina he said it would trigger a " serious crisis , " but did not comment on what action serbia might take . sejdiu , president of the un-run province , told the council that the collapse of the former yugoslavia was " one of the great tragedies of the modern era . " " we are exhausted after nearly two decades of isolation , war and political limbo , " he said , referring to the ethnic cleansing of kosovo albanians in the 1990s .
he stressed that co-existence of serbia and kosovo in the same state was impossible . still in limbo wednesday 's meeting ended with no action taken - which the eu and the united states said was equivalent to closing the door on un efforts to resolve the province 's status . last week , eu leaders said they were prepared to send around 1,800 police and prosecutors to kosovo as part of a un proposal to grant the province " supervised independence . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former un mediator for kosovo , martti ahtisaari at the same time , eu leaders also offered serbia " accelerated " entry into the european union . russia has said that the eu police mission would be illegal without un approval , but western diplomats at the united nations refuted that notion . in april , then un special envoy martti ahtisaari presented a plan offering kosovo " supervised independence . " under the proposal , international agencies would guide kosovo toward full independence and membership to the united nations .
the agencies , however , would also have the power to prevent the province from merging with albania as well as keep serb areas from splitting off to become part of serbia . western ambassadors have said that un security council resolution 1244 - passed after nato pushed serbian forces out of kosovo in 1999 - allowed for the implementation of ahtisaari 's plan . many serbs consider kosovo the cultural cradle of their identity .
the province has been administered by the united nations since 1999 , when nato ended serbia 's crackdown on and ethnic cleansing of separatist ethnic-albanians . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 19.12.2007 eu unveils plan to cut auto emissions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how the burden will be shared among carmakers in reducing emissions is unclear industry and environment champions are lining up for a showdown with the european commission on how to cut carbon dioxide emissions from cars without harming europe 's carmakers . the european union has revealed plans for cutting carbon dioxide emissions in eu-made vehicles , but there is dispute among the manufacturers about who should bear the brunt of the cuts . " a climate-change war over cars " was how the business weekly wirtschaftswoche described the standoff between one of germany 's largest and most vital industries and the bureaucrats in brussels . it is up to the european commission - the eu 's executive arm - to set out how carmakers should meet the target of cutting emissions to an average of 130 grams / kilometer -lrb- g / km -rrb- among their passenger vehicles from 2012 , and how parts and fuel-makers should knock a further 10 g / km off the average .
the target represents a cut of about 25 percent from current levels . internal commission strife bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checking tire pressure and using biofuels can help reduce emissions the eu 's commissioners , however , remain at odds over several key points . commissioner for enterprise günter verheugen , a staunch defender of the german car industry , has sought to reduce fines on companies that do not cut average emissions to 130 grams per km through engine technology . but environment commission stavros dimas argued for gradually mounting fines from 2012 as an effective deterrent to force manufacturers to invest in clean technology . overall , car parts and fuel-makers are meant to find ways to slash average emissions by a quarter - from the current 160 g / km to 120 g / km .
while climate protection groups say that might be a manageable target , it is far from clear which manufacturers will serve as the sacrificial lamb .

" a climate-change war over cars " was how the business weekly wirtschaftswoche described the standoff between one of germany 's largest and most vital industries and the bureaucrats in brussels . it is up to the european commission - the eu 's executive arm - to set out how carmakers should meet the target of cutting emissions to an average of 130 grams / kilometer -lrb- g / km -rrb- among their passenger vehicles from 2012 , and how parts and fuel-makers should knock a further 10 g / km off the average .
the target represents a cut of about 25 percent from current levels . internal commission strife bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checking tire pressure and using biofuels can help reduce emissions the eu 's commissioners , however , remain at odds over several key points . commissioner for enterprise günter verheugen , a staunch defender of the german car industry , has sought to reduce fines on companies that do not cut average emissions to 130 grams per km through engine technology . but environment commission stavros dimas argued for gradually mounting fines from 2012 as an effective deterrent to force manufacturers to invest in clean technology . overall , car parts and fuel-makers are meant to find ways to slash average emissions by a quarter - from the current 160 g / km to 120 g / km .

i think it 's a case of timing .
the fall of the berlin wall and german re-unification have triggered a process of re-imagining the german past in general and prussia in particular .
so much of what was left of the old prussian state was in former communist east germany , so it was kind of locked away .
with the re-unification of germany , it all became visible and got reconnected to the larger german national entity .
that and the opening up of archives of the former east germany prompted a rethink .
let 's try to sum up your thesis .
prussia was a relatively enlightened , progressive state that inadvertently destroyed itself when it enlisted the force of german nationalism .
is that close ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prussian culture , including architecture , blossomed in the 19th century that 's exactly it .
nationalism was prussia 's downfall .
in older historical literature , nationalism was seen as the culmination of prussian history .
prussia 's task in history had been to create the german nation .
just as we today tend to see the rise of the third reich in 1933 as the end of an era and explain how germany got to that point , previous generations tried to explain how german history had got to 1871 and the creation of the german empire .
and the answer was that prussia was the steering , shaping and sometimes manipulative power that would bring the german nation into existence .
the emergence of the german nation is the thing that gives meaning to the whole history of prussia . that , in my view , is completely and utterly wrong .
throughout its history prussia had been the most un-national state you can imagine , partly because it contained such large numbers of non-germans , but also because the whole idea of its existence was that of the sovereign , monarchical state , interwoven with the idea of the sovereignty of law . these were ideas that had nothing to do with the uprising of a national movement .
prussia responded very hostilely to early german nationalism because the hohenzollern rulers rightly recognized that it would act like a kind of corrosive acid eating away at everything the prussian state stood for . it was only during the unstable period of the 1850s , 60s and 70s that prussian statesmen , particularly prussian prime minister and german chancellor otto von bismarck , began to imagine that they could tame nationalism .
but that was something they failed to do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hohenzollern kings ruled first prussia , then germany from 1701 to 1918 you mention bismarck .
he plays less of a role in your book than in most works of prussian history .
why is that ? in some ways i think bismarck turned his back on prussia .
king friedrich wilhelm iv of prussia said in 1848 : " prussia will be henceforth merged into germany . "
and i think he got it right that the process of national consolidation that bismarck saw as a continuation of prussian security policy would ultimately not prussianize germany , but germanize prussia , and that everything the old prussia stood for would be lost .
so in some ways i see bismarck as the first executor of a kind of closing-down sale of prussia and prussian tradition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historian christopher clark says prussia was never the bad guy of europe but was n't nationalism something inevitable that was going to happen sooner or later ?
or can one imagine a scenario in which prussia would still exist today ? that 's a really good question and a difficult one to answer .
although historians usually rear up in horror at the notion , i think it was probably inevitable .
if you think about the other multi-national states that existed in the 19th century , russia , for example , or the austro-hungarian empire , both of them disappeared in the course of the world war i and were replaced by something radically different .
it seems to me that these pre-national , multi-ethnic commonwealths that were such a feature of europe in the early modern period were probably doomed to go under . let 's backtrack now and talk about the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries and prussia under friedrich the great .
you describe especially the prussian capital berlin as a vibrant , even libidinous place during his reign .
would you have liked to live there ? i think there would have been wonderful things about being in berlin in the 1780s and 90s .
berlin , if you compare it with london or paris , has the reputation of being boring .
but , that does n't mean berlin was dead or lacked an urbane identity .
and this identity was not driven by the projection of power through the dynasty and its monumental public buildings .
the new culture that emerged was driven by voluntary impulses from civil society .
there was a proliferation of clubs and organizations for all sorts of purposes - cultivating the sciences , for instance , or looking at economical ways of using fuel .
there were literary societies and freemason lodges .
it was an endless cornucopia of little voluntary initiatives .
the point i was trying to make is that this created a city that was n't just about courts or courtliness but about courtesy and civility of a very middle-class , bourgeois kind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arrogance of emperor wilhelm ii and his generals led to defeat in world war i many historians draw links between prussia and nazism .
although no one would claim prussia was the cradle of the ideology , some people see connections between prussian militarism and subservience and the third reich .
but , you portray prussia more as a source of opposition . if it were true that prussia created an environment that deadened the will of ordinary citizens and turned them into instruments of state power , thereby blazing a trail for a totalitarian dictatorship in which people would do anything they were told , it would be very easy to test that hypothesis .
all you 'd have to show is that germans of prussian provenance made better and more obedient nazis than people from austria , baden-württemberg and so on .
if that had been the case , it would be more than obvious .
but it is n't .
there is simply no evidence .
on the contrary , people from baden-württemberg and especially austria made for equally keen nazis , with austrians , for example , being hugely overrepresented in the machinery of nazi genocide .
it 's just simply not the case that you can map out a relationship between prussia and nazism that made people into better tools of the regime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president paul von hindenburg appointed hitler as chancellor in 1933 of course , prussia is implicated in the story of the events that brought hitler to power .
the old prussian elites played a key role in cooking up the plan to put hitler into power as german chancellor in 1933 .
not because they wanted the third reich , but because they thought they could use hitler in a kind of conservative coup against the weimar republic .
of course , they were disastrously wrong .
the corporate arrogance of the prussian nobility helps to explain why some perfectly intelligent people failed to recognize the danger hitler presented . but national socialism was in many respects the exact opposite pole of prussiandom .
the old prussian state had been about the authority of government and the rule of law , but the new nazi reich was about the people .
it was an ethnic entity .
the nazis did n't care about laws .
to them , laws were utterly secondary .
what mattered was the führer as the expression of the will of the volk .
this was an idea that had no precedent in prussian history whatsoever .

he talked about prussia 's appeal . dw-world.de : are you surprised that an academic book on prussia could make the german bestseller lists ? christopher clark : i certainly did n't expect success on that level .
i think it 's a case of timing .
the fall of the berlin wall and german re-unification have triggered a process of re-imagining the german past in general and prussia in particular .
so much of what was left of the old prussian state was in former communist east germany , so it was kind of locked away .
with the re-unification of germany , it all became visible and got reconnected to the larger german national entity .
that and the opening up of archives of the former east germany prompted a rethink .
let 's try to sum up your thesis .
prussia was a relatively enlightened , progressive state that inadvertently destroyed itself when it enlisted the force of german nationalism .
is that close ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prussian culture , including architecture , blossomed in the 19th century that 's exactly it .
nationalism was prussia 's downfall .
in older historical literature , nationalism was seen as the culmination of prussian history .
prussia 's task in history had been to create the german nation .
just as we today tend to see the rise of the third reich in 1933 as the end of an era and explain how germany got to that point , previous generations tried to explain how german history had got to 1871 and the creation of the german empire .
and the answer was that prussia was the steering , shaping and sometimes manipulative power that would bring the german nation into existence .
the emergence of the german nation is the thing that gives meaning to the whole history of prussia . that , in my view , is completely and utterly wrong .
throughout its history prussia had been the most un-national state you can imagine , partly because it contained such large numbers of non-germans , but also because the whole idea of its existence was that of the sovereign , monarchical state , interwoven with the idea of the sovereignty of law . these were ideas that had nothing to do with the uprising of a national movement .
prussia responded very hostilely to early german nationalism because the hohenzollern rulers rightly recognized that it would act like a kind of corrosive acid eating away at everything the prussian state stood for . it was only during the unstable period of the 1850s , 60s and 70s that prussian statesmen , particularly prussian prime minister and german chancellor otto von bismarck , began to imagine that they could tame nationalism .
but that was something they failed to do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hohenzollern kings ruled first prussia , then germany from 1701 to 1918 you mention bismarck .
he plays less of a role in your book than in most works of prussian history .
why is that ? in some ways i think bismarck turned his back on prussia .
king friedrich wilhelm iv of prussia said in 1848 : " prussia will be henceforth merged into germany . "
and i think he got it right that the process of national consolidation that bismarck saw as a continuation of prussian security policy would ultimately not prussianize germany , but germanize prussia , and that everything the old prussia stood for would be lost .
so in some ways i see bismarck as the first executor of a kind of closing-down sale of prussia and prussian tradition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historian christopher clark says prussia was never the bad guy of europe but was n't nationalism something inevitable that was going to happen sooner or later ?
or can one imagine a scenario in which prussia would still exist today ? that 's a really good question and a difficult one to answer .
although historians usually rear up in horror at the notion , i think it was probably inevitable .
if you think about the other multi-national states that existed in the 19th century , russia , for example , or the austro-hungarian empire , both of them disappeared in the course of the world war i and were replaced by something radically different .
it seems to me that these pre-national , multi-ethnic commonwealths that were such a feature of europe in the early modern period were probably doomed to go under . let 's backtrack now and talk about the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries and prussia under friedrich the great .
you describe especially the prussian capital berlin as a vibrant , even libidinous place during his reign .
would you have liked to live there ? i think there would have been wonderful things about being in berlin in the 1780s and 90s .
berlin , if you compare it with london or paris , has the reputation of being boring .
but , that does n't mean berlin was dead or lacked an urbane identity .
and this identity was not driven by the projection of power through the dynasty and its monumental public buildings .
the new culture that emerged was driven by voluntary impulses from civil society .
there was a proliferation of clubs and organizations for all sorts of purposes - cultivating the sciences , for instance , or looking at economical ways of using fuel .
there were literary societies and freemason lodges .
it was an endless cornucopia of little voluntary initiatives .
the point i was trying to make is that this created a city that was n't just about courts or courtliness but about courtesy and civility of a very middle-class , bourgeois kind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arrogance of emperor wilhelm ii and his generals led to defeat in world war i many historians draw links between prussia and nazism .

king friedrich wilhelm iv of prussia said in 1848 : " prussia will be henceforth merged into germany . "
and i think he got it right that the process of national consolidation that bismarck saw as a continuation of prussian security policy would ultimately not prussianize germany , but germanize prussia , and that everything the old prussia stood for would be lost .
so in some ways i see bismarck as the first executor of a kind of closing-down sale of prussia and prussian tradition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historian christopher clark says prussia was never the bad guy of europe but was n't nationalism something inevitable that was going to happen sooner or later ?
or can one imagine a scenario in which prussia would still exist today ? that 's a really good question and a difficult one to answer .
although historians usually rear up in horror at the notion , i think it was probably inevitable .
if you think about the other multi-national states that existed in the 19th century , russia , for example , or the austro-hungarian empire , both of them disappeared in the course of the world war i and were replaced by something radically different .
it seems to me that these pre-national , multi-ethnic commonwealths that were such a feature of europe in the early modern period were probably doomed to go under . let 's backtrack now and talk about the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries and prussia under friedrich the great .
you describe especially the prussian capital berlin as a vibrant , even libidinous place during his reign .
would you have liked to live there ? i think there would have been wonderful things about being in berlin in the 1780s and 90s .
berlin , if you compare it with london or paris , has the reputation of being boring .
but , that does n't mean berlin was dead or lacked an urbane identity .
and this identity was not driven by the projection of power through the dynasty and its monumental public buildings .
the new culture that emerged was driven by voluntary impulses from civil society .
there was a proliferation of clubs and organizations for all sorts of purposes - cultivating the sciences , for instance , or looking at economical ways of using fuel .
there were literary societies and freemason lodges .
it was an endless cornucopia of little voluntary initiatives .
the point i was trying to make is that this created a city that was n't just about courts or courtliness but about courtesy and civility of a very middle-class , bourgeois kind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arrogance of emperor wilhelm ii and his generals led to defeat in world war i many historians draw links between prussia and nazism .
although no one would claim prussia was the cradle of the ideology , some people see connections between prussian militarism and subservience and the third reich .
but , you portray prussia more as a source of opposition . if it were true that prussia created an environment that deadened the will of ordinary citizens and turned them into instruments of state power , thereby blazing a trail for a totalitarian dictatorship in which people would do anything they were told , it would be very easy to test that hypothesis .
all you 'd have to show is that germans of prussian provenance made better and more obedient nazis than people from austria , baden-württemberg and so on .
if that had been the case , it would be more than obvious .
but it is n't .
there is simply no evidence .
on the contrary , people from baden-württemberg and especially austria made for equally keen nazis , with austrians , for example , being hugely overrepresented in the machinery of nazi genocide .
it 's just simply not the case that you can map out a relationship between prussia and nazism that made people into better tools of the regime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president paul von hindenburg appointed hitler as chancellor in 1933 of course , prussia is implicated in the story of the events that brought hitler to power .
the old prussian elites played a key role in cooking up the plan to put hitler into power as german chancellor in 1933 .
not because they wanted the third reich , but because they thought they could use hitler in a kind of conservative coup against the weimar republic .
of course , they were disastrously wrong .
the corporate arrogance of the prussian nobility helps to explain why some perfectly intelligent people failed to recognize the danger hitler presented . but national socialism was in many respects the exact opposite pole of prussiandom .
the old prussian state had been about the authority of government and the rule of law , but the new nazi reich was about the people .
it was an ethnic entity .
the nazis did n't care about laws .
to them , laws were utterly secondary .
what mattered was the führer as the expression of the will of the volk .
this was an idea that had no precedent in prussian history whatsoever .
so i see a very strong antipathy between the two forms of state . christopher clark is senior lecturer in modern european history at st. catharine 's college , university of cambridge . interview by jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the measures are intended to curb global warming . under the plans , automobile manufacturers would have to reduce carbon emissions produced by their fleets of passenger cars to an average of 120 grams per kilometer by 2012 .
currently , new cars emit some 160 grams on average . should they not comply to the guidelines , automakers are to face steep fines . with several commissioners dissenting , the european commission - the eu 's executive arm - agreed on a four-year phase-in period from 2012 for the fines .

kosovo 's 90-percent albanian majority is ready to declare independence within weeks , but serbia insists that the province must remain part of its territory . neither side was willing to compromise during wednesday 's meeting . " the potential for a negotiated solution is now exhausted , " a joint statement by eu ambassadors on the security council and the united states said following the meeting . the us and key european union nations back kosovo 's call for independence , and have pledged their future support . but on wednesday , russia said it stood behind its close ally serbia 's call for further negotiations on autonomy for the province . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the presence of un police , clashes still occur in kosovo the us and eu statement said that as irreconcilable efforts stand in the way , " the eu stands ready to play a leading role in implementing a settlement defining kosovo 's future status . " listening to both sides the 15-member security council met in a closed-door session to hear serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica and kosovo 's president fatmir sejdiu make their respective cases . it was the first council debate since a " troika " of mediators - the eu , russia and the united states - said on dec .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : live goes on in pristina he said it would trigger a " serious crisis , " but did not comment on what action serbia might take . sejdiu , president of the un-run province , told the council that the collapse of the former yugoslavia was " one of the great tragedies of the modern era . " " we are exhausted after nearly two decades of isolation , war and political limbo , " he said , referring to the ethnic cleansing of kosovo albanians in the 1990s .
he stressed that co-existence of serbia and kosovo in the same state was impossible . still in limbo wednesday 's meeting ended with no action taken - which the eu and the united states said was equivalent to closing the door on un efforts to resolve the province 's status . last week , eu leaders said they were prepared to send around 1,800 police and prosecutors to kosovo as part of a un proposal to grant the province " supervised independence . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former un mediator for kosovo , martti ahtisaari at the same time , eu leaders also offered serbia " accelerated " entry into the european union . russia has said that the eu police mission would be illegal without un approval , but western diplomats at the united nations refuted that notion . in april , then un special envoy martti ahtisaari presented a plan offering kosovo " supervised independence . " under the proposal , international agencies would guide kosovo toward full independence and membership to the united nations .
the agencies , however , would also have the power to prevent the province from merging with albania as well as keep serb areas from splitting off to become part of serbia . western ambassadors have said that un security council resolution 1244 - passed after nato pushed serbian forces out of kosovo in 1999 - allowed for the implementation of ahtisaari 's plan . many serbs consider kosovo the cultural cradle of their identity .
the province has been administered by the united nations since 1999 , when nato ended serbia 's crackdown on and ethnic cleansing of separatist ethnic-albanians . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the measures are intended to curb global warming . under the plans , automobile manufacturers would have to reduce carbon emissions produced by their fleets of passenger cars to an average of 120 grams per kilometer by 2012 .
currently , new cars emit some 160 grams on average . should they not comply to the guidelines , automakers are to face steep fines . with several commissioners dissenting , the european commission - the eu 's executive arm - agreed on a four-year phase-in period from 2012 for the fines . " this will send a strong signal to the world about the determination of the european union to take bold measures on climate change , " eu environment commissioner stavros dimas said at a press conference . germany says the plan will not be effective the proposed legislation enraged germany and its carmakers .
german chancellor angela merkel said the eu was making policy " at the expense of germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler , bmw and porsche could face difficulties meeting the targets government spokesman thomas steg said the measures were biased against german companies , which tend to make bigger and more powerful vehicles .
" whatever motive led a majority of commissioners to decide this , we consider the solution to be wrong , we consider the solution to be very harmful and will do everything to force changes , " he said .
steg said that the plans would threaten jobs , hinder innovation and fail to be an effective instrument for climate protection .
environment minister sigmar gabriel also slammed the proposals , saying that they favored italian and french car makers .
speaking on german television , he criticized the fact that the limits would apply to a car manufacturers ' fleet , meaning that a manufacturer such as fiat with its numerous small models would not have to cut the emissions of its high-end cars .
according to the european commission 's plans , penalties on companies will start at 20 euros -lrb- $ 29 -rrb- per excess gram of co2 and rise to 95 euros in 2016 .
opinions split on the issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany says firms such as fiat will get off lightly eu commission president jose manuel barroso hailed the new measures , which still need the backing of eu states and the european parliament .
" this proposal demonstrates that the european union is committed to being a world leader in cutting co2 emissions and the development of a low carbon economy , " he said .
" at the same time , we are committed to promoting the competitiveness of our industry and its global technological leadership , " barroso added .
the environmental group greenpeace said the proposals did not go far enough , accusing the eu executive of backing down in the face of lobbying from the auto industry .
" the commission has let car makers drive away with a proposal that sets a weak , short-term standard , lacks any longer-term targets and offers an open road to heavy , gas-guzzling vehicles , " said greenpeace transport policy expert franziska achterberg . . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern germany -pipe- 19.12.2007 east germany forges path independent of west , says minister großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tiefensee grew up in communist east germany germany 's eastern states are n't out to mimic the west , german minister wolfgang tiefensee told deutsche welle .
but solving chronic high unemployment and xenophobic tendencies may take a while . deutsche welle : minister tiefensee , you not only serve as transport minister but also oversee the development of eastern germany .
what are your duties in this position ? wolfgang tiefensee : the new german states are still a part of our country that requires special attention and devotion .
that 's why the government has set up a post to coordinate these tasks .
the commissioner works together with ministers from all departments - labor market policy , economic policy , education , research and many other areas are all important for eastern germany .
the commissioner coordinates , gives ideas and advocates the interests of the new states . germany 's reunification happened in 1990 .
how much longer will it be necessary to have a commissioner of this kind ? i think it makes sense to coordinate these tasks .
they are connected , and i think the job will exist for a while .
financial support for the eastern states continues until 2019 - perhaps that 's the point by which things will have to have normalized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany is becoming a leader in renewable energies , said tiefensee will the standards of living in the east and west be similar by then ? actually , in the eastern states , we do n't want to imitate the western ones or become like other western european cities .
it 's more about taking a similar approach in the east and west to the challenges that confront germany and europe .
the pre-existing conditions vary .
i think that the eastern states have a natural advantage - especially in new industrial sectors like renewable energy , it and biotechnology , for example . investing late in new sectors means a more modern approach to investing , and that 's already become apparent .
as far as renewable energy goes , every second job in germany is in eastern germany . nevertheless , unemployment in the new states is still twice as high as in western germany .
when do you think this will even out ? that 's the most difficult question .
in the eastern states , unemployment is way above 13 percent , while it 's at 6 percent in the western states .
in addition , those without jobs in eastern germany are unemployed for long periods of time - for 12 or even 24 months - and get stuck in this chronic unemployment with no chance of breaking back into the job market . how long will this continue ?
we have to think long-term , because chronic unemployment can only be reduced very slowly .
the eastern regions of the new states are experiencing an economic upswing .
but this has n't yet had enough of an effect on the job market .
i think it will take at least another 10 years to reduce unemployment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremism has a larger following in eastern germany people from minority or foreign backgrounds tend to shy away from the eastern states .
some decide not to work or study there because they 're afraid of being assaulted by neo-nazis .
can you understand these concerns ? yes , unfortunately it is the case that the number of xenophobic crimes is higher in the east than in the west .
on the other hand , the big cities and many of the medium-sized cities are great places for foreigners to study or work as engineers or skilled laborers . many people actually prefer the eastern german states because they can also be particularly hospitable .
this is left over from communist east germany , when people had a totally different way of interacting with each other . there are many initiatives in place that are committed to breaking down xenophobia .
often , because there are too few foreigners , people often do n't know what they 're talking about and arrive at negative judgments .
if the number of foreign residents were to increase gradually , then i 'm sure that reservations about them would gradually decrease . you mentioned traditional hospitality in the east .
does eastern germany have a different value system than western germany ? i do n't think so , but of course 40 years of the gdr did n't go by without having an effect on the population and on individuals .
for 40 years , we could n't travel where we wanted to .
studying abroad was out of the question .
we could n't freely organize clubs or political parties like people in the western states and in western europe could .
all of that has left its mark . on the other hand , we ca n't forget that these were the people - just like in poland or czechoslovakia - who prepared the peaceful revolution and the globalchange that came with it .
the forces involved developed under a dictatorship , and the will to create something is still evident today .
people are very happy about finally being able to take responsibility . i do n't think that 's a different value system , particularly since the younger generation is assimilating anyway . interview : miodrag soric -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern germany -pipe- 19.12.2007 east germany forges path independent of west , says minister großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tiefensee grew up in communist east germany germany 's eastern states are n't out to mimic the west , german minister wolfgang tiefensee told deutsche welle .
but solving chronic high unemployment and xenophobic tendencies may take a while . deutsche welle : minister tiefensee , you not only serve as transport minister but also oversee the development of eastern germany .
what are your duties in this position ? wolfgang tiefensee : the new german states are still a part of our country that requires special attention and devotion .
that 's why the government has set up a post to coordinate these tasks .
the commissioner works together with ministers from all departments - labor market policy , economic policy , education , research and many other areas are all important for eastern germany .
the commissioner coordinates , gives ideas and advocates the interests of the new states . germany 's reunification happened in 1990 .
how much longer will it be necessary to have a commissioner of this kind ? i think it makes sense to coordinate these tasks .
they are connected , and i think the job will exist for a while .
financial support for the eastern states continues until 2019 - perhaps that 's the point by which things will have to have normalized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany is becoming a leader in renewable energies , said tiefensee will the standards of living in the east and west be similar by then ? actually , in the eastern states , we do n't want to imitate the western ones or become like other western european cities .
it 's more about taking a similar approach in the east and west to the challenges that confront germany and europe .
the pre-existing conditions vary .
i think that the eastern states have a natural advantage - especially in new industrial sectors like renewable energy , it and biotechnology , for example . investing late in new sectors means a more modern approach to investing , and that 's already become apparent .
as far as renewable energy goes , every second job in germany is in eastern germany . nevertheless , unemployment in the new states is still twice as high as in western germany .
when do you think this will even out ? that 's the most difficult question .
in the eastern states , unemployment is way above 13 percent , while it 's at 6 percent in the western states .
in addition , those without jobs in eastern germany are unemployed for long periods of time - for 12 or even 24 months - and get stuck in this chronic unemployment with no chance of breaking back into the job market . how long will this continue ?
we have to think long-term , because chronic unemployment can only be reduced very slowly .
the eastern regions of the new states are experiencing an economic upswing .
but this has n't yet had enough of an effect on the job market .
i think it will take at least another 10 years to reduce unemployment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremism has a larger following in eastern germany people from minority or foreign backgrounds tend to shy away from the eastern states .
some decide not to work or study there because they 're afraid of being assaulted by neo-nazis .
can you understand these concerns ? yes , unfortunately it is the case that the number of xenophobic crimes is higher in the east than in the west .
on the other hand , the big cities and many of the medium-sized cities are great places for foreigners to study or work as engineers or skilled laborers . many people actually prefer the eastern german states because they can also be particularly hospitable .
this is left over from communist east germany , when people had a totally different way of interacting with each other . there are many initiatives in place that are committed to breaking down xenophobia .
often , because there are too few foreigners , people often do n't know what they 're talking about and arrive at negative judgments .
if the number of foreign residents were to increase gradually , then i 'm sure that reservations about them would gradually decrease . you mentioned traditional hospitality in the east .
does eastern germany have a different value system than western germany ? i do n't think so , but of course 40 years of the gdr did n't go by without having an effect on the population and on individuals .
for 40 years , we could n't travel where we wanted to .
studying abroad was out of the question .
we could n't freely organize clubs or political parties like people in the western states and in western europe could .
all of that has left its mark . on the other hand , we ca n't forget that these were the people - just like in poland or czechoslovakia - who prepared the peaceful revolution and the globalchange that came with it .
the forces involved developed under a dictatorship , and the will to create something is still evident today .
people are very happy about finally being able to take responsibility . i do n't think that 's a different value system , particularly since the younger generation is assimilating anyway . interview : miodrag soric -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 19.12.2007 all-star german band puts sgt. pepper 's on stage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the beatles made it , but it took a bunch of germans to put it on stage the beatles never performed their most famous album live .
to rectify that , film director wolfgang becker has formed a band to play sgt. pepper 's lonely hearts club band from start to finish .
but do they pull it off ? four decades on from the release in 1967 of what is arguably the most famous album in pop music , " sgt. pepper 's lonely hearts club band " was set to be performed live at a large musical theater in central berlin on wednesday night .
the concert was the brainchild of german film director and beatles ' fanatic wolfgang becker , best known for his international hit " goodbye lenin . "
it 's the end result of an idea that grew beyond all proportions .
" originally , the plan was to just play acoustically in someone 's kitchen , " becker told dw-world .
" then we thought we 'd do it in a bar .
but it just kept growing and growing . "
and grown it has .
becker 's band now consists of dozens of musicians - some professionals , some gifted amateurs - including directorial colleague tom tykwer .
a forty-person choir sings background vocals , and indian musicians have been enlisted to play george harrison 's raga-inflected " within you , without you . "
with a little help from his friends bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang becker has taken beatlemania to new extremes the ensemble first performed the record at a private party in a berlin club this summer .
word of the gig spread , and a local radio station contacted becker about playing it in public as part of the station 's anniversary celebrations .
" i 'm not really nervous , " becker said ahead of the gig .
" but when people are paying money to get in , you do feel a different sense of responsibility . "
the musicians begin with the title track and continue on through the fab four 's psychedelic opus , concluding with what some consider lennon and mccartney 's finest composition , " a day in life . "
the band 's musical co-leader niko weidemann said playing the full record presents some unusual challenges .
" the individual songs are not all that difficult to play , but if you look at it as a total work , it can be tricky , " he said .
" we listened to the original album , and what we heard was how the beatles really pushed the limits with the restricted means at their disposal .
they never intended to perform the record live - it 's a studio production full of overdubs .
but when it is played live on stage by a big band with a brass section and a choir , it 's really fantastic . "
the one and only billy shears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a four-piece band , there was no way the beatles could perform sgt. pepper 's live whether becker 's band is authentic is anyone 's guess .
but there 's something fittingly ironic about a group of latter-day fab four fanatics covering a concept record about a fictional band as played by the beatles .
and the performance suggests that had the liverpool quartet played " pepper 's " live , it might well have rocked - a good thing since becker has invested considerable time and money in the project .
" if you go to wolfgang 's home , it 's absolutely full of beatles ' records , posters and memoriabilia , " said adrian kennedy , a dw-tv producer and on-air personality who serves as the emcee .
" i do n't think he 's making any money from it .
it 's just for the love of the music . "
even more ironically , " sgt. pepper 's " is n't even becker 's favorite beatles album .
" no , that would be ' revolver ' , " becker said .
" but we completely forgot the fortieth anniversary of that record , and we were determined not to miss another opportunity again . "
audience members have been asked to dress up in 1960s style , and a " lovely rita " award will be handed out after the famous final piano chord of " a day in the life " has finished reverberating in the rafters . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" a climate-change war over cars " was how the business weekly wirtschaftswoche described the standoff between one of germany 's largest and most vital industries and the bureaucrats in brussels . it is up to the european commission - the eu 's executive arm - to set out how carmakers should meet the target of cutting emissions to an average of 130 grams / kilometer -lrb- g / km -rrb- among their passenger vehicles from 2012 , and how parts and fuel-makers should knock a further 10 g / km off the average .
the target represents a cut of about 25 percent from current levels . internal commission strife bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checking tire pressure and using biofuels can help reduce emissions the eu 's commissioners , however , remain at odds over several key points . commissioner for enterprise günter verheugen , a staunch defender of the german car industry , has sought to reduce fines on companies that do not cut average emissions to 130 grams per km through engine technology . but environment commission stavros dimas argued for gradually mounting fines from 2012 as an effective deterrent to force manufacturers to invest in clean technology . overall , car parts and fuel-makers are meant to find ways to slash average emissions by a quarter - from the current 160 g / km to 120 g / km .
while climate protection groups say that might be a manageable target , it is far from clear which manufacturers will serve as the sacrificial lamb . " the only thing that really poses a threat to us are bad political decisions taken in brussels or berlin , " matthias wissmann , the head of the german automobile federation vda , said last week . given that the targets apply to the sector as a whole , it is the commission 's task to decide how the new burden is to be shared . big versus small bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european carmakers have taken different sides in the co2 dispute countries that traditionally make larger , less fuel-efficient vehicles , such as germany and sweden , are at odds with their european neighbors , such as france , spain and italy , who are better known for producing smaller cars . the latter say luxury carmakers should take the weight of the new guidelines , not least because they are the ones with the highest profit margins . but german chancellor angela merkel , who has been vocally pro-environment since taking up office , has lobbied hard against the emissions caps . " we will fight for our interests , " she told a meeting of eu leaders in brussels recently . a common pool of co2 in keeping with germany 's wishes , the latest word from the commission was that it was proposing the cuts to be proportionate to a vehicle 's weight , and the emissions targets to be pooled among carmakers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european automakers may see profits drop if emissions limits are put in place also unresolved is how manufacturers will be penalized for failing to meet their targets .
head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , has suggested a fine of 10 euros -lrb- $ 14 -rrb- for each extra gram of co2 , but the european commissioner for the environment stavros dimas wants to implement a fee of 35 euros per excess gram - a drop from the 95 euros per gram he had been quoted with proposing in some media reports . that suggestion has met with fierce resistance from germany , whose car industry could stand to loose billions under such a stringent penalty system . " the implementation of the carbon dioxide targets could hurt them more than expected , " ferdinand dudenhöffer , head of the center for automotive research , said of germany 's big , fuel guzzlers .
" the impact on the profit margins of europe 's top-of-the-range producers could be considerable . " but that 's consequence environmental campaigners say the german automobile industry should have seen coming . " it was the germans who popularised the idea of a big car as a status symbol , and now it has backfired on them , " said greenpeace 's wolfgang lohbeck . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" a climate-change war over cars " was how the business weekly wirtschaftswoche described the standoff between one of germany 's largest and most vital industries and the bureaucrats in brussels . it is up to the european commission - the eu 's executive arm - to set out how carmakers should meet the target of cutting emissions to an average of 130 grams / kilometer -lrb- g / km -rrb- among their passenger vehicles from 2012 , and how parts and fuel-makers should knock a further 10 g / km off the average .
the target represents a cut of about 25 percent from current levels . internal commission strife bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checking tire pressure and using biofuels can help reduce emissions the eu 's commissioners , however , remain at odds over several key points . commissioner for enterprise günter verheugen , a staunch defender of the german car industry , has sought to reduce fines on companies that do not cut average emissions to 130 grams per km through engine technology . but environment commission stavros dimas argued for gradually mounting fines from 2012 as an effective deterrent to force manufacturers to invest in clean technology . overall , car parts and fuel-makers are meant to find ways to slash average emissions by a quarter - from the current 160 g / km to 120 g / km .
while climate protection groups say that might be a manageable target , it is far from clear which manufacturers will serve as the sacrificial lamb . " the only thing that really poses a threat to us are bad political decisions taken in brussels or berlin , " matthias wissmann , the head of the german automobile federation vda , said last week . given that the targets apply to the sector as a whole , it is the commission 's task to decide how the new burden is to be shared . big versus small bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european carmakers have taken different sides in the co2 dispute countries that traditionally make larger , less fuel-efficient vehicles , such as germany and sweden , are at odds with their european neighbors , such as france , spain and italy , who are better known for producing smaller cars . the latter say luxury carmakers should take the weight of the new guidelines , not least because they are the ones with the highest profit margins . but german chancellor angela merkel , who has been vocally pro-environment since taking up office , has lobbied hard against the emissions caps .

but putting on a band-aid now wo n't help later , says dw 's karl zawadzky . 2006 was the best year so far in the business cycle .
germany 's economic performance climbed 2.9 percent - the strongest growth in six years .
this year , economic growth is at 2.5 percent . there is a close connection between the growth rates in 2006 and 2007 .
due to the drastic three-percent hike on added-value tax on jan .
1 , many consumers pushed up the purchase of more expensive items - from cars to home decoration items to computers , so it 's no surprise that the 2006 boom could n't continue into 2007 . the tax increase is no longer an issue , but there are plenty of other factors disrupting the economy . us real estate crisis leaves lasting mark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the us , the upswing that followed the real estate and mortgage crisis is now losing steam .
but , it 's even worse : many already see the specter of a recession in the us .
that dampens the mood world-wide since the us is by far the largest economy and a key player in the global financial system . the mortgage crisis hurt business for banks around the world .
everyone wanted to make a profit with the bad mortgages and they all lost - not just the american banks , but also large swiss banks and german savings banks . once again , greed conquered reason .
the result will burden the economy for some time to come . then there are high oil prices and the expensive euro .
the scarcity of raw materials around the world , in part due to strong demand in china , is also driving prices up .
rising prices detract from consumers ' purchasing power and they 're holding on to their money - which , in turn , weakens demand . exports and foreign investment are up nevertheless , " the german economy continues to experience a solid upswing , " said the german federal bank in its most recent report on the state of the economy . there are good reasons for this .
all over the world - especially in the resource-rich emerging nations with high export receipts and , in some cases , huge foreign currency reserves - investments are being made in infrastructure and industry , and the new wealth is being vigorously consumed . germany delivers more high-quality goods than any other country , whether they are machines , manufacturing plants , luxury cars or top-end food products .
what 's more , companies in germany not only have a suitable range of export products , but also offer excellent service . during the last few years of economic decline at home , companies expanded immensely on the world market , which is now paying off .
as a result , not only have exports hit a record high but domestic investment is booming as well , as many companies adjust their production capacity to meet increased demand . otherwise strong economy hurt by external factors however , the economic slump in the us , the problems with the banks , the high oil prices and the expensive euro have dragged down the economy 's upward slope .
respectively , the federal bank has predicted 1.9 percent growth in 2008 , while some economic research institutions foresee only 1.5 to 1.6 percent . hence , the upturn will continue , just with considerably less gusto . no one can reliably predict whether the economy will rebound again in 2009 or whether the current economic cycle is already drawing to a close .
on the one hand , the german economy is resting on a much stronger foundation than in earlier years , but on the other hand , the rising inflation rate is increasingly becoming a reason for concern . in november , price inflation was 3.1 percent higher than what it had been a year earlier , which is significantly greater than the two-percent window tolerated by the european central bank . the currency guardians should respond with an interest rate increase , but that 's not possible due to the bank crisis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 19.12.2007 cambridge historian says prussia gets a bad rap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrich the great -lrb- 1712-1786 -rrb- was both an art lover and a successful military commander christopher clark 's " the iron kingdom " is a 750 + page opus about a state that no longer exists .
but , that did n't stop the german translation from cracking the 2007 bestseller lists .
he talked about prussia 's appeal . dw-world.de : are you surprised that an academic book on prussia could make the german bestseller lists ? christopher clark : i certainly did n't expect success on that level .
i think it 's a case of timing .
the fall of the berlin wall and german re-unification have triggered a process of re-imagining the german past in general and prussia in particular .
so much of what was left of the old prussian state was in former communist east germany , so it was kind of locked away .
with the re-unification of germany , it all became visible and got reconnected to the larger german national entity .
that and the opening up of archives of the former east germany prompted a rethink .
let 's try to sum up your thesis .
prussia was a relatively enlightened , progressive state that inadvertently destroyed itself when it enlisted the force of german nationalism .
is that close ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prussian culture , including architecture , blossomed in the 19th century that 's exactly it .
nationalism was prussia 's downfall .
in older historical literature , nationalism was seen as the culmination of prussian history .
prussia 's task in history had been to create the german nation .
just as we today tend to see the rise of the third reich in 1933 as the end of an era and explain how germany got to that point , previous generations tried to explain how german history had got to 1871 and the creation of the german empire .
and the answer was that prussia was the steering , shaping and sometimes manipulative power that would bring the german nation into existence .
the emergence of the german nation is the thing that gives meaning to the whole history of prussia . that , in my view , is completely and utterly wrong .
throughout its history prussia had been the most un-national state you can imagine , partly because it contained such large numbers of non-germans , but also because the whole idea of its existence was that of the sovereign , monarchical state , interwoven with the idea of the sovereignty of law . these were ideas that had nothing to do with the uprising of a national movement .
prussia responded very hostilely to early german nationalism because the hohenzollern rulers rightly recognized that it would act like a kind of corrosive acid eating away at everything the prussian state stood for . it was only during the unstable period of the 1850s , 60s and 70s that prussian statesmen , particularly prussian prime minister and german chancellor otto von bismarck , began to imagine that they could tame nationalism .
but that was something they failed to do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hohenzollern kings ruled first prussia , then germany from 1701 to 1918 you mention bismarck .
he plays less of a role in your book than in most works of prussian history .
why is that ? in some ways i think bismarck turned his back on prussia .
king friedrich wilhelm iv of prussia said in 1848 : " prussia will be henceforth merged into germany . "
and i think he got it right that the process of national consolidation that bismarck saw as a continuation of prussian security policy would ultimately not prussianize germany , but germanize prussia , and that everything the old prussia stood for would be lost .
so in some ways i see bismarck as the first executor of a kind of closing-down sale of prussia and prussian tradition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historian christopher clark says prussia was never the bad guy of europe but was n't nationalism something inevitable that was going to happen sooner or later ?
or can one imagine a scenario in which prussia would still exist today ? that 's a really good question and a difficult one to answer .
although historians usually rear up in horror at the notion , i think it was probably inevitable .
if you think about the other multi-national states that existed in the 19th century , russia , for example , or the austro-hungarian empire , both of them disappeared in the course of the world war i and were replaced by something radically different .
it seems to me that these pre-national , multi-ethnic commonwealths that were such a feature of europe in the early modern period were probably doomed to go under . let 's backtrack now and talk about the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries and prussia under friedrich the great .
you describe especially the prussian capital berlin as a vibrant , even libidinous place during his reign .
would you have liked to live there ? i think there would have been wonderful things about being in berlin in the 1780s and 90s .
berlin , if you compare it with london or paris , has the reputation of being boring .
but , that does n't mean berlin was dead or lacked an urbane identity .
and this identity was not driven by the projection of power through the dynasty and its monumental public buildings .
the new culture that emerged was driven by voluntary impulses from civil society .
there was a proliferation of clubs and organizations for all sorts of purposes - cultivating the sciences , for instance , or looking at economical ways of using fuel .
there were literary societies and freemason lodges .
it was an endless cornucopia of little voluntary initiatives .
the point i was trying to make is that this created a city that was n't just about courts or courtliness but about courtesy and civility of a very middle-class , bourgeois kind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arrogance of emperor wilhelm ii and his generals led to defeat in world war i many historians draw links between prussia and nazism .
although no one would claim prussia was the cradle of the ideology , some people see connections between prussian militarism and subservience and the third reich .
but , you portray prussia more as a source of opposition . if it were true that prussia created an environment that deadened the will of ordinary citizens and turned them into instruments of state power , thereby blazing a trail for a totalitarian dictatorship in which people would do anything they were told , it would be very easy to test that hypothesis .
all you 'd have to show is that germans of prussian provenance made better and more obedient nazis than people from austria , baden-württemberg and so on .
if that had been the case , it would be more than obvious .
but it is n't .
there is simply no evidence .
on the contrary , people from baden-württemberg and especially austria made for equally keen nazis , with austrians , for example , being hugely overrepresented in the machinery of nazi genocide .
it 's just simply not the case that you can map out a relationship between prussia and nazism that made people into better tools of the regime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president paul von hindenburg appointed hitler as chancellor in 1933 of course , prussia is implicated in the story of the events that brought hitler to power .
the old prussian elites played a key role in cooking up the plan to put hitler into power as german chancellor in 1933 .
not because they wanted the third reich , but because they thought they could use hitler in a kind of conservative coup against the weimar republic .
of course , they were disastrously wrong .

i think it 's a case of timing .
the fall of the berlin wall and german re-unification have triggered a process of re-imagining the german past in general and prussia in particular .
so much of what was left of the old prussian state was in former communist east germany , so it was kind of locked away .
with the re-unification of germany , it all became visible and got reconnected to the larger german national entity .
that and the opening up of archives of the former east germany prompted a rethink .
let 's try to sum up your thesis .
prussia was a relatively enlightened , progressive state that inadvertently destroyed itself when it enlisted the force of german nationalism .
is that close ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prussian culture , including architecture , blossomed in the 19th century that 's exactly it .
nationalism was prussia 's downfall .
in older historical literature , nationalism was seen as the culmination of prussian history .
prussia 's task in history had been to create the german nation .
just as we today tend to see the rise of the third reich in 1933 as the end of an era and explain how germany got to that point , previous generations tried to explain how german history had got to 1871 and the creation of the german empire .
and the answer was that prussia was the steering , shaping and sometimes manipulative power that would bring the german nation into existence .
the emergence of the german nation is the thing that gives meaning to the whole history of prussia . that , in my view , is completely and utterly wrong .
throughout its history prussia had been the most un-national state you can imagine , partly because it contained such large numbers of non-germans , but also because the whole idea of its existence was that of the sovereign , monarchical state , interwoven with the idea of the sovereignty of law . these were ideas that had nothing to do with the uprising of a national movement .
prussia responded very hostilely to early german nationalism because the hohenzollern rulers rightly recognized that it would act like a kind of corrosive acid eating away at everything the prussian state stood for . it was only during the unstable period of the 1850s , 60s and 70s that prussian statesmen , particularly prussian prime minister and german chancellor otto von bismarck , began to imagine that they could tame nationalism .
but that was something they failed to do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hohenzollern kings ruled first prussia , then germany from 1701 to 1918 you mention bismarck .
he plays less of a role in your book than in most works of prussian history .
why is that ? in some ways i think bismarck turned his back on prussia .
king friedrich wilhelm iv of prussia said in 1848 : " prussia will be henceforth merged into germany . "
and i think he got it right that the process of national consolidation that bismarck saw as a continuation of prussian security policy would ultimately not prussianize germany , but germanize prussia , and that everything the old prussia stood for would be lost .
so in some ways i see bismarck as the first executor of a kind of closing-down sale of prussia and prussian tradition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historian christopher clark says prussia was never the bad guy of europe but was n't nationalism something inevitable that was going to happen sooner or later ?
or can one imagine a scenario in which prussia would still exist today ? that 's a really good question and a difficult one to answer .

is that close ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prussian culture , including architecture , blossomed in the 19th century that 's exactly it .
nationalism was prussia 's downfall .
in older historical literature , nationalism was seen as the culmination of prussian history .
prussia 's task in history had been to create the german nation .
just as we today tend to see the rise of the third reich in 1933 as the end of an era and explain how germany got to that point , previous generations tried to explain how german history had got to 1871 and the creation of the german empire .
and the answer was that prussia was the steering , shaping and sometimes manipulative power that would bring the german nation into existence .
the emergence of the german nation is the thing that gives meaning to the whole history of prussia . that , in my view , is completely and utterly wrong .
throughout its history prussia had been the most un-national state you can imagine , partly because it contained such large numbers of non-germans , but also because the whole idea of its existence was that of the sovereign , monarchical state , interwoven with the idea of the sovereignty of law . these were ideas that had nothing to do with the uprising of a national movement .
prussia responded very hostilely to early german nationalism because the hohenzollern rulers rightly recognized that it would act like a kind of corrosive acid eating away at everything the prussian state stood for . it was only during the unstable period of the 1850s , 60s and 70s that prussian statesmen , particularly prussian prime minister and german chancellor otto von bismarck , began to imagine that they could tame nationalism .
but that was something they failed to do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hohenzollern kings ruled first prussia , then germany from 1701 to 1918 you mention bismarck .
he plays less of a role in your book than in most works of prussian history .
why is that ? in some ways i think bismarck turned his back on prussia .
king friedrich wilhelm iv of prussia said in 1848 : " prussia will be henceforth merged into germany . "
and i think he got it right that the process of national consolidation that bismarck saw as a continuation of prussian security policy would ultimately not prussianize germany , but germanize prussia , and that everything the old prussia stood for would be lost .
so in some ways i see bismarck as the first executor of a kind of closing-down sale of prussia and prussian tradition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historian christopher clark says prussia was never the bad guy of europe but was n't nationalism something inevitable that was going to happen sooner or later ?
or can one imagine a scenario in which prussia would still exist today ? that 's a really good question and a difficult one to answer .
although historians usually rear up in horror at the notion , i think it was probably inevitable .
if you think about the other multi-national states that existed in the 19th century , russia , for example , or the austro-hungarian empire , both of them disappeared in the course of the world war i and were replaced by something radically different .
it seems to me that these pre-national , multi-ethnic commonwealths that were such a feature of europe in the early modern period were probably doomed to go under . let 's backtrack now and talk about the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries and prussia under friedrich the great .
you describe especially the prussian capital berlin as a vibrant , even libidinous place during his reign .
would you have liked to live there ? i think there would have been wonderful things about being in berlin in the 1780s and 90s .
berlin , if you compare it with london or paris , has the reputation of being boring .
but , that does n't mean berlin was dead or lacked an urbane identity .
and this identity was not driven by the projection of power through the dynasty and its monumental public buildings .
the new culture that emerged was driven by voluntary impulses from civil society .
there was a proliferation of clubs and organizations for all sorts of purposes - cultivating the sciences , for instance , or looking at economical ways of using fuel .
there were literary societies and freemason lodges .
it was an endless cornucopia of little voluntary initiatives .
the point i was trying to make is that this created a city that was n't just about courts or courtliness but about courtesy and civility of a very middle-class , bourgeois kind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arrogance of emperor wilhelm ii and his generals led to defeat in world war i many historians draw links between prussia and nazism .
although no one would claim prussia was the cradle of the ideology , some people see connections between prussian militarism and subservience and the third reich .
but , you portray prussia more as a source of opposition . if it were true that prussia created an environment that deadened the will of ordinary citizens and turned them into instruments of state power , thereby blazing a trail for a totalitarian dictatorship in which people would do anything they were told , it would be very easy to test that hypothesis .
all you 'd have to show is that germans of prussian provenance made better and more obedient nazis than people from austria , baden-württemberg and so on .
if that had been the case , it would be more than obvious .
but it is n't .
there is simply no evidence .
on the contrary , people from baden-württemberg and especially austria made for equally keen nazis , with austrians , for example , being hugely overrepresented in the machinery of nazi genocide .
it 's just simply not the case that you can map out a relationship between prussia and nazism that made people into better tools of the regime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president paul von hindenburg appointed hitler as chancellor in 1933 of course , prussia is implicated in the story of the events that brought hitler to power .
the old prussian elites played a key role in cooking up the plan to put hitler into power as german chancellor in 1933 .
not because they wanted the third reich , but because they thought they could use hitler in a kind of conservative coup against the weimar republic .
of course , they were disastrously wrong .
the corporate arrogance of the prussian nobility helps to explain why some perfectly intelligent people failed to recognize the danger hitler presented . but national socialism was in many respects the exact opposite pole of prussiandom .
the old prussian state had been about the authority of government and the rule of law , but the new nazi reich was about the people .
it was an ethnic entity .
the nazis did n't care about laws .
to them , laws were utterly secondary .
what mattered was the führer as the expression of the will of the volk .
this was an idea that had no precedent in prussian history whatsoever .
so i see a very strong antipathy between the two forms of state . christopher clark is senior lecturer in modern european history at st. catharine 's college , university of cambridge . interview by jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

currently , new cars emit some 160 grams on average . should they not comply to the guidelines , automakers are to face steep fines . with several commissioners dissenting , the european commission - the eu 's executive arm - agreed on a four-year phase-in period from 2012 for the fines . " this will send a strong signal to the world about the determination of the european union to take bold measures on climate change , " eu environment commissioner stavros dimas said at a press conference . germany says the plan will not be effective the proposed legislation enraged germany and its carmakers .

but putting on a band-aid now wo n't help later , says dw 's karl zawadzky . 2006 was the best year so far in the business cycle .
germany 's economic performance climbed 2.9 percent - the strongest growth in six years .
this year , economic growth is at 2.5 percent . there is a close connection between the growth rates in 2006 and 2007 .
due to the drastic three-percent hike on added-value tax on jan .
1 , many consumers pushed up the purchase of more expensive items - from cars to home decoration items to computers , so it 's no surprise that the 2006 boom could n't continue into 2007 . the tax increase is no longer an issue , but there are plenty of other factors disrupting the economy . us real estate crisis leaves lasting mark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the us , the upswing that followed the real estate and mortgage crisis is now losing steam .
but , it 's even worse : many already see the specter of a recession in the us .
that dampens the mood world-wide since the us is by far the largest economy and a key player in the global financial system . the mortgage crisis hurt business for banks around the world .
everyone wanted to make a profit with the bad mortgages and they all lost - not just the american banks , but also large swiss banks and german savings banks . once again , greed conquered reason .
the result will burden the economy for some time to come . then there are high oil prices and the expensive euro .
the scarcity of raw materials around the world , in part due to strong demand in china , is also driving prices up .
rising prices detract from consumers ' purchasing power and they 're holding on to their money - which , in turn , weakens demand . exports and foreign investment are up nevertheless , " the german economy continues to experience a solid upswing , " said the german federal bank in its most recent report on the state of the economy . there are good reasons for this .
all over the world - especially in the resource-rich emerging nations with high export receipts and , in some cases , huge foreign currency reserves - investments are being made in infrastructure and industry , and the new wealth is being vigorously consumed . germany delivers more high-quality goods than any other country , whether they are machines , manufacturing plants , luxury cars or top-end food products .
what 's more , companies in germany not only have a suitable range of export products , but also offer excellent service . during the last few years of economic decline at home , companies expanded immensely on the world market , which is now paying off .
as a result , not only have exports hit a record high but domestic investment is booming as well , as many companies adjust their production capacity to meet increased demand . otherwise strong economy hurt by external factors however , the economic slump in the us , the problems with the banks , the high oil prices and the expensive euro have dragged down the economy 's upward slope .
respectively , the federal bank has predicted 1.9 percent growth in 2008 , while some economic research institutions foresee only 1.5 to 1.6 percent . hence , the upturn will continue , just with considerably less gusto . no one can reliably predict whether the economy will rebound again in 2009 or whether the current economic cycle is already drawing to a close .
on the one hand , the german economy is resting on a much stronger foundation than in earlier years , but on the other hand , the rising inflation rate is increasingly becoming a reason for concern . in november , price inflation was 3.1 percent higher than what it had been a year earlier , which is significantly greater than the two-percent window tolerated by the european central bank . the currency guardians should respond with an interest rate increase , but that 's not possible due to the bank crisis .
instead , central banks around the world are pumping billions and billions into circulation , which only intensifies inflationary tendencies . what may seem necessary today can strangle the economic upswing in the mid-term . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but , that did n't stop the german translation from cracking the 2007 bestseller lists .
he talked about prussia 's appeal . dw-world.de : are you surprised that an academic book on prussia could make the german bestseller lists ? christopher clark : i certainly did n't expect success on that level .
i think it 's a case of timing .
the fall of the berlin wall and german re-unification have triggered a process of re-imagining the german past in general and prussia in particular .
so much of what was left of the old prussian state was in former communist east germany , so it was kind of locked away .
with the re-unification of germany , it all became visible and got reconnected to the larger german national entity .
that and the opening up of archives of the former east germany prompted a rethink .

prussia was a relatively enlightened , progressive state that inadvertently destroyed itself when it enlisted the force of german nationalism .

in older historical literature , nationalism was seen as the culmination of prussian history .
prussia 's task in history had been to create the german nation .
just as we today tend to see the rise of the third reich in 1933 as the end of an era and explain how germany got to that point , previous generations tried to explain how german history had got to 1871 and the creation of the german empire .
and the answer was that prussia was the steering , shaping and sometimes manipulative power that would bring the german nation into existence .
the emergence of the german nation is the thing that gives meaning to the whole history of prussia . that , in my view , is completely and utterly wrong .
throughout its history prussia had been the most un-national state you can imagine , partly because it contained such large numbers of non-germans , but also because the whole idea of its existence was that of the sovereign , monarchical state , interwoven with the idea of the sovereignty of law . these were ideas that had nothing to do with the uprising of a national movement .
prussia responded very hostilely to early german nationalism because the hohenzollern rulers rightly recognized that it would act like a kind of corrosive acid eating away at everything the prussian state stood for . it was only during the unstable period of the 1850s , 60s and 70s that prussian statesmen , particularly prussian prime minister and german chancellor otto von bismarck , began to imagine that they could tame nationalism .
but that was something they failed to do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hohenzollern kings ruled first prussia , then germany from 1701 to 1918 you mention bismarck .
he plays less of a role in your book than in most works of prussian history .
why is that ? in some ways i think bismarck turned his back on prussia .
king friedrich wilhelm iv of prussia said in 1848 : " prussia will be henceforth merged into germany . "
and i think he got it right that the process of national consolidation that bismarck saw as a continuation of prussian security policy would ultimately not prussianize germany , but germanize prussia , and that everything the old prussia stood for would be lost .
so in some ways i see bismarck as the first executor of a kind of closing-down sale of prussia and prussian tradition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historian christopher clark says prussia was never the bad guy of europe but was n't nationalism something inevitable that was going to happen sooner or later ?
or can one imagine a scenario in which prussia would still exist today ? that 's a really good question and a difficult one to answer .
although historians usually rear up in horror at the notion , i think it was probably inevitable .
if you think about the other multi-national states that existed in the 19th century , russia , for example , or the austro-hungarian empire , both of them disappeared in the course of the world war i and were replaced by something radically different .
it seems to me that these pre-national , multi-ethnic commonwealths that were such a feature of europe in the early modern period were probably doomed to go under . let 's backtrack now and talk about the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries and prussia under friedrich the great .
you describe especially the prussian capital berlin as a vibrant , even libidinous place during his reign .
would you have liked to live there ? i think there would have been wonderful things about being in berlin in the 1780s and 90s .
berlin , if you compare it with london or paris , has the reputation of being boring .
but , that does n't mean berlin was dead or lacked an urbane identity .
and this identity was not driven by the projection of power through the dynasty and its monumental public buildings .
the new culture that emerged was driven by voluntary impulses from civil society .
there was a proliferation of clubs and organizations for all sorts of purposes - cultivating the sciences , for instance , or looking at economical ways of using fuel .
there were literary societies and freemason lodges .
it was an endless cornucopia of little voluntary initiatives .
the point i was trying to make is that this created a city that was n't just about courts or courtliness but about courtesy and civility of a very middle-class , bourgeois kind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arrogance of emperor wilhelm ii and his generals led to defeat in world war i many historians draw links between prussia and nazism .
although no one would claim prussia was the cradle of the ideology , some people see connections between prussian militarism and subservience and the third reich .
but , you portray prussia more as a source of opposition . if it were true that prussia created an environment that deadened the will of ordinary citizens and turned them into instruments of state power , thereby blazing a trail for a totalitarian dictatorship in which people would do anything they were told , it would be very easy to test that hypothesis .
all you 'd have to show is that germans of prussian provenance made better and more obedient nazis than people from austria , baden-württemberg and so on .
if that had been the case , it would be more than obvious .
but it is n't .
there is simply no evidence .
on the contrary , people from baden-württemberg and especially austria made for equally keen nazis , with austrians , for example , being hugely overrepresented in the machinery of nazi genocide .
it 's just simply not the case that you can map out a relationship between prussia and nazism that made people into better tools of the regime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president paul von hindenburg appointed hitler as chancellor in 1933 of course , prussia is implicated in the story of the events that brought hitler to power .
the old prussian elites played a key role in cooking up the plan to put hitler into power as german chancellor in 1933 .
not because they wanted the third reich , but because they thought they could use hitler in a kind of conservative coup against the weimar republic .
of course , they were disastrously wrong .
the corporate arrogance of the prussian nobility helps to explain why some perfectly intelligent people failed to recognize the danger hitler presented . but national socialism was in many respects the exact opposite pole of prussiandom .
the old prussian state had been about the authority of government and the rule of law , but the new nazi reich was about the people .
it was an ethnic entity .
the nazis did n't care about laws .
to them , laws were utterly secondary .
what mattered was the führer as the expression of the will of the volk .
this was an idea that had no precedent in prussian history whatsoever .
so i see a very strong antipathy between the two forms of state . christopher clark is senior lecturer in modern european history at st. catharine 's college , university of cambridge . interview by jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but solving chronic high unemployment and xenophobic tendencies may take a while . deutsche welle : minister tiefensee , you not only serve as transport minister but also oversee the development of eastern germany .
what are your duties in this position ? wolfgang tiefensee : the new german states are still a part of our country that requires special attention and devotion .
that 's why the government has set up a post to coordinate these tasks .
the commissioner works together with ministers from all departments - labor market policy , economic policy , education , research and many other areas are all important for eastern germany .
the commissioner coordinates , gives ideas and advocates the interests of the new states . germany 's reunification happened in 1990 .
how much longer will it be necessary to have a commissioner of this kind ? i think it makes sense to coordinate these tasks .
they are connected , and i think the job will exist for a while .
financial support for the eastern states continues until 2019 - perhaps that 's the point by which things will have to have normalized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany is becoming a leader in renewable energies , said tiefensee will the standards of living in the east and west be similar by then ? actually , in the eastern states , we do n't want to imitate the western ones or become like other western european cities .
it 's more about taking a similar approach in the east and west to the challenges that confront germany and europe .
the pre-existing conditions vary .
i think that the eastern states have a natural advantage - especially in new industrial sectors like renewable energy , it and biotechnology , for example . investing late in new sectors means a more modern approach to investing , and that 's already become apparent .
as far as renewable energy goes , every second job in germany is in eastern germany . nevertheless , unemployment in the new states is still twice as high as in western germany .
when do you think this will even out ? that 's the most difficult question .
in the eastern states , unemployment is way above 13 percent , while it 's at 6 percent in the western states .
in addition , those without jobs in eastern germany are unemployed for long periods of time - for 12 or even 24 months - and get stuck in this chronic unemployment with no chance of breaking back into the job market . how long will this continue ?
we have to think long-term , because chronic unemployment can only be reduced very slowly .
the eastern regions of the new states are experiencing an economic upswing .
but this has n't yet had enough of an effect on the job market .
i think it will take at least another 10 years to reduce unemployment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremism has a larger following in eastern germany people from minority or foreign backgrounds tend to shy away from the eastern states .
some decide not to work or study there because they 're afraid of being assaulted by neo-nazis .
can you understand these concerns ? yes , unfortunately it is the case that the number of xenophobic crimes is higher in the east than in the west .
on the other hand , the big cities and many of the medium-sized cities are great places for foreigners to study or work as engineers or skilled laborers . many people actually prefer the eastern german states because they can also be particularly hospitable .
this is left over from communist east germany , when people had a totally different way of interacting with each other . there are many initiatives in place that are committed to breaking down xenophobia .

does eastern germany have a different value system than western germany ? i do n't think so , but of course 40 years of the gdr did n't go by without having an effect on the population and on individuals .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern germany -pipe- 19.12.2007 east germany forges path independent of west , says minister großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tiefensee grew up in communist east germany germany 's eastern states are n't out to mimic the west , german minister wolfgang tiefensee told deutsche welle .
but solving chronic high unemployment and xenophobic tendencies may take a while . deutsche welle : minister tiefensee , you not only serve as transport minister but also oversee the development of eastern germany .
what are your duties in this position ? wolfgang tiefensee : the new german states are still a part of our country that requires special attention and devotion .
that 's why the government has set up a post to coordinate these tasks .
the commissioner works together with ministers from all departments - labor market policy , economic policy , education , research and many other areas are all important for eastern germany .
the commissioner coordinates , gives ideas and advocates the interests of the new states . germany 's reunification happened in 1990 .
how much longer will it be necessary to have a commissioner of this kind ? i think it makes sense to coordinate these tasks .
they are connected , and i think the job will exist for a while .
financial support for the eastern states continues until 2019 - perhaps that 's the point by which things will have to have normalized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany is becoming a leader in renewable energies , said tiefensee will the standards of living in the east and west be similar by then ? actually , in the eastern states , we do n't want to imitate the western ones or become like other western european cities .
it 's more about taking a similar approach in the east and west to the challenges that confront germany and europe .
the pre-existing conditions vary .
i think that the eastern states have a natural advantage - especially in new industrial sectors like renewable energy , it and biotechnology , for example . investing late in new sectors means a more modern approach to investing , and that 's already become apparent .
as far as renewable energy goes , every second job in germany is in eastern germany . nevertheless , unemployment in the new states is still twice as high as in western germany .
when do you think this will even out ? that 's the most difficult question .
in the eastern states , unemployment is way above 13 percent , while it 's at 6 percent in the western states .
in addition , those without jobs in eastern germany are unemployed for long periods of time - for 12 or even 24 months - and get stuck in this chronic unemployment with no chance of breaking back into the job market . how long will this continue ?
we have to think long-term , because chronic unemployment can only be reduced very slowly .
the eastern regions of the new states are experiencing an economic upswing .
but this has n't yet had enough of an effect on the job market .
i think it will take at least another 10 years to reduce unemployment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremism has a larger following in eastern germany people from minority or foreign backgrounds tend to shy away from the eastern states .
some decide not to work or study there because they 're afraid of being assaulted by neo-nazis .
can you understand these concerns ? yes , unfortunately it is the case that the number of xenophobic crimes is higher in the east than in the west .
on the other hand , the big cities and many of the medium-sized cities are great places for foreigners to study or work as engineers or skilled laborers . many people actually prefer the eastern german states because they can also be particularly hospitable .
this is left over from communist east germany , when people had a totally different way of interacting with each other . there are many initiatives in place that are committed to breaking down xenophobia .
often , because there are too few foreigners , people often do n't know what they 're talking about and arrive at negative judgments .
if the number of foreign residents were to increase gradually , then i 'm sure that reservations about them would gradually decrease . you mentioned traditional hospitality in the east .
does eastern germany have a different value system than western germany ? i do n't think so , but of course 40 years of the gdr did n't go by without having an effect on the population and on individuals .
for 40 years , we could n't travel where we wanted to .
studying abroad was out of the question .
we could n't freely organize clubs or political parties like people in the western states and in western europe could .
all of that has left its mark . on the other hand , we ca n't forget that these were the people - just like in poland or czechoslovakia - who prepared the peaceful revolution and the globalchange that came with it .
the forces involved developed under a dictatorship , and the will to create something is still evident today .
people are very happy about finally being able to take responsibility . i do n't think that 's a different value system , particularly since the younger generation is assimilating anyway . interview : miodrag soric -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

turkey came a small step closer towards european union membership on wednesday , dec .
19 , starting negotiations on two new policy areas .
ankara seized the opportunity to attack some states ' attempts to block its entry . this means that six chapters have been opened until now .
to conclude the accession process , talks have to be completed in thirty-five different fields . speaking after a different meeting in brussels , the eu commissioner in charge of enlargement , finland 's olli rehn , said that all member states had reaffirmed their wish to see accession talks continue , adding that the opening of the two chapters on wednesday should be taken as proof that " the eu sticks to its commitments and keeps its word . " ankara began eu entry talks in 2005 , but they have moved forward very slowly because of rows over cyprus and human rights .
eight negotiating chapters have been blocked since the end of last year because of turkey 's refusal to open its ports and airports to traffic from eu member cyprus .
turkey 's negotiations are expected to last at least a decade , with no guarantee of membership at the end of it all .
ankara criticizes blocking maneuver bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french prime minister is the most vociferous opponent of turkish membership after the formal opening of talks on health and consumer protection and trans-european transport networks , turkish foreign minister ali babacan criticized attempts by individual eu member states to block turkey 's entry bid .
" it is obvious that certain eu member states are trying to erode political and legal aspects of the accession process , " he said .
babacan did not name any names , but french prime minister nicolas sarkozy has been leading the lobby to keep turkey out of the european union . he favors a special partnership with the mainly muslim country instead of full membership .
babacan also stressed that all eu heads of state had agreed in december 2004 to the start of accession talks with turkey .
he said a change of government should not have an impact on this promise .
" we expect all eu member states to stick to that , " he said .
eu states look into the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu member states are divided over whether turkey belongs in the bloc at last friday 's eu summit , members agreed to create a group to study the long-term future of europe .
european union leaders named former spanish prime minister felipe gonzales , a past critic of turkey 's entry bid , to head the group .
a spokesman said gonzales had modified his position and now says the eu should honor any commitments it has made to turkey .
spain , britain , italy and sweden are among the eu states keenest to keep its membership bid on track .
germany 's governing christian democrats are opposed to turkish entry , but chancellor angela merkel did nothing to attempt to stop the opening of further negotiations . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but putting on a band-aid now wo n't help later , says dw 's karl zawadzky . 2006 was the best year so far in the business cycle .
germany 's economic performance climbed 2.9 percent - the strongest growth in six years .
this year , economic growth is at 2.5 percent . there is a close connection between the growth rates in 2006 and 2007 .
due to the drastic three-percent hike on added-value tax on jan .
1 , many consumers pushed up the purchase of more expensive items - from cars to home decoration items to computers , so it 's no surprise that the 2006 boom could n't continue into 2007 . the tax increase is no longer an issue , but there are plenty of other factors disrupting the economy . us real estate crisis leaves lasting mark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the us , the upswing that followed the real estate and mortgage crisis is now losing steam .
but , it 's even worse : many already see the specter of a recession in the us .
that dampens the mood world-wide since the us is by far the largest economy and a key player in the global financial system . the mortgage crisis hurt business for banks around the world .
everyone wanted to make a profit with the bad mortgages and they all lost - not just the american banks , but also large swiss banks and german savings banks . once again , greed conquered reason .
the result will burden the economy for some time to come . then there are high oil prices and the expensive euro .
the scarcity of raw materials around the world , in part due to strong demand in china , is also driving prices up .
rising prices detract from consumers ' purchasing power and they 're holding on to their money - which , in turn , weakens demand . exports and foreign investment are up nevertheless , " the german economy continues to experience a solid upswing , " said the german federal bank in its most recent report on the state of the economy . there are good reasons for this .
all over the world - especially in the resource-rich emerging nations with high export receipts and , in some cases , huge foreign currency reserves - investments are being made in infrastructure and industry , and the new wealth is being vigorously consumed . germany delivers more high-quality goods than any other country , whether they are machines , manufacturing plants , luxury cars or top-end food products .
what 's more , companies in germany not only have a suitable range of export products , but also offer excellent service . during the last few years of economic decline at home , companies expanded immensely on the world market , which is now paying off .
as a result , not only have exports hit a record high but domestic investment is booming as well , as many companies adjust their production capacity to meet increased demand . otherwise strong economy hurt by external factors however , the economic slump in the us , the problems with the banks , the high oil prices and the expensive euro have dragged down the economy 's upward slope .
respectively , the federal bank has predicted 1.9 percent growth in 2008 , while some economic research institutions foresee only 1.5 to 1.6 percent . hence , the upturn will continue , just with considerably less gusto . no one can reliably predict whether the economy will rebound again in 2009 or whether the current economic cycle is already drawing to a close .
on the one hand , the german economy is resting on a much stronger foundation than in earlier years , but on the other hand , the rising inflation rate is increasingly becoming a reason for concern . in november , price inflation was 3.1 percent higher than what it had been a year earlier , which is significantly greater than the two-percent window tolerated by the european central bank . the currency guardians should respond with an interest rate increase , but that 's not possible due to the bank crisis .
instead , central banks around the world are pumping billions and billions into circulation , which only intensifies inflationary tendencies . what may seem necessary today can strangle the economic upswing in the mid-term . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 19.12.2007 all-star german band puts sgt. pepper 's on stage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the beatles made it , but it took a bunch of germans to put it on stage the beatles never performed their most famous album live .
to rectify that , film director wolfgang becker has formed a band to play sgt. pepper 's lonely hearts club band from start to finish .
but do they pull it off ? four decades on from the release in 1967 of what is arguably the most famous album in pop music , " sgt. pepper 's lonely hearts club band " was set to be performed live at a large musical theater in central berlin on wednesday night .
the concert was the brainchild of german film director and beatles ' fanatic wolfgang becker , best known for his international hit " goodbye lenin . "
it 's the end result of an idea that grew beyond all proportions .
" originally , the plan was to just play acoustically in someone 's kitchen , " becker told dw-world .
" then we thought we 'd do it in a bar .
but it just kept growing and growing . "
and grown it has .
becker 's band now consists of dozens of musicians - some professionals , some gifted amateurs - including directorial colleague tom tykwer .
a forty-person choir sings background vocals , and indian musicians have been enlisted to play george harrison 's raga-inflected " within you , without you . "
with a little help from his friends bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang becker has taken beatlemania to new extremes the ensemble first performed the record at a private party in a berlin club this summer .
word of the gig spread , and a local radio station contacted becker about playing it in public as part of the station 's anniversary celebrations .
" i 'm not really nervous , " becker said ahead of the gig .
" but when people are paying money to get in , you do feel a different sense of responsibility . "
the musicians begin with the title track and continue on through the fab four 's psychedelic opus , concluding with what some consider lennon and mccartney 's finest composition , " a day in life . "
the band 's musical co-leader niko weidemann said playing the full record presents some unusual challenges .
" the individual songs are not all that difficult to play , but if you look at it as a total work , it can be tricky , " he said .
" we listened to the original album , and what we heard was how the beatles really pushed the limits with the restricted means at their disposal .
they never intended to perform the record live - it 's a studio production full of overdubs .
but when it is played live on stage by a big band with a brass section and a choir , it 's really fantastic . "
the one and only billy shears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a four-piece band , there was no way the beatles could perform sgt. pepper 's live whether becker 's band is authentic is anyone 's guess .
but there 's something fittingly ironic about a group of latter-day fab four fanatics covering a concept record about a fictional band as played by the beatles .
and the performance suggests that had the liverpool quartet played " pepper 's " live , it might well have rocked - a good thing since becker has invested considerable time and money in the project .
" if you go to wolfgang 's home , it 's absolutely full of beatles ' records , posters and memoriabilia , " said adrian kennedy , a dw-tv producer and on-air personality who serves as the emcee .
" i do n't think he 's making any money from it .
it 's just for the love of the music . "
even more ironically , " sgt. pepper 's " is n't even becker 's favorite beatles album .
" no , that would be ' revolver ' , " becker said .
" but we completely forgot the fortieth anniversary of that record , and we were determined not to miss another opportunity again . "
audience members have been asked to dress up in 1960s style , and a " lovely rita " award will be handed out after the famous final piano chord of " a day in the life " has finished reverberating in the rafters . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

to rectify that , film director wolfgang becker has formed a band to play sgt. pepper 's lonely hearts club band from start to finish .
but do they pull it off ? four decades on from the release in 1967 of what is arguably the most famous album in pop music , " sgt. pepper 's lonely hearts club band " was set to be performed live at a large musical theater in central berlin on wednesday night .
the concert was the brainchild of german film director and beatles ' fanatic wolfgang becker , best known for his international hit " goodbye lenin . "
it 's the end result of an idea that grew beyond all proportions .
" originally , the plan was to just play acoustically in someone 's kitchen , " becker told dw-world .
" then we thought we 'd do it in a bar .
but it just kept growing and growing . "
and grown it has .
becker 's band now consists of dozens of musicians - some professionals , some gifted amateurs - including directorial colleague tom tykwer .

" i 'm not really nervous , " becker said ahead of the gig .
" but when people are paying money to get in , you do feel a different sense of responsibility . "
the musicians begin with the title track and continue on through the fab four 's psychedelic opus , concluding with what some consider lennon and mccartney 's finest composition , " a day in life . "
the band 's musical co-leader niko weidemann said playing the full record presents some unusual challenges .
" the individual songs are not all that difficult to play , but if you look at it as a total work , it can be tricky , " he said .
" we listened to the original album , and what we heard was how the beatles really pushed the limits with the restricted means at their disposal .
they never intended to perform the record live - it 's a studio production full of overdubs .
but when it is played live on stage by a big band with a brass section and a choir , it 's really fantastic . "
the one and only billy shears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a four-piece band , there was no way the beatles could perform sgt. pepper 's live whether becker 's band is authentic is anyone 's guess .
but there 's something fittingly ironic about a group of latter-day fab four fanatics covering a concept record about a fictional band as played by the beatles .
and the performance suggests that had the liverpool quartet played " pepper 's " live , it might well have rocked - a good thing since becker has invested considerable time and money in the project .
" if you go to wolfgang 's home , it 's absolutely full of beatles ' records , posters and memoriabilia , " said adrian kennedy , a dw-tv producer and on-air personality who serves as the emcee .

but putting on a band-aid now wo n't help later , says dw 's karl zawadzky . 2006 was the best year so far in the business cycle .
germany 's economic performance climbed 2.9 percent - the strongest growth in six years .
this year , economic growth is at 2.5 percent . there is a close connection between the growth rates in 2006 and 2007 .
due to the drastic three-percent hike on added-value tax on jan .
1 , many consumers pushed up the purchase of more expensive items - from cars to home decoration items to computers , so it 's no surprise that the 2006 boom could n't continue into 2007 . the tax increase is no longer an issue , but there are plenty of other factors disrupting the economy . us real estate crisis leaves lasting mark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the us , the upswing that followed the real estate and mortgage crisis is now losing steam .
but , it 's even worse : many already see the specter of a recession in the us .
that dampens the mood world-wide since the us is by far the largest economy and a key player in the global financial system . the mortgage crisis hurt business for banks around the world .
everyone wanted to make a profit with the bad mortgages and they all lost - not just the american banks , but also large swiss banks and german savings banks . once again , greed conquered reason .
the result will burden the economy for some time to come . then there are high oil prices and the expensive euro .
the scarcity of raw materials around the world , in part due to strong demand in china , is also driving prices up .
rising prices detract from consumers ' purchasing power and they 're holding on to their money - which , in turn , weakens demand . exports and foreign investment are up nevertheless , " the german economy continues to experience a solid upswing , " said the german federal bank in its most recent report on the state of the economy . there are good reasons for this .
all over the world - especially in the resource-rich emerging nations with high export receipts and , in some cases , huge foreign currency reserves - investments are being made in infrastructure and industry , and the new wealth is being vigorously consumed . germany delivers more high-quality goods than any other country , whether they are machines , manufacturing plants , luxury cars or top-end food products .
what 's more , companies in germany not only have a suitable range of export products , but also offer excellent service . during the last few years of economic decline at home , companies expanded immensely on the world market , which is now paying off .
as a result , not only have exports hit a record high but domestic investment is booming as well , as many companies adjust their production capacity to meet increased demand . otherwise strong economy hurt by external factors however , the economic slump in the us , the problems with the banks , the high oil prices and the expensive euro have dragged down the economy 's upward slope .
respectively , the federal bank has predicted 1.9 percent growth in 2008 , while some economic research institutions foresee only 1.5 to 1.6 percent . hence , the upturn will continue , just with considerably less gusto . no one can reliably predict whether the economy will rebound again in 2009 or whether the current economic cycle is already drawing to a close .
on the one hand , the german economy is resting on a much stronger foundation than in earlier years , but on the other hand , the rising inflation rate is increasingly becoming a reason for concern . in november , price inflation was 3.1 percent higher than what it had been a year earlier , which is significantly greater than the two-percent window tolerated by the european central bank . the currency guardians should respond with an interest rate increase , but that 's not possible due to the bank crisis .
instead , central banks around the world are pumping billions and billions into circulation , which only intensifies inflationary tendencies . what may seem necessary today can strangle the economic upswing in the mid-term . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the measures are intended to curb global warming . under the plans , automobile manufacturers would have to reduce carbon emissions produced by their fleets of passenger cars to an average of 120 grams per kilometer by 2012 .
currently , new cars emit some 160 grams on average . should they not comply to the guidelines , automakers are to face steep fines . with several commissioners dissenting , the european commission - the eu 's executive arm - agreed on a four-year phase-in period from 2012 for the fines . " this will send a strong signal to the world about the determination of the european union to take bold measures on climate change , " eu environment commissioner stavros dimas said at a press conference . germany says the plan will not be effective the proposed legislation enraged germany and its carmakers .
german chancellor angela merkel said the eu was making policy " at the expense of germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler , bmw and porsche could face difficulties meeting the targets government spokesman thomas steg said the measures were biased against german companies , which tend to make bigger and more powerful vehicles .
" whatever motive led a majority of commissioners to decide this , we consider the solution to be wrong , we consider the solution to be very harmful and will do everything to force changes , " he said .
steg said that the plans would threaten jobs , hinder innovation and fail to be an effective instrument for climate protection .
environment minister sigmar gabriel also slammed the proposals , saying that they favored italian and french car makers .
speaking on german television , he criticized the fact that the limits would apply to a car manufacturers ' fleet , meaning that a manufacturer such as fiat with its numerous small models would not have to cut the emissions of its high-end cars .
according to the european commission 's plans , penalties on companies will start at 20 euros -lrb- $ 29 -rrb- per excess gram of co2 and rise to 95 euros in 2016 .
opinions split on the issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany says firms such as fiat will get off lightly eu commission president jose manuel barroso hailed the new measures , which still need the backing of eu states and the european parliament .
" this proposal demonstrates that the european union is committed to being a world leader in cutting co2 emissions and the development of a low carbon economy , " he said .
" at the same time , we are committed to promoting the competitiveness of our industry and its global technological leadership , " barroso added .
the environmental group greenpeace said the proposals did not go far enough , accusing the eu executive of backing down in the face of lobbying from the auto industry .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 19.12.2007 lucio : a kaka or ronaldinho would n't come to munich großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio is a bayern mainstay , but he does n't plan on staying forever defender lucimar ferreira da silva - lucio , for short - is captain of the brazilian national team and the anchor of bayern munich 's back four .
and that , he told dw-world , is all he wants from his german club . dw-world.de : oliver kahn got himself suspended from the last league game of 2007 and has feuded with much of the squad .
could you see yourself taking over from him as bayern 's regular captain ?
lucio : i would n't dream of becoming bayern munich 's captain .
it 's not my life 's goal , and i would n't fight for the position .
as far as i 'm concerned there 'll be no squabbling with my teammates over it .
the coach decides who 's captain .
i wo n't lie and say it would n't be flattering to be singled out for this responsibility , but i 'm not concerned with having a special status - that means nothing to me .
i 'll keep on the way i always have .
i 'm not looking to inherit the captaincy .
but you have served as bayern 's captain for the odd game .
did you not like it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strikers beware - lucio is one of the league most hard-nosed defenders of course it was a great experience .
but it did n't change me or the way i work with the team .
the best part was the feeling that the coach trusts me , that he and the team have faith in me .
in the period when i was captain , the atmosphere was great , really relaxed .
the team assistants and physiotherapists were in a good mood , always making jokes with me .
is the position first and foremost a matter of discipline ?
discipline is important , but a captain needs other qualities as well .
he has to lead by example .
he has to be someone who works hard , who shows respect for the coach and his teammates and who always gives his best for the club .
at bayern i 've always stood for these qualities .
that 's why i was allowed to be captain on occasion .
but as the captain of the brazilian national team , you surely must feel you 're entitled to the same position at bayern munich .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio 's season was going wll until he was suspended for four games for elbowing an opponent i did n't try to become captain of brazil .
it just happened , and i 'm very honored to have been given such an enormous responsibility .
thus far it 's gone well .
my teammates like me , and we get along well with one another .
you would n't have too many problems dealing with players like miroslav klose , luca toni or franck ribery , if you can lead a squad with stars like ronaldinho , kaka or robinho .
i 've known stars like kaka or ronaldinho both professionally and personally for quite some time .
they always listened to me and followed my advice , even when i was n't captain .
and when they tell me something , i listen to them too .
that 's why i have no problems fulfilling my responsibilities in the national team .
so ca n't you convince a kaka or ronaldinho to come to bayern ?
i do n't think they 'll be coming any time soon .
why not ?
it 's next to impossible to convince brazilian stars who can play in italy or spain to come to germany .
it 's not a question of the club , but the country .
the culture , lifestyle and language in italy and spain are fairly brazilian .
bayern ca n't compete .
you do n't try to sell bayern munich to your teammates in the brazilian national squad , as luca toni supposedly does with italy ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio won the world cup with brazil in 2002 as i said , for the reasons i 've just mentioned , bayern munich is a product that 's hard to market .
it 's difficult for me to sell the club to superstars like kaka , ronaldinho or robinho .
there are a few who would believe me - but they 're the ones who already play in the bundesliga .
for example , diego , naldo , gilberto , mineiro and josue .
but not ronaldinho or kaka ?
when we exchange impressions , i have to admit it would be easier for them to convince me to leave germany than for me to convince them to come here .
but they have n't succeeded .
you 're still here .
yes , and i intend to see out my current contract , which runs until 2010 .
i still dream of spain or italy .
i 'd love to play there , and perhaps i can fulfill this dream a bit earlier , if the club and i can reach an agreement .
i transferred from leverkusen to munich two years before my contract back then was set to expire .
in soccer , nothing 's beyond discussion , if the opportunities and the will are there .
so at some point you intend to leave germany and head south .
one thing is for sure : after my time at bayern munich , i 'll definitely leave germany . interview by daniel martinez -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but , that did n't stop the german translation from cracking the 2007 bestseller lists .
he talked about prussia 's appeal . dw-world.de : are you surprised that an academic book on prussia could make the german bestseller lists ? christopher clark : i certainly did n't expect success on that level .
i think it 's a case of timing .
the fall of the berlin wall and german re-unification have triggered a process of re-imagining the german past in general and prussia in particular .
so much of what was left of the old prussian state was in former communist east germany , so it was kind of locked away .
with the re-unification of germany , it all became visible and got reconnected to the larger german national entity .
that and the opening up of archives of the former east germany prompted a rethink .
let 's try to sum up your thesis .
prussia was a relatively enlightened , progressive state that inadvertently destroyed itself when it enlisted the force of german nationalism .
is that close ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prussian culture , including architecture , blossomed in the 19th century that 's exactly it .
nationalism was prussia 's downfall .
in older historical literature , nationalism was seen as the culmination of prussian history .
prussia 's task in history had been to create the german nation .
just as we today tend to see the rise of the third reich in 1933 as the end of an era and explain how germany got to that point , previous generations tried to explain how german history had got to 1871 and the creation of the german empire .
and the answer was that prussia was the steering , shaping and sometimes manipulative power that would bring the german nation into existence .
the emergence of the german nation is the thing that gives meaning to the whole history of prussia . that , in my view , is completely and utterly wrong .
throughout its history prussia had been the most un-national state you can imagine , partly because it contained such large numbers of non-germans , but also because the whole idea of its existence was that of the sovereign , monarchical state , interwoven with the idea of the sovereignty of law . these were ideas that had nothing to do with the uprising of a national movement .
prussia responded very hostilely to early german nationalism because the hohenzollern rulers rightly recognized that it would act like a kind of corrosive acid eating away at everything the prussian state stood for . it was only during the unstable period of the 1850s , 60s and 70s that prussian statesmen , particularly prussian prime minister and german chancellor otto von bismarck , began to imagine that they could tame nationalism .
but that was something they failed to do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hohenzollern kings ruled first prussia , then germany from 1701 to 1918 you mention bismarck .
he plays less of a role in your book than in most works of prussian history .
why is that ? in some ways i think bismarck turned his back on prussia .
king friedrich wilhelm iv of prussia said in 1848 : " prussia will be henceforth merged into germany . "
and i think he got it right that the process of national consolidation that bismarck saw as a continuation of prussian security policy would ultimately not prussianize germany , but germanize prussia , and that everything the old prussia stood for would be lost .
so in some ways i see bismarck as the first executor of a kind of closing-down sale of prussia and prussian tradition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historian christopher clark says prussia was never the bad guy of europe but was n't nationalism something inevitable that was going to happen sooner or later ?
or can one imagine a scenario in which prussia would still exist today ? that 's a really good question and a difficult one to answer .
although historians usually rear up in horror at the notion , i think it was probably inevitable .
if you think about the other multi-national states that existed in the 19th century , russia , for example , or the austro-hungarian empire , both of them disappeared in the course of the world war i and were replaced by something radically different .
it seems to me that these pre-national , multi-ethnic commonwealths that were such a feature of europe in the early modern period were probably doomed to go under . let 's backtrack now and talk about the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries and prussia under friedrich the great .
you describe especially the prussian capital berlin as a vibrant , even libidinous place during his reign .
would you have liked to live there ? i think there would have been wonderful things about being in berlin in the 1780s and 90s .
berlin , if you compare it with london or paris , has the reputation of being boring .
but , that does n't mean berlin was dead or lacked an urbane identity .
and this identity was not driven by the projection of power through the dynasty and its monumental public buildings .
the new culture that emerged was driven by voluntary impulses from civil society .
there was a proliferation of clubs and organizations for all sorts of purposes - cultivating the sciences , for instance , or looking at economical ways of using fuel .
there were literary societies and freemason lodges .
it was an endless cornucopia of little voluntary initiatives .
the point i was trying to make is that this created a city that was n't just about courts or courtliness but about courtesy and civility of a very middle-class , bourgeois kind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arrogance of emperor wilhelm ii and his generals led to defeat in world war i many historians draw links between prussia and nazism .
although no one would claim prussia was the cradle of the ideology , some people see connections between prussian militarism and subservience and the third reich .
but , you portray prussia more as a source of opposition . if it were true that prussia created an environment that deadened the will of ordinary citizens and turned them into instruments of state power , thereby blazing a trail for a totalitarian dictatorship in which people would do anything they were told , it would be very easy to test that hypothesis .
all you 'd have to show is that germans of prussian provenance made better and more obedient nazis than people from austria , baden-württemberg and so on .
if that had been the case , it would be more than obvious .
but it is n't .
there is simply no evidence .
on the contrary , people from baden-württemberg and especially austria made for equally keen nazis , with austrians , for example , being hugely overrepresented in the machinery of nazi genocide .
it 's just simply not the case that you can map out a relationship between prussia and nazism that made people into better tools of the regime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president paul von hindenburg appointed hitler as chancellor in 1933 of course , prussia is implicated in the story of the events that brought hitler to power .
the old prussian elites played a key role in cooking up the plan to put hitler into power as german chancellor in 1933 .
not because they wanted the third reich , but because they thought they could use hitler in a kind of conservative coup against the weimar republic .
of course , they were disastrously wrong .
the corporate arrogance of the prussian nobility helps to explain why some perfectly intelligent people failed to recognize the danger hitler presented . but national socialism was in many respects the exact opposite pole of prussiandom .
the old prussian state had been about the authority of government and the rule of law , but the new nazi reich was about the people .
it was an ethnic entity .
the nazis did n't care about laws .
to them , laws were utterly secondary .
what mattered was the führer as the expression of the will of the volk .
this was an idea that had no precedent in prussian history whatsoever .
so i see a very strong antipathy between the two forms of state . christopher clark is senior lecturer in modern european history at st. catharine 's college , university of cambridge . interview by jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but putting on a band-aid now wo n't help later , says dw 's karl zawadzky . 2006 was the best year so far in the business cycle .
germany 's economic performance climbed 2.9 percent - the strongest growth in six years .
this year , economic growth is at 2.5 percent . there is a close connection between the growth rates in 2006 and 2007 .
due to the drastic three-percent hike on added-value tax on jan .
1 , many consumers pushed up the purchase of more expensive items - from cars to home decoration items to computers , so it 's no surprise that the 2006 boom could n't continue into 2007 . the tax increase is no longer an issue , but there are plenty of other factors disrupting the economy . us real estate crisis leaves lasting mark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the us , the upswing that followed the real estate and mortgage crisis is now losing steam .
but , it 's even worse : many already see the specter of a recession in the us .
that dampens the mood world-wide since the us is by far the largest economy and a key player in the global financial system . the mortgage crisis hurt business for banks around the world .
everyone wanted to make a profit with the bad mortgages and they all lost - not just the american banks , but also large swiss banks and german savings banks . once again , greed conquered reason .
the result will burden the economy for some time to come . then there are high oil prices and the expensive euro .
the scarcity of raw materials around the world , in part due to strong demand in china , is also driving prices up .
rising prices detract from consumers ' purchasing power and they 're holding on to their money - which , in turn , weakens demand . exports and foreign investment are up nevertheless , " the german economy continues to experience a solid upswing , " said the german federal bank in its most recent report on the state of the economy . there are good reasons for this .
all over the world - especially in the resource-rich emerging nations with high export receipts and , in some cases , huge foreign currency reserves - investments are being made in infrastructure and industry , and the new wealth is being vigorously consumed . germany delivers more high-quality goods than any other country , whether they are machines , manufacturing plants , luxury cars or top-end food products .
what 's more , companies in germany not only have a suitable range of export products , but also offer excellent service . during the last few years of economic decline at home , companies expanded immensely on the world market , which is now paying off .
as a result , not only have exports hit a record high but domestic investment is booming as well , as many companies adjust their production capacity to meet increased demand . otherwise strong economy hurt by external factors however , the economic slump in the us , the problems with the banks , the high oil prices and the expensive euro have dragged down the economy 's upward slope .
respectively , the federal bank has predicted 1.9 percent growth in 2008 , while some economic research institutions foresee only 1.5 to 1.6 percent . hence , the upturn will continue , just with considerably less gusto . no one can reliably predict whether the economy will rebound again in 2009 or whether the current economic cycle is already drawing to a close .
on the one hand , the german economy is resting on a much stronger foundation than in earlier years , but on the other hand , the rising inflation rate is increasingly becoming a reason for concern . in november , price inflation was 3.1 percent higher than what it had been a year earlier , which is significantly greater than the two-percent window tolerated by the european central bank . the currency guardians should respond with an interest rate increase , but that 's not possible due to the bank crisis .
instead , central banks around the world are pumping billions and billions into circulation , which only intensifies inflationary tendencies . what may seem necessary today can strangle the economic upswing in the mid-term . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the measures are intended to curb global warming . under the plans , automobile manufacturers would have to reduce carbon emissions produced by their fleets of passenger cars to an average of 120 grams per kilometer by 2012 .
currently , new cars emit some 160 grams on average . should they not comply to the guidelines , automakers are to face steep fines . with several commissioners dissenting , the european commission - the eu 's executive arm - agreed on a four-year phase-in period from 2012 for the fines . " this will send a strong signal to the world about the determination of the european union to take bold measures on climate change , " eu environment commissioner stavros dimas said at a press conference . germany says the plan will not be effective the proposed legislation enraged germany and its carmakers .
german chancellor angela merkel said the eu was making policy " at the expense of germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler , bmw and porsche could face difficulties meeting the targets government spokesman thomas steg said the measures were biased against german companies , which tend to make bigger and more powerful vehicles .
" whatever motive led a majority of commissioners to decide this , we consider the solution to be wrong , we consider the solution to be very harmful and will do everything to force changes , " he said .
steg said that the plans would threaten jobs , hinder innovation and fail to be an effective instrument for climate protection .
environment minister sigmar gabriel also slammed the proposals , saying that they favored italian and french car makers .
speaking on german television , he criticized the fact that the limits would apply to a car manufacturers ' fleet , meaning that a manufacturer such as fiat with its numerous small models would not have to cut the emissions of its high-end cars .
according to the european commission 's plans , penalties on companies will start at 20 euros -lrb- $ 29 -rrb- per excess gram of co2 and rise to 95 euros in 2016 .
opinions split on the issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany says firms such as fiat will get off lightly eu commission president jose manuel barroso hailed the new measures , which still need the backing of eu states and the european parliament .
" this proposal demonstrates that the european union is committed to being a world leader in cutting co2 emissions and the development of a low carbon economy , " he said .
" at the same time , we are committed to promoting the competitiveness of our industry and its global technological leadership , " barroso added .
the environmental group greenpeace said the proposals did not go far enough , accusing the eu executive of backing down in the face of lobbying from the auto industry .
" the commission has let car makers drive away with a proposal that sets a weak , short-term standard , lacks any longer-term targets and offers an open road to heavy , gas-guzzling vehicles , " said greenpeace transport policy expert franziska achterberg . . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

turkey came a small step closer towards european union membership on wednesday , dec .
19 , starting negotiations on two new policy areas .
ankara seized the opportunity to attack some states ' attempts to block its entry . this means that six chapters have been opened until now .
to conclude the accession process , talks have to be completed in thirty-five different fields . speaking after a different meeting in brussels , the eu commissioner in charge of enlargement , finland 's olli rehn , said that all member states had reaffirmed their wish to see accession talks continue , adding that the opening of the two chapters on wednesday should be taken as proof that " the eu sticks to its commitments and keeps its word . " ankara began eu entry talks in 2005 , but they have moved forward very slowly because of rows over cyprus and human rights .
eight negotiating chapters have been blocked since the end of last year because of turkey 's refusal to open its ports and airports to traffic from eu member cyprus .
turkey 's negotiations are expected to last at least a decade , with no guarantee of membership at the end of it all .
ankara criticizes blocking maneuver bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french prime minister is the most vociferous opponent of turkish membership after the formal opening of talks on health and consumer protection and trans-european transport networks , turkish foreign minister ali babacan criticized attempts by individual eu member states to block turkey 's entry bid .
" it is obvious that certain eu member states are trying to erode political and legal aspects of the accession process , " he said .
babacan did not name any names , but french prime minister nicolas sarkozy has been leading the lobby to keep turkey out of the european union . he favors a special partnership with the mainly muslim country instead of full membership .
babacan also stressed that all eu heads of state had agreed in december 2004 to the start of accession talks with turkey .
he said a change of government should not have an impact on this promise .
" we expect all eu member states to stick to that , " he said .
eu states look into the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu member states are divided over whether turkey belongs in the bloc at last friday 's eu summit , members agreed to create a group to study the long-term future of europe .
european union leaders named former spanish prime minister felipe gonzales , a past critic of turkey 's entry bid , to head the group .
a spokesman said gonzales had modified his position and now says the eu should honor any commitments it has made to turkey .
spain , britain , italy and sweden are among the eu states keenest to keep its membership bid on track .
germany 's governing christian democrats are opposed to turkish entry , but chancellor angela merkel did nothing to attempt to stop the opening of further negotiations . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" a climate-change war over cars " was how the business weekly wirtschaftswoche described the standoff between one of germany 's largest and most vital industries and the bureaucrats in brussels . it is up to the european commission - the eu 's executive arm - to set out how carmakers should meet the target of cutting emissions to an average of 130 grams / kilometer -lrb- g / km -rrb- among their passenger vehicles from 2012 , and how parts and fuel-makers should knock a further 10 g / km off the average .
the target represents a cut of about 25 percent from current levels . internal commission strife bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checking tire pressure and using biofuels can help reduce emissions the eu 's commissioners , however , remain at odds over several key points . commissioner for enterprise günter verheugen , a staunch defender of the german car industry , has sought to reduce fines on companies that do not cut average emissions to 130 grams per km through engine technology . but environment commission stavros dimas argued for gradually mounting fines from 2012 as an effective deterrent to force manufacturers to invest in clean technology . overall , car parts and fuel-makers are meant to find ways to slash average emissions by a quarter - from the current 160 g / km to 120 g / km .

turkey came a small step closer towards european union membership on wednesday , dec .
19 , starting negotiations on two new policy areas .
ankara seized the opportunity to attack some states ' attempts to block its entry . this means that six chapters have been opened until now .
to conclude the accession process , talks have to be completed in thirty-five different fields . speaking after a different meeting in brussels , the eu commissioner in charge of enlargement , finland 's olli rehn , said that all member states had reaffirmed their wish to see accession talks continue , adding that the opening of the two chapters on wednesday should be taken as proof that " the eu sticks to its commitments and keeps its word . " ankara began eu entry talks in 2005 , but they have moved forward very slowly because of rows over cyprus and human rights .
eight negotiating chapters have been blocked since the end of last year because of turkey 's refusal to open its ports and airports to traffic from eu member cyprus .
turkey 's negotiations are expected to last at least a decade , with no guarantee of membership at the end of it all .
ankara criticizes blocking maneuver bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french prime minister is the most vociferous opponent of turkish membership after the formal opening of talks on health and consumer protection and trans-european transport networks , turkish foreign minister ali babacan criticized attempts by individual eu member states to block turkey 's entry bid .
" it is obvious that certain eu member states are trying to erode political and legal aspects of the accession process , " he said .
babacan did not name any names , but french prime minister nicolas sarkozy has been leading the lobby to keep turkey out of the european union . he favors a special partnership with the mainly muslim country instead of full membership .
babacan also stressed that all eu heads of state had agreed in december 2004 to the start of accession talks with turkey .
he said a change of government should not have an impact on this promise .
" we expect all eu member states to stick to that , " he said .
eu states look into the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu member states are divided over whether turkey belongs in the bloc at last friday 's eu summit , members agreed to create a group to study the long-term future of europe .
european union leaders named former spanish prime minister felipe gonzales , a past critic of turkey 's entry bid , to head the group .
a spokesman said gonzales had modified his position and now says the eu should honor any commitments it has made to turkey .
spain , britain , italy and sweden are among the eu states keenest to keep its membership bid on track .
germany 's governing christian democrats are opposed to turkish entry , but chancellor angela merkel did nothing to attempt to stop the opening of further negotiations . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's the end result of an idea that grew beyond all proportions .
" originally , the plan was to just play acoustically in someone 's kitchen , " becker told dw-world .
" then we thought we 'd do it in a bar .
but it just kept growing and growing . "
and grown it has .
becker 's band now consists of dozens of musicians - some professionals , some gifted amateurs - including directorial colleague tom tykwer .
a forty-person choir sings background vocals , and indian musicians have been enlisted to play george harrison 's raga-inflected " within you , without you . "
with a little help from his friends bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang becker has taken beatlemania to new extremes the ensemble first performed the record at a private party in a berlin club this summer .
word of the gig spread , and a local radio station contacted becker about playing it in public as part of the station 's anniversary celebrations .
" i 'm not really nervous , " becker said ahead of the gig .
" but when people are paying money to get in , you do feel a different sense of responsibility . "
the musicians begin with the title track and continue on through the fab four 's psychedelic opus , concluding with what some consider lennon and mccartney 's finest composition , " a day in life . "
the band 's musical co-leader niko weidemann said playing the full record presents some unusual challenges .
" the individual songs are not all that difficult to play , but if you look at it as a total work , it can be tricky , " he said .
" we listened to the original album , and what we heard was how the beatles really pushed the limits with the restricted means at their disposal .
they never intended to perform the record live - it 's a studio production full of overdubs .
but when it is played live on stage by a big band with a brass section and a choir , it 's really fantastic . "
the one and only billy shears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a four-piece band , there was no way the beatles could perform sgt. pepper 's live whether becker 's band is authentic is anyone 's guess .
but there 's something fittingly ironic about a group of latter-day fab four fanatics covering a concept record about a fictional band as played by the beatles .
and the performance suggests that had the liverpool quartet played " pepper 's " live , it might well have rocked - a good thing since becker has invested considerable time and money in the project .
" if you go to wolfgang 's home , it 's absolutely full of beatles ' records , posters and memoriabilia , " said adrian kennedy , a dw-tv producer and on-air personality who serves as the emcee .
" i do n't think he 's making any money from it .
it 's just for the love of the music . "
even more ironically , " sgt. pepper 's " is n't even becker 's favorite beatles album .
" no , that would be ' revolver ' , " becker said .
" but we completely forgot the fortieth anniversary of that record , and we were determined not to miss another opportunity again . "
audience members have been asked to dress up in 1960s style , and a " lovely rita " award will be handed out after the famous final piano chord of " a day in the life " has finished reverberating in the rafters . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but , that did n't stop the german translation from cracking the 2007 bestseller lists .
he talked about prussia 's appeal . dw-world.de : are you surprised that an academic book on prussia could make the german bestseller lists ? christopher clark : i certainly did n't expect success on that level .
i think it 's a case of timing .
the fall of the berlin wall and german re-unification have triggered a process of re-imagining the german past in general and prussia in particular .
so much of what was left of the old prussian state was in former communist east germany , so it was kind of locked away .
with the re-unification of germany , it all became visible and got reconnected to the larger german national entity .
that and the opening up of archives of the former east germany prompted a rethink .
let 's try to sum up your thesis .
prussia was a relatively enlightened , progressive state that inadvertently destroyed itself when it enlisted the force of german nationalism .
is that close ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prussian culture , including architecture , blossomed in the 19th century that 's exactly it .
nationalism was prussia 's downfall .
in older historical literature , nationalism was seen as the culmination of prussian history .
prussia 's task in history had been to create the german nation .
just as we today tend to see the rise of the third reich in 1933 as the end of an era and explain how germany got to that point , previous generations tried to explain how german history had got to 1871 and the creation of the german empire .
and the answer was that prussia was the steering , shaping and sometimes manipulative power that would bring the german nation into existence .
the emergence of the german nation is the thing that gives meaning to the whole history of prussia . that , in my view , is completely and utterly wrong .
throughout its history prussia had been the most un-national state you can imagine , partly because it contained such large numbers of non-germans , but also because the whole idea of its existence was that of the sovereign , monarchical state , interwoven with the idea of the sovereignty of law . these were ideas that had nothing to do with the uprising of a national movement .
prussia responded very hostilely to early german nationalism because the hohenzollern rulers rightly recognized that it would act like a kind of corrosive acid eating away at everything the prussian state stood for . it was only during the unstable period of the 1850s , 60s and 70s that prussian statesmen , particularly prussian prime minister and german chancellor otto von bismarck , began to imagine that they could tame nationalism .
but that was something they failed to do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hohenzollern kings ruled first prussia , then germany from 1701 to 1918 you mention bismarck .
he plays less of a role in your book than in most works of prussian history .
why is that ? in some ways i think bismarck turned his back on prussia .
king friedrich wilhelm iv of prussia said in 1848 : " prussia will be henceforth merged into germany . "
and i think he got it right that the process of national consolidation that bismarck saw as a continuation of prussian security policy would ultimately not prussianize germany , but germanize prussia , and that everything the old prussia stood for would be lost .
so in some ways i see bismarck as the first executor of a kind of closing-down sale of prussia and prussian tradition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historian christopher clark says prussia was never the bad guy of europe but was n't nationalism something inevitable that was going to happen sooner or later ?
or can one imagine a scenario in which prussia would still exist today ? that 's a really good question and a difficult one to answer .
although historians usually rear up in horror at the notion , i think it was probably inevitable .
if you think about the other multi-national states that existed in the 19th century , russia , for example , or the austro-hungarian empire , both of them disappeared in the course of the world war i and were replaced by something radically different .
it seems to me that these pre-national , multi-ethnic commonwealths that were such a feature of europe in the early modern period were probably doomed to go under . let 's backtrack now and talk about the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries and prussia under friedrich the great .
you describe especially the prussian capital berlin as a vibrant , even libidinous place during his reign .
would you have liked to live there ? i think there would have been wonderful things about being in berlin in the 1780s and 90s .
berlin , if you compare it with london or paris , has the reputation of being boring .
but , that does n't mean berlin was dead or lacked an urbane identity .
and this identity was not driven by the projection of power through the dynasty and its monumental public buildings .
the new culture that emerged was driven by voluntary impulses from civil society .
there was a proliferation of clubs and organizations for all sorts of purposes - cultivating the sciences , for instance , or looking at economical ways of using fuel .
there were literary societies and freemason lodges .
it was an endless cornucopia of little voluntary initiatives .
the point i was trying to make is that this created a city that was n't just about courts or courtliness but about courtesy and civility of a very middle-class , bourgeois kind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arrogance of emperor wilhelm ii and his generals led to defeat in world war i many historians draw links between prussia and nazism .
although no one would claim prussia was the cradle of the ideology , some people see connections between prussian militarism and subservience and the third reich .
but , you portray prussia more as a source of opposition . if it were true that prussia created an environment that deadened the will of ordinary citizens and turned them into instruments of state power , thereby blazing a trail for a totalitarian dictatorship in which people would do anything they were told , it would be very easy to test that hypothesis .
all you 'd have to show is that germans of prussian provenance made better and more obedient nazis than people from austria , baden-württemberg and so on .
if that had been the case , it would be more than obvious .
but it is n't .
there is simply no evidence .
on the contrary , people from baden-württemberg and especially austria made for equally keen nazis , with austrians , for example , being hugely overrepresented in the machinery of nazi genocide .
it 's just simply not the case that you can map out a relationship between prussia and nazism that made people into better tools of the regime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president paul von hindenburg appointed hitler as chancellor in 1933 of course , prussia is implicated in the story of the events that brought hitler to power .
the old prussian elites played a key role in cooking up the plan to put hitler into power as german chancellor in 1933 .
not because they wanted the third reich , but because they thought they could use hitler in a kind of conservative coup against the weimar republic .
of course , they were disastrously wrong .
the corporate arrogance of the prussian nobility helps to explain why some perfectly intelligent people failed to recognize the danger hitler presented . but national socialism was in many respects the exact opposite pole of prussiandom .
the old prussian state had been about the authority of government and the rule of law , but the new nazi reich was about the people .
it was an ethnic entity .
the nazis did n't care about laws .
to them , laws were utterly secondary .
what mattered was the führer as the expression of the will of the volk .
this was an idea that had no precedent in prussian history whatsoever .
so i see a very strong antipathy between the two forms of state . christopher clark is senior lecturer in modern european history at st. catharine 's college , university of cambridge . interview by jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

throughout its history prussia had been the most un-national state you can imagine , partly because it contained such large numbers of non-germans , but also because the whole idea of its existence was that of the sovereign , monarchical state , interwoven with the idea of the sovereignty of law . these were ideas that had nothing to do with the uprising of a national movement .
prussia responded very hostilely to early german nationalism because the hohenzollern rulers rightly recognized that it would act like a kind of corrosive acid eating away at everything the prussian state stood for . it was only during the unstable period of the 1850s , 60s and 70s that prussian statesmen , particularly prussian prime minister and german chancellor otto von bismarck , began to imagine that they could tame nationalism .
but that was something they failed to do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hohenzollern kings ruled first prussia , then germany from 1701 to 1918 you mention bismarck .
he plays less of a role in your book than in most works of prussian history .
why is that ? in some ways i think bismarck turned his back on prussia .
king friedrich wilhelm iv of prussia said in 1848 : " prussia will be henceforth merged into germany . "
and i think he got it right that the process of national consolidation that bismarck saw as a continuation of prussian security policy would ultimately not prussianize germany , but germanize prussia , and that everything the old prussia stood for would be lost .
so in some ways i see bismarck as the first executor of a kind of closing-down sale of prussia and prussian tradition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historian christopher clark says prussia was never the bad guy of europe but was n't nationalism something inevitable that was going to happen sooner or later ?
or can one imagine a scenario in which prussia would still exist today ? that 's a really good question and a difficult one to answer .
although historians usually rear up in horror at the notion , i think it was probably inevitable .
if you think about the other multi-national states that existed in the 19th century , russia , for example , or the austro-hungarian empire , both of them disappeared in the course of the world war i and were replaced by something radically different .
it seems to me that these pre-national , multi-ethnic commonwealths that were such a feature of europe in the early modern period were probably doomed to go under . let 's backtrack now and talk about the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries and prussia under friedrich the great .
you describe especially the prussian capital berlin as a vibrant , even libidinous place during his reign .
would you have liked to live there ? i think there would have been wonderful things about being in berlin in the 1780s and 90s .
berlin , if you compare it with london or paris , has the reputation of being boring .
but , that does n't mean berlin was dead or lacked an urbane identity .
and this identity was not driven by the projection of power through the dynasty and its monumental public buildings .
the new culture that emerged was driven by voluntary impulses from civil society .
there was a proliferation of clubs and organizations for all sorts of purposes - cultivating the sciences , for instance , or looking at economical ways of using fuel .
there were literary societies and freemason lodges .
it was an endless cornucopia of little voluntary initiatives .
the point i was trying to make is that this created a city that was n't just about courts or courtliness but about courtesy and civility of a very middle-class , bourgeois kind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arrogance of emperor wilhelm ii and his generals led to defeat in world war i many historians draw links between prussia and nazism .
although no one would claim prussia was the cradle of the ideology , some people see connections between prussian militarism and subservience and the third reich .
but , you portray prussia more as a source of opposition . if it were true that prussia created an environment that deadened the will of ordinary citizens and turned them into instruments of state power , thereby blazing a trail for a totalitarian dictatorship in which people would do anything they were told , it would be very easy to test that hypothesis .
all you 'd have to show is that germans of prussian provenance made better and more obedient nazis than people from austria , baden-württemberg and so on .
if that had been the case , it would be more than obvious .
but it is n't .
there is simply no evidence .
on the contrary , people from baden-württemberg and especially austria made for equally keen nazis , with austrians , for example , being hugely overrepresented in the machinery of nazi genocide .
it 's just simply not the case that you can map out a relationship between prussia and nazism that made people into better tools of the regime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president paul von hindenburg appointed hitler as chancellor in 1933 of course , prussia is implicated in the story of the events that brought hitler to power .
the old prussian elites played a key role in cooking up the plan to put hitler into power as german chancellor in 1933 .
not because they wanted the third reich , but because they thought they could use hitler in a kind of conservative coup against the weimar republic .
of course , they were disastrously wrong .
the corporate arrogance of the prussian nobility helps to explain why some perfectly intelligent people failed to recognize the danger hitler presented . but national socialism was in many respects the exact opposite pole of prussiandom .
the old prussian state had been about the authority of government and the rule of law , but the new nazi reich was about the people .
it was an ethnic entity .
the nazis did n't care about laws .
to them , laws were utterly secondary .
what mattered was the führer as the expression of the will of the volk .

with the re-unification of germany , it all became visible and got reconnected to the larger german national entity .
that and the opening up of archives of the former east germany prompted a rethink .
let 's try to sum up your thesis .
prussia was a relatively enlightened , progressive state that inadvertently destroyed itself when it enlisted the force of german nationalism .
is that close ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prussian culture , including architecture , blossomed in the 19th century that 's exactly it .
nationalism was prussia 's downfall .
in older historical literature , nationalism was seen as the culmination of prussian history .
prussia 's task in history had been to create the german nation .
just as we today tend to see the rise of the third reich in 1933 as the end of an era and explain how germany got to that point , previous generations tried to explain how german history had got to 1871 and the creation of the german empire .

he talked about prussia 's appeal . dw-world.de : are you surprised that an academic book on prussia could make the german bestseller lists ? christopher clark : i certainly did n't expect success on that level .
i think it 's a case of timing .
the fall of the berlin wall and german re-unification have triggered a process of re-imagining the german past in general and prussia in particular .
so much of what was left of the old prussian state was in former communist east germany , so it was kind of locked away .
with the re-unification of germany , it all became visible and got reconnected to the larger german national entity .
that and the opening up of archives of the former east germany prompted a rethink .
let 's try to sum up your thesis .
prussia was a relatively enlightened , progressive state that inadvertently destroyed itself when it enlisted the force of german nationalism .
is that close ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prussian culture , including architecture , blossomed in the 19th century that 's exactly it .
nationalism was prussia 's downfall .
in older historical literature , nationalism was seen as the culmination of prussian history .
prussia 's task in history had been to create the german nation .
just as we today tend to see the rise of the third reich in 1933 as the end of an era and explain how germany got to that point , previous generations tried to explain how german history had got to 1871 and the creation of the german empire .
and the answer was that prussia was the steering , shaping and sometimes manipulative power that would bring the german nation into existence .
the emergence of the german nation is the thing that gives meaning to the whole history of prussia . that , in my view , is completely and utterly wrong .
throughout its history prussia had been the most un-national state you can imagine , partly because it contained such large numbers of non-germans , but also because the whole idea of its existence was that of the sovereign , monarchical state , interwoven with the idea of the sovereignty of law . these were ideas that had nothing to do with the uprising of a national movement .
prussia responded very hostilely to early german nationalism because the hohenzollern rulers rightly recognized that it would act like a kind of corrosive acid eating away at everything the prussian state stood for . it was only during the unstable period of the 1850s , 60s and 70s that prussian statesmen , particularly prussian prime minister and german chancellor otto von bismarck , began to imagine that they could tame nationalism .
but that was something they failed to do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hohenzollern kings ruled first prussia , then germany from 1701 to 1918 you mention bismarck .
he plays less of a role in your book than in most works of prussian history .
why is that ? in some ways i think bismarck turned his back on prussia .
king friedrich wilhelm iv of prussia said in 1848 : " prussia will be henceforth merged into germany . "
and i think he got it right that the process of national consolidation that bismarck saw as a continuation of prussian security policy would ultimately not prussianize germany , but germanize prussia , and that everything the old prussia stood for would be lost .
so in some ways i see bismarck as the first executor of a kind of closing-down sale of prussia and prussian tradition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historian christopher clark says prussia was never the bad guy of europe but was n't nationalism something inevitable that was going to happen sooner or later ?
or can one imagine a scenario in which prussia would still exist today ? that 's a really good question and a difficult one to answer .
although historians usually rear up in horror at the notion , i think it was probably inevitable .
if you think about the other multi-national states that existed in the 19th century , russia , for example , or the austro-hungarian empire , both of them disappeared in the course of the world war i and were replaced by something radically different .
it seems to me that these pre-national , multi-ethnic commonwealths that were such a feature of europe in the early modern period were probably doomed to go under . let 's backtrack now and talk about the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries and prussia under friedrich the great .
you describe especially the prussian capital berlin as a vibrant , even libidinous place during his reign .
would you have liked to live there ? i think there would have been wonderful things about being in berlin in the 1780s and 90s .
berlin , if you compare it with london or paris , has the reputation of being boring .
but , that does n't mean berlin was dead or lacked an urbane identity .
and this identity was not driven by the projection of power through the dynasty and its monumental public buildings .
the new culture that emerged was driven by voluntary impulses from civil society .
there was a proliferation of clubs and organizations for all sorts of purposes - cultivating the sciences , for instance , or looking at economical ways of using fuel .
there were literary societies and freemason lodges .
it was an endless cornucopia of little voluntary initiatives .
the point i was trying to make is that this created a city that was n't just about courts or courtliness but about courtesy and civility of a very middle-class , bourgeois kind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arrogance of emperor wilhelm ii and his generals led to defeat in world war i many historians draw links between prussia and nazism .
although no one would claim prussia was the cradle of the ideology , some people see connections between prussian militarism and subservience and the third reich .
but , you portray prussia more as a source of opposition . if it were true that prussia created an environment that deadened the will of ordinary citizens and turned them into instruments of state power , thereby blazing a trail for a totalitarian dictatorship in which people would do anything they were told , it would be very easy to test that hypothesis .
all you 'd have to show is that germans of prussian provenance made better and more obedient nazis than people from austria , baden-württemberg and so on .
if that had been the case , it would be more than obvious .
but it is n't .
there is simply no evidence .
on the contrary , people from baden-württemberg and especially austria made for equally keen nazis , with austrians , for example , being hugely overrepresented in the machinery of nazi genocide .
it 's just simply not the case that you can map out a relationship between prussia and nazism that made people into better tools of the regime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president paul von hindenburg appointed hitler as chancellor in 1933 of course , prussia is implicated in the story of the events that brought hitler to power .
the old prussian elites played a key role in cooking up the plan to put hitler into power as german chancellor in 1933 .
not because they wanted the third reich , but because they thought they could use hitler in a kind of conservative coup against the weimar republic .
of course , they were disastrously wrong .
the corporate arrogance of the prussian nobility helps to explain why some perfectly intelligent people failed to recognize the danger hitler presented . but national socialism was in many respects the exact opposite pole of prussiandom .
the old prussian state had been about the authority of government and the rule of law , but the new nazi reich was about the people .
it was an ethnic entity .
the nazis did n't care about laws .
to them , laws were utterly secondary .
what mattered was the führer as the expression of the will of the volk .
this was an idea that had no precedent in prussian history whatsoever .

" a climate-change war over cars " was how the business weekly wirtschaftswoche described the standoff between one of germany 's largest and most vital industries and the bureaucrats in brussels . it is up to the european commission - the eu 's executive arm - to set out how carmakers should meet the target of cutting emissions to an average of 130 grams / kilometer -lrb- g / km -rrb- among their passenger vehicles from 2012 , and how parts and fuel-makers should knock a further 10 g / km off the average .
the target represents a cut of about 25 percent from current levels . internal commission strife bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checking tire pressure and using biofuels can help reduce emissions the eu 's commissioners , however , remain at odds over several key points . commissioner for enterprise günter verheugen , a staunch defender of the german car industry , has sought to reduce fines on companies that do not cut average emissions to 130 grams per km through engine technology . but environment commission stavros dimas argued for gradually mounting fines from 2012 as an effective deterrent to force manufacturers to invest in clean technology . overall , car parts and fuel-makers are meant to find ways to slash average emissions by a quarter - from the current 160 g / km to 120 g / km .
while climate protection groups say that might be a manageable target , it is far from clear which manufacturers will serve as the sacrificial lamb . " the only thing that really poses a threat to us are bad political decisions taken in brussels or berlin , " matthias wissmann , the head of the german automobile federation vda , said last week . given that the targets apply to the sector as a whole , it is the commission 's task to decide how the new burden is to be shared . big versus small bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european carmakers have taken different sides in the co2 dispute countries that traditionally make larger , less fuel-efficient vehicles , such as germany and sweden , are at odds with their european neighbors , such as france , spain and italy , who are better known for producing smaller cars . the latter say luxury carmakers should take the weight of the new guidelines , not least because they are the ones with the highest profit margins . but german chancellor angela merkel , who has been vocally pro-environment since taking up office , has lobbied hard against the emissions caps . " we will fight for our interests , " she told a meeting of eu leaders in brussels recently . a common pool of co2 in keeping with germany 's wishes , the latest word from the commission was that it was proposing the cuts to be proportionate to a vehicle 's weight , and the emissions targets to be pooled among carmakers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european automakers may see profits drop if emissions limits are put in place also unresolved is how manufacturers will be penalized for failing to meet their targets .
head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , has suggested a fine of 10 euros -lrb- $ 14 -rrb- for each extra gram of co2 , but the european commissioner for the environment stavros dimas wants to implement a fee of 35 euros per excess gram - a drop from the 95 euros per gram he had been quoted with proposing in some media reports . that suggestion has met with fierce resistance from germany , whose car industry could stand to loose billions under such a stringent penalty system . " the implementation of the carbon dioxide targets could hurt them more than expected , " ferdinand dudenhöffer , head of the center for automotive research , said of germany 's big , fuel guzzlers .
" the impact on the profit margins of europe 's top-of-the-range producers could be considerable . " but that 's consequence environmental campaigners say the german automobile industry should have seen coming . " it was the germans who popularised the idea of a big car as a status symbol , and now it has backfired on them , " said greenpeace 's wolfgang lohbeck . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" a climate-change war over cars " was how the business weekly wirtschaftswoche described the standoff between one of germany 's largest and most vital industries and the bureaucrats in brussels . it is up to the european commission - the eu 's executive arm - to set out how carmakers should meet the target of cutting emissions to an average of 130 grams / kilometer -lrb- g / km -rrb- among their passenger vehicles from 2012 , and how parts and fuel-makers should knock a further 10 g / km off the average .
the target represents a cut of about 25 percent from current levels . internal commission strife bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checking tire pressure and using biofuels can help reduce emissions the eu 's commissioners , however , remain at odds over several key points . commissioner for enterprise günter verheugen , a staunch defender of the german car industry , has sought to reduce fines on companies that do not cut average emissions to 130 grams per km through engine technology . but environment commission stavros dimas argued for gradually mounting fines from 2012 as an effective deterrent to force manufacturers to invest in clean technology . overall , car parts and fuel-makers are meant to find ways to slash average emissions by a quarter - from the current 160 g / km to 120 g / km .

" we will fight for our interests , " she told a meeting of eu leaders in brussels recently . a common pool of co2 in keeping with germany 's wishes , the latest word from the commission was that it was proposing the cuts to be proportionate to a vehicle 's weight , and the emissions targets to be pooled among carmakers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european automakers may see profits drop if emissions limits are put in place also unresolved is how manufacturers will be penalized for failing to meet their targets .
head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , has suggested a fine of 10 euros -lrb- $ 14 -rrb- for each extra gram of co2 , but the european commissioner for the environment stavros dimas wants to implement a fee of 35 euros per excess gram - a drop from the 95 euros per gram he had been quoted with proposing in some media reports . that suggestion has met with fierce resistance from germany , whose car industry could stand to loose billions under such a stringent penalty system . " the implementation of the carbon dioxide targets could hurt them more than expected , " ferdinand dudenhöffer , head of the center for automotive research , said of germany 's big , fuel guzzlers .
" the impact on the profit margins of europe 's top-of-the-range producers could be considerable . " but that 's consequence environmental campaigners say the german automobile industry should have seen coming . " it was the germans who popularised the idea of a big car as a status symbol , and now it has backfired on them , " said greenpeace 's wolfgang lohbeck . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but solving chronic high unemployment and xenophobic tendencies may take a while . deutsche welle : minister tiefensee , you not only serve as transport minister but also oversee the development of eastern germany .
what are your duties in this position ? wolfgang tiefensee : the new german states are still a part of our country that requires special attention and devotion .
that 's why the government has set up a post to coordinate these tasks .
the commissioner works together with ministers from all departments - labor market policy , economic policy , education , research and many other areas are all important for eastern germany .
the commissioner coordinates , gives ideas and advocates the interests of the new states . germany 's reunification happened in 1990 .
how much longer will it be necessary to have a commissioner of this kind ? i think it makes sense to coordinate these tasks .
they are connected , and i think the job will exist for a while .
financial support for the eastern states continues until 2019 - perhaps that 's the point by which things will have to have normalized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany is becoming a leader in renewable energies , said tiefensee will the standards of living in the east and west be similar by then ? actually , in the eastern states , we do n't want to imitate the western ones or become like other western european cities .
it 's more about taking a similar approach in the east and west to the challenges that confront germany and europe .
the pre-existing conditions vary .
i think that the eastern states have a natural advantage - especially in new industrial sectors like renewable energy , it and biotechnology , for example . investing late in new sectors means a more modern approach to investing , and that 's already become apparent .
as far as renewable energy goes , every second job in germany is in eastern germany . nevertheless , unemployment in the new states is still twice as high as in western germany .
when do you think this will even out ? that 's the most difficult question .
in the eastern states , unemployment is way above 13 percent , while it 's at 6 percent in the western states .
in addition , those without jobs in eastern germany are unemployed for long periods of time - for 12 or even 24 months - and get stuck in this chronic unemployment with no chance of breaking back into the job market . how long will this continue ?
we have to think long-term , because chronic unemployment can only be reduced very slowly .
the eastern regions of the new states are experiencing an economic upswing .
but this has n't yet had enough of an effect on the job market .
i think it will take at least another 10 years to reduce unemployment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremism has a larger following in eastern germany people from minority or foreign backgrounds tend to shy away from the eastern states .
some decide not to work or study there because they 're afraid of being assaulted by neo-nazis .
can you understand these concerns ? yes , unfortunately it is the case that the number of xenophobic crimes is higher in the east than in the west .
on the other hand , the big cities and many of the medium-sized cities are great places for foreigners to study or work as engineers or skilled laborers . many people actually prefer the eastern german states because they can also be particularly hospitable .
this is left over from communist east germany , when people had a totally different way of interacting with each other . there are many initiatives in place that are committed to breaking down xenophobia .
often , because there are too few foreigners , people often do n't know what they 're talking about and arrive at negative judgments .
if the number of foreign residents were to increase gradually , then i 'm sure that reservations about them would gradually decrease . you mentioned traditional hospitality in the east .
does eastern germany have a different value system than western germany ? i do n't think so , but of course 40 years of the gdr did n't go by without having an effect on the population and on individuals .
for 40 years , we could n't travel where we wanted to .
studying abroad was out of the question .
we could n't freely organize clubs or political parties like people in the western states and in western europe could .

but solving chronic high unemployment and xenophobic tendencies may take a while . deutsche welle : minister tiefensee , you not only serve as transport minister but also oversee the development of eastern germany .
what are your duties in this position ? wolfgang tiefensee : the new german states are still a part of our country that requires special attention and devotion .
that 's why the government has set up a post to coordinate these tasks .
the commissioner works together with ministers from all departments - labor market policy , economic policy , education , research and many other areas are all important for eastern germany .
the commissioner coordinates , gives ideas and advocates the interests of the new states . germany 's reunification happened in 1990 .
how much longer will it be necessary to have a commissioner of this kind ? i think it makes sense to coordinate these tasks .
they are connected , and i think the job will exist for a while .
financial support for the eastern states continues until 2019 - perhaps that 's the point by which things will have to have normalized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany is becoming a leader in renewable energies , said tiefensee will the standards of living in the east and west be similar by then ? actually , in the eastern states , we do n't want to imitate the western ones or become like other western european cities .
it 's more about taking a similar approach in the east and west to the challenges that confront germany and europe .
the pre-existing conditions vary .
i think that the eastern states have a natural advantage - especially in new industrial sectors like renewable energy , it and biotechnology , for example . investing late in new sectors means a more modern approach to investing , and that 's already become apparent .
as far as renewable energy goes , every second job in germany is in eastern germany . nevertheless , unemployment in the new states is still twice as high as in western germany .
when do you think this will even out ? that 's the most difficult question .
in the eastern states , unemployment is way above 13 percent , while it 's at 6 percent in the western states .
in addition , those without jobs in eastern germany are unemployed for long periods of time - for 12 or even 24 months - and get stuck in this chronic unemployment with no chance of breaking back into the job market . how long will this continue ?
we have to think long-term , because chronic unemployment can only be reduced very slowly .
the eastern regions of the new states are experiencing an economic upswing .
but this has n't yet had enough of an effect on the job market .
i think it will take at least another 10 years to reduce unemployment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremism has a larger following in eastern germany people from minority or foreign backgrounds tend to shy away from the eastern states .

but can the french- and flemish-speaking parts of the country truly get along ? the breakthrough came when a centre-left party from french-speaking belgium agreed to join a coalition led by acting prime minister guy verhofstadt .
an interim , five-party government coalition could be formed by the end of the week .
the alliance includes christian democrats and liberals from both parts of belgium as well as francophone socialists .
the agreement puts a temporary end to the political gridlock that has kept belgium without a government since june 10 , when a national election failed to yield a clear winner .
belgium 's nominal head of state king albert ii had asked verhofstadt to try to form an alliance to overcome the stalemate .

french-speaking wallonia , where unemployment runs twice as high as in flemish-speaking flanders , fears that the northern belgian region would use such powers to lure companies away from the south with lower corporate tax rates .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 19.12.2007 lucio : a kaka or ronaldinho would n't come to munich großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio is a bayern mainstay , but he does n't plan on staying forever defender lucimar ferreira da silva - lucio , for short - is captain of the brazilian national team and the anchor of bayern munich 's back four .
and that , he told dw-world , is all he wants from his german club . dw-world.de : oliver kahn got himself suspended from the last league game of 2007 and has feuded with much of the squad .
could you see yourself taking over from him as bayern 's regular captain ?
lucio : i would n't dream of becoming bayern munich 's captain .
it 's not my life 's goal , and i would n't fight for the position .
as far as i 'm concerned there 'll be no squabbling with my teammates over it .
the coach decides who 's captain .
i wo n't lie and say it would n't be flattering to be singled out for this responsibility , but i 'm not concerned with having a special status - that means nothing to me .
i 'll keep on the way i always have .
i 'm not looking to inherit the captaincy .
but you have served as bayern 's captain for the odd game .
did you not like it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strikers beware - lucio is one of the league most hard-nosed defenders of course it was a great experience .
but it did n't change me or the way i work with the team .
the best part was the feeling that the coach trusts me , that he and the team have faith in me .
in the period when i was captain , the atmosphere was great , really relaxed .
the team assistants and physiotherapists were in a good mood , always making jokes with me .
is the position first and foremost a matter of discipline ?
discipline is important , but a captain needs other qualities as well .
he has to lead by example .
he has to be someone who works hard , who shows respect for the coach and his teammates and who always gives his best for the club .
at bayern i 've always stood for these qualities .
that 's why i was allowed to be captain on occasion .
but as the captain of the brazilian national team , you surely must feel you 're entitled to the same position at bayern munich .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio 's season was going wll until he was suspended for four games for elbowing an opponent i did n't try to become captain of brazil .
it just happened , and i 'm very honored to have been given such an enormous responsibility .
thus far it 's gone well .
my teammates like me , and we get along well with one another .
you would n't have too many problems dealing with players like miroslav klose , luca toni or franck ribery , if you can lead a squad with stars like ronaldinho , kaka or robinho .
i 've known stars like kaka or ronaldinho both professionally and personally for quite some time .
they always listened to me and followed my advice , even when i was n't captain .
and when they tell me something , i listen to them too .
that 's why i have no problems fulfilling my responsibilities in the national team .
so ca n't you convince a kaka or ronaldinho to come to bayern ?
i do n't think they 'll be coming any time soon .
why not ?
it 's next to impossible to convince brazilian stars who can play in italy or spain to come to germany .
it 's not a question of the club , but the country .
the culture , lifestyle and language in italy and spain are fairly brazilian .
bayern ca n't compete .
you do n't try to sell bayern munich to your teammates in the brazilian national squad , as luca toni supposedly does with italy ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio won the world cup with brazil in 2002 as i said , for the reasons i 've just mentioned , bayern munich is a product that 's hard to market .
it 's difficult for me to sell the club to superstars like kaka , ronaldinho or robinho .
there are a few who would believe me - but they 're the ones who already play in the bundesliga .
for example , diego , naldo , gilberto , mineiro and josue .
but not ronaldinho or kaka ?
when we exchange impressions , i have to admit it would be easier for them to convince me to leave germany than for me to convince them to come here .
but they have n't succeeded .
you 're still here .
yes , and i intend to see out my current contract , which runs until 2010 .
i still dream of spain or italy .
i 'd love to play there , and perhaps i can fulfill this dream a bit earlier , if the club and i can reach an agreement .
i transferred from leverkusen to munich two years before my contract back then was set to expire .
in soccer , nothing 's beyond discussion , if the opportunities and the will are there .
so at some point you intend to leave germany and head south .
one thing is for sure : after my time at bayern munich , i 'll definitely leave germany . interview by daniel martinez -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and that , he told dw-world , is all he wants from his german club . dw-world.de : oliver kahn got himself suspended from the last league game of 2007 and has feuded with much of the squad .
could you see yourself taking over from him as bayern 's regular captain ?
lucio : i would n't dream of becoming bayern munich 's captain .
it 's not my life 's goal , and i would n't fight for the position .
as far as i 'm concerned there 'll be no squabbling with my teammates over it .
the coach decides who 's captain .
i wo n't lie and say it would n't be flattering to be singled out for this responsibility , but i 'm not concerned with having a special status - that means nothing to me .
i 'll keep on the way i always have .
i 'm not looking to inherit the captaincy .
but you have served as bayern 's captain for the odd game .
did you not like it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strikers beware - lucio is one of the league most hard-nosed defenders of course it was a great experience .
but it did n't change me or the way i work with the team .
the best part was the feeling that the coach trusts me , that he and the team have faith in me .
in the period when i was captain , the atmosphere was great , really relaxed .
the team assistants and physiotherapists were in a good mood , always making jokes with me .
is the position first and foremost a matter of discipline ?
discipline is important , but a captain needs other qualities as well .
he has to lead by example .
he has to be someone who works hard , who shows respect for the coach and his teammates and who always gives his best for the club .
at bayern i 've always stood for these qualities .
that 's why i was allowed to be captain on occasion .
but as the captain of the brazilian national team , you surely must feel you 're entitled to the same position at bayern munich .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio 's season was going wll until he was suspended for four games for elbowing an opponent i did n't try to become captain of brazil .
it just happened , and i 'm very honored to have been given such an enormous responsibility .
thus far it 's gone well .
my teammates like me , and we get along well with one another .
you would n't have too many problems dealing with players like miroslav klose , luca toni or franck ribery , if you can lead a squad with stars like ronaldinho , kaka or robinho .
i 've known stars like kaka or ronaldinho both professionally and personally for quite some time .
they always listened to me and followed my advice , even when i was n't captain .
and when they tell me something , i listen to them too .
that 's why i have no problems fulfilling my responsibilities in the national team .
so ca n't you convince a kaka or ronaldinho to come to bayern ?
i do n't think they 'll be coming any time soon .
why not ?
it 's next to impossible to convince brazilian stars who can play in italy or spain to come to germany .
it 's not a question of the club , but the country .
the culture , lifestyle and language in italy and spain are fairly brazilian .
bayern ca n't compete .
you do n't try to sell bayern munich to your teammates in the brazilian national squad , as luca toni supposedly does with italy ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio won the world cup with brazil in 2002 as i said , for the reasons i 've just mentioned , bayern munich is a product that 's hard to market .
it 's difficult for me to sell the club to superstars like kaka , ronaldinho or robinho .
there are a few who would believe me - but they 're the ones who already play in the bundesliga .
for example , diego , naldo , gilberto , mineiro and josue .
but not ronaldinho or kaka ?
when we exchange impressions , i have to admit it would be easier for them to convince me to leave germany than for me to convince them to come here .
but they have n't succeeded .
you 're still here .
yes , and i intend to see out my current contract , which runs until 2010 .
i still dream of spain or italy .
i 'd love to play there , and perhaps i can fulfill this dream a bit earlier , if the club and i can reach an agreement .
i transferred from leverkusen to munich two years before my contract back then was set to expire .
in soccer , nothing 's beyond discussion , if the opportunities and the will are there .
so at some point you intend to leave germany and head south .
one thing is for sure : after my time at bayern munich , i 'll definitely leave germany . interview by daniel martinez -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and that , he told dw-world , is all he wants from his german club . dw-world.de : oliver kahn got himself suspended from the last league game of 2007 and has feuded with much of the squad .
could you see yourself taking over from him as bayern 's regular captain ?
lucio : i would n't dream of becoming bayern munich 's captain .
it 's not my life 's goal , and i would n't fight for the position .
as far as i 'm concerned there 'll be no squabbling with my teammates over it .
the coach decides who 's captain .
i wo n't lie and say it would n't be flattering to be singled out for this responsibility , but i 'm not concerned with having a special status - that means nothing to me .
i 'll keep on the way i always have .
i 'm not looking to inherit the captaincy .
but you have served as bayern 's captain for the odd game .
did you not like it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strikers beware - lucio is one of the league most hard-nosed defenders of course it was a great experience .
but it did n't change me or the way i work with the team .
the best part was the feeling that the coach trusts me , that he and the team have faith in me .
in the period when i was captain , the atmosphere was great , really relaxed .
the team assistants and physiotherapists were in a good mood , always making jokes with me .
is the position first and foremost a matter of discipline ?
discipline is important , but a captain needs other qualities as well .
he has to lead by example .
he has to be someone who works hard , who shows respect for the coach and his teammates and who always gives his best for the club .
at bayern i 've always stood for these qualities .
that 's why i was allowed to be captain on occasion .
but as the captain of the brazilian national team , you surely must feel you 're entitled to the same position at bayern munich .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio 's season was going wll until he was suspended for four games for elbowing an opponent i did n't try to become captain of brazil .
it just happened , and i 'm very honored to have been given such an enormous responsibility .
thus far it 's gone well .
my teammates like me , and we get along well with one another .
you would n't have too many problems dealing with players like miroslav klose , luca toni or franck ribery , if you can lead a squad with stars like ronaldinho , kaka or robinho .
i 've known stars like kaka or ronaldinho both professionally and personally for quite some time .
they always listened to me and followed my advice , even when i was n't captain .
and when they tell me something , i listen to them too .
that 's why i have no problems fulfilling my responsibilities in the national team .
so ca n't you convince a kaka or ronaldinho to come to bayern ?
i do n't think they 'll be coming any time soon .
why not ?
it 's next to impossible to convince brazilian stars who can play in italy or spain to come to germany .
it 's not a question of the club , but the country .
the culture , lifestyle and language in italy and spain are fairly brazilian .
bayern ca n't compete .
you do n't try to sell bayern munich to your teammates in the brazilian national squad , as luca toni supposedly does with italy ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio won the world cup with brazil in 2002 as i said , for the reasons i 've just mentioned , bayern munich is a product that 's hard to market .
it 's difficult for me to sell the club to superstars like kaka , ronaldinho or robinho .
there are a few who would believe me - but they 're the ones who already play in the bundesliga .
for example , diego , naldo , gilberto , mineiro and josue .
but not ronaldinho or kaka ?
when we exchange impressions , i have to admit it would be easier for them to convince me to leave germany than for me to convince them to come here .
but they have n't succeeded .
you 're still here .
yes , and i intend to see out my current contract , which runs until 2010 .
i still dream of spain or italy .
i 'd love to play there , and perhaps i can fulfill this dream a bit earlier , if the club and i can reach an agreement .
i transferred from leverkusen to munich two years before my contract back then was set to expire .
in soccer , nothing 's beyond discussion , if the opportunities and the will are there .
so at some point you intend to leave germany and head south .

turkey came a small step closer towards european union membership on wednesday , dec .
19 , starting negotiations on two new policy areas .
ankara seized the opportunity to attack some states ' attempts to block its entry . this means that six chapters have been opened until now .
to conclude the accession process , talks have to be completed in thirty-five different fields . speaking after a different meeting in brussels , the eu commissioner in charge of enlargement , finland 's olli rehn , said that all member states had reaffirmed their wish to see accession talks continue , adding that the opening of the two chapters on wednesday should be taken as proof that " the eu sticks to its commitments and keeps its word . " ankara began eu entry talks in 2005 , but they have moved forward very slowly because of rows over cyprus and human rights .
eight negotiating chapters have been blocked since the end of last year because of turkey 's refusal to open its ports and airports to traffic from eu member cyprus .
turkey 's negotiations are expected to last at least a decade , with no guarantee of membership at the end of it all .
ankara criticizes blocking maneuver bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french prime minister is the most vociferous opponent of turkish membership after the formal opening of talks on health and consumer protection and trans-european transport networks , turkish foreign minister ali babacan criticized attempts by individual eu member states to block turkey 's entry bid .
" it is obvious that certain eu member states are trying to erode political and legal aspects of the accession process , " he said .
babacan did not name any names , but french prime minister nicolas sarkozy has been leading the lobby to keep turkey out of the european union . he favors a special partnership with the mainly muslim country instead of full membership .
babacan also stressed that all eu heads of state had agreed in december 2004 to the start of accession talks with turkey .
he said a change of government should not have an impact on this promise .
" we expect all eu member states to stick to that , " he said .
eu states look into the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu member states are divided over whether turkey belongs in the bloc at last friday 's eu summit , members agreed to create a group to study the long-term future of europe .
european union leaders named former spanish prime minister felipe gonzales , a past critic of turkey 's entry bid , to head the group .
a spokesman said gonzales had modified his position and now says the eu should honor any commitments it has made to turkey .
spain , britain , italy and sweden are among the eu states keenest to keep its membership bid on track .
germany 's governing christian democrats are opposed to turkish entry , but chancellor angela merkel did nothing to attempt to stop the opening of further negotiations . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but putting on a band-aid now wo n't help later , says dw 's karl zawadzky . 2006 was the best year so far in the business cycle .
germany 's economic performance climbed 2.9 percent - the strongest growth in six years .
this year , economic growth is at 2.5 percent . there is a close connection between the growth rates in 2006 and 2007 .
due to the drastic three-percent hike on added-value tax on jan .

everyone wanted to make a profit with the bad mortgages and they all lost - not just the american banks , but also large swiss banks and german savings banks . once again , greed conquered reason .
the result will burden the economy for some time to come . then there are high oil prices and the expensive euro .
the scarcity of raw materials around the world , in part due to strong demand in china , is also driving prices up .
rising prices detract from consumers ' purchasing power and they 're holding on to their money - which , in turn , weakens demand . exports and foreign investment are up nevertheless , " the german economy continues to experience a solid upswing , " said the german federal bank in its most recent report on the state of the economy . there are good reasons for this .

what 's more , companies in germany not only have a suitable range of export products , but also offer excellent service . during the last few years of economic decline at home , companies expanded immensely on the world market , which is now paying off .
as a result , not only have exports hit a record high but domestic investment is booming as well , as many companies adjust their production capacity to meet increased demand . otherwise strong economy hurt by external factors however , the economic slump in the us , the problems with the banks , the high oil prices and the expensive euro have dragged down the economy 's upward slope .
respectively , the federal bank has predicted 1.9 percent growth in 2008 , while some economic research institutions foresee only 1.5 to 1.6 percent . hence , the upturn will continue , just with considerably less gusto . no one can reliably predict whether the economy will rebound again in 2009 or whether the current economic cycle is already drawing to a close .
on the one hand , the german economy is resting on a much stronger foundation than in earlier years , but on the other hand , the rising inflation rate is increasingly becoming a reason for concern . in november , price inflation was 3.1 percent higher than what it had been a year earlier , which is significantly greater than the two-percent window tolerated by the european central bank . the currency guardians should respond with an interest rate increase , but that 's not possible due to the bank crisis .

but putting on a band-aid now wo n't help later , says dw 's karl zawadzky . 2006 was the best year so far in the business cycle .
germany 's economic performance climbed 2.9 percent - the strongest growth in six years .
this year , economic growth is at 2.5 percent . there is a close connection between the growth rates in 2006 and 2007 .
due to the drastic three-percent hike on added-value tax on jan .
1 , many consumers pushed up the purchase of more expensive items - from cars to home decoration items to computers , so it 's no surprise that the 2006 boom could n't continue into 2007 . the tax increase is no longer an issue , but there are plenty of other factors disrupting the economy . us real estate crisis leaves lasting mark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the us , the upswing that followed the real estate and mortgage crisis is now losing steam .
but , it 's even worse : many already see the specter of a recession in the us .
that dampens the mood world-wide since the us is by far the largest economy and a key player in the global financial system . the mortgage crisis hurt business for banks around the world .
everyone wanted to make a profit with the bad mortgages and they all lost - not just the american banks , but also large swiss banks and german savings banks . once again , greed conquered reason .
the result will burden the economy for some time to come . then there are high oil prices and the expensive euro .
the scarcity of raw materials around the world , in part due to strong demand in china , is also driving prices up .
rising prices detract from consumers ' purchasing power and they 're holding on to their money - which , in turn , weakens demand . exports and foreign investment are up nevertheless , " the german economy continues to experience a solid upswing , " said the german federal bank in its most recent report on the state of the economy . there are good reasons for this .
all over the world - especially in the resource-rich emerging nations with high export receipts and , in some cases , huge foreign currency reserves - investments are being made in infrastructure and industry , and the new wealth is being vigorously consumed . germany delivers more high-quality goods than any other country , whether they are machines , manufacturing plants , luxury cars or top-end food products .
what 's more , companies in germany not only have a suitable range of export products , but also offer excellent service . during the last few years of economic decline at home , companies expanded immensely on the world market , which is now paying off .
as a result , not only have exports hit a record high but domestic investment is booming as well , as many companies adjust their production capacity to meet increased demand . otherwise strong economy hurt by external factors however , the economic slump in the us , the problems with the banks , the high oil prices and the expensive euro have dragged down the economy 's upward slope .
respectively , the federal bank has predicted 1.9 percent growth in 2008 , while some economic research institutions foresee only 1.5 to 1.6 percent . hence , the upturn will continue , just with considerably less gusto . no one can reliably predict whether the economy will rebound again in 2009 or whether the current economic cycle is already drawing to a close .
on the one hand , the german economy is resting on a much stronger foundation than in earlier years , but on the other hand , the rising inflation rate is increasingly becoming a reason for concern . in november , price inflation was 3.1 percent higher than what it had been a year earlier , which is significantly greater than the two-percent window tolerated by the european central bank . the currency guardians should respond with an interest rate increase , but that 's not possible due to the bank crisis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 19.12.2007 all-star german band puts sgt. pepper 's on stage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the beatles made it , but it took a bunch of germans to put it on stage the beatles never performed their most famous album live .
to rectify that , film director wolfgang becker has formed a band to play sgt. pepper 's lonely hearts club band from start to finish .
but do they pull it off ? four decades on from the release in 1967 of what is arguably the most famous album in pop music , " sgt. pepper 's lonely hearts club band " was set to be performed live at a large musical theater in central berlin on wednesday night .
the concert was the brainchild of german film director and beatles ' fanatic wolfgang becker , best known for his international hit " goodbye lenin . "
it 's the end result of an idea that grew beyond all proportions .
" originally , the plan was to just play acoustically in someone 's kitchen , " becker told dw-world .
" then we thought we 'd do it in a bar .
but it just kept growing and growing . "
and grown it has .
becker 's band now consists of dozens of musicians - some professionals , some gifted amateurs - including directorial colleague tom tykwer .
a forty-person choir sings background vocals , and indian musicians have been enlisted to play george harrison 's raga-inflected " within you , without you . "
with a little help from his friends bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang becker has taken beatlemania to new extremes the ensemble first performed the record at a private party in a berlin club this summer .
word of the gig spread , and a local radio station contacted becker about playing it in public as part of the station 's anniversary celebrations .
" i 'm not really nervous , " becker said ahead of the gig .
" but when people are paying money to get in , you do feel a different sense of responsibility . "
the musicians begin with the title track and continue on through the fab four 's psychedelic opus , concluding with what some consider lennon and mccartney 's finest composition , " a day in life . "
the band 's musical co-leader niko weidemann said playing the full record presents some unusual challenges .
" the individual songs are not all that difficult to play , but if you look at it as a total work , it can be tricky , " he said .
" we listened to the original album , and what we heard was how the beatles really pushed the limits with the restricted means at their disposal .
they never intended to perform the record live - it 's a studio production full of overdubs .
but when it is played live on stage by a big band with a brass section and a choir , it 's really fantastic . "
the one and only billy shears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a four-piece band , there was no way the beatles could perform sgt. pepper 's live whether becker 's band is authentic is anyone 's guess .
but there 's something fittingly ironic about a group of latter-day fab four fanatics covering a concept record about a fictional band as played by the beatles .
and the performance suggests that had the liverpool quartet played " pepper 's " live , it might well have rocked - a good thing since becker has invested considerable time and money in the project .
" if you go to wolfgang 's home , it 's absolutely full of beatles ' records , posters and memoriabilia , " said adrian kennedy , a dw-tv producer and on-air personality who serves as the emcee .
" i do n't think he 's making any money from it .
it 's just for the love of the music . "
even more ironically , " sgt. pepper 's " is n't even becker 's favorite beatles album .
" no , that would be ' revolver ' , " becker said .
" but we completely forgot the fortieth anniversary of that record , and we were determined not to miss another opportunity again . "
audience members have been asked to dress up in 1960s style , and a " lovely rita " award will be handed out after the famous final piano chord of " a day in the life " has finished reverberating in the rafters . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

to rectify that , film director wolfgang becker has formed a band to play sgt. pepper 's lonely hearts club band from start to finish .
but do they pull it off ? four decades on from the release in 1967 of what is arguably the most famous album in pop music , " sgt. pepper 's lonely hearts club band " was set to be performed live at a large musical theater in central berlin on wednesday night .
the concert was the brainchild of german film director and beatles ' fanatic wolfgang becker , best known for his international hit " goodbye lenin . "
it 's the end result of an idea that grew beyond all proportions .
" originally , the plan was to just play acoustically in someone 's kitchen , " becker told dw-world .
" then we thought we 'd do it in a bar .
but it just kept growing and growing . "
and grown it has .
becker 's band now consists of dozens of musicians - some professionals , some gifted amateurs - including directorial colleague tom tykwer .
a forty-person choir sings background vocals , and indian musicians have been enlisted to play george harrison 's raga-inflected " within you , without you . "
with a little help from his friends bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang becker has taken beatlemania to new extremes the ensemble first performed the record at a private party in a berlin club this summer .
word of the gig spread , and a local radio station contacted becker about playing it in public as part of the station 's anniversary celebrations .
" i 'm not really nervous , " becker said ahead of the gig .
" but when people are paying money to get in , you do feel a different sense of responsibility . "
the musicians begin with the title track and continue on through the fab four 's psychedelic opus , concluding with what some consider lennon and mccartney 's finest composition , " a day in life . "
the band 's musical co-leader niko weidemann said playing the full record presents some unusual challenges .
" the individual songs are not all that difficult to play , but if you look at it as a total work , it can be tricky , " he said .
" we listened to the original album , and what we heard was how the beatles really pushed the limits with the restricted means at their disposal .
they never intended to perform the record live - it 's a studio production full of overdubs .
but when it is played live on stage by a big band with a brass section and a choir , it 's really fantastic . "
the one and only billy shears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a four-piece band , there was no way the beatles could perform sgt. pepper 's live whether becker 's band is authentic is anyone 's guess .
but there 's something fittingly ironic about a group of latter-day fab four fanatics covering a concept record about a fictional band as played by the beatles .
and the performance suggests that had the liverpool quartet played " pepper 's " live , it might well have rocked - a good thing since becker has invested considerable time and money in the project .
" if you go to wolfgang 's home , it 's absolutely full of beatles ' records , posters and memoriabilia , " said adrian kennedy , a dw-tv producer and on-air personality who serves as the emcee .
" i do n't think he 's making any money from it .
it 's just for the love of the music . "
even more ironically , " sgt. pepper 's " is n't even becker 's favorite beatles album .
" no , that would be ' revolver ' , " becker said .
" but we completely forgot the fortieth anniversary of that record , and we were determined not to miss another opportunity again . "

with a little help from his friends bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang becker has taken beatlemania to new extremes the ensemble first performed the record at a private party in a berlin club this summer .
word of the gig spread , and a local radio station contacted becker about playing it in public as part of the station 's anniversary celebrations .
" i 'm not really nervous , " becker said ahead of the gig .
" but when people are paying money to get in , you do feel a different sense of responsibility . "
the musicians begin with the title track and continue on through the fab four 's psychedelic opus , concluding with what some consider lennon and mccartney 's finest composition , " a day in life . "
the band 's musical co-leader niko weidemann said playing the full record presents some unusual challenges .
" the individual songs are not all that difficult to play , but if you look at it as a total work , it can be tricky , " he said .
" we listened to the original album , and what we heard was how the beatles really pushed the limits with the restricted means at their disposal .
they never intended to perform the record live - it 's a studio production full of overdubs .
but when it is played live on stage by a big band with a brass section and a choir , it 's really fantastic . "
the one and only billy shears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a four-piece band , there was no way the beatles could perform sgt. pepper 's live whether becker 's band is authentic is anyone 's guess .
but there 's something fittingly ironic about a group of latter-day fab four fanatics covering a concept record about a fictional band as played by the beatles .
and the performance suggests that had the liverpool quartet played " pepper 's " live , it might well have rocked - a good thing since becker has invested considerable time and money in the project .
" if you go to wolfgang 's home , it 's absolutely full of beatles ' records , posters and memoriabilia , " said adrian kennedy , a dw-tv producer and on-air personality who serves as the emcee .
" i do n't think he 's making any money from it .
it 's just for the love of the music . "
even more ironically , " sgt. pepper 's " is n't even becker 's favorite beatles album .
" no , that would be ' revolver ' , " becker said .
" but we completely forgot the fortieth anniversary of that record , and we were determined not to miss another opportunity again . "
audience members have been asked to dress up in 1960s style , and a " lovely rita " award will be handed out after the famous final piano chord of " a day in the life " has finished reverberating in the rafters . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

turkey came a small step closer towards european union membership on wednesday , dec .
19 , starting negotiations on two new policy areas .
ankara seized the opportunity to attack some states ' attempts to block its entry . this means that six chapters have been opened until now .
to conclude the accession process , talks have to be completed in thirty-five different fields . speaking after a different meeting in brussels , the eu commissioner in charge of enlargement , finland 's olli rehn , said that all member states had reaffirmed their wish to see accession talks continue , adding that the opening of the two chapters on wednesday should be taken as proof that " the eu sticks to its commitments and keeps its word . " ankara began eu entry talks in 2005 , but they have moved forward very slowly because of rows over cyprus and human rights .
eight negotiating chapters have been blocked since the end of last year because of turkey 's refusal to open its ports and airports to traffic from eu member cyprus .
turkey 's negotiations are expected to last at least a decade , with no guarantee of membership at the end of it all .
ankara criticizes blocking maneuver bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french prime minister is the most vociferous opponent of turkish membership after the formal opening of talks on health and consumer protection and trans-european transport networks , turkish foreign minister ali babacan criticized attempts by individual eu member states to block turkey 's entry bid .
" it is obvious that certain eu member states are trying to erode political and legal aspects of the accession process , " he said .
babacan did not name any names , but french prime minister nicolas sarkozy has been leading the lobby to keep turkey out of the european union . he favors a special partnership with the mainly muslim country instead of full membership .
babacan also stressed that all eu heads of state had agreed in december 2004 to the start of accession talks with turkey .
he said a change of government should not have an impact on this promise .
" we expect all eu member states to stick to that , " he said .
eu states look into the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu member states are divided over whether turkey belongs in the bloc at last friday 's eu summit , members agreed to create a group to study the long-term future of europe .
european union leaders named former spanish prime minister felipe gonzales , a past critic of turkey 's entry bid , to head the group .
a spokesman said gonzales had modified his position and now says the eu should honor any commitments it has made to turkey .
spain , britain , italy and sweden are among the eu states keenest to keep its membership bid on track .
germany 's governing christian democrats are opposed to turkish entry , but chancellor angela merkel did nothing to attempt to stop the opening of further negotiations . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the measures are intended to curb global warming . under the plans , automobile manufacturers would have to reduce carbon emissions produced by their fleets of passenger cars to an average of 120 grams per kilometer by 2012 .
currently , new cars emit some 160 grams on average . should they not comply to the guidelines , automakers are to face steep fines . with several commissioners dissenting , the european commission - the eu 's executive arm - agreed on a four-year phase-in period from 2012 for the fines . " this will send a strong signal to the world about the determination of the european union to take bold measures on climate change , " eu environment commissioner stavros dimas said at a press conference . germany says the plan will not be effective the proposed legislation enraged germany and its carmakers .
german chancellor angela merkel said the eu was making policy " at the expense of germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler , bmw and porsche could face difficulties meeting the targets government spokesman thomas steg said the measures were biased against german companies , which tend to make bigger and more powerful vehicles .
" whatever motive led a majority of commissioners to decide this , we consider the solution to be wrong , we consider the solution to be very harmful and will do everything to force changes , " he said .
steg said that the plans would threaten jobs , hinder innovation and fail to be an effective instrument for climate protection .
environment minister sigmar gabriel also slammed the proposals , saying that they favored italian and french car makers .
speaking on german television , he criticized the fact that the limits would apply to a car manufacturers ' fleet , meaning that a manufacturer such as fiat with its numerous small models would not have to cut the emissions of its high-end cars .
according to the european commission 's plans , penalties on companies will start at 20 euros -lrb- $ 29 -rrb- per excess gram of co2 and rise to 95 euros in 2016 .
opinions split on the issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany says firms such as fiat will get off lightly eu commission president jose manuel barroso hailed the new measures , which still need the backing of eu states and the european parliament .
" this proposal demonstrates that the european union is committed to being a world leader in cutting co2 emissions and the development of a low carbon economy , " he said .
" at the same time , we are committed to promoting the competitiveness of our industry and its global technological leadership , " barroso added .
the environmental group greenpeace said the proposals did not go far enough , accusing the eu executive of backing down in the face of lobbying from the auto industry .
" the commission has let car makers drive away with a proposal that sets a weak , short-term standard , lacks any longer-term targets and offers an open road to heavy , gas-guzzling vehicles , " said greenpeace transport policy expert franziska achterberg . . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 19.12.2007 all-star german band puts sgt. pepper 's on stage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the beatles made it , but it took a bunch of germans to put it on stage the beatles never performed their most famous album live .
to rectify that , film director wolfgang becker has formed a band to play sgt. pepper 's lonely hearts club band from start to finish .
but do they pull it off ? four decades on from the release in 1967 of what is arguably the most famous album in pop music , " sgt. pepper 's lonely hearts club band " was set to be performed live at a large musical theater in central berlin on wednesday night .
the concert was the brainchild of german film director and beatles ' fanatic wolfgang becker , best known for his international hit " goodbye lenin . "
it 's the end result of an idea that grew beyond all proportions .
" originally , the plan was to just play acoustically in someone 's kitchen , " becker told dw-world .
" then we thought we 'd do it in a bar .
but it just kept growing and growing . "
and grown it has .
becker 's band now consists of dozens of musicians - some professionals , some gifted amateurs - including directorial colleague tom tykwer .
a forty-person choir sings background vocals , and indian musicians have been enlisted to play george harrison 's raga-inflected " within you , without you . "
with a little help from his friends bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang becker has taken beatlemania to new extremes the ensemble first performed the record at a private party in a berlin club this summer .
word of the gig spread , and a local radio station contacted becker about playing it in public as part of the station 's anniversary celebrations .
" i 'm not really nervous , " becker said ahead of the gig .
" but when people are paying money to get in , you do feel a different sense of responsibility . "
the musicians begin with the title track and continue on through the fab four 's psychedelic opus , concluding with what some consider lennon and mccartney 's finest composition , " a day in life . "
the band 's musical co-leader niko weidemann said playing the full record presents some unusual challenges .
" the individual songs are not all that difficult to play , but if you look at it as a total work , it can be tricky , " he said .
" we listened to the original album , and what we heard was how the beatles really pushed the limits with the restricted means at their disposal .
they never intended to perform the record live - it 's a studio production full of overdubs .
but when it is played live on stage by a big band with a brass section and a choir , it 's really fantastic . "
the one and only billy shears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a four-piece band , there was no way the beatles could perform sgt. pepper 's live whether becker 's band is authentic is anyone 's guess .
but there 's something fittingly ironic about a group of latter-day fab four fanatics covering a concept record about a fictional band as played by the beatles .
and the performance suggests that had the liverpool quartet played " pepper 's " live , it might well have rocked - a good thing since becker has invested considerable time and money in the project .
" if you go to wolfgang 's home , it 's absolutely full of beatles ' records , posters and memoriabilia , " said adrian kennedy , a dw-tv producer and on-air personality who serves as the emcee .
" i do n't think he 's making any money from it .
it 's just for the love of the music . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 19.12.2007 eu unveils plan to cut auto emissions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how the burden will be shared among carmakers in reducing emissions is unclear industry and environment champions are lining up for a showdown with the european commission on how to cut carbon dioxide emissions from cars without harming europe 's carmakers . the european union has revealed plans for cutting carbon dioxide emissions in eu-made vehicles , but there is dispute among the manufacturers about who should bear the brunt of the cuts . " a climate-change war over cars " was how the business weekly wirtschaftswoche described the standoff between one of germany 's largest and most vital industries and the bureaucrats in brussels . it is up to the european commission - the eu 's executive arm - to set out how carmakers should meet the target of cutting emissions to an average of 130 grams / kilometer -lrb- g / km -rrb- among their passenger vehicles from 2012 , and how parts and fuel-makers should knock a further 10 g / km off the average .
the target represents a cut of about 25 percent from current levels . internal commission strife bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checking tire pressure and using biofuels can help reduce emissions the eu 's commissioners , however , remain at odds over several key points . commissioner for enterprise günter verheugen , a staunch defender of the german car industry , has sought to reduce fines on companies that do not cut average emissions to 130 grams per km through engine technology . but environment commission stavros dimas argued for gradually mounting fines from 2012 as an effective deterrent to force manufacturers to invest in clean technology . overall , car parts and fuel-makers are meant to find ways to slash average emissions by a quarter - from the current 160 g / km to 120 g / km .
while climate protection groups say that might be a manageable target , it is far from clear which manufacturers will serve as the sacrificial lamb . " the only thing that really poses a threat to us are bad political decisions taken in brussels or berlin , " matthias wissmann , the head of the german automobile federation vda , said last week . given that the targets apply to the sector as a whole , it is the commission 's task to decide how the new burden is to be shared . big versus small bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european carmakers have taken different sides in the co2 dispute countries that traditionally make larger , less fuel-efficient vehicles , such as germany and sweden , are at odds with their european neighbors , such as france , spain and italy , who are better known for producing smaller cars . the latter say luxury carmakers should take the weight of the new guidelines , not least because they are the ones with the highest profit margins . but german chancellor angela merkel , who has been vocally pro-environment since taking up office , has lobbied hard against the emissions caps . " we will fight for our interests , " she told a meeting of eu leaders in brussels recently . a common pool of co2 in keeping with germany 's wishes , the latest word from the commission was that it was proposing the cuts to be proportionate to a vehicle 's weight , and the emissions targets to be pooled among carmakers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european automakers may see profits drop if emissions limits are put in place also unresolved is how manufacturers will be penalized for failing to meet their targets .
head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , has suggested a fine of 10 euros -lrb- $ 14 -rrb- for each extra gram of co2 , but the european commissioner for the environment stavros dimas wants to implement a fee of 35 euros per excess gram - a drop from the 95 euros per gram he had been quoted with proposing in some media reports . that suggestion has met with fierce resistance from germany , whose car industry could stand to loose billions under such a stringent penalty system . " the implementation of the carbon dioxide targets could hurt them more than expected , " ferdinand dudenhöffer , head of the center for automotive research , said of germany 's big , fuel guzzlers .
" the impact on the profit margins of europe 's top-of-the-range producers could be considerable . " but that 's consequence environmental campaigners say the german automobile industry should have seen coming . " it was the germans who popularised the idea of a big car as a status symbol , and now it has backfired on them , " said greenpeace 's wolfgang lohbeck . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de opinion : mandate for kyoto successor redeems bali failure the progress made in bali was minimal at best , writes dw 's jens thurau .
but the mandate for a kyoto successor treaty by 2009 and the isolation of the us delegation were two lights in the dark .
-lrb- 17.12.2007 -rrb- germany hails bali outcome as better than expected german environment minister sigmar gabriel welcomed the outcome of the un climate change conference on saturday after a grueling all-night finish in which the negotiating countries ironed out a last-minute compromise .

" a climate-change war over cars " was how the business weekly wirtschaftswoche described the standoff between one of germany 's largest and most vital industries and the bureaucrats in brussels . it is up to the european commission - the eu 's executive arm - to set out how carmakers should meet the target of cutting emissions to an average of 130 grams / kilometer -lrb- g / km -rrb- among their passenger vehicles from 2012 , and how parts and fuel-makers should knock a further 10 g / km off the average .
the target represents a cut of about 25 percent from current levels . internal commission strife bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checking tire pressure and using biofuels can help reduce emissions the eu 's commissioners , however , remain at odds over several key points . commissioner for enterprise günter verheugen , a staunch defender of the german car industry , has sought to reduce fines on companies that do not cut average emissions to 130 grams per km through engine technology . but environment commission stavros dimas argued for gradually mounting fines from 2012 as an effective deterrent to force manufacturers to invest in clean technology . overall , car parts and fuel-makers are meant to find ways to slash average emissions by a quarter - from the current 160 g / km to 120 g / km .
while climate protection groups say that might be a manageable target , it is far from clear which manufacturers will serve as the sacrificial lamb . " the only thing that really poses a threat to us are bad political decisions taken in brussels or berlin , " matthias wissmann , the head of the german automobile federation vda , said last week . given that the targets apply to the sector as a whole , it is the commission 's task to decide how the new burden is to be shared . big versus small bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european carmakers have taken different sides in the co2 dispute countries that traditionally make larger , less fuel-efficient vehicles , such as germany and sweden , are at odds with their european neighbors , such as france , spain and italy , who are better known for producing smaller cars . the latter say luxury carmakers should take the weight of the new guidelines , not least because they are the ones with the highest profit margins . but german chancellor angela merkel , who has been vocally pro-environment since taking up office , has lobbied hard against the emissions caps . " we will fight for our interests , " she told a meeting of eu leaders in brussels recently . a common pool of co2 in keeping with germany 's wishes , the latest word from the commission was that it was proposing the cuts to be proportionate to a vehicle 's weight , and the emissions targets to be pooled among carmakers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european automakers may see profits drop if emissions limits are put in place also unresolved is how manufacturers will be penalized for failing to meet their targets .
head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , has suggested a fine of 10 euros -lrb- $ 14 -rrb- for each extra gram of co2 , but the european commissioner for the environment stavros dimas wants to implement a fee of 35 euros per excess gram - a drop from the 95 euros per gram he had been quoted with proposing in some media reports . that suggestion has met with fierce resistance from germany , whose car industry could stand to loose billions under such a stringent penalty system .

" a climate-change war over cars " was how the business weekly wirtschaftswoche described the standoff between one of germany 's largest and most vital industries and the bureaucrats in brussels . it is up to the european commission - the eu 's executive arm - to set out how carmakers should meet the target of cutting emissions to an average of 130 grams / kilometer -lrb- g / km -rrb- among their passenger vehicles from 2012 , and how parts and fuel-makers should knock a further 10 g / km off the average .
the target represents a cut of about 25 percent from current levels . internal commission strife bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checking tire pressure and using biofuels can help reduce emissions the eu 's commissioners , however , remain at odds over several key points . commissioner for enterprise günter verheugen , a staunch defender of the german car industry , has sought to reduce fines on companies that do not cut average emissions to 130 grams per km through engine technology . but environment commission stavros dimas argued for gradually mounting fines from 2012 as an effective deterrent to force manufacturers to invest in clean technology . overall , car parts and fuel-makers are meant to find ways to slash average emissions by a quarter - from the current 160 g / km to 120 g / km .
while climate protection groups say that might be a manageable target , it is far from clear which manufacturers will serve as the sacrificial lamb . " the only thing that really poses a threat to us are bad political decisions taken in brussels or berlin , " matthias wissmann , the head of the german automobile federation vda , said last week . given that the targets apply to the sector as a whole , it is the commission 's task to decide how the new burden is to be shared . big versus small bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european carmakers have taken different sides in the co2 dispute countries that traditionally make larger , less fuel-efficient vehicles , such as germany and sweden , are at odds with their european neighbors , such as france , spain and italy , who are better known for producing smaller cars . the latter say luxury carmakers should take the weight of the new guidelines , not least because they are the ones with the highest profit margins . but german chancellor angela merkel , who has been vocally pro-environment since taking up office , has lobbied hard against the emissions caps . " we will fight for our interests , " she told a meeting of eu leaders in brussels recently . a common pool of co2 in keeping with germany 's wishes , the latest word from the commission was that it was proposing the cuts to be proportionate to a vehicle 's weight , and the emissions targets to be pooled among carmakers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european automakers may see profits drop if emissions limits are put in place also unresolved is how manufacturers will be penalized for failing to meet their targets .
head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , has suggested a fine of 10 euros -lrb- $ 14 -rrb- for each extra gram of co2 , but the european commissioner for the environment stavros dimas wants to implement a fee of 35 euros per excess gram - a drop from the 95 euros per gram he had been quoted with proposing in some media reports . that suggestion has met with fierce resistance from germany , whose car industry could stand to loose billions under such a stringent penalty system . " the implementation of the carbon dioxide targets could hurt them more than expected , " ferdinand dudenhöffer , head of the center for automotive research , said of germany 's big , fuel guzzlers .
" the impact on the profit margins of europe 's top-of-the-range producers could be considerable . " but that 's consequence environmental campaigners say the german automobile industry should have seen coming . " it was the germans who popularised the idea of a big car as a status symbol , and now it has backfired on them , " said greenpeace 's wolfgang lohbeck . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but , that did n't stop the german translation from cracking the 2007 bestseller lists .
he talked about prussia 's appeal . dw-world.de : are you surprised that an academic book on prussia could make the german bestseller lists ? christopher clark : i certainly did n't expect success on that level .
i think it 's a case of timing .
the fall of the berlin wall and german re-unification have triggered a process of re-imagining the german past in general and prussia in particular .
so much of what was left of the old prussian state was in former communist east germany , so it was kind of locked away .
with the re-unification of germany , it all became visible and got reconnected to the larger german national entity .
that and the opening up of archives of the former east germany prompted a rethink .
let 's try to sum up your thesis .
prussia was a relatively enlightened , progressive state that inadvertently destroyed itself when it enlisted the force of german nationalism .
is that close ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prussian culture , including architecture , blossomed in the 19th century that 's exactly it .
nationalism was prussia 's downfall .
in older historical literature , nationalism was seen as the culmination of prussian history .
prussia 's task in history had been to create the german nation .
just as we today tend to see the rise of the third reich in 1933 as the end of an era and explain how germany got to that point , previous generations tried to explain how german history had got to 1871 and the creation of the german empire .
and the answer was that prussia was the steering , shaping and sometimes manipulative power that would bring the german nation into existence .
the emergence of the german nation is the thing that gives meaning to the whole history of prussia . that , in my view , is completely and utterly wrong .
throughout its history prussia had been the most un-national state you can imagine , partly because it contained such large numbers of non-germans , but also because the whole idea of its existence was that of the sovereign , monarchical state , interwoven with the idea of the sovereignty of law . these were ideas that had nothing to do with the uprising of a national movement .
prussia responded very hostilely to early german nationalism because the hohenzollern rulers rightly recognized that it would act like a kind of corrosive acid eating away at everything the prussian state stood for . it was only during the unstable period of the 1850s , 60s and 70s that prussian statesmen , particularly prussian prime minister and german chancellor otto von bismarck , began to imagine that they could tame nationalism .
but that was something they failed to do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hohenzollern kings ruled first prussia , then germany from 1701 to 1918 you mention bismarck .
he plays less of a role in your book than in most works of prussian history .
why is that ? in some ways i think bismarck turned his back on prussia .
king friedrich wilhelm iv of prussia said in 1848 : " prussia will be henceforth merged into germany . "
and i think he got it right that the process of national consolidation that bismarck saw as a continuation of prussian security policy would ultimately not prussianize germany , but germanize prussia , and that everything the old prussia stood for would be lost .
so in some ways i see bismarck as the first executor of a kind of closing-down sale of prussia and prussian tradition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historian christopher clark says prussia was never the bad guy of europe but was n't nationalism something inevitable that was going to happen sooner or later ?
or can one imagine a scenario in which prussia would still exist today ? that 's a really good question and a difficult one to answer .
although historians usually rear up in horror at the notion , i think it was probably inevitable .
if you think about the other multi-national states that existed in the 19th century , russia , for example , or the austro-hungarian empire , both of them disappeared in the course of the world war i and were replaced by something radically different .
it seems to me that these pre-national , multi-ethnic commonwealths that were such a feature of europe in the early modern period were probably doomed to go under . let 's backtrack now and talk about the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries and prussia under friedrich the great .
you describe especially the prussian capital berlin as a vibrant , even libidinous place during his reign .
would you have liked to live there ? i think there would have been wonderful things about being in berlin in the 1780s and 90s .
berlin , if you compare it with london or paris , has the reputation of being boring .
but , that does n't mean berlin was dead or lacked an urbane identity .
and this identity was not driven by the projection of power through the dynasty and its monumental public buildings .
the new culture that emerged was driven by voluntary impulses from civil society .
there was a proliferation of clubs and organizations for all sorts of purposes - cultivating the sciences , for instance , or looking at economical ways of using fuel .
there were literary societies and freemason lodges .
it was an endless cornucopia of little voluntary initiatives .
the point i was trying to make is that this created a city that was n't just about courts or courtliness but about courtesy and civility of a very middle-class , bourgeois kind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arrogance of emperor wilhelm ii and his generals led to defeat in world war i many historians draw links between prussia and nazism .
although no one would claim prussia was the cradle of the ideology , some people see connections between prussian militarism and subservience and the third reich .
but , you portray prussia more as a source of opposition . if it were true that prussia created an environment that deadened the will of ordinary citizens and turned them into instruments of state power , thereby blazing a trail for a totalitarian dictatorship in which people would do anything they were told , it would be very easy to test that hypothesis .
all you 'd have to show is that germans of prussian provenance made better and more obedient nazis than people from austria , baden-württemberg and so on .
if that had been the case , it would be more than obvious .
but it is n't .
there is simply no evidence .
on the contrary , people from baden-württemberg and especially austria made for equally keen nazis , with austrians , for example , being hugely overrepresented in the machinery of nazi genocide .
it 's just simply not the case that you can map out a relationship between prussia and nazism that made people into better tools of the regime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president paul von hindenburg appointed hitler as chancellor in 1933 of course , prussia is implicated in the story of the events that brought hitler to power .
the old prussian elites played a key role in cooking up the plan to put hitler into power as german chancellor in 1933 .
not because they wanted the third reich , but because they thought they could use hitler in a kind of conservative coup against the weimar republic .
of course , they were disastrously wrong .
the corporate arrogance of the prussian nobility helps to explain why some perfectly intelligent people failed to recognize the danger hitler presented . but national socialism was in many respects the exact opposite pole of prussiandom .
the old prussian state had been about the authority of government and the rule of law , but the new nazi reich was about the people .
it was an ethnic entity .
the nazis did n't care about laws .
to them , laws were utterly secondary .
what mattered was the führer as the expression of the will of the volk .
this was an idea that had no precedent in prussian history whatsoever .
so i see a very strong antipathy between the two forms of state . christopher clark is senior lecturer in modern european history at st. catharine 's college , university of cambridge . interview by jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but , that did n't stop the german translation from cracking the 2007 bestseller lists .
he talked about prussia 's appeal . dw-world.de : are you surprised that an academic book on prussia could make the german bestseller lists ? christopher clark : i certainly did n't expect success on that level .
i think it 's a case of timing .
the fall of the berlin wall and german re-unification have triggered a process of re-imagining the german past in general and prussia in particular .
so much of what was left of the old prussian state was in former communist east germany , so it was kind of locked away .
with the re-unification of germany , it all became visible and got reconnected to the larger german national entity .
that and the opening up of archives of the former east germany prompted a rethink .
let 's try to sum up your thesis .
prussia was a relatively enlightened , progressive state that inadvertently destroyed itself when it enlisted the force of german nationalism .
is that close ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prussian culture , including architecture , blossomed in the 19th century that 's exactly it .
nationalism was prussia 's downfall .
in older historical literature , nationalism was seen as the culmination of prussian history .
prussia 's task in history had been to create the german nation .
just as we today tend to see the rise of the third reich in 1933 as the end of an era and explain how germany got to that point , previous generations tried to explain how german history had got to 1871 and the creation of the german empire .
and the answer was that prussia was the steering , shaping and sometimes manipulative power that would bring the german nation into existence .
the emergence of the german nation is the thing that gives meaning to the whole history of prussia . that , in my view , is completely and utterly wrong .
throughout its history prussia had been the most un-national state you can imagine , partly because it contained such large numbers of non-germans , but also because the whole idea of its existence was that of the sovereign , monarchical state , interwoven with the idea of the sovereignty of law . these were ideas that had nothing to do with the uprising of a national movement .
prussia responded very hostilely to early german nationalism because the hohenzollern rulers rightly recognized that it would act like a kind of corrosive acid eating away at everything the prussian state stood for . it was only during the unstable period of the 1850s , 60s and 70s that prussian statesmen , particularly prussian prime minister and german chancellor otto von bismarck , began to imagine that they could tame nationalism .
but that was something they failed to do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hohenzollern kings ruled first prussia , then germany from 1701 to 1918 you mention bismarck .
he plays less of a role in your book than in most works of prussian history .
why is that ? in some ways i think bismarck turned his back on prussia .
king friedrich wilhelm iv of prussia said in 1848 : " prussia will be henceforth merged into germany . "
and i think he got it right that the process of national consolidation that bismarck saw as a continuation of prussian security policy would ultimately not prussianize germany , but germanize prussia , and that everything the old prussia stood for would be lost .
so in some ways i see bismarck as the first executor of a kind of closing-down sale of prussia and prussian tradition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historian christopher clark says prussia was never the bad guy of europe but was n't nationalism something inevitable that was going to happen sooner or later ?
or can one imagine a scenario in which prussia would still exist today ? that 's a really good question and a difficult one to answer .
although historians usually rear up in horror at the notion , i think it was probably inevitable .
if you think about the other multi-national states that existed in the 19th century , russia , for example , or the austro-hungarian empire , both of them disappeared in the course of the world war i and were replaced by something radically different .
it seems to me that these pre-national , multi-ethnic commonwealths that were such a feature of europe in the early modern period were probably doomed to go under . let 's backtrack now and talk about the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries and prussia under friedrich the great .
you describe especially the prussian capital berlin as a vibrant , even libidinous place during his reign .
would you have liked to live there ? i think there would have been wonderful things about being in berlin in the 1780s and 90s .
berlin , if you compare it with london or paris , has the reputation of being boring .
but , that does n't mean berlin was dead or lacked an urbane identity .
and this identity was not driven by the projection of power through the dynasty and its monumental public buildings .
the new culture that emerged was driven by voluntary impulses from civil society .
there was a proliferation of clubs and organizations for all sorts of purposes - cultivating the sciences , for instance , or looking at economical ways of using fuel .
there were literary societies and freemason lodges .
it was an endless cornucopia of little voluntary initiatives .
the point i was trying to make is that this created a city that was n't just about courts or courtliness but about courtesy and civility of a very middle-class , bourgeois kind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arrogance of emperor wilhelm ii and his generals led to defeat in world war i many historians draw links between prussia and nazism .
although no one would claim prussia was the cradle of the ideology , some people see connections between prussian militarism and subservience and the third reich .
but , you portray prussia more as a source of opposition . if it were true that prussia created an environment that deadened the will of ordinary citizens and turned them into instruments of state power , thereby blazing a trail for a totalitarian dictatorship in which people would do anything they were told , it would be very easy to test that hypothesis .
all you 'd have to show is that germans of prussian provenance made better and more obedient nazis than people from austria , baden-württemberg and so on .
if that had been the case , it would be more than obvious .
but it is n't .
there is simply no evidence .
on the contrary , people from baden-württemberg and especially austria made for equally keen nazis , with austrians , for example , being hugely overrepresented in the machinery of nazi genocide .
it 's just simply not the case that you can map out a relationship between prussia and nazism that made people into better tools of the regime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president paul von hindenburg appointed hitler as chancellor in 1933 of course , prussia is implicated in the story of the events that brought hitler to power .
the old prussian elites played a key role in cooking up the plan to put hitler into power as german chancellor in 1933 .
not because they wanted the third reich , but because they thought they could use hitler in a kind of conservative coup against the weimar republic .
of course , they were disastrously wrong .
the corporate arrogance of the prussian nobility helps to explain why some perfectly intelligent people failed to recognize the danger hitler presented . but national socialism was in many respects the exact opposite pole of prussiandom .
the old prussian state had been about the authority of government and the rule of law , but the new nazi reich was about the people .
it was an ethnic entity .
the nazis did n't care about laws .
to them , laws were utterly secondary .
what mattered was the führer as the expression of the will of the volk .
this was an idea that had no precedent in prussian history whatsoever .
so i see a very strong antipathy between the two forms of state . christopher clark is senior lecturer in modern european history at st. catharine 's college , university of cambridge . interview by jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

western countries have offered their help to the breakaway province . serbia and kosovo were at loggerheads at a united nations security council meeting in new york .
kosovo 's 90-percent albanian majority is ready to declare independence within weeks , but serbia insists that the province must remain part of its territory . neither side was willing to compromise during wednesday 's meeting . " the potential for a negotiated solution is now exhausted , " a joint statement by eu ambassadors on the security council and the united states said following the meeting . the us and key european union nations back kosovo 's call for independence , and have pledged their future support . but on wednesday , russia said it stood behind its close ally serbia 's call for further negotiations on autonomy for the province . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the presence of un police , clashes still occur in kosovo the us and eu statement said that as irreconcilable efforts stand in the way , " the eu stands ready to play a leading role in implementing a settlement defining kosovo 's future status . " listening to both sides the 15-member security council met in a closed-door session to hear serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica and kosovo 's president fatmir sejdiu make their respective cases . it was the first council debate since a " troika " of mediators - the eu , russia and the united states - said on dec .
10 that four months of talks between belgrade and kosovo 's albanian separatists had failed to reach a compromise on the issue of sovereignty . kostunica said that a unilateral declaration of independence supported by western nations would undermine the un charter and mark the beginning of a new era " in which might is above right . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : live goes on in pristina he said it would trigger a " serious crisis , " but did not comment on what action serbia might take . sejdiu , president of the un-run province , told the council that the collapse of the former yugoslavia was " one of the great tragedies of the modern era . " " we are exhausted after nearly two decades of isolation , war and political limbo , " he said , referring to the ethnic cleansing of kosovo albanians in the 1990s .
he stressed that co-existence of serbia and kosovo in the same state was impossible . still in limbo wednesday 's meeting ended with no action taken - which the eu and the united states said was equivalent to closing the door on un efforts to resolve the province 's status . last week , eu leaders said they were prepared to send around 1,800 police and prosecutors to kosovo as part of a un proposal to grant the province " supervised independence . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former un mediator for kosovo , martti ahtisaari at the same time , eu leaders also offered serbia " accelerated " entry into the european union . russia has said that the eu police mission would be illegal without un approval , but western diplomats at the united nations refuted that notion . in april , then un special envoy martti ahtisaari presented a plan offering kosovo " supervised independence . " under the proposal , international agencies would guide kosovo toward full independence and membership to the united nations .
the agencies , however , would also have the power to prevent the province from merging with albania as well as keep serb areas from splitting off to become part of serbia . western ambassadors have said that un security council resolution 1244 - passed after nato pushed serbian forces out of kosovo in 1999 - allowed for the implementation of ahtisaari 's plan . many serbs consider kosovo the cultural cradle of their identity .
the province has been administered by the united nations since 1999 , when nato ended serbia 's crackdown on and ethnic cleansing of separatist ethnic-albanians . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

19 .
western countries have offered their help to the breakaway province . serbia and kosovo were at loggerheads at a united nations security council meeting in new york .
kosovo 's 90-percent albanian majority is ready to declare independence within weeks , but serbia insists that the province must remain part of its territory . neither side was willing to compromise during wednesday 's meeting . " the potential for a negotiated solution is now exhausted , " a joint statement by eu ambassadors on the security council and the united states said following the meeting . the us and key european union nations back kosovo 's call for independence , and have pledged their future support . but on wednesday , russia said it stood behind its close ally serbia 's call for further negotiations on autonomy for the province . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the presence of un police , clashes still occur in kosovo the us and eu statement said that as irreconcilable efforts stand in the way , " the eu stands ready to play a leading role in implementing a settlement defining kosovo 's future status . " listening to both sides the 15-member security council met in a closed-door session to hear serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica and kosovo 's president fatmir sejdiu make their respective cases . it was the first council debate since a " troika " of mediators - the eu , russia and the united states - said on dec .
10 that four months of talks between belgrade and kosovo 's albanian separatists had failed to reach a compromise on the issue of sovereignty . kostunica said that a unilateral declaration of independence supported by western nations would undermine the un charter and mark the beginning of a new era " in which might is above right . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : live goes on in pristina he said it would trigger a " serious crisis , " but did not comment on what action serbia might take . sejdiu , president of the un-run province , told the council that the collapse of the former yugoslavia was " one of the great tragedies of the modern era . " " we are exhausted after nearly two decades of isolation , war and political limbo , " he said , referring to the ethnic cleansing of kosovo albanians in the 1990s .
he stressed that co-existence of serbia and kosovo in the same state was impossible . still in limbo wednesday 's meeting ended with no action taken - which the eu and the united states said was equivalent to closing the door on un efforts to resolve the province 's status . last week , eu leaders said they were prepared to send around 1,800 police and prosecutors to kosovo as part of a un proposal to grant the province " supervised independence . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former un mediator for kosovo , martti ahtisaari at the same time , eu leaders also offered serbia " accelerated " entry into the european union . russia has said that the eu police mission would be illegal without un approval , but western diplomats at the united nations refuted that notion . in april , then un special envoy martti ahtisaari presented a plan offering kosovo " supervised independence . " under the proposal , international agencies would guide kosovo toward full independence and membership to the united nations .
the agencies , however , would also have the power to prevent the province from merging with albania as well as keep serb areas from splitting off to become part of serbia . western ambassadors have said that un security council resolution 1244 - passed after nato pushed serbian forces out of kosovo in 1999 - allowed for the implementation of ahtisaari 's plan . many serbs consider kosovo the cultural cradle of their identity .
the province has been administered by the united nations since 1999 , when nato ended serbia 's crackdown on and ethnic cleansing of separatist ethnic-albanians . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he talked about prussia 's appeal . dw-world.de : are you surprised that an academic book on prussia could make the german bestseller lists ? christopher clark : i certainly did n't expect success on that level .
i think it 's a case of timing .
the fall of the berlin wall and german re-unification have triggered a process of re-imagining the german past in general and prussia in particular .
so much of what was left of the old prussian state was in former communist east germany , so it was kind of locked away .
with the re-unification of germany , it all became visible and got reconnected to the larger german national entity .
that and the opening up of archives of the former east germany prompted a rethink .
let 's try to sum up your thesis .
prussia was a relatively enlightened , progressive state that inadvertently destroyed itself when it enlisted the force of german nationalism .
is that close ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prussian culture , including architecture , blossomed in the 19th century that 's exactly it .
nationalism was prussia 's downfall .
in older historical literature , nationalism was seen as the culmination of prussian history .
prussia 's task in history had been to create the german nation .
just as we today tend to see the rise of the third reich in 1933 as the end of an era and explain how germany got to that point , previous generations tried to explain how german history had got to 1871 and the creation of the german empire .
and the answer was that prussia was the steering , shaping and sometimes manipulative power that would bring the german nation into existence .
the emergence of the german nation is the thing that gives meaning to the whole history of prussia . that , in my view , is completely and utterly wrong .
throughout its history prussia had been the most un-national state you can imagine , partly because it contained such large numbers of non-germans , but also because the whole idea of its existence was that of the sovereign , monarchical state , interwoven with the idea of the sovereignty of law . these were ideas that had nothing to do with the uprising of a national movement .
prussia responded very hostilely to early german nationalism because the hohenzollern rulers rightly recognized that it would act like a kind of corrosive acid eating away at everything the prussian state stood for . it was only during the unstable period of the 1850s , 60s and 70s that prussian statesmen , particularly prussian prime minister and german chancellor otto von bismarck , began to imagine that they could tame nationalism .
but that was something they failed to do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hohenzollern kings ruled first prussia , then germany from 1701 to 1918 you mention bismarck .
he plays less of a role in your book than in most works of prussian history .
why is that ? in some ways i think bismarck turned his back on prussia .
king friedrich wilhelm iv of prussia said in 1848 : " prussia will be henceforth merged into germany . "
and i think he got it right that the process of national consolidation that bismarck saw as a continuation of prussian security policy would ultimately not prussianize germany , but germanize prussia , and that everything the old prussia stood for would be lost .
so in some ways i see bismarck as the first executor of a kind of closing-down sale of prussia and prussian tradition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historian christopher clark says prussia was never the bad guy of europe but was n't nationalism something inevitable that was going to happen sooner or later ?
or can one imagine a scenario in which prussia would still exist today ? that 's a really good question and a difficult one to answer .
although historians usually rear up in horror at the notion , i think it was probably inevitable .
if you think about the other multi-national states that existed in the 19th century , russia , for example , or the austro-hungarian empire , both of them disappeared in the course of the world war i and were replaced by something radically different .
it seems to me that these pre-national , multi-ethnic commonwealths that were such a feature of europe in the early modern period were probably doomed to go under . let 's backtrack now and talk about the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries and prussia under friedrich the great .
you describe especially the prussian capital berlin as a vibrant , even libidinous place during his reign .
would you have liked to live there ? i think there would have been wonderful things about being in berlin in the 1780s and 90s .
berlin , if you compare it with london or paris , has the reputation of being boring .
but , that does n't mean berlin was dead or lacked an urbane identity .
and this identity was not driven by the projection of power through the dynasty and its monumental public buildings .
the new culture that emerged was driven by voluntary impulses from civil society .
there was a proliferation of clubs and organizations for all sorts of purposes - cultivating the sciences , for instance , or looking at economical ways of using fuel .
there were literary societies and freemason lodges .
it was an endless cornucopia of little voluntary initiatives .
the point i was trying to make is that this created a city that was n't just about courts or courtliness but about courtesy and civility of a very middle-class , bourgeois kind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arrogance of emperor wilhelm ii and his generals led to defeat in world war i many historians draw links between prussia and nazism .
although no one would claim prussia was the cradle of the ideology , some people see connections between prussian militarism and subservience and the third reich .
but , you portray prussia more as a source of opposition . if it were true that prussia created an environment that deadened the will of ordinary citizens and turned them into instruments of state power , thereby blazing a trail for a totalitarian dictatorship in which people would do anything they were told , it would be very easy to test that hypothesis .
all you 'd have to show is that germans of prussian provenance made better and more obedient nazis than people from austria , baden-württemberg and so on .
if that had been the case , it would be more than obvious .
but it is n't .
there is simply no evidence .
on the contrary , people from baden-württemberg and especially austria made for equally keen nazis , with austrians , for example , being hugely overrepresented in the machinery of nazi genocide .
it 's just simply not the case that you can map out a relationship between prussia and nazism that made people into better tools of the regime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president paul von hindenburg appointed hitler as chancellor in 1933 of course , prussia is implicated in the story of the events that brought hitler to power .
the old prussian elites played a key role in cooking up the plan to put hitler into power as german chancellor in 1933 .
not because they wanted the third reich , but because they thought they could use hitler in a kind of conservative coup against the weimar republic .
of course , they were disastrously wrong .
the corporate arrogance of the prussian nobility helps to explain why some perfectly intelligent people failed to recognize the danger hitler presented . but national socialism was in many respects the exact opposite pole of prussiandom .
the old prussian state had been about the authority of government and the rule of law , but the new nazi reich was about the people .
it was an ethnic entity .
the nazis did n't care about laws .
to them , laws were utterly secondary .
what mattered was the führer as the expression of the will of the volk .
this was an idea that had no precedent in prussian history whatsoever .

the measures are intended to curb global warming . under the plans , automobile manufacturers would have to reduce carbon emissions produced by their fleets of passenger cars to an average of 120 grams per kilometer by 2012 .
currently , new cars emit some 160 grams on average . should they not comply to the guidelines , automakers are to face steep fines . with several commissioners dissenting , the european commission - the eu 's executive arm - agreed on a four-year phase-in period from 2012 for the fines . " this will send a strong signal to the world about the determination of the european union to take bold measures on climate change , " eu environment commissioner stavros dimas said at a press conference . germany says the plan will not be effective the proposed legislation enraged germany and its carmakers .
german chancellor angela merkel said the eu was making policy " at the expense of germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler , bmw and porsche could face difficulties meeting the targets government spokesman thomas steg said the measures were biased against german companies , which tend to make bigger and more powerful vehicles .
" whatever motive led a majority of commissioners to decide this , we consider the solution to be wrong , we consider the solution to be very harmful and will do everything to force changes , " he said .
steg said that the plans would threaten jobs , hinder innovation and fail to be an effective instrument for climate protection .
environment minister sigmar gabriel also slammed the proposals , saying that they favored italian and french car makers .
speaking on german television , he criticized the fact that the limits would apply to a car manufacturers ' fleet , meaning that a manufacturer such as fiat with its numerous small models would not have to cut the emissions of its high-end cars .
according to the european commission 's plans , penalties on companies will start at 20 euros -lrb- $ 29 -rrb- per excess gram of co2 and rise to 95 euros in 2016 .
opinions split on the issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany says firms such as fiat will get off lightly eu commission president jose manuel barroso hailed the new measures , which still need the backing of eu states and the european parliament .
" this proposal demonstrates that the european union is committed to being a world leader in cutting co2 emissions and the development of a low carbon economy , " he said .
" at the same time , we are committed to promoting the competitiveness of our industry and its global technological leadership , " barroso added .
the environmental group greenpeace said the proposals did not go far enough , accusing the eu executive of backing down in the face of lobbying from the auto industry .
" the commission has let car makers drive away with a proposal that sets a weak , short-term standard , lacks any longer-term targets and offers an open road to heavy , gas-guzzling vehicles , " said greenpeace transport policy expert franziska achterberg . . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's economic performance climbed 2.9 percent - the strongest growth in six years .
this year , economic growth is at 2.5 percent . there is a close connection between the growth rates in 2006 and 2007 .
due to the drastic three-percent hike on added-value tax on jan .

the result will burden the economy for some time to come . then there are high oil prices and the expensive euro .
the scarcity of raw materials around the world , in part due to strong demand in china , is also driving prices up .
rising prices detract from consumers ' purchasing power and they 're holding on to their money - which , in turn , weakens demand . exports and foreign investment are up nevertheless , " the german economy continues to experience a solid upswing , " said the german federal bank in its most recent report on the state of the economy . there are good reasons for this .

what 's more , companies in germany not only have a suitable range of export products , but also offer excellent service . during the last few years of economic decline at home , companies expanded immensely on the world market , which is now paying off .
as a result , not only have exports hit a record high but domestic investment is booming as well , as many companies adjust their production capacity to meet increased demand . otherwise strong economy hurt by external factors however , the economic slump in the us , the problems with the banks , the high oil prices and the expensive euro have dragged down the economy 's upward slope .
respectively , the federal bank has predicted 1.9 percent growth in 2008 , while some economic research institutions foresee only 1.5 to 1.6 percent . hence , the upturn will continue , just with considerably less gusto . no one can reliably predict whether the economy will rebound again in 2009 or whether the current economic cycle is already drawing to a close .
on the one hand , the german economy is resting on a much stronger foundation than in earlier years , but on the other hand , the rising inflation rate is increasingly becoming a reason for concern . in november , price inflation was 3.1 percent higher than what it had been a year earlier , which is significantly greater than the two-percent window tolerated by the european central bank . the currency guardians should respond with an interest rate increase , but that 's not possible due to the bank crisis .

but solving chronic high unemployment and xenophobic tendencies may take a while . deutsche welle : minister tiefensee , you not only serve as transport minister but also oversee the development of eastern germany .
what are your duties in this position ? wolfgang tiefensee : the new german states are still a part of our country that requires special attention and devotion .
that 's why the government has set up a post to coordinate these tasks .
the commissioner works together with ministers from all departments - labor market policy , economic policy , education , research and many other areas are all important for eastern germany .
the commissioner coordinates , gives ideas and advocates the interests of the new states . germany 's reunification happened in 1990 .
how much longer will it be necessary to have a commissioner of this kind ? i think it makes sense to coordinate these tasks .
they are connected , and i think the job will exist for a while .

it 's more about taking a similar approach in the east and west to the challenges that confront germany and europe .
the pre-existing conditions vary .
i think that the eastern states have a natural advantage - especially in new industrial sectors like renewable energy , it and biotechnology , for example . investing late in new sectors means a more modern approach to investing , and that 's already become apparent .
as far as renewable energy goes , every second job in germany is in eastern germany . nevertheless , unemployment in the new states is still twice as high as in western germany .
when do you think this will even out ? that 's the most difficult question .
in the eastern states , unemployment is way above 13 percent , while it 's at 6 percent in the western states .
in addition , those without jobs in eastern germany are unemployed for long periods of time - for 12 or even 24 months - and get stuck in this chronic unemployment with no chance of breaking back into the job market . how long will this continue ?
we have to think long-term , because chronic unemployment can only be reduced very slowly .
the eastern regions of the new states are experiencing an economic upswing .
but this has n't yet had enough of an effect on the job market .
i think it will take at least another 10 years to reduce unemployment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremism has a larger following in eastern germany people from minority or foreign backgrounds tend to shy away from the eastern states .
some decide not to work or study there because they 're afraid of being assaulted by neo-nazis .
can you understand these concerns ? yes , unfortunately it is the case that the number of xenophobic crimes is higher in the east than in the west .
on the other hand , the big cities and many of the medium-sized cities are great places for foreigners to study or work as engineers or skilled laborers . many people actually prefer the eastern german states because they can also be particularly hospitable .
this is left over from communist east germany , when people had a totally different way of interacting with each other . there are many initiatives in place that are committed to breaking down xenophobia .
often , because there are too few foreigners , people often do n't know what they 're talking about and arrive at negative judgments .
if the number of foreign residents were to increase gradually , then i 'm sure that reservations about them would gradually decrease . you mentioned traditional hospitality in the east .
does eastern germany have a different value system than western germany ? i do n't think so , but of course 40 years of the gdr did n't go by without having an effect on the population and on individuals .
for 40 years , we could n't travel where we wanted to .
studying abroad was out of the question .
we could n't freely organize clubs or political parties like people in the western states and in western europe could .
all of that has left its mark . on the other hand , we ca n't forget that these were the people - just like in poland or czechoslovakia - who prepared the peaceful revolution and the globalchange that came with it .

but solving chronic high unemployment and xenophobic tendencies may take a while . deutsche welle : minister tiefensee , you not only serve as transport minister but also oversee the development of eastern germany .
what are your duties in this position ? wolfgang tiefensee : the new german states are still a part of our country that requires special attention and devotion .
that 's why the government has set up a post to coordinate these tasks .
the commissioner works together with ministers from all departments - labor market policy , economic policy , education , research and many other areas are all important for eastern germany .
the commissioner coordinates , gives ideas and advocates the interests of the new states . germany 's reunification happened in 1990 .
how much longer will it be necessary to have a commissioner of this kind ? i think it makes sense to coordinate these tasks .
they are connected , and i think the job will exist for a while .
financial support for the eastern states continues until 2019 - perhaps that 's the point by which things will have to have normalized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany is becoming a leader in renewable energies , said tiefensee will the standards of living in the east and west be similar by then ? actually , in the eastern states , we do n't want to imitate the western ones or become like other western european cities .
it 's more about taking a similar approach in the east and west to the challenges that confront germany and europe .
the pre-existing conditions vary .
i think that the eastern states have a natural advantage - especially in new industrial sectors like renewable energy , it and biotechnology , for example . investing late in new sectors means a more modern approach to investing , and that 's already become apparent .
as far as renewable energy goes , every second job in germany is in eastern germany . nevertheless , unemployment in the new states is still twice as high as in western germany .
when do you think this will even out ? that 's the most difficult question .
in the eastern states , unemployment is way above 13 percent , while it 's at 6 percent in the western states .
in addition , those without jobs in eastern germany are unemployed for long periods of time - for 12 or even 24 months - and get stuck in this chronic unemployment with no chance of breaking back into the job market . how long will this continue ?
we have to think long-term , because chronic unemployment can only be reduced very slowly .
the eastern regions of the new states are experiencing an economic upswing .
but this has n't yet had enough of an effect on the job market .
i think it will take at least another 10 years to reduce unemployment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremism has a larger following in eastern germany people from minority or foreign backgrounds tend to shy away from the eastern states .
some decide not to work or study there because they 're afraid of being assaulted by neo-nazis .
can you understand these concerns ? yes , unfortunately it is the case that the number of xenophobic crimes is higher in the east than in the west .
on the other hand , the big cities and many of the medium-sized cities are great places for foreigners to study or work as engineers or skilled laborers . many people actually prefer the eastern german states because they can also be particularly hospitable .
this is left over from communist east germany , when people had a totally different way of interacting with each other . there are many initiatives in place that are committed to breaking down xenophobia .
often , because there are too few foreigners , people often do n't know what they 're talking about and arrive at negative judgments .
if the number of foreign residents were to increase gradually , then i 'm sure that reservations about them would gradually decrease . you mentioned traditional hospitality in the east .
does eastern germany have a different value system than western germany ? i do n't think so , but of course 40 years of the gdr did n't go by without having an effect on the population and on individuals .
for 40 years , we could n't travel where we wanted to .
studying abroad was out of the question .
we could n't freely organize clubs or political parties like people in the western states and in western europe could .
all of that has left its mark . on the other hand , we ca n't forget that these were the people - just like in poland or czechoslovakia - who prepared the peaceful revolution and the globalchange that came with it .
the forces involved developed under a dictatorship , and the will to create something is still evident today .
people are very happy about finally being able to take responsibility . i do n't think that 's a different value system , particularly since the younger generation is assimilating anyway . interview : miodrag soric -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but putting on a band-aid now wo n't help later , says dw 's karl zawadzky . 2006 was the best year so far in the business cycle .
germany 's economic performance climbed 2.9 percent - the strongest growth in six years .
this year , economic growth is at 2.5 percent . there is a close connection between the growth rates in 2006 and 2007 .
due to the drastic three-percent hike on added-value tax on jan .
1 , many consumers pushed up the purchase of more expensive items - from cars to home decoration items to computers , so it 's no surprise that the 2006 boom could n't continue into 2007 . the tax increase is no longer an issue , but there are plenty of other factors disrupting the economy . us real estate crisis leaves lasting mark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the us , the upswing that followed the real estate and mortgage crisis is now losing steam .
but , it 's even worse : many already see the specter of a recession in the us .
that dampens the mood world-wide since the us is by far the largest economy and a key player in the global financial system . the mortgage crisis hurt business for banks around the world .
everyone wanted to make a profit with the bad mortgages and they all lost - not just the american banks , but also large swiss banks and german savings banks . once again , greed conquered reason .
the result will burden the economy for some time to come . then there are high oil prices and the expensive euro .
the scarcity of raw materials around the world , in part due to strong demand in china , is also driving prices up .
rising prices detract from consumers ' purchasing power and they 're holding on to their money - which , in turn , weakens demand . exports and foreign investment are up nevertheless , " the german economy continues to experience a solid upswing , " said the german federal bank in its most recent report on the state of the economy . there are good reasons for this .
all over the world - especially in the resource-rich emerging nations with high export receipts and , in some cases , huge foreign currency reserves - investments are being made in infrastructure and industry , and the new wealth is being vigorously consumed . germany delivers more high-quality goods than any other country , whether they are machines , manufacturing plants , luxury cars or top-end food products .
what 's more , companies in germany not only have a suitable range of export products , but also offer excellent service . during the last few years of economic decline at home , companies expanded immensely on the world market , which is now paying off .
as a result , not only have exports hit a record high but domestic investment is booming as well , as many companies adjust their production capacity to meet increased demand . otherwise strong economy hurt by external factors however , the economic slump in the us , the problems with the banks , the high oil prices and the expensive euro have dragged down the economy 's upward slope .
respectively , the federal bank has predicted 1.9 percent growth in 2008 , while some economic research institutions foresee only 1.5 to 1.6 percent . hence , the upturn will continue , just with considerably less gusto . no one can reliably predict whether the economy will rebound again in 2009 or whether the current economic cycle is already drawing to a close .
on the one hand , the german economy is resting on a much stronger foundation than in earlier years , but on the other hand , the rising inflation rate is increasingly becoming a reason for concern . in november , price inflation was 3.1 percent higher than what it had been a year earlier , which is significantly greater than the two-percent window tolerated by the european central bank . the currency guardians should respond with an interest rate increase , but that 's not possible due to the bank crisis .
instead , central banks around the world are pumping billions and billions into circulation , which only intensifies inflationary tendencies . what may seem necessary today can strangle the economic upswing in the mid-term . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and that , he told dw-world , is all he wants from his german club . dw-world.de : oliver kahn got himself suspended from the last league game of 2007 and has feuded with much of the squad .
could you see yourself taking over from him as bayern 's regular captain ?
lucio : i would n't dream of becoming bayern munich 's captain .
it 's not my life 's goal , and i would n't fight for the position .
as far as i 'm concerned there 'll be no squabbling with my teammates over it .
the coach decides who 's captain .
i wo n't lie and say it would n't be flattering to be singled out for this responsibility , but i 'm not concerned with having a special status - that means nothing to me .
i 'll keep on the way i always have .
i 'm not looking to inherit the captaincy .
but you have served as bayern 's captain for the odd game .

in the period when i was captain , the atmosphere was great , really relaxed .
the team assistants and physiotherapists were in a good mood , always making jokes with me .
is the position first and foremost a matter of discipline ?
discipline is important , but a captain needs other qualities as well .
he has to lead by example .
he has to be someone who works hard , who shows respect for the coach and his teammates and who always gives his best for the club .
at bayern i 've always stood for these qualities .
that 's why i was allowed to be captain on occasion .
but as the captain of the brazilian national team , you surely must feel you 're entitled to the same position at bayern munich .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio 's season was going wll until he was suspended for four games for elbowing an opponent i did n't try to become captain of brazil .
it just happened , and i 'm very honored to have been given such an enormous responsibility .
thus far it 's gone well .
my teammates like me , and we get along well with one another .
you would n't have too many problems dealing with players like miroslav klose , luca toni or franck ribery , if you can lead a squad with stars like ronaldinho , kaka or robinho .
i 've known stars like kaka or ronaldinho both professionally and personally for quite some time .
they always listened to me and followed my advice , even when i was n't captain .
and when they tell me something , i listen to them too .
that 's why i have no problems fulfilling my responsibilities in the national team .
so ca n't you convince a kaka or ronaldinho to come to bayern ?
i do n't think they 'll be coming any time soon .
why not ?
it 's next to impossible to convince brazilian stars who can play in italy or spain to come to germany .
it 's not a question of the club , but the country .
the culture , lifestyle and language in italy and spain are fairly brazilian .
bayern ca n't compete .
you do n't try to sell bayern munich to your teammates in the brazilian national squad , as luca toni supposedly does with italy ?

there are a few who would believe me - but they 're the ones who already play in the bundesliga .

and that , he told dw-world , is all he wants from his german club . dw-world.de : oliver kahn got himself suspended from the last league game of 2007 and has feuded with much of the squad .
could you see yourself taking over from him as bayern 's regular captain ?
lucio : i would n't dream of becoming bayern munich 's captain .
it 's not my life 's goal , and i would n't fight for the position .
as far as i 'm concerned there 'll be no squabbling with my teammates over it .
the coach decides who 's captain .
i wo n't lie and say it would n't be flattering to be singled out for this responsibility , but i 'm not concerned with having a special status - that means nothing to me .
i 'll keep on the way i always have .
i 'm not looking to inherit the captaincy .
but you have served as bayern 's captain for the odd game .
did you not like it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strikers beware - lucio is one of the league most hard-nosed defenders of course it was a great experience .
but it did n't change me or the way i work with the team .
the best part was the feeling that the coach trusts me , that he and the team have faith in me .
in the period when i was captain , the atmosphere was great , really relaxed .
the team assistants and physiotherapists were in a good mood , always making jokes with me .
is the position first and foremost a matter of discipline ?
discipline is important , but a captain needs other qualities as well .
he has to lead by example .
he has to be someone who works hard , who shows respect for the coach and his teammates and who always gives his best for the club .
at bayern i 've always stood for these qualities .
that 's why i was allowed to be captain on occasion .
but as the captain of the brazilian national team , you surely must feel you 're entitled to the same position at bayern munich .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio 's season was going wll until he was suspended for four games for elbowing an opponent i did n't try to become captain of brazil .
it just happened , and i 'm very honored to have been given such an enormous responsibility .
thus far it 's gone well .
my teammates like me , and we get along well with one another .
you would n't have too many problems dealing with players like miroslav klose , luca toni or franck ribery , if you can lead a squad with stars like ronaldinho , kaka or robinho .
i 've known stars like kaka or ronaldinho both professionally and personally for quite some time .
they always listened to me and followed my advice , even when i was n't captain .
and when they tell me something , i listen to them too .
that 's why i have no problems fulfilling my responsibilities in the national team .
so ca n't you convince a kaka or ronaldinho to come to bayern ?
i do n't think they 'll be coming any time soon .
why not ?
it 's next to impossible to convince brazilian stars who can play in italy or spain to come to germany .
it 's not a question of the club , but the country .
the culture , lifestyle and language in italy and spain are fairly brazilian .
bayern ca n't compete .
you do n't try to sell bayern munich to your teammates in the brazilian national squad , as luca toni supposedly does with italy ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio won the world cup with brazil in 2002 as i said , for the reasons i 've just mentioned , bayern munich is a product that 's hard to market .
it 's difficult for me to sell the club to superstars like kaka , ronaldinho or robinho .
there are a few who would believe me - but they 're the ones who already play in the bundesliga .
for example , diego , naldo , gilberto , mineiro and josue .
but not ronaldinho or kaka ?
when we exchange impressions , i have to admit it would be easier for them to convince me to leave germany than for me to convince them to come here .
but they have n't succeeded .
you 're still here .
yes , and i intend to see out my current contract , which runs until 2010 .
i still dream of spain or italy .
i 'd love to play there , and perhaps i can fulfill this dream a bit earlier , if the club and i can reach an agreement .
i transferred from leverkusen to munich two years before my contract back then was set to expire .

the weak dollar is just one factor that has made german firms more attractive . foreign ownership in the biggest companies on the german stock exchange -lrb- dax -rrb- reached a record 52.6 percent this year , up 20 percent from 2005 , the business daily handelsblatt reported . " the trend shows how attractive german companies and stocks are abroad , " franz-josef leven from the stock market association deutsches aktieninstitut , which confirmed the report , told the paper . the joint-stock company deutsche börse ranked in with the highest foreign investment at 84 percent , followed by adidas -lrb- 79 percent -rrb- and bayer -lrb- 78 percent -rrb- . formerly state-owned firms like deutsche post and lufthansa reported somewhat lower foreign holdings , at 39.6 and 37.4 percent , respectively .
us-based blackstone owns 4.4 percent of deutsche telekom , while dubai international finance purchased 2.2 percent of deutsche bank earlier this year .
investment firms barclays , sun life and capital research each hold five percent of merck pharmaceutical company . german exports spark foreign interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : profitable exports are making german companies attractive to investors in addition to soaring revenue and high growth rates , german firms have become more attractive to foreign shareholders by upping their activity abroad .
germany 's four largest stock exchanges , the dax , mdax , sdax , and tecdax , earned 59.5 percent of their total revenues abroad this year , a 5 percent increase over last year . the subprime lending crisis and sagging euro-dollar exchange rate have also sparked interest in german and european stocks , while drawing investors ' attention away from the us stock market . the trend of foreign investment in german firms " is irreversible and even continues when the economic situation weakens in individual countries like the us , " said oliver-wyman consultant thomas kautzsch . leven , however , said that he predicted the move to german and european stocks would likely loose speed . expert : foreign investment is normal deutsche aktieninstitut president rüdiger von rosen cautioned against seeing the development as a foreign take-over of german firms . " there are a lot of pension funds and banks among the investors , " he said in an interview with ard .
" it may also be that german citizens living abroad -lrb- in switzerland , for example -rrb- have purchased massive amounts of germans stocks . " dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and that , he told dw-world , is all he wants from his german club . dw-world.de : oliver kahn got himself suspended from the last league game of 2007 and has feuded with much of the squad .
could you see yourself taking over from him as bayern 's regular captain ?
lucio : i would n't dream of becoming bayern munich 's captain .
it 's not my life 's goal , and i would n't fight for the position .
as far as i 'm concerned there 'll be no squabbling with my teammates over it .
the coach decides who 's captain .
i wo n't lie and say it would n't be flattering to be singled out for this responsibility , but i 'm not concerned with having a special status - that means nothing to me .
i 'll keep on the way i always have .
i 'm not looking to inherit the captaincy .
but you have served as bayern 's captain for the odd game .
did you not like it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strikers beware - lucio is one of the league most hard-nosed defenders of course it was a great experience .
but it did n't change me or the way i work with the team .
the best part was the feeling that the coach trusts me , that he and the team have faith in me .
in the period when i was captain , the atmosphere was great , really relaxed .
the team assistants and physiotherapists were in a good mood , always making jokes with me .
is the position first and foremost a matter of discipline ?
discipline is important , but a captain needs other qualities as well .
he has to lead by example .
he has to be someone who works hard , who shows respect for the coach and his teammates and who always gives his best for the club .
at bayern i 've always stood for these qualities .
that 's why i was allowed to be captain on occasion .
but as the captain of the brazilian national team , you surely must feel you 're entitled to the same position at bayern munich .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio 's season was going wll until he was suspended for four games for elbowing an opponent i did n't try to become captain of brazil .
it just happened , and i 'm very honored to have been given such an enormous responsibility .
thus far it 's gone well .
my teammates like me , and we get along well with one another .
you would n't have too many problems dealing with players like miroslav klose , luca toni or franck ribery , if you can lead a squad with stars like ronaldinho , kaka or robinho .
i 've known stars like kaka or ronaldinho both professionally and personally for quite some time .
they always listened to me and followed my advice , even when i was n't captain .
and when they tell me something , i listen to them too .
that 's why i have no problems fulfilling my responsibilities in the national team .
so ca n't you convince a kaka or ronaldinho to come to bayern ?
i do n't think they 'll be coming any time soon .
why not ?
it 's next to impossible to convince brazilian stars who can play in italy or spain to come to germany .
it 's not a question of the club , but the country .
the culture , lifestyle and language in italy and spain are fairly brazilian .

you do n't try to sell bayern munich to your teammates in the brazilian national squad , as luca toni supposedly does with italy ?

there are a few who would believe me - but they 're the ones who already play in the bundesliga .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern germany -pipe- 19.12.2007 east germany forges path independent of west , says minister großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tiefensee grew up in communist east germany germany 's eastern states are n't out to mimic the west , german minister wolfgang tiefensee told deutsche welle .
but solving chronic high unemployment and xenophobic tendencies may take a while . deutsche welle : minister tiefensee , you not only serve as transport minister but also oversee the development of eastern germany .
what are your duties in this position ? wolfgang tiefensee : the new german states are still a part of our country that requires special attention and devotion .
that 's why the government has set up a post to coordinate these tasks .
the commissioner works together with ministers from all departments - labor market policy , economic policy , education , research and many other areas are all important for eastern germany .
the commissioner coordinates , gives ideas and advocates the interests of the new states . germany 's reunification happened in 1990 .
how much longer will it be necessary to have a commissioner of this kind ? i think it makes sense to coordinate these tasks .
they are connected , and i think the job will exist for a while .
financial support for the eastern states continues until 2019 - perhaps that 's the point by which things will have to have normalized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany is becoming a leader in renewable energies , said tiefensee will the standards of living in the east and west be similar by then ? actually , in the eastern states , we do n't want to imitate the western ones or become like other western european cities .
it 's more about taking a similar approach in the east and west to the challenges that confront germany and europe .
the pre-existing conditions vary .
i think that the eastern states have a natural advantage - especially in new industrial sectors like renewable energy , it and biotechnology , for example . investing late in new sectors means a more modern approach to investing , and that 's already become apparent .
as far as renewable energy goes , every second job in germany is in eastern germany . nevertheless , unemployment in the new states is still twice as high as in western germany .
when do you think this will even out ? that 's the most difficult question .
in the eastern states , unemployment is way above 13 percent , while it 's at 6 percent in the western states .
in addition , those without jobs in eastern germany are unemployed for long periods of time - for 12 or even 24 months - and get stuck in this chronic unemployment with no chance of breaking back into the job market . how long will this continue ?
we have to think long-term , because chronic unemployment can only be reduced very slowly .
the eastern regions of the new states are experiencing an economic upswing .
but this has n't yet had enough of an effect on the job market .
i think it will take at least another 10 years to reduce unemployment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremism has a larger following in eastern germany people from minority or foreign backgrounds tend to shy away from the eastern states .
some decide not to work or study there because they 're afraid of being assaulted by neo-nazis .
can you understand these concerns ? yes , unfortunately it is the case that the number of xenophobic crimes is higher in the east than in the west .
on the other hand , the big cities and many of the medium-sized cities are great places for foreigners to study or work as engineers or skilled laborers . many people actually prefer the eastern german states because they can also be particularly hospitable .
this is left over from communist east germany , when people had a totally different way of interacting with each other . there are many initiatives in place that are committed to breaking down xenophobia .
often , because there are too few foreigners , people often do n't know what they 're talking about and arrive at negative judgments .
if the number of foreign residents were to increase gradually , then i 'm sure that reservations about them would gradually decrease . you mentioned traditional hospitality in the east .
does eastern germany have a different value system than western germany ? i do n't think so , but of course 40 years of the gdr did n't go by without having an effect on the population and on individuals .
for 40 years , we could n't travel where we wanted to .
studying abroad was out of the question .
we could n't freely organize clubs or political parties like people in the western states and in western europe could .
all of that has left its mark . on the other hand , we ca n't forget that these were the people - just like in poland or czechoslovakia - who prepared the peaceful revolution and the globalchange that came with it .
the forces involved developed under a dictatorship , and the will to create something is still evident today .
people are very happy about finally being able to take responsibility . i do n't think that 's a different value system , particularly since the younger generation is assimilating anyway . interview : miodrag soric -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but solving chronic high unemployment and xenophobic tendencies may take a while . deutsche welle : minister tiefensee , you not only serve as transport minister but also oversee the development of eastern germany .
what are your duties in this position ? wolfgang tiefensee : the new german states are still a part of our country that requires special attention and devotion .
that 's why the government has set up a post to coordinate these tasks .
the commissioner works together with ministers from all departments - labor market policy , economic policy , education , research and many other areas are all important for eastern germany .
the commissioner coordinates , gives ideas and advocates the interests of the new states . germany 's reunification happened in 1990 .
how much longer will it be necessary to have a commissioner of this kind ? i think it makes sense to coordinate these tasks .
they are connected , and i think the job will exist for a while .
financial support for the eastern states continues until 2019 - perhaps that 's the point by which things will have to have normalized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany is becoming a leader in renewable energies , said tiefensee will the standards of living in the east and west be similar by then ? actually , in the eastern states , we do n't want to imitate the western ones or become like other western european cities .
it 's more about taking a similar approach in the east and west to the challenges that confront germany and europe .
the pre-existing conditions vary .
i think that the eastern states have a natural advantage - especially in new industrial sectors like renewable energy , it and biotechnology , for example . investing late in new sectors means a more modern approach to investing , and that 's already become apparent .
as far as renewable energy goes , every second job in germany is in eastern germany . nevertheless , unemployment in the new states is still twice as high as in western germany .
when do you think this will even out ? that 's the most difficult question .
in the eastern states , unemployment is way above 13 percent , while it 's at 6 percent in the western states .
in addition , those without jobs in eastern germany are unemployed for long periods of time - for 12 or even 24 months - and get stuck in this chronic unemployment with no chance of breaking back into the job market . how long will this continue ?
we have to think long-term , because chronic unemployment can only be reduced very slowly .
the eastern regions of the new states are experiencing an economic upswing .
but this has n't yet had enough of an effect on the job market .
i think it will take at least another 10 years to reduce unemployment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremism has a larger following in eastern germany people from minority or foreign backgrounds tend to shy away from the eastern states .
some decide not to work or study there because they 're afraid of being assaulted by neo-nazis .
can you understand these concerns ? yes , unfortunately it is the case that the number of xenophobic crimes is higher in the east than in the west .
on the other hand , the big cities and many of the medium-sized cities are great places for foreigners to study or work as engineers or skilled laborers . many people actually prefer the eastern german states because they can also be particularly hospitable .
this is left over from communist east germany , when people had a totally different way of interacting with each other . there are many initiatives in place that are committed to breaking down xenophobia .
often , because there are too few foreigners , people often do n't know what they 're talking about and arrive at negative judgments .
if the number of foreign residents were to increase gradually , then i 'm sure that reservations about them would gradually decrease . you mentioned traditional hospitality in the east .
does eastern germany have a different value system than western germany ? i do n't think so , but of course 40 years of the gdr did n't go by without having an effect on the population and on individuals .
for 40 years , we could n't travel where we wanted to .
studying abroad was out of the question .
we could n't freely organize clubs or political parties like people in the western states and in western europe could .
all of that has left its mark . on the other hand , we ca n't forget that these were the people - just like in poland or czechoslovakia - who prepared the peaceful revolution and the globalchange that came with it .
the forces involved developed under a dictatorship , and the will to create something is still evident today .
people are very happy about finally being able to take responsibility . i do n't think that 's a different value system , particularly since the younger generation is assimilating anyway . interview : miodrag soric -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ankara seized the opportunity to attack some states ' attempts to block its entry . this means that six chapters have been opened until now .
to conclude the accession process , talks have to be completed in thirty-five different fields . speaking after a different meeting in brussels , the eu commissioner in charge of enlargement , finland 's olli rehn , said that all member states had reaffirmed their wish to see accession talks continue , adding that the opening of the two chapters on wednesday should be taken as proof that " the eu sticks to its commitments and keeps its word . " ankara began eu entry talks in 2005 , but they have moved forward very slowly because of rows over cyprus and human rights .
eight negotiating chapters have been blocked since the end of last year because of turkey 's refusal to open its ports and airports to traffic from eu member cyprus .
turkey 's negotiations are expected to last at least a decade , with no guarantee of membership at the end of it all .

babacan did not name any names , but french prime minister nicolas sarkozy has been leading the lobby to keep turkey out of the european union . he favors a special partnership with the mainly muslim country instead of full membership .
babacan also stressed that all eu heads of state had agreed in december 2004 to the start of accession talks with turkey .

ankara seized the opportunity to attack some states ' attempts to block its entry . this means that six chapters have been opened until now .
to conclude the accession process , talks have to be completed in thirty-five different fields . speaking after a different meeting in brussels , the eu commissioner in charge of enlargement , finland 's olli rehn , said that all member states had reaffirmed their wish to see accession talks continue , adding that the opening of the two chapters on wednesday should be taken as proof that " the eu sticks to its commitments and keeps its word . " ankara began eu entry talks in 2005 , but they have moved forward very slowly because of rows over cyprus and human rights .
eight negotiating chapters have been blocked since the end of last year because of turkey 's refusal to open its ports and airports to traffic from eu member cyprus .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 19.12.2007 opinion : hasty solutions now could kill the economy later großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with strong exports and foreign investment , the german economy would be soaring if it were n't for the subprime crisis and high oil prices .
but putting on a band-aid now wo n't help later , says dw 's karl zawadzky . 2006 was the best year so far in the business cycle .
germany 's economic performance climbed 2.9 percent - the strongest growth in six years .
this year , economic growth is at 2.5 percent . there is a close connection between the growth rates in 2006 and 2007 .
due to the drastic three-percent hike on added-value tax on jan .
1 , many consumers pushed up the purchase of more expensive items - from cars to home decoration items to computers , so it 's no surprise that the 2006 boom could n't continue into 2007 . the tax increase is no longer an issue , but there are plenty of other factors disrupting the economy . us real estate crisis leaves lasting mark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the us , the upswing that followed the real estate and mortgage crisis is now losing steam .
but , it 's even worse : many already see the specter of a recession in the us .
that dampens the mood world-wide since the us is by far the largest economy and a key player in the global financial system . the mortgage crisis hurt business for banks around the world .
everyone wanted to make a profit with the bad mortgages and they all lost - not just the american banks , but also large swiss banks and german savings banks . once again , greed conquered reason .
the result will burden the economy for some time to come . then there are high oil prices and the expensive euro .
the scarcity of raw materials around the world , in part due to strong demand in china , is also driving prices up .
rising prices detract from consumers ' purchasing power and they 're holding on to their money - which , in turn , weakens demand . exports and foreign investment are up nevertheless , " the german economy continues to experience a solid upswing , " said the german federal bank in its most recent report on the state of the economy . there are good reasons for this .
all over the world - especially in the resource-rich emerging nations with high export receipts and , in some cases , huge foreign currency reserves - investments are being made in infrastructure and industry , and the new wealth is being vigorously consumed . germany delivers more high-quality goods than any other country , whether they are machines , manufacturing plants , luxury cars or top-end food products .
what 's more , companies in germany not only have a suitable range of export products , but also offer excellent service . during the last few years of economic decline at home , companies expanded immensely on the world market , which is now paying off .
as a result , not only have exports hit a record high but domestic investment is booming as well , as many companies adjust their production capacity to meet increased demand . otherwise strong economy hurt by external factors however , the economic slump in the us , the problems with the banks , the high oil prices and the expensive euro have dragged down the economy 's upward slope .
respectively , the federal bank has predicted 1.9 percent growth in 2008 , while some economic research institutions foresee only 1.5 to 1.6 percent . hence , the upturn will continue , just with considerably less gusto . no one can reliably predict whether the economy will rebound again in 2009 or whether the current economic cycle is already drawing to a close .
on the one hand , the german economy is resting on a much stronger foundation than in earlier years , but on the other hand , the rising inflation rate is increasingly becoming a reason for concern . in november , price inflation was 3.1 percent higher than what it had been a year earlier , which is significantly greater than the two-percent window tolerated by the european central bank . the currency guardians should respond with an interest rate increase , but that 's not possible due to the bank crisis .
instead , central banks around the world are pumping billions and billions into circulation , which only intensifies inflationary tendencies . what may seem necessary today can strangle the economic upswing in the mid-term . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de foreign ownership in german firms hits all-time high for the first time , foreign investors own a majority share of germany 's 30 largest publicly traded companies .
the weak dollar is just one factor that has made german firms more attractive .
-lrb- 19.12.2007 -rrb- germans are saving more , despite the economic upswing germans are putting aside more money this year , according to a recent report .

but putting on a band-aid now wo n't help later , says dw 's karl zawadzky . 2006 was the best year so far in the business cycle .
germany 's economic performance climbed 2.9 percent - the strongest growth in six years .
this year , economic growth is at 2.5 percent . there is a close connection between the growth rates in 2006 and 2007 .
due to the drastic three-percent hike on added-value tax on jan .
1 , many consumers pushed up the purchase of more expensive items - from cars to home decoration items to computers , so it 's no surprise that the 2006 boom could n't continue into 2007 . the tax increase is no longer an issue , but there are plenty of other factors disrupting the economy . us real estate crisis leaves lasting mark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the us , the upswing that followed the real estate and mortgage crisis is now losing steam .
but , it 's even worse : many already see the specter of a recession in the us .
that dampens the mood world-wide since the us is by far the largest economy and a key player in the global financial system . the mortgage crisis hurt business for banks around the world .
everyone wanted to make a profit with the bad mortgages and they all lost - not just the american banks , but also large swiss banks and german savings banks . once again , greed conquered reason .
the result will burden the economy for some time to come . then there are high oil prices and the expensive euro .
the scarcity of raw materials around the world , in part due to strong demand in china , is also driving prices up .
rising prices detract from consumers ' purchasing power and they 're holding on to their money - which , in turn , weakens demand . exports and foreign investment are up nevertheless , " the german economy continues to experience a solid upswing , " said the german federal bank in its most recent report on the state of the economy . there are good reasons for this .
all over the world - especially in the resource-rich emerging nations with high export receipts and , in some cases , huge foreign currency reserves - investments are being made in infrastructure and industry , and the new wealth is being vigorously consumed . germany delivers more high-quality goods than any other country , whether they are machines , manufacturing plants , luxury cars or top-end food products .
what 's more , companies in germany not only have a suitable range of export products , but also offer excellent service . during the last few years of economic decline at home , companies expanded immensely on the world market , which is now paying off .
as a result , not only have exports hit a record high but domestic investment is booming as well , as many companies adjust their production capacity to meet increased demand . otherwise strong economy hurt by external factors however , the economic slump in the us , the problems with the banks , the high oil prices and the expensive euro have dragged down the economy 's upward slope .
respectively , the federal bank has predicted 1.9 percent growth in 2008 , while some economic research institutions foresee only 1.5 to 1.6 percent . hence , the upturn will continue , just with considerably less gusto . no one can reliably predict whether the economy will rebound again in 2009 or whether the current economic cycle is already drawing to a close .
on the one hand , the german economy is resting on a much stronger foundation than in earlier years , but on the other hand , the rising inflation rate is increasingly becoming a reason for concern . in november , price inflation was 3.1 percent higher than what it had been a year earlier , which is significantly greater than the two-percent window tolerated by the european central bank . the currency guardians should respond with an interest rate increase , but that 's not possible due to the bank crisis .
instead , central banks around the world are pumping billions and billions into circulation , which only intensifies inflationary tendencies . what may seem necessary today can strangle the economic upswing in the mid-term . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but putting on a band-aid now wo n't help later , says dw 's karl zawadzky . 2006 was the best year so far in the business cycle .
germany 's economic performance climbed 2.9 percent - the strongest growth in six years .
this year , economic growth is at 2.5 percent . there is a close connection between the growth rates in 2006 and 2007 .
due to the drastic three-percent hike on added-value tax on jan .
1 , many consumers pushed up the purchase of more expensive items - from cars to home decoration items to computers , so it 's no surprise that the 2006 boom could n't continue into 2007 . the tax increase is no longer an issue , but there are plenty of other factors disrupting the economy . us real estate crisis leaves lasting mark bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the us , the upswing that followed the real estate and mortgage crisis is now losing steam .
but , it 's even worse : many already see the specter of a recession in the us .
that dampens the mood world-wide since the us is by far the largest economy and a key player in the global financial system . the mortgage crisis hurt business for banks around the world .
everyone wanted to make a profit with the bad mortgages and they all lost - not just the american banks , but also large swiss banks and german savings banks . once again , greed conquered reason .
the result will burden the economy for some time to come . then there are high oil prices and the expensive euro .
the scarcity of raw materials around the world , in part due to strong demand in china , is also driving prices up .
rising prices detract from consumers ' purchasing power and they 're holding on to their money - which , in turn , weakens demand . exports and foreign investment are up nevertheless , " the german economy continues to experience a solid upswing , " said the german federal bank in its most recent report on the state of the economy . there are good reasons for this .
all over the world - especially in the resource-rich emerging nations with high export receipts and , in some cases , huge foreign currency reserves - investments are being made in infrastructure and industry , and the new wealth is being vigorously consumed . germany delivers more high-quality goods than any other country , whether they are machines , manufacturing plants , luxury cars or top-end food products .
what 's more , companies in germany not only have a suitable range of export products , but also offer excellent service . during the last few years of economic decline at home , companies expanded immensely on the world market , which is now paying off .
as a result , not only have exports hit a record high but domestic investment is booming as well , as many companies adjust their production capacity to meet increased demand . otherwise strong economy hurt by external factors however , the economic slump in the us , the problems with the banks , the high oil prices and the expensive euro have dragged down the economy 's upward slope .
respectively , the federal bank has predicted 1.9 percent growth in 2008 , while some economic research institutions foresee only 1.5 to 1.6 percent . hence , the upturn will continue , just with considerably less gusto . no one can reliably predict whether the economy will rebound again in 2009 or whether the current economic cycle is already drawing to a close .
on the one hand , the german economy is resting on a much stronger foundation than in earlier years , but on the other hand , the rising inflation rate is increasingly becoming a reason for concern . in november , price inflation was 3.1 percent higher than what it had been a year earlier , which is significantly greater than the two-percent window tolerated by the european central bank . the currency guardians should respond with an interest rate increase , but that 's not possible due to the bank crisis .
instead , central banks around the world are pumping billions and billions into circulation , which only intensifies inflationary tendencies . what may seem necessary today can strangle the economic upswing in the mid-term . karl zawadzky is dw-radio 's business editor . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de foreign ownership in german firms hits all-time high for the first time , foreign investors own a majority share of germany 's 30 largest publicly traded companies .
the weak dollar is just one factor that has made german firms more attractive .
-lrb- 19.12.2007 -rrb- germans are saving more , despite the economic upswing germans are putting aside more money this year , according to a recent report .
analyst michael grömling said it 's because they all bought last year to beat the sales tax increase - and because they 're getting older .

-lrb- 23.10.2007 -rrb- despite booming economy , germans not in celebratory mood business surveys and consumer confidence levels suggest that the german economic motor has roared back to life and is racing towards a bright future .
but that sunny outlook is n't reflected in the mood of the nation .

to rectify that , film director wolfgang becker has formed a band to play sgt. pepper 's lonely hearts club band from start to finish .
but do they pull it off ? four decades on from the release in 1967 of what is arguably the most famous album in pop music , " sgt. pepper 's lonely hearts club band " was set to be performed live at a large musical theater in central berlin on wednesday night .
the concert was the brainchild of german film director and beatles ' fanatic wolfgang becker , best known for his international hit " goodbye lenin . "
it 's the end result of an idea that grew beyond all proportions .
" originally , the plan was to just play acoustically in someone 's kitchen , " becker told dw-world .
" then we thought we 'd do it in a bar .
but it just kept growing and growing . "
and grown it has .
becker 's band now consists of dozens of musicians - some professionals , some gifted amateurs - including directorial colleague tom tykwer .
a forty-person choir sings background vocals , and indian musicians have been enlisted to play george harrison 's raga-inflected " within you , without you . "
with a little help from his friends bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang becker has taken beatlemania to new extremes the ensemble first performed the record at a private party in a berlin club this summer .
word of the gig spread , and a local radio station contacted becker about playing it in public as part of the station 's anniversary celebrations .
" i 'm not really nervous , " becker said ahead of the gig .
" but when people are paying money to get in , you do feel a different sense of responsibility . "
the musicians begin with the title track and continue on through the fab four 's psychedelic opus , concluding with what some consider lennon and mccartney 's finest composition , " a day in life . "
the band 's musical co-leader niko weidemann said playing the full record presents some unusual challenges .
" the individual songs are not all that difficult to play , but if you look at it as a total work , it can be tricky , " he said .
" we listened to the original album , and what we heard was how the beatles really pushed the limits with the restricted means at their disposal .
they never intended to perform the record live - it 's a studio production full of overdubs .
but when it is played live on stage by a big band with a brass section and a choir , it 's really fantastic . "
the one and only billy shears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as a four-piece band , there was no way the beatles could perform sgt. pepper 's live whether becker 's band is authentic is anyone 's guess .
but there 's something fittingly ironic about a group of latter-day fab four fanatics covering a concept record about a fictional band as played by the beatles .
and the performance suggests that had the liverpool quartet played " pepper 's " live , it might well have rocked - a good thing since becker has invested considerable time and money in the project .
" if you go to wolfgang 's home , it 's absolutely full of beatles ' records , posters and memoriabilia , " said adrian kennedy , a dw-tv producer and on-air personality who serves as the emcee .
" i do n't think he 's making any money from it .
it 's just for the love of the music . "
even more ironically , " sgt. pepper 's " is n't even becker 's favorite beatles album .
" no , that would be ' revolver ' , " becker said .
" but we completely forgot the fortieth anniversary of that record , and we were determined not to miss another opportunity again . "

" we listened to the original album , and what we heard was how the beatles really pushed the limits with the restricted means at their disposal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 19.12.2007 germany cries foul over eu plans to cut car emissions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin believes everyone should contribute to cutting emissions germany has attacked european commission proposals to cut car c02 emissions limits , saying they unfairly hit the country 's auto industry .
the measures are intended to curb global warming . under the plans , automobile manufacturers would have to reduce carbon emissions produced by their fleets of passenger cars to an average of 120 grams per kilometer by 2012 .
currently , new cars emit some 160 grams on average . should they not comply to the guidelines , automakers are to face steep fines . with several commissioners dissenting , the european commission - the eu 's executive arm - agreed on a four-year phase-in period from 2012 for the fines . " this will send a strong signal to the world about the determination of the european union to take bold measures on climate change , " eu environment commissioner stavros dimas said at a press conference . germany says the plan will not be effective the proposed legislation enraged germany and its carmakers .
german chancellor angela merkel said the eu was making policy " at the expense of germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler , bmw and porsche could face difficulties meeting the targets government spokesman thomas steg said the measures were biased against german companies , which tend to make bigger and more powerful vehicles .
" whatever motive led a majority of commissioners to decide this , we consider the solution to be wrong , we consider the solution to be very harmful and will do everything to force changes , " he said .
steg said that the plans would threaten jobs , hinder innovation and fail to be an effective instrument for climate protection .
environment minister sigmar gabriel also slammed the proposals , saying that they favored italian and french car makers .

the measures are intended to curb global warming . under the plans , automobile manufacturers would have to reduce carbon emissions produced by their fleets of passenger cars to an average of 120 grams per kilometer by 2012 .
currently , new cars emit some 160 grams on average . should they not comply to the guidelines , automakers are to face steep fines . with several commissioners dissenting , the european commission - the eu 's executive arm - agreed on a four-year phase-in period from 2012 for the fines . " this will send a strong signal to the world about the determination of the european union to take bold measures on climate change , " eu environment commissioner stavros dimas said at a press conference . germany says the plan will not be effective the proposed legislation enraged germany and its carmakers .
german chancellor angela merkel said the eu was making policy " at the expense of germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler , bmw and porsche could face difficulties meeting the targets government spokesman thomas steg said the measures were biased against german companies , which tend to make bigger and more powerful vehicles .
" whatever motive led a majority of commissioners to decide this , we consider the solution to be wrong , we consider the solution to be very harmful and will do everything to force changes , " he said .
steg said that the plans would threaten jobs , hinder innovation and fail to be an effective instrument for climate protection .
environment minister sigmar gabriel also slammed the proposals , saying that they favored italian and french car makers .
speaking on german television , he criticized the fact that the limits would apply to a car manufacturers ' fleet , meaning that a manufacturer such as fiat with its numerous small models would not have to cut the emissions of its high-end cars .
according to the european commission 's plans , penalties on companies will start at 20 euros -lrb- $ 29 -rrb- per excess gram of co2 and rise to 95 euros in 2016 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern germany -pipe- 19.12.2007 east germany forges path independent of west , says minister großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tiefensee grew up in communist east germany germany 's eastern states are n't out to mimic the west , german minister wolfgang tiefensee told deutsche welle .
but solving chronic high unemployment and xenophobic tendencies may take a while . deutsche welle : minister tiefensee , you not only serve as transport minister but also oversee the development of eastern germany .
what are your duties in this position ? wolfgang tiefensee : the new german states are still a part of our country that requires special attention and devotion .
that 's why the government has set up a post to coordinate these tasks .
the commissioner works together with ministers from all departments - labor market policy , economic policy , education , research and many other areas are all important for eastern germany .
the commissioner coordinates , gives ideas and advocates the interests of the new states . germany 's reunification happened in 1990 .
how much longer will it be necessary to have a commissioner of this kind ? i think it makes sense to coordinate these tasks .
they are connected , and i think the job will exist for a while .
financial support for the eastern states continues until 2019 - perhaps that 's the point by which things will have to have normalized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany is becoming a leader in renewable energies , said tiefensee will the standards of living in the east and west be similar by then ? actually , in the eastern states , we do n't want to imitate the western ones or become like other western european cities .
it 's more about taking a similar approach in the east and west to the challenges that confront germany and europe .
the pre-existing conditions vary .
i think that the eastern states have a natural advantage - especially in new industrial sectors like renewable energy , it and biotechnology , for example . investing late in new sectors means a more modern approach to investing , and that 's already become apparent .
as far as renewable energy goes , every second job in germany is in eastern germany . nevertheless , unemployment in the new states is still twice as high as in western germany .
when do you think this will even out ? that 's the most difficult question .
in the eastern states , unemployment is way above 13 percent , while it 's at 6 percent in the western states .
in addition , those without jobs in eastern germany are unemployed for long periods of time - for 12 or even 24 months - and get stuck in this chronic unemployment with no chance of breaking back into the job market . how long will this continue ?
we have to think long-term , because chronic unemployment can only be reduced very slowly .
the eastern regions of the new states are experiencing an economic upswing .
but this has n't yet had enough of an effect on the job market .
i think it will take at least another 10 years to reduce unemployment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremism has a larger following in eastern germany people from minority or foreign backgrounds tend to shy away from the eastern states .
some decide not to work or study there because they 're afraid of being assaulted by neo-nazis .
can you understand these concerns ? yes , unfortunately it is the case that the number of xenophobic crimes is higher in the east than in the west .
on the other hand , the big cities and many of the medium-sized cities are great places for foreigners to study or work as engineers or skilled laborers . many people actually prefer the eastern german states because they can also be particularly hospitable .
this is left over from communist east germany , when people had a totally different way of interacting with each other . there are many initiatives in place that are committed to breaking down xenophobia .
often , because there are too few foreigners , people often do n't know what they 're talking about and arrive at negative judgments .
if the number of foreign residents were to increase gradually , then i 'm sure that reservations about them would gradually decrease . you mentioned traditional hospitality in the east .
does eastern germany have a different value system than western germany ? i do n't think so , but of course 40 years of the gdr did n't go by without having an effect on the population and on individuals .
for 40 years , we could n't travel where we wanted to .
studying abroad was out of the question .
we could n't freely organize clubs or political parties like people in the western states and in western europe could .
all of that has left its mark . on the other hand , we ca n't forget that these were the people - just like in poland or czechoslovakia - who prepared the peaceful revolution and the globalchange that came with it .
the forces involved developed under a dictatorship , and the will to create something is still evident today .
people are very happy about finally being able to take responsibility . i do n't think that 's a different value system , particularly since the younger generation is assimilating anyway . interview : miodrag soric -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but solving chronic high unemployment and xenophobic tendencies may take a while . deutsche welle : minister tiefensee , you not only serve as transport minister but also oversee the development of eastern germany .
what are your duties in this position ? wolfgang tiefensee : the new german states are still a part of our country that requires special attention and devotion .
that 's why the government has set up a post to coordinate these tasks .
the commissioner works together with ministers from all departments - labor market policy , economic policy , education , research and many other areas are all important for eastern germany .
the commissioner coordinates , gives ideas and advocates the interests of the new states . germany 's reunification happened in 1990 .
how much longer will it be necessary to have a commissioner of this kind ? i think it makes sense to coordinate these tasks .
they are connected , and i think the job will exist for a while .
financial support for the eastern states continues until 2019 - perhaps that 's the point by which things will have to have normalized . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany is becoming a leader in renewable energies , said tiefensee will the standards of living in the east and west be similar by then ? actually , in the eastern states , we do n't want to imitate the western ones or become like other western european cities .
it 's more about taking a similar approach in the east and west to the challenges that confront germany and europe .
the pre-existing conditions vary .
i think that the eastern states have a natural advantage - especially in new industrial sectors like renewable energy , it and biotechnology , for example . investing late in new sectors means a more modern approach to investing , and that 's already become apparent .
as far as renewable energy goes , every second job in germany is in eastern germany . nevertheless , unemployment in the new states is still twice as high as in western germany .
when do you think this will even out ? that 's the most difficult question .
in the eastern states , unemployment is way above 13 percent , while it 's at 6 percent in the western states .
in addition , those without jobs in eastern germany are unemployed for long periods of time - for 12 or even 24 months - and get stuck in this chronic unemployment with no chance of breaking back into the job market . how long will this continue ?
we have to think long-term , because chronic unemployment can only be reduced very slowly .
the eastern regions of the new states are experiencing an economic upswing .
but this has n't yet had enough of an effect on the job market .
i think it will take at least another 10 years to reduce unemployment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : right-wing extremism has a larger following in eastern germany people from minority or foreign backgrounds tend to shy away from the eastern states .
some decide not to work or study there because they 're afraid of being assaulted by neo-nazis .
can you understand these concerns ? yes , unfortunately it is the case that the number of xenophobic crimes is higher in the east than in the west .
on the other hand , the big cities and many of the medium-sized cities are great places for foreigners to study or work as engineers or skilled laborers . many people actually prefer the eastern german states because they can also be particularly hospitable .
this is left over from communist east germany , when people had a totally different way of interacting with each other . there are many initiatives in place that are committed to breaking down xenophobia .
often , because there are too few foreigners , people often do n't know what they 're talking about and arrive at negative judgments .
if the number of foreign residents were to increase gradually , then i 'm sure that reservations about them would gradually decrease . you mentioned traditional hospitality in the east .
does eastern germany have a different value system than western germany ? i do n't think so , but of course 40 years of the gdr did n't go by without having an effect on the population and on individuals .
for 40 years , we could n't travel where we wanted to .
studying abroad was out of the question .
we could n't freely organize clubs or political parties like people in the western states and in western europe could .
all of that has left its mark . on the other hand , we ca n't forget that these were the people - just like in poland or czechoslovakia - who prepared the peaceful revolution and the globalchange that came with it .
the forces involved developed under a dictatorship , and the will to create something is still evident today .
people are very happy about finally being able to take responsibility . i do n't think that 's a different value system , particularly since the younger generation is assimilating anyway . interview : miodrag soric -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and that , he told dw-world , is all he wants from his german club . dw-world.de : oliver kahn got himself suspended from the last league game of 2007 and has feuded with much of the squad .
could you see yourself taking over from him as bayern 's regular captain ?
lucio : i would n't dream of becoming bayern munich 's captain .
it 's not my life 's goal , and i would n't fight for the position .
as far as i 'm concerned there 'll be no squabbling with my teammates over it .
the coach decides who 's captain .
i wo n't lie and say it would n't be flattering to be singled out for this responsibility , but i 'm not concerned with having a special status - that means nothing to me .
i 'll keep on the way i always have .
i 'm not looking to inherit the captaincy .
but you have served as bayern 's captain for the odd game .
did you not like it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strikers beware - lucio is one of the league most hard-nosed defenders of course it was a great experience .
but it did n't change me or the way i work with the team .
the best part was the feeling that the coach trusts me , that he and the team have faith in me .
in the period when i was captain , the atmosphere was great , really relaxed .
the team assistants and physiotherapists were in a good mood , always making jokes with me .
is the position first and foremost a matter of discipline ?
discipline is important , but a captain needs other qualities as well .
he has to lead by example .
he has to be someone who works hard , who shows respect for the coach and his teammates and who always gives his best for the club .
at bayern i 've always stood for these qualities .
that 's why i was allowed to be captain on occasion .
but as the captain of the brazilian national team , you surely must feel you 're entitled to the same position at bayern munich .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio 's season was going wll until he was suspended for four games for elbowing an opponent i did n't try to become captain of brazil .
it just happened , and i 'm very honored to have been given such an enormous responsibility .
thus far it 's gone well .
my teammates like me , and we get along well with one another .
you would n't have too many problems dealing with players like miroslav klose , luca toni or franck ribery , if you can lead a squad with stars like ronaldinho , kaka or robinho .
i 've known stars like kaka or ronaldinho both professionally and personally for quite some time .
they always listened to me and followed my advice , even when i was n't captain .
and when they tell me something , i listen to them too .
that 's why i have no problems fulfilling my responsibilities in the national team .
so ca n't you convince a kaka or ronaldinho to come to bayern ?
i do n't think they 'll be coming any time soon .
why not ?
it 's next to impossible to convince brazilian stars who can play in italy or spain to come to germany .
it 's not a question of the club , but the country .
the culture , lifestyle and language in italy and spain are fairly brazilian .
bayern ca n't compete .
you do n't try to sell bayern munich to your teammates in the brazilian national squad , as luca toni supposedly does with italy ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio won the world cup with brazil in 2002 as i said , for the reasons i 've just mentioned , bayern munich is a product that 's hard to market .
it 's difficult for me to sell the club to superstars like kaka , ronaldinho or robinho .
there are a few who would believe me - but they 're the ones who already play in the bundesliga .
for example , diego , naldo , gilberto , mineiro and josue .
but not ronaldinho or kaka ?
when we exchange impressions , i have to admit it would be easier for them to convince me to leave germany than for me to convince them to come here .
but they have n't succeeded .
you 're still here .
yes , and i intend to see out my current contract , which runs until 2010 .
i still dream of spain or italy .
i 'd love to play there , and perhaps i can fulfill this dream a bit earlier , if the club and i can reach an agreement .
i transferred from leverkusen to munich two years before my contract back then was set to expire .

but , that did n't stop the german translation from cracking the 2007 bestseller lists .
he talked about prussia 's appeal . dw-world.de : are you surprised that an academic book on prussia could make the german bestseller lists ? christopher clark : i certainly did n't expect success on that level .
i think it 's a case of timing .
the fall of the berlin wall and german re-unification have triggered a process of re-imagining the german past in general and prussia in particular .
so much of what was left of the old prussian state was in former communist east germany , so it was kind of locked away .
with the re-unification of germany , it all became visible and got reconnected to the larger german national entity .
that and the opening up of archives of the former east germany prompted a rethink .
let 's try to sum up your thesis .
prussia was a relatively enlightened , progressive state that inadvertently destroyed itself when it enlisted the force of german nationalism .
is that close ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prussian culture , including architecture , blossomed in the 19th century that 's exactly it .
nationalism was prussia 's downfall .
in older historical literature , nationalism was seen as the culmination of prussian history .
prussia 's task in history had been to create the german nation .
just as we today tend to see the rise of the third reich in 1933 as the end of an era and explain how germany got to that point , previous generations tried to explain how german history had got to 1871 and the creation of the german empire .
and the answer was that prussia was the steering , shaping and sometimes manipulative power that would bring the german nation into existence .
the emergence of the german nation is the thing that gives meaning to the whole history of prussia . that , in my view , is completely and utterly wrong .
throughout its history prussia had been the most un-national state you can imagine , partly because it contained such large numbers of non-germans , but also because the whole idea of its existence was that of the sovereign , monarchical state , interwoven with the idea of the sovereignty of law . these were ideas that had nothing to do with the uprising of a national movement .
prussia responded very hostilely to early german nationalism because the hohenzollern rulers rightly recognized that it would act like a kind of corrosive acid eating away at everything the prussian state stood for . it was only during the unstable period of the 1850s , 60s and 70s that prussian statesmen , particularly prussian prime minister and german chancellor otto von bismarck , began to imagine that they could tame nationalism .
but that was something they failed to do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hohenzollern kings ruled first prussia , then germany from 1701 to 1918 you mention bismarck .
he plays less of a role in your book than in most works of prussian history .
why is that ? in some ways i think bismarck turned his back on prussia .
king friedrich wilhelm iv of prussia said in 1848 : " prussia will be henceforth merged into germany . "
and i think he got it right that the process of national consolidation that bismarck saw as a continuation of prussian security policy would ultimately not prussianize germany , but germanize prussia , and that everything the old prussia stood for would be lost .
so in some ways i see bismarck as the first executor of a kind of closing-down sale of prussia and prussian tradition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historian christopher clark says prussia was never the bad guy of europe but was n't nationalism something inevitable that was going to happen sooner or later ?
or can one imagine a scenario in which prussia would still exist today ? that 's a really good question and a difficult one to answer .
although historians usually rear up in horror at the notion , i think it was probably inevitable .
if you think about the other multi-national states that existed in the 19th century , russia , for example , or the austro-hungarian empire , both of them disappeared in the course of the world war i and were replaced by something radically different .
it seems to me that these pre-national , multi-ethnic commonwealths that were such a feature of europe in the early modern period were probably doomed to go under . let 's backtrack now and talk about the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries and prussia under friedrich the great .
you describe especially the prussian capital berlin as a vibrant , even libidinous place during his reign .
would you have liked to live there ? i think there would have been wonderful things about being in berlin in the 1780s and 90s .
berlin , if you compare it with london or paris , has the reputation of being boring .
but , that does n't mean berlin was dead or lacked an urbane identity .
and this identity was not driven by the projection of power through the dynasty and its monumental public buildings .
the new culture that emerged was driven by voluntary impulses from civil society .
there was a proliferation of clubs and organizations for all sorts of purposes - cultivating the sciences , for instance , or looking at economical ways of using fuel .
there were literary societies and freemason lodges .
it was an endless cornucopia of little voluntary initiatives .
the point i was trying to make is that this created a city that was n't just about courts or courtliness but about courtesy and civility of a very middle-class , bourgeois kind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arrogance of emperor wilhelm ii and his generals led to defeat in world war i many historians draw links between prussia and nazism .
although no one would claim prussia was the cradle of the ideology , some people see connections between prussian militarism and subservience and the third reich .
but , you portray prussia more as a source of opposition . if it were true that prussia created an environment that deadened the will of ordinary citizens and turned them into instruments of state power , thereby blazing a trail for a totalitarian dictatorship in which people would do anything they were told , it would be very easy to test that hypothesis .
all you 'd have to show is that germans of prussian provenance made better and more obedient nazis than people from austria , baden-württemberg and so on .
if that had been the case , it would be more than obvious .
but it is n't .
there is simply no evidence .
on the contrary , people from baden-württemberg and especially austria made for equally keen nazis , with austrians , for example , being hugely overrepresented in the machinery of nazi genocide .
it 's just simply not the case that you can map out a relationship between prussia and nazism that made people into better tools of the regime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president paul von hindenburg appointed hitler as chancellor in 1933 of course , prussia is implicated in the story of the events that brought hitler to power .
the old prussian elites played a key role in cooking up the plan to put hitler into power as german chancellor in 1933 .
not because they wanted the third reich , but because they thought they could use hitler in a kind of conservative coup against the weimar republic .
of course , they were disastrously wrong .
the corporate arrogance of the prussian nobility helps to explain why some perfectly intelligent people failed to recognize the danger hitler presented . but national socialism was in many respects the exact opposite pole of prussiandom .
the old prussian state had been about the authority of government and the rule of law , but the new nazi reich was about the people .
it was an ethnic entity .
the nazis did n't care about laws .
to them , laws were utterly secondary .
what mattered was the führer as the expression of the will of the volk .
this was an idea that had no precedent in prussian history whatsoever .
so i see a very strong antipathy between the two forms of state . christopher clark is senior lecturer in modern european history at st. catharine 's college , university of cambridge . interview by jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

throughout its history prussia had been the most un-national state you can imagine , partly because it contained such large numbers of non-germans , but also because the whole idea of its existence was that of the sovereign , monarchical state , interwoven with the idea of the sovereignty of law . these were ideas that had nothing to do with the uprising of a national movement .
prussia responded very hostilely to early german nationalism because the hohenzollern rulers rightly recognized that it would act like a kind of corrosive acid eating away at everything the prussian state stood for . it was only during the unstable period of the 1850s , 60s and 70s that prussian statesmen , particularly prussian prime minister and german chancellor otto von bismarck , began to imagine that they could tame nationalism .
but that was something they failed to do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hohenzollern kings ruled first prussia , then germany from 1701 to 1918 you mention bismarck .
he plays less of a role in your book than in most works of prussian history .
why is that ? in some ways i think bismarck turned his back on prussia .
king friedrich wilhelm iv of prussia said in 1848 : " prussia will be henceforth merged into germany . "
and i think he got it right that the process of national consolidation that bismarck saw as a continuation of prussian security policy would ultimately not prussianize germany , but germanize prussia , and that everything the old prussia stood for would be lost .
so in some ways i see bismarck as the first executor of a kind of closing-down sale of prussia and prussian tradition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historian christopher clark says prussia was never the bad guy of europe but was n't nationalism something inevitable that was going to happen sooner or later ?
or can one imagine a scenario in which prussia would still exist today ? that 's a really good question and a difficult one to answer .
although historians usually rear up in horror at the notion , i think it was probably inevitable .
if you think about the other multi-national states that existed in the 19th century , russia , for example , or the austro-hungarian empire , both of them disappeared in the course of the world war i and were replaced by something radically different .
it seems to me that these pre-national , multi-ethnic commonwealths that were such a feature of europe in the early modern period were probably doomed to go under . let 's backtrack now and talk about the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries and prussia under friedrich the great .
you describe especially the prussian capital berlin as a vibrant , even libidinous place during his reign .
would you have liked to live there ? i think there would have been wonderful things about being in berlin in the 1780s and 90s .
berlin , if you compare it with london or paris , has the reputation of being boring .
but , that does n't mean berlin was dead or lacked an urbane identity .
and this identity was not driven by the projection of power through the dynasty and its monumental public buildings .
the new culture that emerged was driven by voluntary impulses from civil society .
there was a proliferation of clubs and organizations for all sorts of purposes - cultivating the sciences , for instance , or looking at economical ways of using fuel .
there were literary societies and freemason lodges .
it was an endless cornucopia of little voluntary initiatives .
the point i was trying to make is that this created a city that was n't just about courts or courtliness but about courtesy and civility of a very middle-class , bourgeois kind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arrogance of emperor wilhelm ii and his generals led to defeat in world war i many historians draw links between prussia and nazism .
although no one would claim prussia was the cradle of the ideology , some people see connections between prussian militarism and subservience and the third reich .
but , you portray prussia more as a source of opposition . if it were true that prussia created an environment that deadened the will of ordinary citizens and turned them into instruments of state power , thereby blazing a trail for a totalitarian dictatorship in which people would do anything they were told , it would be very easy to test that hypothesis .
all you 'd have to show is that germans of prussian provenance made better and more obedient nazis than people from austria , baden-württemberg and so on .
if that had been the case , it would be more than obvious .
but it is n't .
there is simply no evidence .
on the contrary , people from baden-württemberg and especially austria made for equally keen nazis , with austrians , for example , being hugely overrepresented in the machinery of nazi genocide .
it 's just simply not the case that you can map out a relationship between prussia and nazism that made people into better tools of the regime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president paul von hindenburg appointed hitler as chancellor in 1933 of course , prussia is implicated in the story of the events that brought hitler to power .
the old prussian elites played a key role in cooking up the plan to put hitler into power as german chancellor in 1933 .
not because they wanted the third reich , but because they thought they could use hitler in a kind of conservative coup against the weimar republic .
of course , they were disastrously wrong .
the corporate arrogance of the prussian nobility helps to explain why some perfectly intelligent people failed to recognize the danger hitler presented . but national socialism was in many respects the exact opposite pole of prussiandom .
the old prussian state had been about the authority of government and the rule of law , but the new nazi reich was about the people .
it was an ethnic entity .
the nazis did n't care about laws .
to them , laws were utterly secondary .
what mattered was the führer as the expression of the will of the volk .

the fall of the berlin wall and german re-unification have triggered a process of re-imagining the german past in general and prussia in particular .

with the re-unification of germany , it all became visible and got reconnected to the larger german national entity .
that and the opening up of archives of the former east germany prompted a rethink .
let 's try to sum up your thesis .
prussia was a relatively enlightened , progressive state that inadvertently destroyed itself when it enlisted the force of german nationalism .
is that close ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prussian culture , including architecture , blossomed in the 19th century that 's exactly it .
nationalism was prussia 's downfall .
in older historical literature , nationalism was seen as the culmination of prussian history .
prussia 's task in history had been to create the german nation .
just as we today tend to see the rise of the third reich in 1933 as the end of an era and explain how germany got to that point , previous generations tried to explain how german history had got to 1871 and the creation of the german empire .

" a climate-change war over cars " was how the business weekly wirtschaftswoche described the standoff between one of germany 's largest and most vital industries and the bureaucrats in brussels . it is up to the european commission - the eu 's executive arm - to set out how carmakers should meet the target of cutting emissions to an average of 130 grams / kilometer -lrb- g / km -rrb- among their passenger vehicles from 2012 , and how parts and fuel-makers should knock a further 10 g / km off the average .
the target represents a cut of about 25 percent from current levels . internal commission strife bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checking tire pressure and using biofuels can help reduce emissions the eu 's commissioners , however , remain at odds over several key points . commissioner for enterprise günter verheugen , a staunch defender of the german car industry , has sought to reduce fines on companies that do not cut average emissions to 130 grams per km through engine technology . but environment commission stavros dimas argued for gradually mounting fines from 2012 as an effective deterrent to force manufacturers to invest in clean technology . overall , car parts and fuel-makers are meant to find ways to slash average emissions by a quarter - from the current 160 g / km to 120 g / km .
while climate protection groups say that might be a manageable target , it is far from clear which manufacturers will serve as the sacrificial lamb . " the only thing that really poses a threat to us are bad political decisions taken in brussels or berlin , " matthias wissmann , the head of the german automobile federation vda , said last week . given that the targets apply to the sector as a whole , it is the commission 's task to decide how the new burden is to be shared . big versus small bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european carmakers have taken different sides in the co2 dispute countries that traditionally make larger , less fuel-efficient vehicles , such as germany and sweden , are at odds with their european neighbors , such as france , spain and italy , who are better known for producing smaller cars . the latter say luxury carmakers should take the weight of the new guidelines , not least because they are the ones with the highest profit margins . but german chancellor angela merkel , who has been vocally pro-environment since taking up office , has lobbied hard against the emissions caps . " we will fight for our interests , " she told a meeting of eu leaders in brussels recently . a common pool of co2 in keeping with germany 's wishes , the latest word from the commission was that it was proposing the cuts to be proportionate to a vehicle 's weight , and the emissions targets to be pooled among carmakers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european automakers may see profits drop if emissions limits are put in place also unresolved is how manufacturers will be penalized for failing to meet their targets .
head of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , has suggested a fine of 10 euros -lrb- $ 14 -rrb- for each extra gram of co2 , but the european commissioner for the environment stavros dimas wants to implement a fee of 35 euros per excess gram - a drop from the 95 euros per gram he had been quoted with proposing in some media reports . that suggestion has met with fierce resistance from germany , whose car industry could stand to loose billions under such a stringent penalty system .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 19.12.2007 cambridge historian says prussia gets a bad rap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrich the great -lrb- 1712-1786 -rrb- was both an art lover and a successful military commander christopher clark 's " the iron kingdom " is a 750 + page opus about a state that no longer exists .
but , that did n't stop the german translation from cracking the 2007 bestseller lists .
he talked about prussia 's appeal . dw-world.de : are you surprised that an academic book on prussia could make the german bestseller lists ? christopher clark : i certainly did n't expect success on that level .
i think it 's a case of timing .
the fall of the berlin wall and german re-unification have triggered a process of re-imagining the german past in general and prussia in particular .
so much of what was left of the old prussian state was in former communist east germany , so it was kind of locked away .
with the re-unification of germany , it all became visible and got reconnected to the larger german national entity .
that and the opening up of archives of the former east germany prompted a rethink .
let 's try to sum up your thesis .
prussia was a relatively enlightened , progressive state that inadvertently destroyed itself when it enlisted the force of german nationalism .
is that close ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prussian culture , including architecture , blossomed in the 19th century that 's exactly it .
nationalism was prussia 's downfall .
in older historical literature , nationalism was seen as the culmination of prussian history .
prussia 's task in history had been to create the german nation .
just as we today tend to see the rise of the third reich in 1933 as the end of an era and explain how germany got to that point , previous generations tried to explain how german history had got to 1871 and the creation of the german empire .
and the answer was that prussia was the steering , shaping and sometimes manipulative power that would bring the german nation into existence .
the emergence of the german nation is the thing that gives meaning to the whole history of prussia . that , in my view , is completely and utterly wrong .
throughout its history prussia had been the most un-national state you can imagine , partly because it contained such large numbers of non-germans , but also because the whole idea of its existence was that of the sovereign , monarchical state , interwoven with the idea of the sovereignty of law . these were ideas that had nothing to do with the uprising of a national movement .
prussia responded very hostilely to early german nationalism because the hohenzollern rulers rightly recognized that it would act like a kind of corrosive acid eating away at everything the prussian state stood for . it was only during the unstable period of the 1850s , 60s and 70s that prussian statesmen , particularly prussian prime minister and german chancellor otto von bismarck , began to imagine that they could tame nationalism .
but that was something they failed to do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hohenzollern kings ruled first prussia , then germany from 1701 to 1918 you mention bismarck .
he plays less of a role in your book than in most works of prussian history .
why is that ? in some ways i think bismarck turned his back on prussia .
king friedrich wilhelm iv of prussia said in 1848 : " prussia will be henceforth merged into germany . "
and i think he got it right that the process of national consolidation that bismarck saw as a continuation of prussian security policy would ultimately not prussianize germany , but germanize prussia , and that everything the old prussia stood for would be lost .
so in some ways i see bismarck as the first executor of a kind of closing-down sale of prussia and prussian tradition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historian christopher clark says prussia was never the bad guy of europe but was n't nationalism something inevitable that was going to happen sooner or later ?
or can one imagine a scenario in which prussia would still exist today ? that 's a really good question and a difficult one to answer .
although historians usually rear up in horror at the notion , i think it was probably inevitable .
if you think about the other multi-national states that existed in the 19th century , russia , for example , or the austro-hungarian empire , both of them disappeared in the course of the world war i and were replaced by something radically different .
it seems to me that these pre-national , multi-ethnic commonwealths that were such a feature of europe in the early modern period were probably doomed to go under . let 's backtrack now and talk about the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries and prussia under friedrich the great .
you describe especially the prussian capital berlin as a vibrant , even libidinous place during his reign .
would you have liked to live there ? i think there would have been wonderful things about being in berlin in the 1780s and 90s .
berlin , if you compare it with london or paris , has the reputation of being boring .
but , that does n't mean berlin was dead or lacked an urbane identity .
and this identity was not driven by the projection of power through the dynasty and its monumental public buildings .
the new culture that emerged was driven by voluntary impulses from civil society .
there was a proliferation of clubs and organizations for all sorts of purposes - cultivating the sciences , for instance , or looking at economical ways of using fuel .
there were literary societies and freemason lodges .
it was an endless cornucopia of little voluntary initiatives .
the point i was trying to make is that this created a city that was n't just about courts or courtliness but about courtesy and civility of a very middle-class , bourgeois kind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arrogance of emperor wilhelm ii and his generals led to defeat in world war i many historians draw links between prussia and nazism .
although no one would claim prussia was the cradle of the ideology , some people see connections between prussian militarism and subservience and the third reich .
but , you portray prussia more as a source of opposition . if it were true that prussia created an environment that deadened the will of ordinary citizens and turned them into instruments of state power , thereby blazing a trail for a totalitarian dictatorship in which people would do anything they were told , it would be very easy to test that hypothesis .
all you 'd have to show is that germans of prussian provenance made better and more obedient nazis than people from austria , baden-württemberg and so on .
if that had been the case , it would be more than obvious .
but it is n't .
there is simply no evidence .
on the contrary , people from baden-württemberg and especially austria made for equally keen nazis , with austrians , for example , being hugely overrepresented in the machinery of nazi genocide .
it 's just simply not the case that you can map out a relationship between prussia and nazism that made people into better tools of the regime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president paul von hindenburg appointed hitler as chancellor in 1933 of course , prussia is implicated in the story of the events that brought hitler to power .
the old prussian elites played a key role in cooking up the plan to put hitler into power as german chancellor in 1933 .
not because they wanted the third reich , but because they thought they could use hitler in a kind of conservative coup against the weimar republic .
of course , they were disastrously wrong .
the corporate arrogance of the prussian nobility helps to explain why some perfectly intelligent people failed to recognize the danger hitler presented . but national socialism was in many respects the exact opposite pole of prussiandom .
the old prussian state had been about the authority of government and the rule of law , but the new nazi reich was about the people .
it was an ethnic entity .
the nazis did n't care about laws .
to them , laws were utterly secondary .
what mattered was the führer as the expression of the will of the volk .
this was an idea that had no precedent in prussian history whatsoever .
so i see a very strong antipathy between the two forms of state . christopher clark is senior lecturer in modern european history at st. catharine 's college , university of cambridge . interview by jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but , that did n't stop the german translation from cracking the 2007 bestseller lists .
he talked about prussia 's appeal . dw-world.de : are you surprised that an academic book on prussia could make the german bestseller lists ? christopher clark : i certainly did n't expect success on that level .
i think it 's a case of timing .
the fall of the berlin wall and german re-unification have triggered a process of re-imagining the german past in general and prussia in particular .
so much of what was left of the old prussian state was in former communist east germany , so it was kind of locked away .
with the re-unification of germany , it all became visible and got reconnected to the larger german national entity .
that and the opening up of archives of the former east germany prompted a rethink .
let 's try to sum up your thesis .
prussia was a relatively enlightened , progressive state that inadvertently destroyed itself when it enlisted the force of german nationalism .
is that close ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prussian culture , including architecture , blossomed in the 19th century that 's exactly it .

but , that did n't stop the german translation from cracking the 2007 bestseller lists .
he talked about prussia 's appeal . dw-world.de : are you surprised that an academic book on prussia could make the german bestseller lists ? christopher clark : i certainly did n't expect success on that level .
i think it 's a case of timing .
the fall of the berlin wall and german re-unification have triggered a process of re-imagining the german past in general and prussia in particular .
so much of what was left of the old prussian state was in former communist east germany , so it was kind of locked away .
with the re-unification of germany , it all became visible and got reconnected to the larger german national entity .
that and the opening up of archives of the former east germany prompted a rethink .
let 's try to sum up your thesis .
prussia was a relatively enlightened , progressive state that inadvertently destroyed itself when it enlisted the force of german nationalism .
is that close ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prussian culture , including architecture , blossomed in the 19th century that 's exactly it .
nationalism was prussia 's downfall .
in older historical literature , nationalism was seen as the culmination of prussian history .
prussia 's task in history had been to create the german nation .
just as we today tend to see the rise of the third reich in 1933 as the end of an era and explain how germany got to that point , previous generations tried to explain how german history had got to 1871 and the creation of the german empire .
and the answer was that prussia was the steering , shaping and sometimes manipulative power that would bring the german nation into existence .
the emergence of the german nation is the thing that gives meaning to the whole history of prussia . that , in my view , is completely and utterly wrong .
throughout its history prussia had been the most un-national state you can imagine , partly because it contained such large numbers of non-germans , but also because the whole idea of its existence was that of the sovereign , monarchical state , interwoven with the idea of the sovereignty of law . these were ideas that had nothing to do with the uprising of a national movement .
prussia responded very hostilely to early german nationalism because the hohenzollern rulers rightly recognized that it would act like a kind of corrosive acid eating away at everything the prussian state stood for . it was only during the unstable period of the 1850s , 60s and 70s that prussian statesmen , particularly prussian prime minister and german chancellor otto von bismarck , began to imagine that they could tame nationalism .
but that was something they failed to do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hohenzollern kings ruled first prussia , then germany from 1701 to 1918 you mention bismarck .
he plays less of a role in your book than in most works of prussian history .
why is that ? in some ways i think bismarck turned his back on prussia .
king friedrich wilhelm iv of prussia said in 1848 : " prussia will be henceforth merged into germany . "
and i think he got it right that the process of national consolidation that bismarck saw as a continuation of prussian security policy would ultimately not prussianize germany , but germanize prussia , and that everything the old prussia stood for would be lost .
so in some ways i see bismarck as the first executor of a kind of closing-down sale of prussia and prussian tradition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historian christopher clark says prussia was never the bad guy of europe but was n't nationalism something inevitable that was going to happen sooner or later ?
or can one imagine a scenario in which prussia would still exist today ? that 's a really good question and a difficult one to answer .
although historians usually rear up in horror at the notion , i think it was probably inevitable .
if you think about the other multi-national states that existed in the 19th century , russia , for example , or the austro-hungarian empire , both of them disappeared in the course of the world war i and were replaced by something radically different .
it seems to me that these pre-national , multi-ethnic commonwealths that were such a feature of europe in the early modern period were probably doomed to go under . let 's backtrack now and talk about the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries and prussia under friedrich the great .
you describe especially the prussian capital berlin as a vibrant , even libidinous place during his reign .
would you have liked to live there ? i think there would have been wonderful things about being in berlin in the 1780s and 90s .
berlin , if you compare it with london or paris , has the reputation of being boring .
but , that does n't mean berlin was dead or lacked an urbane identity .
and this identity was not driven by the projection of power through the dynasty and its monumental public buildings .
the new culture that emerged was driven by voluntary impulses from civil society .
there was a proliferation of clubs and organizations for all sorts of purposes - cultivating the sciences , for instance , or looking at economical ways of using fuel .
there were literary societies and freemason lodges .
it was an endless cornucopia of little voluntary initiatives .
the point i was trying to make is that this created a city that was n't just about courts or courtliness but about courtesy and civility of a very middle-class , bourgeois kind . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the arrogance of emperor wilhelm ii and his generals led to defeat in world war i many historians draw links between prussia and nazism .
although no one would claim prussia was the cradle of the ideology , some people see connections between prussian militarism and subservience and the third reich .
but , you portray prussia more as a source of opposition . if it were true that prussia created an environment that deadened the will of ordinary citizens and turned them into instruments of state power , thereby blazing a trail for a totalitarian dictatorship in which people would do anything they were told , it would be very easy to test that hypothesis .
all you 'd have to show is that germans of prussian provenance made better and more obedient nazis than people from austria , baden-württemberg and so on .
if that had been the case , it would be more than obvious .
but it is n't .
there is simply no evidence .
on the contrary , people from baden-württemberg and especially austria made for equally keen nazis , with austrians , for example , being hugely overrepresented in the machinery of nazi genocide .
it 's just simply not the case that you can map out a relationship between prussia and nazism that made people into better tools of the regime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president paul von hindenburg appointed hitler as chancellor in 1933 of course , prussia is implicated in the story of the events that brought hitler to power .
the old prussian elites played a key role in cooking up the plan to put hitler into power as german chancellor in 1933 .
not because they wanted the third reich , but because they thought they could use hitler in a kind of conservative coup against the weimar republic .
of course , they were disastrously wrong .
the corporate arrogance of the prussian nobility helps to explain why some perfectly intelligent people failed to recognize the danger hitler presented . but national socialism was in many respects the exact opposite pole of prussiandom .
the old prussian state had been about the authority of government and the rule of law , but the new nazi reich was about the people .
it was an ethnic entity .
the nazis did n't care about laws .
to them , laws were utterly secondary .
what mattered was the führer as the expression of the will of the volk .
this was an idea that had no precedent in prussian history whatsoever .
so i see a very strong antipathy between the two forms of state . christopher clark is senior lecturer in modern european history at st. catharine 's college , university of cambridge . interview by jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

we begin with the cartwrights , and will report on the others in the days ahead .
all the coal house families have had to get used to being approached by fans , everywhere from the theatre to the supermarket .
but the prize for most unexpected encounter has to go to geology professor joe cartwright .
it happened on a business trip , as his wife annabel explained : " he went to holland and met the chief senior geologist with shell in the hague .
" he was all anxious as he had a very important presentation to do .
but the man wanted to talk about coal house .
he saw joe and asked ' how 's your finger ? '
" via satellite tv , he had joined the hundreds of thousands who tuned in and saw joe , 48 , slice his finger in week one .
more than a month after the family left blaenavon 's stack square , they are recognised daily , including last week when joe was buying stewing steak and the butcher joked it would cost him two shillings .
' so humbling ' astrophysicist annabel said she found it particularly strange people " knew " not only her , but her daughters .
she said : " i went to buy music in a shop i need for my daughter 's cello exam .
the woman asked me which one .
i thought she meant which exam , but she meant gwen or kitty . "
i did feel sad leaving the cottage , i just loved it annabel cartwright it is a far cry from 1927 when the women in particular spent virtually all their time at home , with their families and neighbours for company .
the community spirit among the coal house families is something mrs cartwright valued , while her husband misses the camaraderie at the blaentillery drift mine .
the cardiff university professor said : " i miss the mining , i miss all the blokes in the mine and rubbing shoulders with men who do the world 's hardest job .
it was so humbling .
" i was chuffed to bits i did ok and earned money .
the guys down there knew i did a reasonable job and they let me know .
that means more than anything else i 've done in my career . "
recalling leaving day , annabel said : " i did feel sad leaving the cottage , i just loved it .
it was so beautiful in there .
i loved the look of it .
" the sitting room was not comfortable to sit in but it was cosy and i loved my old plates on the rack .
i loved lining them up . "
when they first returned to their penarth home , everyday aspects of modern life felt like luxuries , as annabel remembers .
" taking my shoes off and walking on carpet thinking ' this is nice actually ' .
putting the lights and heating on .
i made a cup of tea which took about three minutes straight to finish , wonderful . "
having a sink to wash dishes in feels like a luxury kitty , 11 , said : " you kept thinking ' was that a dream or was that really real ? '
i remember things in coal house but could n't quite remember if i dreamt it . "
gwen , 12 , is in no doubt of the 2007 items she missed most : " i did not miss central heating or the car .
it was frozen peas and tomato ketchup . "
bringing them back to earth was a pile of bills for numerous utilities they had lived without in the coal house .
meanwhile , some tastes and skills they acquired in 1927 appear to have travelled through time .
former non-cook annabel has made her own mince pies , while scarce " treat " foods from 1927 , like leeks , have retained their appeal .
she explained : " -lsb- in 1927 -rsb- i could never afford to buy pears .
i quite like pears but because i could not have one i could almost have snatched them .
when i got out , i rushed out to buy pears . "
overall , the family believe the experience has " spectacularly " broadened their minds and given them a unique insight into how their forefathers lived .
mr cartwright said : " it makes me even more crave a simple life .
just to simplify life and value time with your family . "
he added : " i feel privileged to have had the chance to do it , leaving aside public reaction , just for us as a family it was an amazing adventure .
" we 're so lucky to have had that , we will always have those memories . "

we begin with the cartwrights , and will report on the others in the days ahead .
all the coal house families have had to get used to being approached by fans , everywhere from the theatre to the supermarket .
but the prize for most unexpected encounter has to go to geology professor joe cartwright .
it happened on a business trip , as his wife annabel explained : " he went to holland and met the chief senior geologist with shell in the hague .
" he was all anxious as he had a very important presentation to do .
but the man wanted to talk about coal house .
he saw joe and asked ' how 's your finger ? '
" via satellite tv , he had joined the hundreds of thousands who tuned in and saw joe , 48 , slice his finger in week one .
more than a month after the family left blaenavon 's stack square , they are recognised daily , including last week when joe was buying stewing steak and the butcher joked it would cost him two shillings .
' so humbling ' astrophysicist annabel said she found it particularly strange people " knew " not only her , but her daughters .
she said : " i went to buy music in a shop i need for my daughter 's cello exam .
the woman asked me which one .
i thought she meant which exam , but she meant gwen or kitty . "
" i did feel sad leaving the cottage , i just loved it " annabel cartwright it is a far cry from 1927 when the women in particular spent virtually all their time at home , with their families and neighbours for company .
the community spirit among the coal house families is something mrs cartwright valued , while her husband misses the camaraderie at the blaentillery drift mine .
the cardiff university professor said : " i miss the mining , i miss all the blokes in the mine and rubbing shoulders with men who do the world 's hardest job .
it was so humbling .
" i was chuffed to bits i did ok and earned money .
the guys down there knew i did a reasonable job and they let me know .
that means more than anything else i 've done in my career . "
recalling leaving day , annabel said : " i did feel sad leaving the cottage , i just loved it .
it was so beautiful in there .
i loved the look of it .
" the sitting room was not comfortable to sit in but it was cosy and i loved my old plates on the rack .
i loved lining them up . "
when they first returned to their penarth home , everyday aspects of modern life felt like luxuries , as annabel remembers .
" taking my shoes off and walking on carpet thinking ' this is nice actually ' .
putting the lights and heating on .
i made a cup of tea which took about three minutes straight to finish , wonderful . "
kitty , 11 , said : " you kept thinking ' was that a dream or was that really real ? '
i remember things in coal house but could n't quite remember if i dreamt it . "
gwen , 12 , is in no doubt of the 2007 items she missed most : " i did not miss central heating or the car .
it was frozen peas and tomato ketchup . "
bringing them back to earth was a pile of bills for numerous utilities they had lived without in the coal house .
meanwhile , some tastes and skills they acquired in 1927 appear to have travelled through time .
former non-cook annabel has made her own mince pies , while scarce " treat " foods from 1927 , like leeks , have retained their appeal .
she explained : " -lsb- in 1927 -rsb- i could never afford to buy pears .
i quite like pears but because i could not have one i could almost have snatched them .
when i got out , i rushed out to buy pears . "
overall , the family believe the experience has " spectacularly " broadened their minds and given them a unique insight into how their forefathers lived .
mr cartwright said : " it makes me even more crave a simple life .

he added : " i feel privileged to have had the chance to do it , leaving aside public reaction , just for us as a family it was an amazing adventure .

the scam saw hackers steal details of about 100 million credit and debit card transactions over several years .
the value of the settlement is confidential but includes payments to visa and us bank associations to cover costs of replacing customers ' cards .
the retailer has said that uk customers were not exposed to fraud .
tjx said it had also spent about $ 125m on improving security .
the settlement covered class actions in the united states , puerto rico and canada .
decryption tool tjx reached a deal with all but one of the seven banks and bankers groups that sued it .
those who did sign up to the settlement - also designed to cover costs of monitoring fraud - have waived their rights to sue .
the data was accessed on tjx 's systems in watford , hertfordshire , and massachusetts over a 16-month period from july 2005 and covered transactions made by credit and debit card dating as far back as december 2002 .
in its filing to the securities and exchange commission earlier this year , the group said it believed " the intruder had access to the decryption tool for the encryption software utilized by tjx " .
the firm had initially said that at least 45.7 million cards were exposed to potential fraud .
but it added that at least three-quarters of the affected cards had expired or data had been masked .

the scam saw hackers steal details of about 100 million credit and debit card transactions over several years .
the value of the settlement is confidential but includes payments to visa and us bank associations to cover costs of replacing customers ' cards .
the retailer has said that uk customers were not exposed to fraud .
tjx said it had also spent about $ 125m on improving security .
the settlement covered class actions in the united states , puerto rico and canada .
decryption tool tjx reached a deal with all but one of the seven banks and bankers groups that sued it .
those who did sign up to the settlement - also designed to cover costs of monitoring fraud - have waived their rights to sue .
the data was accessed on tjx 's systems in watford , hertfordshire , and massachusetts over a 16-month period from july 2005 and covered transactions made by credit and debit card dating as far back as december 2002 .
in its filing to the securities and exchange commission earlier this year , the group said it believed " the intruder had access to the decryption tool for the encryption software utilized by tjx " .
the firm had initially said that at least 45.7 million cards were exposed to potential fraud .
but it added that at least three-quarters of the affected cards had expired or data had been masked .

us researchers studied deforested land in mexico and found that soil levels of phosphorus , a key nutrient for plants , fell by 44 % after three growing cycles .
in the long-term , the land risked becoming so degraded that it would be uneconomic to farm , they added .
the findings appear in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences .
downward spiral the researchers from the university of virginia examined the disruption to the phosphorus -lrb- p -rrb- cycle in southern yucatan , where a dry tropical forest had been felled to become farmland .
" after three cultivation-fallow cycles , available soil p declines by 44 % , and one-time p inputs from biomass burning decline by 76 % from mature forest levels , " they wrote .
the team added that the lack of a forest 's canopy also resulted in hampering an area 's ability to replenish phosphorus levels .
" the decline in new p from atmospheric deposition creates a long-term negative ecosystem balance . "
the ongoing decline of the nutrient , which is a key component in the growth of organisms , triggered a " feedback " effect , they explained .
it could affect the growth of plants in the study area , and " may induce a shift to sparser vegetation " , they warned .
as well as the area 's ecosystem , the researchers added that local farmers were likely to be affected .
" without financial support to encourage the use of fertilisers , farmers could increase the fallow period , clear new land , or abandon agriculture for off-farm employment , " they wrote .
" -lsb- the farmers ' -rsb- response will determine the regional balance between forest loss and forest regrowth . "
