the tiny country is struggling to cope with the influx - camps are bursting at the seams and xenophobia is on the rise . three years ago , jonas set out to make the long and dangerous journey to europe from his home country , eritrea .
there was absolutely no reason to stay there , he said .
although jonas finished high school with good marks and had found a job working for an oil company , his wages in eritrea were n't nearly enough to feed his family . " my aim was to get to europe and get a better education and find a good job , " he said .
" eritreans are people without hope .
i wanted to have a chance in life , and i also wanted be able to give something back to my people . " life-threatening crossing but jonas did n't expect that the crossing would be so dangerous .
many of his fellow passengers fell overboard during the journey and were left to drown .
others died of starvation on board . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boat load of africans hang onto a tuna net after their vessel sank off malta 's coast jonas was on his way to italy , a common destination for boats leaving the coast of africa .
but as happens with many other unseaworthy vessels , his boat was picked up by a maritime patrol , and he ended up being interned in malta .
jonas was released after a year , and now lives in a church-run refugee center . filled to capacity nearly 2,000 african boat people arrived in malta last year . a former british colony located 100km -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- south of sicily and 200km north of libya , malta has 405,000 inhabitants packed into seven tiny islands .
it 's the second most densely populated country in the world , and it 's not happy about having to house illegal immigrants . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the numbers of rufugees arriving in malta are less than italy or spain , but are growing malta , however , has a comparatively liberal and humanitarian refugee policy .
those who receive a humanitarian residency permit - mainly given to people from countries affected by civil war and internal conflicts such as somalia - are allowed to live in refugee accommodation . under european union law , asylum seekers must stay in the european country they first arrive in .
although malta is so tiny , it is a sovereign member of the eu , so anyone who lands is stuck there . to avert further humanitarian crises , malta has proposed that migrants whose boats founder in non-eu waters would be distributed evenly among the 27 eu countries . " the situation right now is just a complete mess , " the maltese interior minister , tonio borg , said several months ago .
" it 's a free-for-all .
each year 600 immigrants are dying on the threshold of europe .
it is unbelievable that on the doorstep of europe we are having this tragic situation and not enough is being done . " malta has three internment camps , which have been damned by amnesty international and visiting members of the european parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somalian women wait at the balzan refugee center and for those africans lucky enough to live outside the camps , the relationship to the maltese themselves is difficult .
the country has virtually no history of immigration , and reported cases of xenophobia are on the increase . " there are no real possibilities of getting on , of getting more training .
even if you have skills , you ca n't use them here .
-lrb- on malta -rrb- , there 's only work for unskilled labor , " jonas said . many ocean journeys begin in mauritania the maltese government has said in the past that the country feels " alone and abandoned by the eu " on the issue of immigration .
but in the african country of mauritania , the government is also struggling to cope with the influx of immigrants hoping to travel onward to europe . mauritania sits in the north-west of the african continent and its port town of nouadhibou is one of the three main launching places for africans , primarily from ivory coast , ghana , burkina faso and benin , who dream of working in the eu . the town of nouadhibou is near a well known " porous " border crossing point , where " even though the border controls are good , customs officers can be ' persuaded ' , " according to a report on african migrations routes by david van moppes . but once the potential immigrants enter mauritania , it does n't always mean they can get a spot on a smuggler 's boat .
in order to close off the country 's 750 km of coastline , the spanish guardia civil provides mauritania with satellites , radar equipment , helicopters and fast boots to try . even if many of the want-to-be immigrants end up temporarily trapped in mauritania , their aim remains europe .
and even jonas in malta is n't at the end of his travels .

organic products have been on their supermarket shelves for years and this wider availability has had a positive impact on sales . the sector 's growth has been largely driven by supermarket sales , which make up almost half of the total number of organic retail sales in germany .
in 2006 the trade in organic food products in both specialized organic stores and regular supermarkets topped 4.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- . that growth has prompted many more players to enter the market , including well-established conventional food manufactures and supermarket chains . this has many of the traditional organic companies , some of whom have been in the business for decades , worried these new players might damage the industry . is it really organic ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even some packet puddings are organic in germany the organic food industry association , an umbrella group representing organic farming , retail and traders association , is warning companies wanting to cash in on the organics trade to beware when buying organic raw materials .
they said inexperience in recognizing organic products could lead to companies buying fakes . " the traditional producers know where and how to buy organic raw materials , whereas those who come freshly into the market will have more difficulties , " the association 's president , felix prinz zu löwenstein , said . one company with a lot of industry experience is bio zentrale - an all organic company that has been selling organic food products in germany for over 30 years . " conventional companies do n't have the experience - they might just believe the organic certificate .
but we analyse it and if we find traces of pesticides then we will send it back , " marc netten from bio-zentrale said . shortfall of organic raw materials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic was a feature at the anuga food fair in cologne part of the concern over the arrival of new organic products by conventional producers is driven by a shortage of organic raw materials .
currently the organic farming sector is not growing at the same rate as the demand for organic products .
a shortage in organic raw materials grown in germany has meant that producers have begun to look far and wide for new producers to keep up their demand . " to get organic wheat is very difficult at the moment .
usually we buy our oats in germany or austria but at the moment we are also buying them in australia , " netten said . " while they have a certificate from australia certifying them as organic , nobody knows what happens on the ship . " for this reason the company analyses the oats it buys in a lab .
this takes one to two weeks and is adds to their production costs but bio-zentrale said it is only through doing their own tests that they feel confident in certifying it as organic . conventional companies claim they 're capable conventional companies acknowledge the difficulties in purchasing organically grown goods at the moment . " our problem is to ensure that you get the quantities of raw materials that you need , " said dominik ahrer , director marketing and sales of frenzel austria frost .

the eit will have a governing body , a director and an executive committee , but will not be a new institute as such , eu ministers decided on friday , nov .
23 .
rather , it will network and pool resources from europe 's universities and will initially seek to focus research into three broad areas : energy , climate change and information technology .
the eu has earmarked 308.7 million euros -lrb- $ 455 million -rrb- for the functioning of the eit for a period of six years .
its budget has yet to receive final clearance , but eu officials expect the eit to be up and running some time in 2008 .
eu ministers meeting in brussels also agreed to set up four joint technology initiatives -lrb- jti -rrb- linking the private and public sector .
driven by industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : embedded computing systems are used in an increasing range of consumer products driven primarily by industry , the jtis will implement research programs in the fields of innovative medicines , nano-electronic technologies , aeronautics and air transport and embedded computing systems -lrb- invisible electronics and software used in cars and in an increasing range of consumer products -rrb- .
ministers also acknowledged the need to modernize europe 's universities and higher education institutions .
a report published this week by the european commission found that while productivity growth in the eu had gathered pace since 2005 , the 27-member bloc was likely to continue lagging behind the united states for years to come . insufficient investments in research , development and education were identified among the root causes for europe 's slow productivity growth .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 24.11.2007 tiny state of malta struggles to cope with illegal immigrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants often have ardous journeys behind them when they finally arrive on land hundreds of african boat people arrive on the shores of the eu 's smallest state , malta every year .
the tiny country is struggling to cope with the influx - camps are bursting at the seams and xenophobia is on the rise . three years ago , jonas set out to make the long and dangerous journey to europe from his home country , eritrea .
there was absolutely no reason to stay there , he said .
although jonas finished high school with good marks and had found a job working for an oil company , his wages in eritrea were n't nearly enough to feed his family . " my aim was to get to europe and get a better education and find a good job , " he said .
" eritreans are people without hope .
i wanted to have a chance in life , and i also wanted be able to give something back to my people . " life-threatening crossing but jonas did n't expect that the crossing would be so dangerous .
many of his fellow passengers fell overboard during the journey and were left to drown .
others died of starvation on board . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boat load of africans hang onto a tuna net after their vessel sank off malta 's coast jonas was on his way to italy , a common destination for boats leaving the coast of africa .
but as happens with many other unseaworthy vessels , his boat was picked up by a maritime patrol , and he ended up being interned in malta .
jonas was released after a year , and now lives in a church-run refugee center . filled to capacity nearly 2,000 african boat people arrived in malta last year . a former british colony located 100km -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- south of sicily and 200km north of libya , malta has 405,000 inhabitants packed into seven tiny islands .
it 's the second most densely populated country in the world , and it 's not happy about having to house illegal immigrants . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the numbers of rufugees arriving in malta are less than italy or spain , but are growing malta , however , has a comparatively liberal and humanitarian refugee policy .
those who receive a humanitarian residency permit - mainly given to people from countries affected by civil war and internal conflicts such as somalia - are allowed to live in refugee accommodation . under european union law , asylum seekers must stay in the european country they first arrive in .
although malta is so tiny , it is a sovereign member of the eu , so anyone who lands is stuck there . to avert further humanitarian crises , malta has proposed that migrants whose boats founder in non-eu waters would be distributed evenly among the 27 eu countries . " the situation right now is just a complete mess , " the maltese interior minister , tonio borg , said several months ago .
" it 's a free-for-all .
each year 600 immigrants are dying on the threshold of europe .
it is unbelievable that on the doorstep of europe we are having this tragic situation and not enough is being done . " malta has three internment camps , which have been damned by amnesty international and visiting members of the european parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somalian women wait at the balzan refugee center and for those africans lucky enough to live outside the camps , the relationship to the maltese themselves is difficult .
the country has virtually no history of immigration , and reported cases of xenophobia are on the increase . " there are no real possibilities of getting on , of getting more training .

they admire his iron rule , and the way he goes fishing topless .
but is it the real putin they know ? the images of putin at the eu-russian summit in samara which went around the world in may fast became iconic .
in his natty shades , black designer suit and knowing smile , he came across less like a democratically elected president and more like a professional hit man . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " for putin " reads this giant poster in moscow but icy efficiency seems to be exactly what putin wants to convey .
over the years , he 's learnt that cutting a telegenic dash through the world media is an effective way of showing what a tough guy he is . no doubt with this principle in mind , he made headlines in august when he took a brief break from running the country to go fishing in siberia with prince albert of monaco , abandoning the formal suits in favor of some camouflage chic .
the president then wasted no time stripping down to the waist , showing off a remarkably trim physique for a man of his years . although his antics met with plenty of raised eyebrows in the uptight west , this sort of macho posturing is not so much laughed at as admired back home in russia . " -lsb- putin -rsb- likes to profile himself as a protector , a strong man who 's also very sensible , " says russia expert hans-henning schröder from the foundation for science and politics .
" he embodies everything a russian woman wants in a man . " no one to trust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's more serious side in reality , his image as russia 's knight in shining armor is wishful thinking .
the country has no one it can trust - which is why it 's not so surprising that 70 percent of the public named the president in a recent survey of the most trustworthy institutions . only eight percent said they had faith in the unions , 15 percent in the judicial system and just 10 percent in political parties . " this is to be expected , " said schröder .
" the parties change every year and many of them are more likely to be imposed from above than be genuine representatives of the people .
the unions do n't care about the public and the judicial system is corrupt . " in contrast , putin must seem like a guardian angel , seen to have guided his people through the turmoil of the 1990s to moderate prosperity and helping secure the country a place within the new world order . " in fact , putin can not take the credit for this prosperity , " points out falk bomsdorf from the friedrich naumann foundation in moscow .
" it is largely due to the steep rise in oil prices .
but no one seems to care . " " national leader " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president or hit man ?
but the russians have undoubtedly never had it as good as under putin .
in the last eight years , wages have grown 50 percent , and the country has seen a slow but sure emergence of the middle class . " a class of small and medium-sized entrepreneurs has arisen which never existed before putin , " points out thomas kunze , who used to work at the konrad adenauer foundation in russia .
" they have a vested interest in his remaining in power . " as hans-henning schröder observed , few russians could live off their wages under putin 's predecessor boris yeltsin . " old people without pensions simply died .
back then , people had to fight to survive , " he said . unlike in germany after the second world war , democracy and a free market economy failed to result in an immediate boost to the standard of living in russia , he explained .
but life improved once putin began centralizing the economy . to many , he is still the only man able to run the show , which is why russia 's dominant united russia party has published a blueprint for formalizing the status of president vladimir putin as " national leader " after he steps down as president next year . indecisive bildunterschrift : a series of political rallies have cast the popular president as an indispensable leader schröder , however , believes that putin 's public image belies the truth of a far more indecisive character . uncompromising as he is on the world stage , putin is actually strikingly ineffective at home . " my impression is that putin has never been very assertive and has seldom made difficult decisions , " he points out . in the last four years , he has steered well clear of controversial issues such as health reforms .
in 2005 he hastily backed down on plans for social reform as soon as a few demonstrators took to the streets .
five years ago , he showed similar weakness when he refrained from intervening in a public spat between his defense minister and the head of the general staff over security policy . " had such an argument happened in germany , one of them would have been fired immediately , if not both , " said schröder . so why do the russians still love him ?
perhaps it 's because the putin approach is one that many of the more apolitical members of the population can identify with .
but , according to schröder , the president is by no means a typical russian . " he 's more typically german than russian , " he said .
" a typical russian has a bit more soul and likes to party more than he does . " manfred götzke -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" a class of small and medium-sized entrepreneurs has arisen which never existed before putin , " points out thomas kunze , who used to work at the konrad adenauer foundation in russia .
" they have a vested interest in his remaining in power . " as hans-henning schröder observed , few russians could live off their wages under putin 's predecessor boris yeltsin . " old people without pensions simply died .
back then , people had to fight to survive , " he said . unlike in germany after the second world war , democracy and a free market economy failed to result in an immediate boost to the standard of living in russia , he explained .
but life improved once putin began centralizing the economy . to many , he is still the only man able to run the show , which is why russia 's dominant united russia party has published a blueprint for formalizing the status of president vladimir putin as " national leader " after he steps down as president next year . indecisive bildunterschrift : a series of political rallies have cast the popular president as an indispensable leader schröder , however , believes that putin 's public image belies the truth of a far more indecisive character . uncompromising as he is on the world stage , putin is actually strikingly ineffective at home . " my impression is that putin has never been very assertive and has seldom made difficult decisions , " he points out . in the last four years , he has steered well clear of controversial issues such as health reforms .
in 2005 he hastily backed down on plans for social reform as soon as a few demonstrators took to the streets .
five years ago , he showed similar weakness when he refrained from intervening in a public spat between his defense minister and the head of the general staff over security policy . " had such an argument happened in germany , one of them would have been fired immediately , if not both , " said schröder . so why do the russians still love him ?
perhaps it 's because the putin approach is one that many of the more apolitical members of the population can identify with .
but , according to schröder , the president is by no means a typical russian . " he 's more typically german than russian , " he said .

the eu has earmarked 308.7 million euros -lrb- $ 455 million -rrb- for the functioning of the eit for a period of six years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : russian parliamentary elections putin 's party wins russia elections amid vote-rigging claims kremlin takes heat from the west following dubious election opinion : democracy biggest loser in russian elections germany 's merkel criticizes lack of observers in russian poll russia -pipe- 24.11.2007 macho but indecisive , putin is all russia 's got großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you know you 're in safe hands with a leader like this the russians love their president .
they admire his iron rule , and the way he goes fishing topless .
but is it the real putin they know ? the images of putin at the eu-russian summit in samara which went around the world in may fast became iconic .
in his natty shades , black designer suit and knowing smile , he came across less like a democratically elected president and more like a professional hit man . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " for putin " reads this giant poster in moscow but icy efficiency seems to be exactly what putin wants to convey .
over the years , he 's learnt that cutting a telegenic dash through the world media is an effective way of showing what a tough guy he is . no doubt with this principle in mind , he made headlines in august when he took a brief break from running the country to go fishing in siberia with prince albert of monaco , abandoning the formal suits in favor of some camouflage chic .
the president then wasted no time stripping down to the waist , showing off a remarkably trim physique for a man of his years . although his antics met with plenty of raised eyebrows in the uptight west , this sort of macho posturing is not so much laughed at as admired back home in russia . " -lsb- putin -rsb- likes to profile himself as a protector , a strong man who 's also very sensible , " says russia expert hans-henning schröder from the foundation for science and politics .
" he embodies everything a russian woman wants in a man . " no one to trust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's more serious side in reality , his image as russia 's knight in shining armor is wishful thinking .
the country has no one it can trust - which is why it 's not so surprising that 70 percent of the public named the president in a recent survey of the most trustworthy institutions . only eight percent said they had faith in the unions , 15 percent in the judicial system and just 10 percent in political parties . " this is to be expected , " said schröder .
" the parties change every year and many of them are more likely to be imposed from above than be genuine representatives of the people .
the unions do n't care about the public and the judicial system is corrupt . " in contrast , putin must seem like a guardian angel , seen to have guided his people through the turmoil of the 1990s to moderate prosperity and helping secure the country a place within the new world order . " in fact , putin can not take the credit for this prosperity , " points out falk bomsdorf from the friedrich naumann foundation in moscow .
" it is largely due to the steep rise in oil prices .
but no one seems to care . " " national leader " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president or hit man ?
but the russians have undoubtedly never had it as good as under putin .
in the last eight years , wages have grown 50 percent , and the country has seen a slow but sure emergence of the middle class . " a class of small and medium-sized entrepreneurs has arisen which never existed before putin , " points out thomas kunze , who used to work at the konrad adenauer foundation in russia .
" they have a vested interest in his remaining in power . " as hans-henning schröder observed , few russians could live off their wages under putin 's predecessor boris yeltsin . " old people without pensions simply died .
back then , people had to fight to survive , " he said . unlike in germany after the second world war , democracy and a free market economy failed to result in an immediate boost to the standard of living in russia , he explained .
but life improved once putin began centralizing the economy . to many , he is still the only man able to run the show , which is why russia 's dominant united russia party has published a blueprint for formalizing the status of president vladimir putin as " national leader " after he steps down as president next year . indecisive bildunterschrift : a series of political rallies have cast the popular president as an indispensable leader schröder , however , believes that putin 's public image belies the truth of a far more indecisive character . uncompromising as he is on the world stage , putin is actually strikingly ineffective at home . " my impression is that putin has never been very assertive and has seldom made difficult decisions , " he points out . in the last four years , he has steered well clear of controversial issues such as health reforms .
in 2005 he hastily backed down on plans for social reform as soon as a few demonstrators took to the streets .
five years ago , he showed similar weakness when he refrained from intervening in a public spat between his defense minister and the head of the general staff over security policy . " had such an argument happened in germany , one of them would have been fired immediately , if not both , " said schröder . so why do the russians still love him ?
perhaps it 's because the putin approach is one that many of the more apolitical members of the population can identify with .
but , according to schröder , the president is by no means a typical russian . " he 's more typically german than russian , " he said .
" a typical russian has a bit more soul and likes to party more than he does . " manfred götzke -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they admire his iron rule , and the way he goes fishing topless .
but is it the real putin they know ? the images of putin at the eu-russian summit in samara which went around the world in may fast became iconic .
in his natty shades , black designer suit and knowing smile , he came across less like a democratically elected president and more like a professional hit man . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " for putin " reads this giant poster in moscow but icy efficiency seems to be exactly what putin wants to convey .
over the years , he 's learnt that cutting a telegenic dash through the world media is an effective way of showing what a tough guy he is . no doubt with this principle in mind , he made headlines in august when he took a brief break from running the country to go fishing in siberia with prince albert of monaco , abandoning the formal suits in favor of some camouflage chic .
the president then wasted no time stripping down to the waist , showing off a remarkably trim physique for a man of his years . although his antics met with plenty of raised eyebrows in the uptight west , this sort of macho posturing is not so much laughed at as admired back home in russia . " -lsb- putin -rsb- likes to profile himself as a protector , a strong man who 's also very sensible , " says russia expert hans-henning schröder from the foundation for science and politics .
" he embodies everything a russian woman wants in a man . " no one to trust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's more serious side in reality , his image as russia 's knight in shining armor is wishful thinking .
the country has no one it can trust - which is why it 's not so surprising that 70 percent of the public named the president in a recent survey of the most trustworthy institutions . only eight percent said they had faith in the unions , 15 percent in the judicial system and just 10 percent in political parties . " this is to be expected , " said schröder .
" the parties change every year and many of them are more likely to be imposed from above than be genuine representatives of the people .
the unions do n't care about the public and the judicial system is corrupt . " in contrast , putin must seem like a guardian angel , seen to have guided his people through the turmoil of the 1990s to moderate prosperity and helping secure the country a place within the new world order . " in fact , putin can not take the credit for this prosperity , " points out falk bomsdorf from the friedrich naumann foundation in moscow .
" it is largely due to the steep rise in oil prices .
but no one seems to care . " " national leader " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president or hit man ?
but the russians have undoubtedly never had it as good as under putin .
in the last eight years , wages have grown 50 percent , and the country has seen a slow but sure emergence of the middle class . " a class of small and medium-sized entrepreneurs has arisen which never existed before putin , " points out thomas kunze , who used to work at the konrad adenauer foundation in russia .
" they have a vested interest in his remaining in power . " as hans-henning schröder observed , few russians could live off their wages under putin 's predecessor boris yeltsin . " old people without pensions simply died .
back then , people had to fight to survive , " he said . unlike in germany after the second world war , democracy and a free market economy failed to result in an immediate boost to the standard of living in russia , he explained .
but life improved once putin began centralizing the economy . to many , he is still the only man able to run the show , which is why russia 's dominant united russia party has published a blueprint for formalizing the status of president vladimir putin as " national leader " after he steps down as president next year . indecisive bildunterschrift : a series of political rallies have cast the popular president as an indispensable leader schröder , however , believes that putin 's public image belies the truth of a far more indecisive character . uncompromising as he is on the world stage , putin is actually strikingly ineffective at home . " my impression is that putin has never been very assertive and has seldom made difficult decisions , " he points out . in the last four years , he has steered well clear of controversial issues such as health reforms .
in 2005 he hastily backed down on plans for social reform as soon as a few demonstrators took to the streets .
five years ago , he showed similar weakness when he refrained from intervening in a public spat between his defense minister and the head of the general staff over security policy . " had such an argument happened in germany , one of them would have been fired immediately , if not both , " said schröder . so why do the russians still love him ?
perhaps it 's because the putin approach is one that many of the more apolitical members of the population can identify with .
but , according to schröder , the president is by no means a typical russian . " he 's more typically german than russian , " he said .

the eit will have a governing body , a director and an executive committee , but will not be a new institute as such , eu ministers decided on friday , nov .
23 .
rather , it will network and pool resources from europe 's universities and will initially seek to focus research into three broad areas : energy , climate change and information technology .
the eu has earmarked 308.7 million euros -lrb- $ 455 million -rrb- for the functioning of the eit for a period of six years .
its budget has yet to receive final clearance , but eu officials expect the eit to be up and running some time in 2008 .
eu ministers meeting in brussels also agreed to set up four joint technology initiatives -lrb- jti -rrb- linking the private and public sector .
driven by industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : embedded computing systems are used in an increasing range of consumer products driven primarily by industry , the jtis will implement research programs in the fields of innovative medicines , nano-electronic technologies , aeronautics and air transport and embedded computing systems -lrb- invisible electronics and software used in cars and in an increasing range of consumer products -rrb- .
ministers also acknowledged the need to modernize europe 's universities and higher education institutions .
a report published this week by the european commission found that while productivity growth in the eu had gathered pace since 2005 , the 27-member bloc was likely to continue lagging behind the united states for years to come . insufficient investments in research , development and education were identified among the root causes for europe 's slow productivity growth .
on thursday , eu ministers made only limited progress in establishing an eu-wide patent system .
the initiative has stalled for years , in part because italy and spain want eu patents to be published in italian and spanish as well . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : russian parliamentary elections putin 's party wins russia elections amid vote-rigging claims kremlin takes heat from the west following dubious election opinion : democracy biggest loser in russian elections germany 's merkel criticizes lack of observers in russian poll russia -pipe- 24.11.2007 macho but indecisive , putin is all russia 's got großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you know you 're in safe hands with a leader like this the russians love their president .
they admire his iron rule , and the way he goes fishing topless .
but is it the real putin they know ? the images of putin at the eu-russian summit in samara which went around the world in may fast became iconic .
in his natty shades , black designer suit and knowing smile , he came across less like a democratically elected president and more like a professional hit man . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " for putin " reads this giant poster in moscow but icy efficiency seems to be exactly what putin wants to convey .
over the years , he 's learnt that cutting a telegenic dash through the world media is an effective way of showing what a tough guy he is . no doubt with this principle in mind , he made headlines in august when he took a brief break from running the country to go fishing in siberia with prince albert of monaco , abandoning the formal suits in favor of some camouflage chic .
the president then wasted no time stripping down to the waist , showing off a remarkably trim physique for a man of his years . although his antics met with plenty of raised eyebrows in the uptight west , this sort of macho posturing is not so much laughed at as admired back home in russia . " -lsb- putin -rsb- likes to profile himself as a protector , a strong man who 's also very sensible , " says russia expert hans-henning schröder from the foundation for science and politics .
" he embodies everything a russian woman wants in a man . " no one to trust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's more serious side in reality , his image as russia 's knight in shining armor is wishful thinking .
the country has no one it can trust - which is why it 's not so surprising that 70 percent of the public named the president in a recent survey of the most trustworthy institutions . only eight percent said they had faith in the unions , 15 percent in the judicial system and just 10 percent in political parties . " this is to be expected , " said schröder .
" the parties change every year and many of them are more likely to be imposed from above than be genuine representatives of the people .
the unions do n't care about the public and the judicial system is corrupt . " in contrast , putin must seem like a guardian angel , seen to have guided his people through the turmoil of the 1990s to moderate prosperity and helping secure the country a place within the new world order . " in fact , putin can not take the credit for this prosperity , " points out falk bomsdorf from the friedrich naumann foundation in moscow .
" it is largely due to the steep rise in oil prices .
but no one seems to care . " " national leader " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president or hit man ?
but the russians have undoubtedly never had it as good as under putin .
in the last eight years , wages have grown 50 percent , and the country has seen a slow but sure emergence of the middle class . " a class of small and medium-sized entrepreneurs has arisen which never existed before putin , " points out thomas kunze , who used to work at the konrad adenauer foundation in russia .
" they have a vested interest in his remaining in power . " as hans-henning schröder observed , few russians could live off their wages under putin 's predecessor boris yeltsin . " old people without pensions simply died .
back then , people had to fight to survive , " he said . unlike in germany after the second world war , democracy and a free market economy failed to result in an immediate boost to the standard of living in russia , he explained .
but life improved once putin began centralizing the economy . to many , he is still the only man able to run the show , which is why russia 's dominant united russia party has published a blueprint for formalizing the status of president vladimir putin as " national leader " after he steps down as president next year . indecisive bildunterschrift : a series of political rallies have cast the popular president as an indispensable leader schröder , however , believes that putin 's public image belies the truth of a far more indecisive character . uncompromising as he is on the world stage , putin is actually strikingly ineffective at home . " my impression is that putin has never been very assertive and has seldom made difficult decisions , " he points out . in the last four years , he has steered well clear of controversial issues such as health reforms .
in 2005 he hastily backed down on plans for social reform as soon as a few demonstrators took to the streets .
five years ago , he showed similar weakness when he refrained from intervening in a public spat between his defense minister and the head of the general staff over security policy . " had such an argument happened in germany , one of them would have been fired immediately , if not both , " said schröder . so why do the russians still love him ?
perhaps it 's because the putin approach is one that many of the more apolitical members of the population can identify with .
but , according to schröder , the president is by no means a typical russian . " he 's more typically german than russian , " he said .
" a typical russian has a bit more soul and likes to party more than he does . " manfred götzke -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 24.11.2007 organic firms fear newcomers will ruin their reputation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some coventional food companies are eager to jump on the organic wagon some traditional organic companies in germany are worried that their reputation could easily be spoiled by inexperienced newcomers on the rapidly growing market . organic is nothing unusual for german consumers .
organic products have been on their supermarket shelves for years and this wider availability has had a positive impact on sales . the sector 's growth has been largely driven by supermarket sales , which make up almost half of the total number of organic retail sales in germany .
in 2006 the trade in organic food products in both specialized organic stores and regular supermarkets topped 4.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- . that growth has prompted many more players to enter the market , including well-established conventional food manufactures and supermarket chains . this has many of the traditional organic companies , some of whom have been in the business for decades , worried these new players might damage the industry . is it really organic ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even some packet puddings are organic in germany the organic food industry association , an umbrella group representing organic farming , retail and traders association , is warning companies wanting to cash in on the organics trade to beware when buying organic raw materials .
they said inexperience in recognizing organic products could lead to companies buying fakes . " the traditional producers know where and how to buy organic raw materials , whereas those who come freshly into the market will have more difficulties , " the association 's president , felix prinz zu löwenstein , said . one company with a lot of industry experience is bio zentrale - an all organic company that has been selling organic food products in germany for over 30 years . " conventional companies do n't have the experience - they might just believe the organic certificate .
but we analyse it and if we find traces of pesticides then we will send it back , " marc netten from bio-zentrale said . shortfall of organic raw materials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic was a feature at the anuga food fair in cologne part of the concern over the arrival of new organic products by conventional producers is driven by a shortage of organic raw materials .
currently the organic farming sector is not growing at the same rate as the demand for organic products .
a shortage in organic raw materials grown in germany has meant that producers have begun to look far and wide for new producers to keep up their demand . " to get organic wheat is very difficult at the moment .
usually we buy our oats in germany or austria but at the moment we are also buying them in australia , " netten said . " while they have a certificate from australia certifying them as organic , nobody knows what happens on the ship . " for this reason the company analyses the oats it buys in a lab .
this takes one to two weeks and is adds to their production costs but bio-zentrale said it is only through doing their own tests that they feel confident in certifying it as organic . conventional companies claim they 're capable conventional companies acknowledge the difficulties in purchasing organically grown goods at the moment . " our problem is to ensure that you get the quantities of raw materials that you need , " said dominik ahrer , director marketing and sales of frenzel austria frost .
" our customers say they want organic .
the problem is not the price , it is getting the product so you have to make early contact . " frenzel austria frost is a conventional food company that has turned organic .
they produce over 100,000 tons of vegetables and ready meals per year , including an organic range of products sold in german supermarkets . the company denied they are at risk of buying non-organic materials by mistake because they " control the whole process from growing the crop to production to quality control by management , " ahrer said . organic standards the same as other food regulations according to conventional food companies that have gone organic , adhering to the strict organic certification guidelines is no different from the regulations they follow for other food certification schemes and other food standards . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic frozen pretzels " our company has been certified with a variety of quality standards for several years already , " said kurt hassinger from the pretzel-baking company ditsch .
" we have the ifs , brc and organic certificates .
just to get these certifications we have to ensure that our raw materials , production process , etc. are in order and properly documented . " major pretzel-producer ditsch , which sell pretzel products in chain stores and supermarkets throughout germany , started experimenting with organic products in late 2006 .
they intend to introduce a range of organic home-bake products , including pretzels , to german supermarkets in mid-2008 . " since there are only a limited number of pretzel producers in germany and we 've specialized in this area , there are very few competitors that can offer organic products of a similarly high quality .
in addition , our retail customers want these products to make their customers happy , " hassinger said . if you do organic , do it right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some lucky dogs get to eat organic the industry does n't want to discourage new players , nor does it want to stop major conventional food companies from going organic .
what it does want to do , according to the löwenstein , is to make sure that companies do it the right way without ruining it for everyone else . " companies participating in the market without experience could spoil the consumer 's trust in organic food by not working properly , " löwenstein said .
" this is because the consumers will maybe not make a difference between different sectors of the industry . " it 's a claim echoed by bio-zentrale .
" this can damage the whole organic market .
the customer doesn ’ t say one company is okay and one is not - they just think of them all together , " netten said . good partnerships the key the buying of raw organic materials from unknown growers , especially overseas , does pose problems in guaranteeing the product is organic .
for this reason the association wants to encourage partnerships between companies and growers . " i think partnership is a very important word because you have to know who you are dealing with , " löwenstein said . the association currently has action plans in place to assist conventional producers in going organic .

organic products have been on their supermarket shelves for years and this wider availability has had a positive impact on sales . the sector 's growth has been largely driven by supermarket sales , which make up almost half of the total number of organic retail sales in germany .
in 2006 the trade in organic food products in both specialized organic stores and regular supermarkets topped 4.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- . that growth has prompted many more players to enter the market , including well-established conventional food manufactures and supermarket chains . this has many of the traditional organic companies , some of whom have been in the business for decades , worried these new players might damage the industry . is it really organic ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even some packet puddings are organic in germany the organic food industry association , an umbrella group representing organic farming , retail and traders association , is warning companies wanting to cash in on the organics trade to beware when buying organic raw materials .
they said inexperience in recognizing organic products could lead to companies buying fakes .

usually we buy our oats in germany or austria but at the moment we are also buying them in australia , " netten said . " while they have a certificate from australia certifying them as organic , nobody knows what happens on the ship . " for this reason the company analyses the oats it buys in a lab .
this takes one to two weeks and is adds to their production costs but bio-zentrale said it is only through doing their own tests that they feel confident in certifying it as organic . conventional companies claim they 're capable conventional companies acknowledge the difficulties in purchasing organically grown goods at the moment .

" since there are only a limited number of pretzel producers in germany and we 've specialized in this area , there are very few competitors that can offer organic products of a similarly high quality .

the eit will have a governing body , a director and an executive committee , but will not be a new institute as such , eu ministers decided on friday , nov .

rather , it will network and pool resources from europe 's universities and will initially seek to focus research into three broad areas : energy , climate change and information technology .
the eu has earmarked 308.7 million euros -lrb- $ 455 million -rrb- for the functioning of the eit for a period of six years .
its budget has yet to receive final clearance , but eu officials expect the eit to be up and running some time in 2008 .

ministers also acknowledged the need to modernize europe 's universities and higher education institutions .
a report published this week by the european commission found that while productivity growth in the eu had gathered pace since 2005 , the 27-member bloc was likely to continue lagging behind the united states for years to come . insufficient investments in research , development and education were identified among the root causes for europe 's slow productivity growth .
on thursday , eu ministers made only limited progress in establishing an eu-wide patent system .
the initiative has stalled for years , in part because italy and spain want eu patents to be published in italian and spanish as well . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 24.11.2007 tiny state of malta struggles to cope with illegal immigrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants often have ardous journeys behind them when they finally arrive on land hundreds of african boat people arrive on the shores of the eu 's smallest state , malta every year .
the tiny country is struggling to cope with the influx - camps are bursting at the seams and xenophobia is on the rise . three years ago , jonas set out to make the long and dangerous journey to europe from his home country , eritrea .
there was absolutely no reason to stay there , he said .
although jonas finished high school with good marks and had found a job working for an oil company , his wages in eritrea were n't nearly enough to feed his family . " my aim was to get to europe and get a better education and find a good job , " he said .
" eritreans are people without hope .
i wanted to have a chance in life , and i also wanted be able to give something back to my people . " life-threatening crossing but jonas did n't expect that the crossing would be so dangerous .
many of his fellow passengers fell overboard during the journey and were left to drown .
others died of starvation on board . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boat load of africans hang onto a tuna net after their vessel sank off malta 's coast jonas was on his way to italy , a common destination for boats leaving the coast of africa .
but as happens with many other unseaworthy vessels , his boat was picked up by a maritime patrol , and he ended up being interned in malta .
jonas was released after a year , and now lives in a church-run refugee center . filled to capacity nearly 2,000 african boat people arrived in malta last year . a former british colony located 100km -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- south of sicily and 200km north of libya , malta has 405,000 inhabitants packed into seven tiny islands .
it 's the second most densely populated country in the world , and it 's not happy about having to house illegal immigrants . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the numbers of rufugees arriving in malta are less than italy or spain , but are growing malta , however , has a comparatively liberal and humanitarian refugee policy .
those who receive a humanitarian residency permit - mainly given to people from countries affected by civil war and internal conflicts such as somalia - are allowed to live in refugee accommodation . under european union law , asylum seekers must stay in the european country they first arrive in .
although malta is so tiny , it is a sovereign member of the eu , so anyone who lands is stuck there . to avert further humanitarian crises , malta has proposed that migrants whose boats founder in non-eu waters would be distributed evenly among the 27 eu countries . " the situation right now is just a complete mess , " the maltese interior minister , tonio borg , said several months ago .
" it 's a free-for-all .
each year 600 immigrants are dying on the threshold of europe .
it is unbelievable that on the doorstep of europe we are having this tragic situation and not enough is being done . " malta has three internment camps , which have been damned by amnesty international and visiting members of the european parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somalian women wait at the balzan refugee center and for those africans lucky enough to live outside the camps , the relationship to the maltese themselves is difficult .
the country has virtually no history of immigration , and reported cases of xenophobia are on the increase . " there are no real possibilities of getting on , of getting more training .
even if you have skills , you ca n't use them here .
-lrb- on malta -rrb- , there 's only work for unskilled labor , " jonas said . many ocean journeys begin in mauritania the maltese government has said in the past that the country feels " alone and abandoned by the eu " on the issue of immigration .
but in the african country of mauritania , the government is also struggling to cope with the influx of immigrants hoping to travel onward to europe . mauritania sits in the north-west of the african continent and its port town of nouadhibou is one of the three main launching places for africans , primarily from ivory coast , ghana , burkina faso and benin , who dream of working in the eu . the town of nouadhibou is near a well known " porous " border crossing point , where " even though the border controls are good , customs officers can be ' persuaded ' , " according to a report on african migrations routes by david van moppes . but once the potential immigrants enter mauritania , it does n't always mean they can get a spot on a smuggler 's boat .
in order to close off the country 's 750 km of coastline , the spanish guardia civil provides mauritania with satellites , radar equipment , helicopters and fast boots to try . even if many of the want-to-be immigrants end up temporarily trapped in mauritania , their aim remains europe .
and even jonas in malta is n't at the end of his travels .
he refuses to give up his idea of a better life somewhere else in europe . ute schaeffer -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eit will have a governing body , a director and an executive committee , but will not be a new institute as such , eu ministers decided on friday , nov .
23 .
rather , it will network and pool resources from europe 's universities and will initially seek to focus research into three broad areas : energy , climate change and information technology .
the eu has earmarked 308.7 million euros -lrb- $ 455 million -rrb- for the functioning of the eit for a period of six years .
its budget has yet to receive final clearance , but eu officials expect the eit to be up and running some time in 2008 .
eu ministers meeting in brussels also agreed to set up four joint technology initiatives -lrb- jti -rrb- linking the private and public sector .
driven by industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : embedded computing systems are used in an increasing range of consumer products driven primarily by industry , the jtis will implement research programs in the fields of innovative medicines , nano-electronic technologies , aeronautics and air transport and embedded computing systems -lrb- invisible electronics and software used in cars and in an increasing range of consumer products -rrb- .
ministers also acknowledged the need to modernize europe 's universities and higher education institutions .
a report published this week by the european commission found that while productivity growth in the eu had gathered pace since 2005 , the 27-member bloc was likely to continue lagging behind the united states for years to come . insufficient investments in research , development and education were identified among the root causes for europe 's slow productivity growth .
on thursday , eu ministers made only limited progress in establishing an eu-wide patent system .
the initiative has stalled for years , in part because italy and spain want eu patents to be published in italian and spanish as well . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they admire his iron rule , and the way he goes fishing topless .
but is it the real putin they know ? the images of putin at the eu-russian summit in samara which went around the world in may fast became iconic .
in his natty shades , black designer suit and knowing smile , he came across less like a democratically elected president and more like a professional hit man . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " for putin " reads this giant poster in moscow but icy efficiency seems to be exactly what putin wants to convey .
over the years , he 's learnt that cutting a telegenic dash through the world media is an effective way of showing what a tough guy he is . no doubt with this principle in mind , he made headlines in august when he took a brief break from running the country to go fishing in siberia with prince albert of monaco , abandoning the formal suits in favor of some camouflage chic .
the president then wasted no time stripping down to the waist , showing off a remarkably trim physique for a man of his years . although his antics met with plenty of raised eyebrows in the uptight west , this sort of macho posturing is not so much laughed at as admired back home in russia . " -lsb- putin -rsb- likes to profile himself as a protector , a strong man who 's also very sensible , " says russia expert hans-henning schröder from the foundation for science and politics .
" he embodies everything a russian woman wants in a man . " no one to trust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's more serious side in reality , his image as russia 's knight in shining armor is wishful thinking .
the country has no one it can trust - which is why it 's not so surprising that 70 percent of the public named the president in a recent survey of the most trustworthy institutions . only eight percent said they had faith in the unions , 15 percent in the judicial system and just 10 percent in political parties . " this is to be expected , " said schröder .
" the parties change every year and many of them are more likely to be imposed from above than be genuine representatives of the people .
the unions do n't care about the public and the judicial system is corrupt . " in contrast , putin must seem like a guardian angel , seen to have guided his people through the turmoil of the 1990s to moderate prosperity and helping secure the country a place within the new world order . " in fact , putin can not take the credit for this prosperity , " points out falk bomsdorf from the friedrich naumann foundation in moscow .
" it is largely due to the steep rise in oil prices .
but no one seems to care . " " national leader " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president or hit man ?
but the russians have undoubtedly never had it as good as under putin .
in the last eight years , wages have grown 50 percent , and the country has seen a slow but sure emergence of the middle class . " a class of small and medium-sized entrepreneurs has arisen which never existed before putin , " points out thomas kunze , who used to work at the konrad adenauer foundation in russia .
" they have a vested interest in his remaining in power . " as hans-henning schröder observed , few russians could live off their wages under putin 's predecessor boris yeltsin . " old people without pensions simply died .
back then , people had to fight to survive , " he said . unlike in germany after the second world war , democracy and a free market economy failed to result in an immediate boost to the standard of living in russia , he explained .
but life improved once putin began centralizing the economy . to many , he is still the only man able to run the show , which is why russia 's dominant united russia party has published a blueprint for formalizing the status of president vladimir putin as " national leader " after he steps down as president next year . indecisive bildunterschrift : a series of political rallies have cast the popular president as an indispensable leader schröder , however , believes that putin 's public image belies the truth of a far more indecisive character . uncompromising as he is on the world stage , putin is actually strikingly ineffective at home . " my impression is that putin has never been very assertive and has seldom made difficult decisions , " he points out . in the last four years , he has steered well clear of controversial issues such as health reforms .
in 2005 he hastily backed down on plans for social reform as soon as a few demonstrators took to the streets .
five years ago , he showed similar weakness when he refrained from intervening in a public spat between his defense minister and the head of the general staff over security policy . " had such an argument happened in germany , one of them would have been fired immediately , if not both , " said schröder . so why do the russians still love him ?
perhaps it 's because the putin approach is one that many of the more apolitical members of the population can identify with .
but , according to schröder , the president is by no means a typical russian . " he 's more typically german than russian , " he said .
" a typical russian has a bit more soul and likes to party more than he does . " manfred götzke -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the tiny country is struggling to cope with the influx - camps are bursting at the seams and xenophobia is on the rise . three years ago , jonas set out to make the long and dangerous journey to europe from his home country , eritrea .
there was absolutely no reason to stay there , he said .
although jonas finished high school with good marks and had found a job working for an oil company , his wages in eritrea were n't nearly enough to feed his family . " my aim was to get to europe and get a better education and find a good job , " he said .
" eritreans are people without hope .
i wanted to have a chance in life , and i also wanted be able to give something back to my people . " life-threatening crossing but jonas did n't expect that the crossing would be so dangerous .
many of his fellow passengers fell overboard during the journey and were left to drown .
others died of starvation on board . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boat load of africans hang onto a tuna net after their vessel sank off malta 's coast jonas was on his way to italy , a common destination for boats leaving the coast of africa .
but as happens with many other unseaworthy vessels , his boat was picked up by a maritime patrol , and he ended up being interned in malta .
jonas was released after a year , and now lives in a church-run refugee center . filled to capacity nearly 2,000 african boat people arrived in malta last year . a former british colony located 100km -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- south of sicily and 200km north of libya , malta has 405,000 inhabitants packed into seven tiny islands .
it 's the second most densely populated country in the world , and it 's not happy about having to house illegal immigrants . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the numbers of rufugees arriving in malta are less than italy or spain , but are growing malta , however , has a comparatively liberal and humanitarian refugee policy .
those who receive a humanitarian residency permit - mainly given to people from countries affected by civil war and internal conflicts such as somalia - are allowed to live in refugee accommodation . under european union law , asylum seekers must stay in the european country they first arrive in .
although malta is so tiny , it is a sovereign member of the eu , so anyone who lands is stuck there . to avert further humanitarian crises , malta has proposed that migrants whose boats founder in non-eu waters would be distributed evenly among the 27 eu countries . " the situation right now is just a complete mess , " the maltese interior minister , tonio borg , said several months ago .
" it 's a free-for-all .
each year 600 immigrants are dying on the threshold of europe .
it is unbelievable that on the doorstep of europe we are having this tragic situation and not enough is being done . " malta has three internment camps , which have been damned by amnesty international and visiting members of the european parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somalian women wait at the balzan refugee center and for those africans lucky enough to live outside the camps , the relationship to the maltese themselves is difficult .
the country has virtually no history of immigration , and reported cases of xenophobia are on the increase . " there are no real possibilities of getting on , of getting more training .
even if you have skills , you ca n't use them here .
-lrb- on malta -rrb- , there 's only work for unskilled labor , " jonas said . many ocean journeys begin in mauritania the maltese government has said in the past that the country feels " alone and abandoned by the eu " on the issue of immigration .

the country has no one it can trust - which is why it 's not so surprising that 70 percent of the public named the president in a recent survey of the most trustworthy institutions . only eight percent said they had faith in the unions , 15 percent in the judicial system and just 10 percent in political parties .

" my impression is that putin has never been very assertive and has seldom made difficult decisions , " he points out . in the last four years , he has steered well clear of controversial issues such as health reforms .

the tiny country is struggling to cope with the influx - camps are bursting at the seams and xenophobia is on the rise . three years ago , jonas set out to make the long and dangerous journey to europe from his home country , eritrea .
there was absolutely no reason to stay there , he said .
although jonas finished high school with good marks and had found a job working for an oil company , his wages in eritrea were n't nearly enough to feed his family . " my aim was to get to europe and get a better education and find a good job , " he said .
" eritreans are people without hope .
i wanted to have a chance in life , and i also wanted be able to give something back to my people . " life-threatening crossing but jonas did n't expect that the crossing would be so dangerous .
many of his fellow passengers fell overboard during the journey and were left to drown .
others died of starvation on board . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boat load of africans hang onto a tuna net after their vessel sank off malta 's coast jonas was on his way to italy , a common destination for boats leaving the coast of africa .
but as happens with many other unseaworthy vessels , his boat was picked up by a maritime patrol , and he ended up being interned in malta .
jonas was released after a year , and now lives in a church-run refugee center . filled to capacity nearly 2,000 african boat people arrived in malta last year . a former british colony located 100km -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- south of sicily and 200km north of libya , malta has 405,000 inhabitants packed into seven tiny islands .
it 's the second most densely populated country in the world , and it 's not happy about having to house illegal immigrants . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the numbers of rufugees arriving in malta are less than italy or spain , but are growing malta , however , has a comparatively liberal and humanitarian refugee policy .
those who receive a humanitarian residency permit - mainly given to people from countries affected by civil war and internal conflicts such as somalia - are allowed to live in refugee accommodation . under european union law , asylum seekers must stay in the european country they first arrive in .
although malta is so tiny , it is a sovereign member of the eu , so anyone who lands is stuck there . to avert further humanitarian crises , malta has proposed that migrants whose boats founder in non-eu waters would be distributed evenly among the 27 eu countries . " the situation right now is just a complete mess , " the maltese interior minister , tonio borg , said several months ago .
" it 's a free-for-all .
each year 600 immigrants are dying on the threshold of europe .
it is unbelievable that on the doorstep of europe we are having this tragic situation and not enough is being done . " malta has three internment camps , which have been damned by amnesty international and visiting members of the european parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somalian women wait at the balzan refugee center and for those africans lucky enough to live outside the camps , the relationship to the maltese themselves is difficult .
the country has virtually no history of immigration , and reported cases of xenophobia are on the increase . " there are no real possibilities of getting on , of getting more training .
even if you have skills , you ca n't use them here .
-lrb- on malta -rrb- , there 's only work for unskilled labor , " jonas said . many ocean journeys begin in mauritania the maltese government has said in the past that the country feels " alone and abandoned by the eu " on the issue of immigration .
but in the african country of mauritania , the government is also struggling to cope with the influx of immigrants hoping to travel onward to europe . mauritania sits in the north-west of the african continent and its port town of nouadhibou is one of the three main launching places for africans , primarily from ivory coast , ghana , burkina faso and benin , who dream of working in the eu . the town of nouadhibou is near a well known " porous " border crossing point , where " even though the border controls are good , customs officers can be ' persuaded ' , " according to a report on african migrations routes by david van moppes . but once the potential immigrants enter mauritania , it does n't always mean they can get a spot on a smuggler 's boat .
in order to close off the country 's 750 km of coastline , the spanish guardia civil provides mauritania with satellites , radar equipment , helicopters and fast boots to try . even if many of the want-to-be immigrants end up temporarily trapped in mauritania , their aim remains europe .
and even jonas in malta is n't at the end of his travels .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 24.11.2007 organic firms fear newcomers will ruin their reputation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some coventional food companies are eager to jump on the organic wagon some traditional organic companies in germany are worried that their reputation could easily be spoiled by inexperienced newcomers on the rapidly growing market . organic is nothing unusual for german consumers .
organic products have been on their supermarket shelves for years and this wider availability has had a positive impact on sales . the sector 's growth has been largely driven by supermarket sales , which make up almost half of the total number of organic retail sales in germany .
in 2006 the trade in organic food products in both specialized organic stores and regular supermarkets topped 4.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- . that growth has prompted many more players to enter the market , including well-established conventional food manufactures and supermarket chains . this has many of the traditional organic companies , some of whom have been in the business for decades , worried these new players might damage the industry . is it really organic ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even some packet puddings are organic in germany the organic food industry association , an umbrella group representing organic farming , retail and traders association , is warning companies wanting to cash in on the organics trade to beware when buying organic raw materials .
they said inexperience in recognizing organic products could lead to companies buying fakes . " the traditional producers know where and how to buy organic raw materials , whereas those who come freshly into the market will have more difficulties , " the association 's president , felix prinz zu löwenstein , said . one company with a lot of industry experience is bio zentrale - an all organic company that has been selling organic food products in germany for over 30 years . " conventional companies do n't have the experience - they might just believe the organic certificate .
but we analyse it and if we find traces of pesticides then we will send it back , " marc netten from bio-zentrale said . shortfall of organic raw materials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic was a feature at the anuga food fair in cologne part of the concern over the arrival of new organic products by conventional producers is driven by a shortage of organic raw materials .
currently the organic farming sector is not growing at the same rate as the demand for organic products .
a shortage in organic raw materials grown in germany has meant that producers have begun to look far and wide for new producers to keep up their demand . " to get organic wheat is very difficult at the moment .
usually we buy our oats in germany or austria but at the moment we are also buying them in australia , " netten said . " while they have a certificate from australia certifying them as organic , nobody knows what happens on the ship . " for this reason the company analyses the oats it buys in a lab .
this takes one to two weeks and is adds to their production costs but bio-zentrale said it is only through doing their own tests that they feel confident in certifying it as organic . conventional companies claim they 're capable conventional companies acknowledge the difficulties in purchasing organically grown goods at the moment . " our problem is to ensure that you get the quantities of raw materials that you need , " said dominik ahrer , director marketing and sales of frenzel austria frost .
" our customers say they want organic .
the problem is not the price , it is getting the product so you have to make early contact . " frenzel austria frost is a conventional food company that has turned organic .
they produce over 100,000 tons of vegetables and ready meals per year , including an organic range of products sold in german supermarkets . the company denied they are at risk of buying non-organic materials by mistake because they " control the whole process from growing the crop to production to quality control by management , " ahrer said . organic standards the same as other food regulations according to conventional food companies that have gone organic , adhering to the strict organic certification guidelines is no different from the regulations they follow for other food certification schemes and other food standards . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic frozen pretzels " our company has been certified with a variety of quality standards for several years already , " said kurt hassinger from the pretzel-baking company ditsch .
" we have the ifs , brc and organic certificates .
just to get these certifications we have to ensure that our raw materials , production process , etc. are in order and properly documented . " major pretzel-producer ditsch , which sell pretzel products in chain stores and supermarkets throughout germany , started experimenting with organic products in late 2006 .
they intend to introduce a range of organic home-bake products , including pretzels , to german supermarkets in mid-2008 . " since there are only a limited number of pretzel producers in germany and we 've specialized in this area , there are very few competitors that can offer organic products of a similarly high quality .
in addition , our retail customers want these products to make their customers happy , " hassinger said . if you do organic , do it right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some lucky dogs get to eat organic the industry does n't want to discourage new players , nor does it want to stop major conventional food companies from going organic .
what it does want to do , according to the löwenstein , is to make sure that companies do it the right way without ruining it for everyone else . " companies participating in the market without experience could spoil the consumer 's trust in organic food by not working properly , " löwenstein said .
" this is because the consumers will maybe not make a difference between different sectors of the industry . " it 's a claim echoed by bio-zentrale .
" this can damage the whole organic market .
the customer doesn ’ t say one company is okay and one is not - they just think of them all together , " netten said . good partnerships the key the buying of raw organic materials from unknown growers , especially overseas , does pose problems in guaranteeing the product is organic .
for this reason the association wants to encourage partnerships between companies and growers . " i think partnership is a very important word because you have to know who you are dealing with , " löwenstein said . the association currently has action plans in place to assist conventional producers in going organic .
through the bund für lebensmittelrecht und lebensmittelkunde -lrb- bll -rrb- , the leading association of the german food sector , and the association of conventional supermarkets , they regularly provide information to companies on how to recognize organic . they also want to make sure that the current threshold for the organic seal of approval in germany remains at 0.01 - meaning that to be certified a product must not contain more than 0.01 percent non-organic ingredients . " it 's not so difficult to sell organic products but it 's very difficult to ensure that it ’ s really organic , " netten said .
" those companies that ensure this will last a really long time . " stephanie raison send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

organic products have been on their supermarket shelves for years and this wider availability has had a positive impact on sales . the sector 's growth has been largely driven by supermarket sales , which make up almost half of the total number of organic retail sales in germany .
in 2006 the trade in organic food products in both specialized organic stores and regular supermarkets topped 4.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- . that growth has prompted many more players to enter the market , including well-established conventional food manufactures and supermarket chains . this has many of the traditional organic companies , some of whom have been in the business for decades , worried these new players might damage the industry . is it really organic ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even some packet puddings are organic in germany the organic food industry association , an umbrella group representing organic farming , retail and traders association , is warning companies wanting to cash in on the organics trade to beware when buying organic raw materials .
they said inexperience in recognizing organic products could lead to companies buying fakes . " the traditional producers know where and how to buy organic raw materials , whereas those who come freshly into the market will have more difficulties , " the association 's president , felix prinz zu löwenstein , said . one company with a lot of industry experience is bio zentrale - an all organic company that has been selling organic food products in germany for over 30 years . " conventional companies do n't have the experience - they might just believe the organic certificate .
but we analyse it and if we find traces of pesticides then we will send it back , " marc netten from bio-zentrale said . shortfall of organic raw materials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic was a feature at the anuga food fair in cologne part of the concern over the arrival of new organic products by conventional producers is driven by a shortage of organic raw materials .
currently the organic farming sector is not growing at the same rate as the demand for organic products .
a shortage in organic raw materials grown in germany has meant that producers have begun to look far and wide for new producers to keep up their demand . " to get organic wheat is very difficult at the moment .
usually we buy our oats in germany or austria but at the moment we are also buying them in australia , " netten said . " while they have a certificate from australia certifying them as organic , nobody knows what happens on the ship . " for this reason the company analyses the oats it buys in a lab .
this takes one to two weeks and is adds to their production costs but bio-zentrale said it is only through doing their own tests that they feel confident in certifying it as organic . conventional companies claim they 're capable conventional companies acknowledge the difficulties in purchasing organically grown goods at the moment . " our problem is to ensure that you get the quantities of raw materials that you need , " said dominik ahrer , director marketing and sales of frenzel austria frost .

the tiny country is struggling to cope with the influx - camps are bursting at the seams and xenophobia is on the rise . three years ago , jonas set out to make the long and dangerous journey to europe from his home country , eritrea .
there was absolutely no reason to stay there , he said .
although jonas finished high school with good marks and had found a job working for an oil company , his wages in eritrea were n't nearly enough to feed his family . " my aim was to get to europe and get a better education and find a good job , " he said .
" eritreans are people without hope .
i wanted to have a chance in life , and i also wanted be able to give something back to my people . " life-threatening crossing but jonas did n't expect that the crossing would be so dangerous .
many of his fellow passengers fell overboard during the journey and were left to drown .
others died of starvation on board . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boat load of africans hang onto a tuna net after their vessel sank off malta 's coast jonas was on his way to italy , a common destination for boats leaving the coast of africa .
but as happens with many other unseaworthy vessels , his boat was picked up by a maritime patrol , and he ended up being interned in malta .
jonas was released after a year , and now lives in a church-run refugee center . filled to capacity nearly 2,000 african boat people arrived in malta last year . a former british colony located 100km -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- south of sicily and 200km north of libya , malta has 405,000 inhabitants packed into seven tiny islands .
it 's the second most densely populated country in the world , and it 's not happy about having to house illegal immigrants . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the numbers of rufugees arriving in malta are less than italy or spain , but are growing malta , however , has a comparatively liberal and humanitarian refugee policy .
those who receive a humanitarian residency permit - mainly given to people from countries affected by civil war and internal conflicts such as somalia - are allowed to live in refugee accommodation . under european union law , asylum seekers must stay in the european country they first arrive in .
although malta is so tiny , it is a sovereign member of the eu , so anyone who lands is stuck there . to avert further humanitarian crises , malta has proposed that migrants whose boats founder in non-eu waters would be distributed evenly among the 27 eu countries . " the situation right now is just a complete mess , " the maltese interior minister , tonio borg , said several months ago .
" it 's a free-for-all .
each year 600 immigrants are dying on the threshold of europe .
it is unbelievable that on the doorstep of europe we are having this tragic situation and not enough is being done .

even if you have skills , you ca n't use them here .
-lrb- on malta -rrb- , there 's only work for unskilled labor , " jonas said . many ocean journeys begin in mauritania the maltese government has said in the past that the country feels " alone and abandoned by the eu " on the issue of immigration .
but in the african country of mauritania , the government is also struggling to cope with the influx of immigrants hoping to travel onward to europe . mauritania sits in the north-west of the african continent and its port town of nouadhibou is one of the three main launching places for africans , primarily from ivory coast , ghana , burkina faso and benin , who dream of working in the eu . the town of nouadhibou is near a well known " porous " border crossing point , where " even though the border controls are good , customs officers can be ' persuaded ' , " according to a report on african migrations routes by david van moppes . but once the potential immigrants enter mauritania , it does n't always mean they can get a spot on a smuggler 's boat .
in order to close off the country 's 750 km of coastline , the spanish guardia civil provides mauritania with satellites , radar equipment , helicopters and fast boots to try . even if many of the want-to-be immigrants end up temporarily trapped in mauritania , their aim remains europe .

the tiny country is struggling to cope with the influx - camps are bursting at the seams and xenophobia is on the rise . three years ago , jonas set out to make the long and dangerous journey to europe from his home country , eritrea .
there was absolutely no reason to stay there , he said .
although jonas finished high school with good marks and had found a job working for an oil company , his wages in eritrea were n't nearly enough to feed his family . " my aim was to get to europe and get a better education and find a good job , " he said .
" eritreans are people without hope .
i wanted to have a chance in life , and i also wanted be able to give something back to my people . " life-threatening crossing but jonas did n't expect that the crossing would be so dangerous .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 24.11.2007 organic firms fear newcomers will ruin their reputation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some coventional food companies are eager to jump on the organic wagon some traditional organic companies in germany are worried that their reputation could easily be spoiled by inexperienced newcomers on the rapidly growing market . organic is nothing unusual for german consumers .
organic products have been on their supermarket shelves for years and this wider availability has had a positive impact on sales . the sector 's growth has been largely driven by supermarket sales , which make up almost half of the total number of organic retail sales in germany .
in 2006 the trade in organic food products in both specialized organic stores and regular supermarkets topped 4.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- . that growth has prompted many more players to enter the market , including well-established conventional food manufactures and supermarket chains . this has many of the traditional organic companies , some of whom have been in the business for decades , worried these new players might damage the industry . is it really organic ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even some packet puddings are organic in germany the organic food industry association , an umbrella group representing organic farming , retail and traders association , is warning companies wanting to cash in on the organics trade to beware when buying organic raw materials .
they said inexperience in recognizing organic products could lead to companies buying fakes . " the traditional producers know where and how to buy organic raw materials , whereas those who come freshly into the market will have more difficulties , " the association 's president , felix prinz zu löwenstein , said . one company with a lot of industry experience is bio zentrale - an all organic company that has been selling organic food products in germany for over 30 years . " conventional companies do n't have the experience - they might just believe the organic certificate .
but we analyse it and if we find traces of pesticides then we will send it back , " marc netten from bio-zentrale said . shortfall of organic raw materials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic was a feature at the anuga food fair in cologne part of the concern over the arrival of new organic products by conventional producers is driven by a shortage of organic raw materials .
currently the organic farming sector is not growing at the same rate as the demand for organic products .
a shortage in organic raw materials grown in germany has meant that producers have begun to look far and wide for new producers to keep up their demand . " to get organic wheat is very difficult at the moment .
usually we buy our oats in germany or austria but at the moment we are also buying them in australia , " netten said . " while they have a certificate from australia certifying them as organic , nobody knows what happens on the ship . " for this reason the company analyses the oats it buys in a lab .
this takes one to two weeks and is adds to their production costs but bio-zentrale said it is only through doing their own tests that they feel confident in certifying it as organic . conventional companies claim they 're capable conventional companies acknowledge the difficulties in purchasing organically grown goods at the moment . " our problem is to ensure that you get the quantities of raw materials that you need , " said dominik ahrer , director marketing and sales of frenzel austria frost .
" our customers say they want organic .
the problem is not the price , it is getting the product so you have to make early contact . " frenzel austria frost is a conventional food company that has turned organic .
they produce over 100,000 tons of vegetables and ready meals per year , including an organic range of products sold in german supermarkets . the company denied they are at risk of buying non-organic materials by mistake because they " control the whole process from growing the crop to production to quality control by management , " ahrer said . organic standards the same as other food regulations according to conventional food companies that have gone organic , adhering to the strict organic certification guidelines is no different from the regulations they follow for other food certification schemes and other food standards . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic frozen pretzels " our company has been certified with a variety of quality standards for several years already , " said kurt hassinger from the pretzel-baking company ditsch .
" we have the ifs , brc and organic certificates .
just to get these certifications we have to ensure that our raw materials , production process , etc. are in order and properly documented . " major pretzel-producer ditsch , which sell pretzel products in chain stores and supermarkets throughout germany , started experimenting with organic products in late 2006 .
they intend to introduce a range of organic home-bake products , including pretzels , to german supermarkets in mid-2008 . " since there are only a limited number of pretzel producers in germany and we 've specialized in this area , there are very few competitors that can offer organic products of a similarly high quality .
in addition , our retail customers want these products to make their customers happy , " hassinger said . if you do organic , do it right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some lucky dogs get to eat organic the industry does n't want to discourage new players , nor does it want to stop major conventional food companies from going organic .
what it does want to do , according to the löwenstein , is to make sure that companies do it the right way without ruining it for everyone else . " companies participating in the market without experience could spoil the consumer 's trust in organic food by not working properly , " löwenstein said .
" this is because the consumers will maybe not make a difference between different sectors of the industry . " it 's a claim echoed by bio-zentrale .
" this can damage the whole organic market .
the customer doesn ’ t say one company is okay and one is not - they just think of them all together , " netten said . good partnerships the key the buying of raw organic materials from unknown growers , especially overseas , does pose problems in guaranteeing the product is organic .
for this reason the association wants to encourage partnerships between companies and growers . " i think partnership is a very important word because you have to know who you are dealing with , " löwenstein said . the association currently has action plans in place to assist conventional producers in going organic .
through the bund für lebensmittelrecht und lebensmittelkunde -lrb- bll -rrb- , the leading association of the german food sector , and the association of conventional supermarkets , they regularly provide information to companies on how to recognize organic . they also want to make sure that the current threshold for the organic seal of approval in germany remains at 0.01 - meaning that to be certified a product must not contain more than 0.01 percent non-organic ingredients . " it 's not so difficult to sell organic products but it 's very difficult to ensure that it ’ s really organic , " netten said .
" those companies that ensure this will last a really long time . " stephanie raison send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they admire his iron rule , and the way he goes fishing topless .
but is it the real putin they know ? the images of putin at the eu-russian summit in samara which went around the world in may fast became iconic .
in his natty shades , black designer suit and knowing smile , he came across less like a democratically elected president and more like a professional hit man . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " for putin " reads this giant poster in moscow but icy efficiency seems to be exactly what putin wants to convey .
over the years , he 's learnt that cutting a telegenic dash through the world media is an effective way of showing what a tough guy he is . no doubt with this principle in mind , he made headlines in august when he took a brief break from running the country to go fishing in siberia with prince albert of monaco , abandoning the formal suits in favor of some camouflage chic .
the president then wasted no time stripping down to the waist , showing off a remarkably trim physique for a man of his years . although his antics met with plenty of raised eyebrows in the uptight west , this sort of macho posturing is not so much laughed at as admired back home in russia . " -lsb- putin -rsb- likes to profile himself as a protector , a strong man who 's also very sensible , " says russia expert hans-henning schröder from the foundation for science and politics .
" he embodies everything a russian woman wants in a man . " no one to trust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's more serious side in reality , his image as russia 's knight in shining armor is wishful thinking .
the country has no one it can trust - which is why it 's not so surprising that 70 percent of the public named the president in a recent survey of the most trustworthy institutions . only eight percent said they had faith in the unions , 15 percent in the judicial system and just 10 percent in political parties . " this is to be expected , " said schröder .
" the parties change every year and many of them are more likely to be imposed from above than be genuine representatives of the people .
the unions do n't care about the public and the judicial system is corrupt . " in contrast , putin must seem like a guardian angel , seen to have guided his people through the turmoil of the 1990s to moderate prosperity and helping secure the country a place within the new world order . " in fact , putin can not take the credit for this prosperity , " points out falk bomsdorf from the friedrich naumann foundation in moscow .
" it is largely due to the steep rise in oil prices .
but no one seems to care . " " national leader " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president or hit man ?
but the russians have undoubtedly never had it as good as under putin .
in the last eight years , wages have grown 50 percent , and the country has seen a slow but sure emergence of the middle class . " a class of small and medium-sized entrepreneurs has arisen which never existed before putin , " points out thomas kunze , who used to work at the konrad adenauer foundation in russia .
" they have a vested interest in his remaining in power . " as hans-henning schröder observed , few russians could live off their wages under putin 's predecessor boris yeltsin . " old people without pensions simply died .
back then , people had to fight to survive , " he said . unlike in germany after the second world war , democracy and a free market economy failed to result in an immediate boost to the standard of living in russia , he explained .
but life improved once putin began centralizing the economy . to many , he is still the only man able to run the show , which is why russia 's dominant united russia party has published a blueprint for formalizing the status of president vladimir putin as " national leader " after he steps down as president next year . indecisive bildunterschrift : a series of political rallies have cast the popular president as an indispensable leader schröder , however , believes that putin 's public image belies the truth of a far more indecisive character . uncompromising as he is on the world stage , putin is actually strikingly ineffective at home . " my impression is that putin has never been very assertive and has seldom made difficult decisions , " he points out . in the last four years , he has steered well clear of controversial issues such as health reforms .
in 2005 he hastily backed down on plans for social reform as soon as a few demonstrators took to the streets .
five years ago , he showed similar weakness when he refrained from intervening in a public spat between his defense minister and the head of the general staff over security policy . " had such an argument happened in germany , one of them would have been fired immediately , if not both , " said schröder . so why do the russians still love him ?
perhaps it 's because the putin approach is one that many of the more apolitical members of the population can identify with .
but , according to schröder , the president is by no means a typical russian . " he 's more typically german than russian , " he said .
" a typical russian has a bit more soul and likes to party more than he does . " manfred götzke -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they admire his iron rule , and the way he goes fishing topless .
but is it the real putin they know ? the images of putin at the eu-russian summit in samara which went around the world in may fast became iconic .
in his natty shades , black designer suit and knowing smile , he came across less like a democratically elected president and more like a professional hit man . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " for putin " reads this giant poster in moscow but icy efficiency seems to be exactly what putin wants to convey .
over the years , he 's learnt that cutting a telegenic dash through the world media is an effective way of showing what a tough guy he is . no doubt with this principle in mind , he made headlines in august when he took a brief break from running the country to go fishing in siberia with prince albert of monaco , abandoning the formal suits in favor of some camouflage chic .
the president then wasted no time stripping down to the waist , showing off a remarkably trim physique for a man of his years . although his antics met with plenty of raised eyebrows in the uptight west , this sort of macho posturing is not so much laughed at as admired back home in russia . " -lsb- putin -rsb- likes to profile himself as a protector , a strong man who 's also very sensible , " says russia expert hans-henning schröder from the foundation for science and politics .
" he embodies everything a russian woman wants in a man . " no one to trust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's more serious side in reality , his image as russia 's knight in shining armor is wishful thinking .
the country has no one it can trust - which is why it 's not so surprising that 70 percent of the public named the president in a recent survey of the most trustworthy institutions . only eight percent said they had faith in the unions , 15 percent in the judicial system and just 10 percent in political parties . " this is to be expected , " said schröder .
" the parties change every year and many of them are more likely to be imposed from above than be genuine representatives of the people .
the unions do n't care about the public and the judicial system is corrupt . " in contrast , putin must seem like a guardian angel , seen to have guided his people through the turmoil of the 1990s to moderate prosperity and helping secure the country a place within the new world order . " in fact , putin can not take the credit for this prosperity , " points out falk bomsdorf from the friedrich naumann foundation in moscow .
" it is largely due to the steep rise in oil prices .
but no one seems to care . " " national leader " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president or hit man ?
but the russians have undoubtedly never had it as good as under putin .
in the last eight years , wages have grown 50 percent , and the country has seen a slow but sure emergence of the middle class . " a class of small and medium-sized entrepreneurs has arisen which never existed before putin , " points out thomas kunze , who used to work at the konrad adenauer foundation in russia .
" they have a vested interest in his remaining in power . " as hans-henning schröder observed , few russians could live off their wages under putin 's predecessor boris yeltsin . " old people without pensions simply died .
back then , people had to fight to survive , " he said . unlike in germany after the second world war , democracy and a free market economy failed to result in an immediate boost to the standard of living in russia , he explained .
but life improved once putin began centralizing the economy . to many , he is still the only man able to run the show , which is why russia 's dominant united russia party has published a blueprint for formalizing the status of president vladimir putin as " national leader " after he steps down as president next year . indecisive bildunterschrift : a series of political rallies have cast the popular president as an indispensable leader schröder , however , believes that putin 's public image belies the truth of a far more indecisive character . uncompromising as he is on the world stage , putin is actually strikingly ineffective at home . " my impression is that putin has never been very assertive and has seldom made difficult decisions , " he points out . in the last four years , he has steered well clear of controversial issues such as health reforms .
in 2005 he hastily backed down on plans for social reform as soon as a few demonstrators took to the streets .
five years ago , he showed similar weakness when he refrained from intervening in a public spat between his defense minister and the head of the general staff over security policy . " had such an argument happened in germany , one of them would have been fired immediately , if not both , " said schröder . so why do the russians still love him ?
perhaps it 's because the putin approach is one that many of the more apolitical members of the population can identify with .
but , according to schröder , the president is by no means a typical russian . " he 's more typically german than russian , " he said .

the eit will have a governing body , a director and an executive committee , but will not be a new institute as such , eu ministers decided on friday , nov .
23 .
rather , it will network and pool resources from europe 's universities and will initially seek to focus research into three broad areas : energy , climate change and information technology .
the eu has earmarked 308.7 million euros -lrb- $ 455 million -rrb- for the functioning of the eit for a period of six years .
its budget has yet to receive final clearance , but eu officials expect the eit to be up and running some time in 2008 .
eu ministers meeting in brussels also agreed to set up four joint technology initiatives -lrb- jti -rrb- linking the private and public sector .
driven by industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : embedded computing systems are used in an increasing range of consumer products driven primarily by industry , the jtis will implement research programs in the fields of innovative medicines , nano-electronic technologies , aeronautics and air transport and embedded computing systems -lrb- invisible electronics and software used in cars and in an increasing range of consumer products -rrb- .
ministers also acknowledged the need to modernize europe 's universities and higher education institutions .
a report published this week by the european commission found that while productivity growth in the eu had gathered pace since 2005 , the 27-member bloc was likely to continue lagging behind the united states for years to come . insufficient investments in research , development and education were identified among the root causes for europe 's slow productivity growth .
on thursday , eu ministers made only limited progress in establishing an eu-wide patent system .
the initiative has stalled for years , in part because italy and spain want eu patents to be published in italian and spanish as well . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the tiny country is struggling to cope with the influx - camps are bursting at the seams and xenophobia is on the rise . three years ago , jonas set out to make the long and dangerous journey to europe from his home country , eritrea .
there was absolutely no reason to stay there , he said .
although jonas finished high school with good marks and had found a job working for an oil company , his wages in eritrea were n't nearly enough to feed his family . " my aim was to get to europe and get a better education and find a good job , " he said .
" eritreans are people without hope .
i wanted to have a chance in life , and i also wanted be able to give something back to my people . " life-threatening crossing but jonas did n't expect that the crossing would be so dangerous .
many of his fellow passengers fell overboard during the journey and were left to drown .
others died of starvation on board . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boat load of africans hang onto a tuna net after their vessel sank off malta 's coast jonas was on his way to italy , a common destination for boats leaving the coast of africa .
but as happens with many other unseaworthy vessels , his boat was picked up by a maritime patrol , and he ended up being interned in malta .
jonas was released after a year , and now lives in a church-run refugee center . filled to capacity nearly 2,000 african boat people arrived in malta last year . a former british colony located 100km -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- south of sicily and 200km north of libya , malta has 405,000 inhabitants packed into seven tiny islands .
it 's the second most densely populated country in the world , and it 's not happy about having to house illegal immigrants . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the numbers of rufugees arriving in malta are less than italy or spain , but are growing malta , however , has a comparatively liberal and humanitarian refugee policy .
those who receive a humanitarian residency permit - mainly given to people from countries affected by civil war and internal conflicts such as somalia - are allowed to live in refugee accommodation . under european union law , asylum seekers must stay in the european country they first arrive in .
although malta is so tiny , it is a sovereign member of the eu , so anyone who lands is stuck there . to avert further humanitarian crises , malta has proposed that migrants whose boats founder in non-eu waters would be distributed evenly among the 27 eu countries . " the situation right now is just a complete mess , " the maltese interior minister , tonio borg , said several months ago .
" it 's a free-for-all .
each year 600 immigrants are dying on the threshold of europe .
it is unbelievable that on the doorstep of europe we are having this tragic situation and not enough is being done . " malta has three internment camps , which have been damned by amnesty international and visiting members of the european parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somalian women wait at the balzan refugee center and for those africans lucky enough to live outside the camps , the relationship to the maltese themselves is difficult .
the country has virtually no history of immigration , and reported cases of xenophobia are on the increase . " there are no real possibilities of getting on , of getting more training .
even if you have skills , you ca n't use them here .
-lrb- on malta -rrb- , there 's only work for unskilled labor , " jonas said . many ocean journeys begin in mauritania the maltese government has said in the past that the country feels " alone and abandoned by the eu " on the issue of immigration .
but in the african country of mauritania , the government is also struggling to cope with the influx of immigrants hoping to travel onward to europe . mauritania sits in the north-west of the african continent and its port town of nouadhibou is one of the three main launching places for africans , primarily from ivory coast , ghana , burkina faso and benin , who dream of working in the eu . the town of nouadhibou is near a well known " porous " border crossing point , where " even though the border controls are good , customs officers can be ' persuaded ' , " according to a report on african migrations routes by david van moppes . but once the potential immigrants enter mauritania , it does n't always mean they can get a spot on a smuggler 's boat .
in order to close off the country 's 750 km of coastline , the spanish guardia civil provides mauritania with satellites , radar equipment , helicopters and fast boots to try . even if many of the want-to-be immigrants end up temporarily trapped in mauritania , their aim remains europe .
and even jonas in malta is n't at the end of his travels .
he refuses to give up his idea of a better life somewhere else in europe . ute schaeffer -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eit will have a governing body , a director and an executive committee , but will not be a new institute as such , eu ministers decided on friday , nov .
23 .
rather , it will network and pool resources from europe 's universities and will initially seek to focus research into three broad areas : energy , climate change and information technology .
the eu has earmarked 308.7 million euros -lrb- $ 455 million -rrb- for the functioning of the eit for a period of six years .
its budget has yet to receive final clearance , but eu officials expect the eit to be up and running some time in 2008 .
eu ministers meeting in brussels also agreed to set up four joint technology initiatives -lrb- jti -rrb- linking the private and public sector .
driven by industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : embedded computing systems are used in an increasing range of consumer products driven primarily by industry , the jtis will implement research programs in the fields of innovative medicines , nano-electronic technologies , aeronautics and air transport and embedded computing systems -lrb- invisible electronics and software used in cars and in an increasing range of consumer products -rrb- .
ministers also acknowledged the need to modernize europe 's universities and higher education institutions .
a report published this week by the european commission found that while productivity growth in the eu had gathered pace since 2005 , the 27-member bloc was likely to continue lagging behind the united states for years to come . insufficient investments in research , development and education were identified among the root causes for europe 's slow productivity growth .
on thursday , eu ministers made only limited progress in establishing an eu-wide patent system .
the initiative has stalled for years , in part because italy and spain want eu patents to be published in italian and spanish as well . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but is it the real putin they know ? the images of putin at the eu-russian summit in samara which went around the world in may fast became iconic .

over the years , he 's learnt that cutting a telegenic dash through the world media is an effective way of showing what a tough guy he is . no doubt with this principle in mind , he made headlines in august when he took a brief break from running the country to go fishing in siberia with prince albert of monaco , abandoning the formal suits in favor of some camouflage chic .
the president then wasted no time stripping down to the waist , showing off a remarkably trim physique for a man of his years . although his antics met with plenty of raised eyebrows in the uptight west , this sort of macho posturing is not so much laughed at as admired back home in russia . " -lsb- putin -rsb- likes to profile himself as a protector , a strong man who 's also very sensible , " says russia expert hans-henning schröder from the foundation for science and politics .
" he embodies everything a russian woman wants in a man . " no one to trust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's more serious side in reality , his image as russia 's knight in shining armor is wishful thinking .
the country has no one it can trust - which is why it 's not so surprising that 70 percent of the public named the president in a recent survey of the most trustworthy institutions . only eight percent said they had faith in the unions , 15 percent in the judicial system and just 10 percent in political parties . " this is to be expected , " said schröder .
" the parties change every year and many of them are more likely to be imposed from above than be genuine representatives of the people .
the unions do n't care about the public and the judicial system is corrupt . " in contrast , putin must seem like a guardian angel , seen to have guided his people through the turmoil of the 1990s to moderate prosperity and helping secure the country a place within the new world order . " in fact , putin can not take the credit for this prosperity , " points out falk bomsdorf from the friedrich naumann foundation in moscow .

in the last eight years , wages have grown 50 percent , and the country has seen a slow but sure emergence of the middle class . " a class of small and medium-sized entrepreneurs has arisen which never existed before putin , " points out thomas kunze , who used to work at the konrad adenauer foundation in russia .
" they have a vested interest in his remaining in power . " as hans-henning schröder observed , few russians could live off their wages under putin 's predecessor boris yeltsin . " old people without pensions simply died .
back then , people had to fight to survive , " he said . unlike in germany after the second world war , democracy and a free market economy failed to result in an immediate boost to the standard of living in russia , he explained .

the eit will have a governing body , a director and an executive committee , but will not be a new institute as such , eu ministers decided on friday , nov .
23 .
rather , it will network and pool resources from europe 's universities and will initially seek to focus research into three broad areas : energy , climate change and information technology .
the eu has earmarked 308.7 million euros -lrb- $ 455 million -rrb- for the functioning of the eit for a period of six years .
its budget has yet to receive final clearance , but eu officials expect the eit to be up and running some time in 2008 .
eu ministers meeting in brussels also agreed to set up four joint technology initiatives -lrb- jti -rrb- linking the private and public sector .
driven by industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : embedded computing systems are used in an increasing range of consumer products driven primarily by industry , the jtis will implement research programs in the fields of innovative medicines , nano-electronic technologies , aeronautics and air transport and embedded computing systems -lrb- invisible electronics and software used in cars and in an increasing range of consumer products -rrb- .
ministers also acknowledged the need to modernize europe 's universities and higher education institutions .
a report published this week by the european commission found that while productivity growth in the eu had gathered pace since 2005 , the 27-member bloc was likely to continue lagging behind the united states for years to come . insufficient investments in research , development and education were identified among the root causes for europe 's slow productivity growth .
on thursday , eu ministers made only limited progress in establishing an eu-wide patent system .
the initiative has stalled for years , in part because italy and spain want eu patents to be published in italian and spanish as well . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eit will have a governing body , a director and an executive committee , but will not be a new institute as such , eu ministers decided on friday , nov .
23 .
rather , it will network and pool resources from europe 's universities and will initially seek to focus research into three broad areas : energy , climate change and information technology .
the eu has earmarked 308.7 million euros -lrb- $ 455 million -rrb- for the functioning of the eit for a period of six years .
its budget has yet to receive final clearance , but eu officials expect the eit to be up and running some time in 2008 .
eu ministers meeting in brussels also agreed to set up four joint technology initiatives -lrb- jti -rrb- linking the private and public sector .
driven by industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : embedded computing systems are used in an increasing range of consumer products driven primarily by industry , the jtis will implement research programs in the fields of innovative medicines , nano-electronic technologies , aeronautics and air transport and embedded computing systems -lrb- invisible electronics and software used in cars and in an increasing range of consumer products -rrb- .
ministers also acknowledged the need to modernize europe 's universities and higher education institutions .
a report published this week by the european commission found that while productivity growth in the eu had gathered pace since 2005 , the 27-member bloc was likely to continue lagging behind the united states for years to come . insufficient investments in research , development and education were identified among the root causes for europe 's slow productivity growth .
on thursday , eu ministers made only limited progress in establishing an eu-wide patent system .

the tiny country is struggling to cope with the influx - camps are bursting at the seams and xenophobia is on the rise . three years ago , jonas set out to make the long and dangerous journey to europe from his home country , eritrea .
there was absolutely no reason to stay there , he said .
although jonas finished high school with good marks and had found a job working for an oil company , his wages in eritrea were n't nearly enough to feed his family . " my aim was to get to europe and get a better education and find a good job , " he said .
" eritreans are people without hope .
i wanted to have a chance in life , and i also wanted be able to give something back to my people . " life-threatening crossing but jonas did n't expect that the crossing would be so dangerous .
many of his fellow passengers fell overboard during the journey and were left to drown .
others died of starvation on board . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boat load of africans hang onto a tuna net after their vessel sank off malta 's coast jonas was on his way to italy , a common destination for boats leaving the coast of africa .
but as happens with many other unseaworthy vessels , his boat was picked up by a maritime patrol , and he ended up being interned in malta .
jonas was released after a year , and now lives in a church-run refugee center . filled to capacity nearly 2,000 african boat people arrived in malta last year . a former british colony located 100km -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- south of sicily and 200km north of libya , malta has 405,000 inhabitants packed into seven tiny islands .
it 's the second most densely populated country in the world , and it 's not happy about having to house illegal immigrants . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the numbers of rufugees arriving in malta are less than italy or spain , but are growing malta , however , has a comparatively liberal and humanitarian refugee policy .
those who receive a humanitarian residency permit - mainly given to people from countries affected by civil war and internal conflicts such as somalia - are allowed to live in refugee accommodation . under european union law , asylum seekers must stay in the european country they first arrive in .
although malta is so tiny , it is a sovereign member of the eu , so anyone who lands is stuck there . to avert further humanitarian crises , malta has proposed that migrants whose boats founder in non-eu waters would be distributed evenly among the 27 eu countries . " the situation right now is just a complete mess , " the maltese interior minister , tonio borg , said several months ago .
" it 's a free-for-all .
each year 600 immigrants are dying on the threshold of europe .
it is unbelievable that on the doorstep of europe we are having this tragic situation and not enough is being done . " malta has three internment camps , which have been damned by amnesty international and visiting members of the european parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somalian women wait at the balzan refugee center and for those africans lucky enough to live outside the camps , the relationship to the maltese themselves is difficult .
the country has virtually no history of immigration , and reported cases of xenophobia are on the increase . " there are no real possibilities of getting on , of getting more training .
even if you have skills , you ca n't use them here .
-lrb- on malta -rrb- , there 's only work for unskilled labor , " jonas said . many ocean journeys begin in mauritania the maltese government has said in the past that the country feels " alone and abandoned by the eu " on the issue of immigration .
but in the african country of mauritania , the government is also struggling to cope with the influx of immigrants hoping to travel onward to europe . mauritania sits in the north-west of the african continent and its port town of nouadhibou is one of the three main launching places for africans , primarily from ivory coast , ghana , burkina faso and benin , who dream of working in the eu . the town of nouadhibou is near a well known " porous " border crossing point , where " even though the border controls are good , customs officers can be ' persuaded ' , " according to a report on african migrations routes by david van moppes . but once the potential immigrants enter mauritania , it does n't always mean they can get a spot on a smuggler 's boat .
in order to close off the country 's 750 km of coastline , the spanish guardia civil provides mauritania with satellites , radar equipment , helicopters and fast boots to try . even if many of the want-to-be immigrants end up temporarily trapped in mauritania , their aim remains europe .
and even jonas in malta is n't at the end of his travels .
he refuses to give up his idea of a better life somewhere else in europe . ute schaeffer -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : russian parliamentary elections putin 's party wins russia elections amid vote-rigging claims kremlin takes heat from the west following dubious election opinion : democracy biggest loser in russian elections germany 's merkel criticizes lack of observers in russian poll russia -pipe- 24.11.2007 macho but indecisive , putin is all russia 's got großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you know you 're in safe hands with a leader like this the russians love their president .
they admire his iron rule , and the way he goes fishing topless .
but is it the real putin they know ? the images of putin at the eu-russian summit in samara which went around the world in may fast became iconic .
in his natty shades , black designer suit and knowing smile , he came across less like a democratically elected president and more like a professional hit man . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " for putin " reads this giant poster in moscow but icy efficiency seems to be exactly what putin wants to convey .
over the years , he 's learnt that cutting a telegenic dash through the world media is an effective way of showing what a tough guy he is . no doubt with this principle in mind , he made headlines in august when he took a brief break from running the country to go fishing in siberia with prince albert of monaco , abandoning the formal suits in favor of some camouflage chic .
the president then wasted no time stripping down to the waist , showing off a remarkably trim physique for a man of his years . although his antics met with plenty of raised eyebrows in the uptight west , this sort of macho posturing is not so much laughed at as admired back home in russia . " -lsb- putin -rsb- likes to profile himself as a protector , a strong man who 's also very sensible , " says russia expert hans-henning schröder from the foundation for science and politics .
" he embodies everything a russian woman wants in a man . " no one to trust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's more serious side in reality , his image as russia 's knight in shining armor is wishful thinking .
the country has no one it can trust - which is why it 's not so surprising that 70 percent of the public named the president in a recent survey of the most trustworthy institutions . only eight percent said they had faith in the unions , 15 percent in the judicial system and just 10 percent in political parties . " this is to be expected , " said schröder .
" the parties change every year and many of them are more likely to be imposed from above than be genuine representatives of the people .
the unions do n't care about the public and the judicial system is corrupt . " in contrast , putin must seem like a guardian angel , seen to have guided his people through the turmoil of the 1990s to moderate prosperity and helping secure the country a place within the new world order . " in fact , putin can not take the credit for this prosperity , " points out falk bomsdorf from the friedrich naumann foundation in moscow .
" it is largely due to the steep rise in oil prices .
but no one seems to care . " " national leader " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president or hit man ?
but the russians have undoubtedly never had it as good as under putin .
in the last eight years , wages have grown 50 percent , and the country has seen a slow but sure emergence of the middle class . " a class of small and medium-sized entrepreneurs has arisen which never existed before putin , " points out thomas kunze , who used to work at the konrad adenauer foundation in russia .
" they have a vested interest in his remaining in power . " as hans-henning schröder observed , few russians could live off their wages under putin 's predecessor boris yeltsin . " old people without pensions simply died .
back then , people had to fight to survive , " he said . unlike in germany after the second world war , democracy and a free market economy failed to result in an immediate boost to the standard of living in russia , he explained .
but life improved once putin began centralizing the economy . to many , he is still the only man able to run the show , which is why russia 's dominant united russia party has published a blueprint for formalizing the status of president vladimir putin as " national leader " after he steps down as president next year . indecisive bildunterschrift : a series of political rallies have cast the popular president as an indispensable leader schröder , however , believes that putin 's public image belies the truth of a far more indecisive character . uncompromising as he is on the world stage , putin is actually strikingly ineffective at home . " my impression is that putin has never been very assertive and has seldom made difficult decisions , " he points out . in the last four years , he has steered well clear of controversial issues such as health reforms .
in 2005 he hastily backed down on plans for social reform as soon as a few demonstrators took to the streets .
five years ago , he showed similar weakness when he refrained from intervening in a public spat between his defense minister and the head of the general staff over security policy . " had such an argument happened in germany , one of them would have been fired immediately , if not both , " said schröder . so why do the russians still love him ?
perhaps it 's because the putin approach is one that many of the more apolitical members of the population can identify with .
but , according to schröder , the president is by no means a typical russian . " he 's more typically german than russian , " he said .
" a typical russian has a bit more soul and likes to party more than he does . " manfred götzke -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

organic products have been on their supermarket shelves for years and this wider availability has had a positive impact on sales . the sector 's growth has been largely driven by supermarket sales , which make up almost half of the total number of organic retail sales in germany .
in 2006 the trade in organic food products in both specialized organic stores and regular supermarkets topped 4.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- . that growth has prompted many more players to enter the market , including well-established conventional food manufactures and supermarket chains . this has many of the traditional organic companies , some of whom have been in the business for decades , worried these new players might damage the industry . is it really organic ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even some packet puddings are organic in germany the organic food industry association , an umbrella group representing organic farming , retail and traders association , is warning companies wanting to cash in on the organics trade to beware when buying organic raw materials .
they said inexperience in recognizing organic products could lead to companies buying fakes . " the traditional producers know where and how to buy organic raw materials , whereas those who come freshly into the market will have more difficulties , " the association 's president , felix prinz zu löwenstein , said . one company with a lot of industry experience is bio zentrale - an all organic company that has been selling organic food products in germany for over 30 years . " conventional companies do n't have the experience - they might just believe the organic certificate .
but we analyse it and if we find traces of pesticides then we will send it back , " marc netten from bio-zentrale said . shortfall of organic raw materials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic was a feature at the anuga food fair in cologne part of the concern over the arrival of new organic products by conventional producers is driven by a shortage of organic raw materials .
currently the organic farming sector is not growing at the same rate as the demand for organic products .
a shortage in organic raw materials grown in germany has meant that producers have begun to look far and wide for new producers to keep up their demand . " to get organic wheat is very difficult at the moment .
usually we buy our oats in germany or austria but at the moment we are also buying them in australia , " netten said . " while they have a certificate from australia certifying them as organic , nobody knows what happens on the ship . " for this reason the company analyses the oats it buys in a lab .
this takes one to two weeks and is adds to their production costs but bio-zentrale said it is only through doing their own tests that they feel confident in certifying it as organic . conventional companies claim they 're capable conventional companies acknowledge the difficulties in purchasing organically grown goods at the moment . " our problem is to ensure that you get the quantities of raw materials that you need , " said dominik ahrer , director marketing and sales of frenzel austria frost .
" our customers say they want organic .
the problem is not the price , it is getting the product so you have to make early contact . " frenzel austria frost is a conventional food company that has turned organic .
they produce over 100,000 tons of vegetables and ready meals per year , including an organic range of products sold in german supermarkets . the company denied they are at risk of buying non-organic materials by mistake because they " control the whole process from growing the crop to production to quality control by management , " ahrer said . organic standards the same as other food regulations according to conventional food companies that have gone organic , adhering to the strict organic certification guidelines is no different from the regulations they follow for other food certification schemes and other food standards . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic frozen pretzels " our company has been certified with a variety of quality standards for several years already , " said kurt hassinger from the pretzel-baking company ditsch .
" we have the ifs , brc and organic certificates .
just to get these certifications we have to ensure that our raw materials , production process , etc. are in order and properly documented . " major pretzel-producer ditsch , which sell pretzel products in chain stores and supermarkets throughout germany , started experimenting with organic products in late 2006 .

they admire his iron rule , and the way he goes fishing topless .
but is it the real putin they know ? the images of putin at the eu-russian summit in samara which went around the world in may fast became iconic .
in his natty shades , black designer suit and knowing smile , he came across less like a democratically elected president and more like a professional hit man . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " for putin " reads this giant poster in moscow but icy efficiency seems to be exactly what putin wants to convey .
over the years , he 's learnt that cutting a telegenic dash through the world media is an effective way of showing what a tough guy he is . no doubt with this principle in mind , he made headlines in august when he took a brief break from running the country to go fishing in siberia with prince albert of monaco , abandoning the formal suits in favor of some camouflage chic .
the president then wasted no time stripping down to the waist , showing off a remarkably trim physique for a man of his years . although his antics met with plenty of raised eyebrows in the uptight west , this sort of macho posturing is not so much laughed at as admired back home in russia . " -lsb- putin -rsb- likes to profile himself as a protector , a strong man who 's also very sensible , " says russia expert hans-henning schröder from the foundation for science and politics .
" he embodies everything a russian woman wants in a man . " no one to trust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's more serious side in reality , his image as russia 's knight in shining armor is wishful thinking .
the country has no one it can trust - which is why it 's not so surprising that 70 percent of the public named the president in a recent survey of the most trustworthy institutions . only eight percent said they had faith in the unions , 15 percent in the judicial system and just 10 percent in political parties . " this is to be expected , " said schröder .
" the parties change every year and many of them are more likely to be imposed from above than be genuine representatives of the people .
the unions do n't care about the public and the judicial system is corrupt . " in contrast , putin must seem like a guardian angel , seen to have guided his people through the turmoil of the 1990s to moderate prosperity and helping secure the country a place within the new world order . " in fact , putin can not take the credit for this prosperity , " points out falk bomsdorf from the friedrich naumann foundation in moscow .
" it is largely due to the steep rise in oil prices .
but no one seems to care . " " national leader " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president or hit man ?
but the russians have undoubtedly never had it as good as under putin .
in the last eight years , wages have grown 50 percent , and the country has seen a slow but sure emergence of the middle class . " a class of small and medium-sized entrepreneurs has arisen which never existed before putin , " points out thomas kunze , who used to work at the konrad adenauer foundation in russia .
" they have a vested interest in his remaining in power . " as hans-henning schröder observed , few russians could live off their wages under putin 's predecessor boris yeltsin . " old people without pensions simply died .
back then , people had to fight to survive , " he said . unlike in germany after the second world war , democracy and a free market economy failed to result in an immediate boost to the standard of living in russia , he explained .
but life improved once putin began centralizing the economy . to many , he is still the only man able to run the show , which is why russia 's dominant united russia party has published a blueprint for formalizing the status of president vladimir putin as " national leader " after he steps down as president next year . indecisive bildunterschrift : a series of political rallies have cast the popular president as an indispensable leader schröder , however , believes that putin 's public image belies the truth of a far more indecisive character . uncompromising as he is on the world stage , putin is actually strikingly ineffective at home . " my impression is that putin has never been very assertive and has seldom made difficult decisions , " he points out . in the last four years , he has steered well clear of controversial issues such as health reforms .
in 2005 he hastily backed down on plans for social reform as soon as a few demonstrators took to the streets .
five years ago , he showed similar weakness when he refrained from intervening in a public spat between his defense minister and the head of the general staff over security policy . " had such an argument happened in germany , one of them would have been fired immediately , if not both , " said schröder . so why do the russians still love him ?
perhaps it 's because the putin approach is one that many of the more apolitical members of the population can identify with .
but , according to schröder , the president is by no means a typical russian . " he 's more typically german than russian , " he said .

the eit will have a governing body , a director and an executive committee , but will not be a new institute as such , eu ministers decided on friday , nov .
23 .
rather , it will network and pool resources from europe 's universities and will initially seek to focus research into three broad areas : energy , climate change and information technology .
the eu has earmarked 308.7 million euros -lrb- $ 455 million -rrb- for the functioning of the eit for a period of six years .
its budget has yet to receive final clearance , but eu officials expect the eit to be up and running some time in 2008 .
eu ministers meeting in brussels also agreed to set up four joint technology initiatives -lrb- jti -rrb- linking the private and public sector .
driven by industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : embedded computing systems are used in an increasing range of consumer products driven primarily by industry , the jtis will implement research programs in the fields of innovative medicines , nano-electronic technologies , aeronautics and air transport and embedded computing systems -lrb- invisible electronics and software used in cars and in an increasing range of consumer products -rrb- .
ministers also acknowledged the need to modernize europe 's universities and higher education institutions .
a report published this week by the european commission found that while productivity growth in the eu had gathered pace since 2005 , the 27-member bloc was likely to continue lagging behind the united states for years to come . insufficient investments in research , development and education were identified among the root causes for europe 's slow productivity growth .
on thursday , eu ministers made only limited progress in establishing an eu-wide patent system .
the initiative has stalled for years , in part because italy and spain want eu patents to be published in italian and spanish as well . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they admire his iron rule , and the way he goes fishing topless .
but is it the real putin they know ? the images of putin at the eu-russian summit in samara which went around the world in may fast became iconic .
in his natty shades , black designer suit and knowing smile , he came across less like a democratically elected president and more like a professional hit man . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " for putin " reads this giant poster in moscow but icy efficiency seems to be exactly what putin wants to convey .
over the years , he 's learnt that cutting a telegenic dash through the world media is an effective way of showing what a tough guy he is . no doubt with this principle in mind , he made headlines in august when he took a brief break from running the country to go fishing in siberia with prince albert of monaco , abandoning the formal suits in favor of some camouflage chic .
the president then wasted no time stripping down to the waist , showing off a remarkably trim physique for a man of his years . although his antics met with plenty of raised eyebrows in the uptight west , this sort of macho posturing is not so much laughed at as admired back home in russia . " -lsb- putin -rsb- likes to profile himself as a protector , a strong man who 's also very sensible , " says russia expert hans-henning schröder from the foundation for science and politics .
" he embodies everything a russian woman wants in a man . " no one to trust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's more serious side in reality , his image as russia 's knight in shining armor is wishful thinking .
the country has no one it can trust - which is why it 's not so surprising that 70 percent of the public named the president in a recent survey of the most trustworthy institutions . only eight percent said they had faith in the unions , 15 percent in the judicial system and just 10 percent in political parties . " this is to be expected , " said schröder .
" the parties change every year and many of them are more likely to be imposed from above than be genuine representatives of the people .
the unions do n't care about the public and the judicial system is corrupt . " in contrast , putin must seem like a guardian angel , seen to have guided his people through the turmoil of the 1990s to moderate prosperity and helping secure the country a place within the new world order . " in fact , putin can not take the credit for this prosperity , " points out falk bomsdorf from the friedrich naumann foundation in moscow .
" it is largely due to the steep rise in oil prices .
but no one seems to care . " " national leader " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president or hit man ?
but the russians have undoubtedly never had it as good as under putin .
in the last eight years , wages have grown 50 percent , and the country has seen a slow but sure emergence of the middle class . " a class of small and medium-sized entrepreneurs has arisen which never existed before putin , " points out thomas kunze , who used to work at the konrad adenauer foundation in russia .
" they have a vested interest in his remaining in power . " as hans-henning schröder observed , few russians could live off their wages under putin 's predecessor boris yeltsin . " old people without pensions simply died .
back then , people had to fight to survive , " he said . unlike in germany after the second world war , democracy and a free market economy failed to result in an immediate boost to the standard of living in russia , he explained .
but life improved once putin began centralizing the economy . to many , he is still the only man able to run the show , which is why russia 's dominant united russia party has published a blueprint for formalizing the status of president vladimir putin as " national leader " after he steps down as president next year . indecisive bildunterschrift : a series of political rallies have cast the popular president as an indispensable leader schröder , however , believes that putin 's public image belies the truth of a far more indecisive character . uncompromising as he is on the world stage , putin is actually strikingly ineffective at home . " my impression is that putin has never been very assertive and has seldom made difficult decisions , " he points out . in the last four years , he has steered well clear of controversial issues such as health reforms .
in 2005 he hastily backed down on plans for social reform as soon as a few demonstrators took to the streets .
five years ago , he showed similar weakness when he refrained from intervening in a public spat between his defense minister and the head of the general staff over security policy . " had such an argument happened in germany , one of them would have been fired immediately , if not both , " said schröder . so why do the russians still love him ?
perhaps it 's because the putin approach is one that many of the more apolitical members of the population can identify with .
but , according to schröder , the president is by no means a typical russian . " he 's more typically german than russian , " he said .

the eit will have a governing body , a director and an executive committee , but will not be a new institute as such , eu ministers decided on friday , nov .
23 .
rather , it will network and pool resources from europe 's universities and will initially seek to focus research into three broad areas : energy , climate change and information technology .
the eu has earmarked 308.7 million euros -lrb- $ 455 million -rrb- for the functioning of the eit for a period of six years .
its budget has yet to receive final clearance , but eu officials expect the eit to be up and running some time in 2008 .
eu ministers meeting in brussels also agreed to set up four joint technology initiatives -lrb- jti -rrb- linking the private and public sector .
driven by industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : embedded computing systems are used in an increasing range of consumer products driven primarily by industry , the jtis will implement research programs in the fields of innovative medicines , nano-electronic technologies , aeronautics and air transport and embedded computing systems -lrb- invisible electronics and software used in cars and in an increasing range of consumer products -rrb- .
ministers also acknowledged the need to modernize europe 's universities and higher education institutions .
a report published this week by the european commission found that while productivity growth in the eu had gathered pace since 2005 , the 27-member bloc was likely to continue lagging behind the united states for years to come . insufficient investments in research , development and education were identified among the root causes for europe 's slow productivity growth .
on thursday , eu ministers made only limited progress in establishing an eu-wide patent system .
the initiative has stalled for years , in part because italy and spain want eu patents to be published in italian and spanish as well . dpa news agency -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : russian parliamentary elections putin 's party wins russia elections amid vote-rigging claims kremlin takes heat from the west following dubious election opinion : democracy biggest loser in russian elections germany 's merkel criticizes lack of observers in russian poll russia -pipe- 24.11.2007 macho but indecisive , putin is all russia 's got großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you know you 're in safe hands with a leader like this the russians love their president .
they admire his iron rule , and the way he goes fishing topless .
but is it the real putin they know ? the images of putin at the eu-russian summit in samara which went around the world in may fast became iconic .
in his natty shades , black designer suit and knowing smile , he came across less like a democratically elected president and more like a professional hit man . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " for putin " reads this giant poster in moscow but icy efficiency seems to be exactly what putin wants to convey .
over the years , he 's learnt that cutting a telegenic dash through the world media is an effective way of showing what a tough guy he is . no doubt with this principle in mind , he made headlines in august when he took a brief break from running the country to go fishing in siberia with prince albert of monaco , abandoning the formal suits in favor of some camouflage chic .
the president then wasted no time stripping down to the waist , showing off a remarkably trim physique for a man of his years . although his antics met with plenty of raised eyebrows in the uptight west , this sort of macho posturing is not so much laughed at as admired back home in russia . " -lsb- putin -rsb- likes to profile himself as a protector , a strong man who 's also very sensible , " says russia expert hans-henning schröder from the foundation for science and politics .
" he embodies everything a russian woman wants in a man . " no one to trust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's more serious side in reality , his image as russia 's knight in shining armor is wishful thinking .
the country has no one it can trust - which is why it 's not so surprising that 70 percent of the public named the president in a recent survey of the most trustworthy institutions . only eight percent said they had faith in the unions , 15 percent in the judicial system and just 10 percent in political parties . " this is to be expected , " said schröder .
" the parties change every year and many of them are more likely to be imposed from above than be genuine representatives of the people .
the unions do n't care about the public and the judicial system is corrupt . " in contrast , putin must seem like a guardian angel , seen to have guided his people through the turmoil of the 1990s to moderate prosperity and helping secure the country a place within the new world order . " in fact , putin can not take the credit for this prosperity , " points out falk bomsdorf from the friedrich naumann foundation in moscow .
" it is largely due to the steep rise in oil prices .
but no one seems to care . " " national leader " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president or hit man ?
but the russians have undoubtedly never had it as good as under putin .
in the last eight years , wages have grown 50 percent , and the country has seen a slow but sure emergence of the middle class . " a class of small and medium-sized entrepreneurs has arisen which never existed before putin , " points out thomas kunze , who used to work at the konrad adenauer foundation in russia .
" they have a vested interest in his remaining in power . " as hans-henning schröder observed , few russians could live off their wages under putin 's predecessor boris yeltsin . " old people without pensions simply died .
back then , people had to fight to survive , " he said . unlike in germany after the second world war , democracy and a free market economy failed to result in an immediate boost to the standard of living in russia , he explained .
but life improved once putin began centralizing the economy . to many , he is still the only man able to run the show , which is why russia 's dominant united russia party has published a blueprint for formalizing the status of president vladimir putin as " national leader " after he steps down as president next year . indecisive bildunterschrift : a series of political rallies have cast the popular president as an indispensable leader schröder , however , believes that putin 's public image belies the truth of a far more indecisive character . uncompromising as he is on the world stage , putin is actually strikingly ineffective at home . " my impression is that putin has never been very assertive and has seldom made difficult decisions , " he points out . in the last four years , he has steered well clear of controversial issues such as health reforms .
in 2005 he hastily backed down on plans for social reform as soon as a few demonstrators took to the streets .
five years ago , he showed similar weakness when he refrained from intervening in a public spat between his defense minister and the head of the general staff over security policy . " had such an argument happened in germany , one of them would have been fired immediately , if not both , " said schröder . so why do the russians still love him ?
perhaps it 's because the putin approach is one that many of the more apolitical members of the population can identify with .
but , according to schröder , the president is by no means a typical russian . " he 's more typically german than russian , " he said .
" a typical russian has a bit more soul and likes to party more than he does . " manfred götzke -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the tiny country is struggling to cope with the influx - camps are bursting at the seams and xenophobia is on the rise . three years ago , jonas set out to make the long and dangerous journey to europe from his home country , eritrea .
there was absolutely no reason to stay there , he said .
although jonas finished high school with good marks and had found a job working for an oil company , his wages in eritrea were n't nearly enough to feed his family . " my aim was to get to europe and get a better education and find a good job , " he said .
" eritreans are people without hope .
i wanted to have a chance in life , and i also wanted be able to give something back to my people . " life-threatening crossing but jonas did n't expect that the crossing would be so dangerous .
many of his fellow passengers fell overboard during the journey and were left to drown .
others died of starvation on board . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boat load of africans hang onto a tuna net after their vessel sank off malta 's coast jonas was on his way to italy , a common destination for boats leaving the coast of africa .
but as happens with many other unseaworthy vessels , his boat was picked up by a maritime patrol , and he ended up being interned in malta .
jonas was released after a year , and now lives in a church-run refugee center . filled to capacity nearly 2,000 african boat people arrived in malta last year . a former british colony located 100km -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- south of sicily and 200km north of libya , malta has 405,000 inhabitants packed into seven tiny islands .
it 's the second most densely populated country in the world , and it 's not happy about having to house illegal immigrants . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the numbers of rufugees arriving in malta are less than italy or spain , but are growing malta , however , has a comparatively liberal and humanitarian refugee policy .
those who receive a humanitarian residency permit - mainly given to people from countries affected by civil war and internal conflicts such as somalia - are allowed to live in refugee accommodation . under european union law , asylum seekers must stay in the european country they first arrive in .
although malta is so tiny , it is a sovereign member of the eu , so anyone who lands is stuck there . to avert further humanitarian crises , malta has proposed that migrants whose boats founder in non-eu waters would be distributed evenly among the 27 eu countries . " the situation right now is just a complete mess , " the maltese interior minister , tonio borg , said several months ago .
" it 's a free-for-all .
each year 600 immigrants are dying on the threshold of europe .
it is unbelievable that on the doorstep of europe we are having this tragic situation and not enough is being done . " malta has three internment camps , which have been damned by amnesty international and visiting members of the european parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somalian women wait at the balzan refugee center and for those africans lucky enough to live outside the camps , the relationship to the maltese themselves is difficult .
the country has virtually no history of immigration , and reported cases of xenophobia are on the increase . " there are no real possibilities of getting on , of getting more training .

the tiny country is struggling to cope with the influx - camps are bursting at the seams and xenophobia is on the rise . three years ago , jonas set out to make the long and dangerous journey to europe from his home country , eritrea .
there was absolutely no reason to stay there , he said .
although jonas finished high school with good marks and had found a job working for an oil company , his wages in eritrea were n't nearly enough to feed his family . " my aim was to get to europe and get a better education and find a good job , " he said .
" eritreans are people without hope .
i wanted to have a chance in life , and i also wanted be able to give something back to my people . " life-threatening crossing but jonas did n't expect that the crossing would be so dangerous .
many of his fellow passengers fell overboard during the journey and were left to drown .
others died of starvation on board . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boat load of africans hang onto a tuna net after their vessel sank off malta 's coast jonas was on his way to italy , a common destination for boats leaving the coast of africa .
but as happens with many other unseaworthy vessels , his boat was picked up by a maritime patrol , and he ended up being interned in malta .
jonas was released after a year , and now lives in a church-run refugee center . filled to capacity nearly 2,000 african boat people arrived in malta last year . a former british colony located 100km -lrb- 62 miles -rrb- south of sicily and 200km north of libya , malta has 405,000 inhabitants packed into seven tiny islands .
it 's the second most densely populated country in the world , and it 's not happy about having to house illegal immigrants . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the numbers of rufugees arriving in malta are less than italy or spain , but are growing malta , however , has a comparatively liberal and humanitarian refugee policy .
those who receive a humanitarian residency permit - mainly given to people from countries affected by civil war and internal conflicts such as somalia - are allowed to live in refugee accommodation . under european union law , asylum seekers must stay in the european country they first arrive in .
although malta is so tiny , it is a sovereign member of the eu , so anyone who lands is stuck there . to avert further humanitarian crises , malta has proposed that migrants whose boats founder in non-eu waters would be distributed evenly among the 27 eu countries . " the situation right now is just a complete mess , " the maltese interior minister , tonio borg , said several months ago .
" it 's a free-for-all .
each year 600 immigrants are dying on the threshold of europe .
it is unbelievable that on the doorstep of europe we are having this tragic situation and not enough is being done . " malta has three internment camps , which have been damned by amnesty international and visiting members of the european parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somalian women wait at the balzan refugee center and for those africans lucky enough to live outside the camps , the relationship to the maltese themselves is difficult .

even if you have skills , you ca n't use them here .

they admire his iron rule , and the way he goes fishing topless .
but is it the real putin they know ? the images of putin at the eu-russian summit in samara which went around the world in may fast became iconic .
in his natty shades , black designer suit and knowing smile , he came across less like a democratically elected president and more like a professional hit man . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " for putin " reads this giant poster in moscow but icy efficiency seems to be exactly what putin wants to convey .
over the years , he 's learnt that cutting a telegenic dash through the world media is an effective way of showing what a tough guy he is . no doubt with this principle in mind , he made headlines in august when he took a brief break from running the country to go fishing in siberia with prince albert of monaco , abandoning the formal suits in favor of some camouflage chic .
the president then wasted no time stripping down to the waist , showing off a remarkably trim physique for a man of his years . although his antics met with plenty of raised eyebrows in the uptight west , this sort of macho posturing is not so much laughed at as admired back home in russia . " -lsb- putin -rsb- likes to profile himself as a protector , a strong man who 's also very sensible , " says russia expert hans-henning schröder from the foundation for science and politics .
" he embodies everything a russian woman wants in a man . " no one to trust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's more serious side in reality , his image as russia 's knight in shining armor is wishful thinking .
the country has no one it can trust - which is why it 's not so surprising that 70 percent of the public named the president in a recent survey of the most trustworthy institutions . only eight percent said they had faith in the unions , 15 percent in the judicial system and just 10 percent in political parties . " this is to be expected , " said schröder .
" the parties change every year and many of them are more likely to be imposed from above than be genuine representatives of the people .
the unions do n't care about the public and the judicial system is corrupt . " in contrast , putin must seem like a guardian angel , seen to have guided his people through the turmoil of the 1990s to moderate prosperity and helping secure the country a place within the new world order . " in fact , putin can not take the credit for this prosperity , " points out falk bomsdorf from the friedrich naumann foundation in moscow .
" it is largely due to the steep rise in oil prices .
but no one seems to care . " " national leader " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president or hit man ?
but the russians have undoubtedly never had it as good as under putin .
in the last eight years , wages have grown 50 percent , and the country has seen a slow but sure emergence of the middle class . " a class of small and medium-sized entrepreneurs has arisen which never existed before putin , " points out thomas kunze , who used to work at the konrad adenauer foundation in russia .
" they have a vested interest in his remaining in power . " as hans-henning schröder observed , few russians could live off their wages under putin 's predecessor boris yeltsin . " old people without pensions simply died .
back then , people had to fight to survive , " he said . unlike in germany after the second world war , democracy and a free market economy failed to result in an immediate boost to the standard of living in russia , he explained .
but life improved once putin began centralizing the economy . to many , he is still the only man able to run the show , which is why russia 's dominant united russia party has published a blueprint for formalizing the status of president vladimir putin as " national leader " after he steps down as president next year . indecisive bildunterschrift : a series of political rallies have cast the popular president as an indispensable leader schröder , however , believes that putin 's public image belies the truth of a far more indecisive character . uncompromising as he is on the world stage , putin is actually strikingly ineffective at home . " my impression is that putin has never been very assertive and has seldom made difficult decisions , " he points out . in the last four years , he has steered well clear of controversial issues such as health reforms .
in 2005 he hastily backed down on plans for social reform as soon as a few demonstrators took to the streets .
five years ago , he showed similar weakness when he refrained from intervening in a public spat between his defense minister and the head of the general staff over security policy . " had such an argument happened in germany , one of them would have been fired immediately , if not both , " said schröder . so why do the russians still love him ?
perhaps it 's because the putin approach is one that many of the more apolitical members of the population can identify with .
but , according to schröder , the president is by no means a typical russian . " he 's more typically german than russian , " he said .
" a typical russian has a bit more soul and likes to party more than he does . " manfred götzke -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

organic products have been on their supermarket shelves for years and this wider availability has had a positive impact on sales . the sector 's growth has been largely driven by supermarket sales , which make up almost half of the total number of organic retail sales in germany .
in 2006 the trade in organic food products in both specialized organic stores and regular supermarkets topped 4.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.5 billion -rrb- . that growth has prompted many more players to enter the market , including well-established conventional food manufactures and supermarket chains . this has many of the traditional organic companies , some of whom have been in the business for decades , worried these new players might damage the industry . is it really organic ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even some packet puddings are organic in germany the organic food industry association , an umbrella group representing organic farming , retail and traders association , is warning companies wanting to cash in on the organics trade to beware when buying organic raw materials .
they said inexperience in recognizing organic products could lead to companies buying fakes . " the traditional producers know where and how to buy organic raw materials , whereas those who come freshly into the market will have more difficulties , " the association 's president , felix prinz zu löwenstein , said . one company with a lot of industry experience is bio zentrale - an all organic company that has been selling organic food products in germany for over 30 years . " conventional companies do n't have the experience - they might just believe the organic certificate .
but we analyse it and if we find traces of pesticides then we will send it back , " marc netten from bio-zentrale said . shortfall of organic raw materials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic was a feature at the anuga food fair in cologne part of the concern over the arrival of new organic products by conventional producers is driven by a shortage of organic raw materials .
currently the organic farming sector is not growing at the same rate as the demand for organic products .
a shortage in organic raw materials grown in germany has meant that producers have begun to look far and wide for new producers to keep up their demand . " to get organic wheat is very difficult at the moment .
usually we buy our oats in germany or austria but at the moment we are also buying them in australia , " netten said . " while they have a certificate from australia certifying them as organic , nobody knows what happens on the ship . " for this reason the company analyses the oats it buys in a lab .
this takes one to two weeks and is adds to their production costs but bio-zentrale said it is only through doing their own tests that they feel confident in certifying it as organic . conventional companies claim they 're capable conventional companies acknowledge the difficulties in purchasing organically grown goods at the moment . " our problem is to ensure that you get the quantities of raw materials that you need , " said dominik ahrer , director marketing and sales of frenzel austria frost .
" our customers say they want organic .
the problem is not the price , it is getting the product so you have to make early contact . " frenzel austria frost is a conventional food company that has turned organic .
they produce over 100,000 tons of vegetables and ready meals per year , including an organic range of products sold in german supermarkets . the company denied they are at risk of buying non-organic materials by mistake because they " control the whole process from growing the crop to production to quality control by management , " ahrer said . organic standards the same as other food regulations according to conventional food companies that have gone organic , adhering to the strict organic certification guidelines is no different from the regulations they follow for other food certification schemes and other food standards . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic frozen pretzels " our company has been certified with a variety of quality standards for several years already , " said kurt hassinger from the pretzel-baking company ditsch .

but is it the real putin they know ? the images of putin at the eu-russian summit in samara which went around the world in may fast became iconic .
in his natty shades , black designer suit and knowing smile , he came across less like a democratically elected president and more like a professional hit man . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " for putin " reads this giant poster in moscow but icy efficiency seems to be exactly what putin wants to convey .
over the years , he 's learnt that cutting a telegenic dash through the world media is an effective way of showing what a tough guy he is . no doubt with this principle in mind , he made headlines in august when he took a brief break from running the country to go fishing in siberia with prince albert of monaco , abandoning the formal suits in favor of some camouflage chic .
the president then wasted no time stripping down to the waist , showing off a remarkably trim physique for a man of his years . although his antics met with plenty of raised eyebrows in the uptight west , this sort of macho posturing is not so much laughed at as admired back home in russia . " -lsb- putin -rsb- likes to profile himself as a protector , a strong man who 's also very sensible , " says russia expert hans-henning schröder from the foundation for science and politics .
" he embodies everything a russian woman wants in a man . " no one to trust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's more serious side in reality , his image as russia 's knight in shining armor is wishful thinking .
the country has no one it can trust - which is why it 's not so surprising that 70 percent of the public named the president in a recent survey of the most trustworthy institutions . only eight percent said they had faith in the unions , 15 percent in the judicial system and just 10 percent in political parties . " this is to be expected , " said schröder .
" the parties change every year and many of them are more likely to be imposed from above than be genuine representatives of the people .
the unions do n't care about the public and the judicial system is corrupt . " in contrast , putin must seem like a guardian angel , seen to have guided his people through the turmoil of the 1990s to moderate prosperity and helping secure the country a place within the new world order . " in fact , putin can not take the credit for this prosperity , " points out falk bomsdorf from the friedrich naumann foundation in moscow .
" it is largely due to the steep rise in oil prices .
but no one seems to care . " " national leader " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president or hit man ?
but the russians have undoubtedly never had it as good as under putin .
in the last eight years , wages have grown 50 percent , and the country has seen a slow but sure emergence of the middle class . " a class of small and medium-sized entrepreneurs has arisen which never existed before putin , " points out thomas kunze , who used to work at the konrad adenauer foundation in russia .
" they have a vested interest in his remaining in power . " as hans-henning schröder observed , few russians could live off their wages under putin 's predecessor boris yeltsin . " old people without pensions simply died .
back then , people had to fight to survive , " he said . unlike in germany after the second world war , democracy and a free market economy failed to result in an immediate boost to the standard of living in russia , he explained .
but life improved once putin began centralizing the economy . to many , he is still the only man able to run the show , which is why russia 's dominant united russia party has published a blueprint for formalizing the status of president vladimir putin as " national leader " after he steps down as president next year . indecisive bildunterschrift : a series of political rallies have cast the popular president as an indispensable leader schröder , however , believes that putin 's public image belies the truth of a far more indecisive character . uncompromising as he is on the world stage , putin is actually strikingly ineffective at home . " my impression is that putin has never been very assertive and has seldom made difficult decisions , " he points out . in the last four years , he has steered well clear of controversial issues such as health reforms .
in 2005 he hastily backed down on plans for social reform as soon as a few demonstrators took to the streets .
five years ago , he showed similar weakness when he refrained from intervening in a public spat between his defense minister and the head of the general staff over security policy . " had such an argument happened in germany , one of them would have been fired immediately , if not both , " said schröder . so why do the russians still love him ?
perhaps it 's because the putin approach is one that many of the more apolitical members of the population can identify with .
but , according to schröder , the president is by no means a typical russian . " he 's more typically german than russian , " he said .

" frequently heads will tell me , ' i 've been kicked frequently by children , i 've been head-butted and punched ' , " she continued .
' long-term concern ' ms hovey said such attacks had a major and long-term affect , with some teachers never recovering .

the council of mortgage lenders estimate that 145,000 mortgages will be over 3 months in arrears by the end of 2007 .
this week , senior county court judge michael tennant , told money box that some borrowers are being forced into repaying their arrears far more quickly than they can afford .
we asked for your comments - a selection of which are below - the debate is now closed .
i have had cause to contact my mortgage lender 3 times in the past year with regard to payments .
on every occasion they have been very uncooperative .
i requested to change my direct debit day as my pay date had changed to the 31st of the month and this was refused as they did not take direct debits after the 28th of the month .
hardly customer friendly .
it took 10 weeks to resolve .
secondly , and more importantly , i requested a mortgage payment holiday well in advance as i knew my job was coming to an end .
this was refused as my ex-husband , whose name was still on the mortgage , refused to sign .
it took 6 weeks to resolve .
on both occasions i could not resolve these issues by telephone but had to write to the complaints dept .
now , i am unable to pay by direct debit as my income comes intermittently and although i can pay on the due date , the lender will not allow me to pay until the following day , thus putting me in arrears !
the lender are unbelievably old-fashioned , uncooperative and not customer friendly .
i am appalled .
joy , wales i am 12 months in arrears with my mortgage because i suffered a serious injury and attack .
i am unable to walk or work .
i have claimed benefits but they are not sufficient .
the mortgage -lrb- and the arrears -rrb- amount to less than 30 % of the value of the property .
the mortgage has 5 years to run .
the mortgage is a repayment mortgage and i have an endowment policy which at it 's lowest prediction is set to pay off the mortgage -lrb- including the arrears -rrb- with a surplus -lrb- one of the few -rrb- .
the lender are charging me their highest standard variable rate .
they are also charging me £ 40 per month for being in arrears .
i have repeatedly requested that they agree to add the value of the arrears to the mortgage -lrb- for the rest of the mortgage term -rrb- which would reduce my payments to a manageable level ; they have refused .
instead , they demand that i pay £ 360 pounds per month on top of the amount paid by the income support so that the arrears will be repaid in 24 months .
at the same time they will be charging me £ 40 each month -lrb- to be added to the outstanding capital -rrb- until the arrears are repaid .
i can not afford this .
i have advised this but their response is to threaten repossession .

the council of mortgage lenders estimate that 145,000 mortgages will be over 3 months in arrears by the end of 2007 .
this week , senior county court judge michael tennant , told money box that some borrowers are being forced into repaying their arrears far more quickly than they can afford .
we asked for your comments - a selection of which are below - the debate is now closed .
i have had cause to contact my mortgage lender 3 times in the past year with regard to payments .
on every occasion they have been very uncooperative .
i requested to change my direct debit day as my pay date had changed to the 31st of the month and this was refused as they did not take direct debits after the 28th of the month .
hardly customer friendly .
it took 10 weeks to resolve .
secondly , and more importantly , i requested a mortgage payment holiday well in advance as i knew my job was coming to an end .
this was refused as my ex-husband , whose name was still on the mortgage , refused to sign .
it took 6 weeks to resolve .
on both occasions i could not resolve these issues by telephone but had to write to the complaints dept .
now , i am unable to pay by direct debit as my income comes intermittently and although i can pay on the due date , the lender will not allow me to pay until the following day , thus putting me in arrears !
the lender are unbelievably old-fashioned , uncooperative and not customer friendly .
i am appalled .
joy , wales i am 12 months in arrears with my mortgage because i suffered a serious injury and attack .
i am unable to walk or work .
i have claimed benefits but they are not sufficient .
the mortgage -lrb- and the arrears -rrb- amount to less than 30 % of the value of the property .
the mortgage has 5 years to run .
the mortgage is a repayment mortgage and i have an endowment policy which at it 's lowest prediction is set to pay off the mortgage -lrb- including the arrears -rrb- with a surplus -lrb- one of the few -rrb- .
the lender are charging me their highest standard variable rate .
they are also charging me £ 40 per month for being in arrears .
i have repeatedly requested that they agree to add the value of the arrears to the mortgage -lrb- for the rest of the mortgage term -rrb- which would reduce my payments to a manageable level ; they have refused .
instead , they demand that i pay £ 360 pounds per month on top of the amount paid by the income support so that the arrears will be repaid in 24 months .
at the same time they will be charging me £ 40 each month -lrb- to be added to the outstanding capital -rrb- until the arrears are repaid .
i can not afford this .
i have advised this but their response is to threaten repossession .
rupert , london the comments we publish are not necessarily the views of the bbc but will reflect the balance of views we have received .

i requested to change my direct debit day as my pay date had changed to the 31st of the month and this was refused as they did not take direct debits after the 28th of the month .
hardly customer friendly .
it took 10 weeks to resolve .
secondly , and more importantly , i requested a mortgage payment holiday well in advance as i knew my job was coming to an end .
this was refused as my ex-husband , whose name was still on the mortgage , refused to sign .
it took 6 weeks to resolve .
on both occasions i could not resolve these issues by telephone but had to write to the complaints dept .
now , i am unable to pay by direct debit as my income comes intermittently and although i can pay on the due date , the lender will not allow me to pay until the following day , thus putting me in arrears !
the lender are unbelievably old-fashioned , uncooperative and not customer friendly .
i am appalled .

born in september 1957 in the coastal hinterland north of brisbane , kevin michael rudd lost his father - a farmer - at the age of 11 .
apparently facing eviction from the farm and with nowhere else to go , his mother , margaret , was forced to sleep overnight in a car with two of her four young children .
four years later , mr rudd joined the australian labor party , his family 's experience of hardship having partly contributed to the decision . "
there 's a clinical side to him , and sometimes he keeps his passion under wraps " bruce hawker strip club visit dents rudd 's halo as a student , he studied chinese language and history at the australian national university , from where mr rudd joined the foreign service , serving as a diplomat in both sweden and china .
but in 1988 he decided to change paths and became the chief of staff to the labor premier in queensland .
ten years later , after carving out a reputation as a competent if slightly humourless technocrat - colleagues nicknamed him dr death - he won election to parliament for the queensland seat of griffith .
whilst he harboured prime ministerial ambitions when he first arrived in canberra , it would be eight years before he became labor leader , after impressing colleagues with his performance as shadow minister for foreign affairs .
a committed christian , with a neat turn in sound-bites , he seemed particularly well-equipped to appeal to the suburban swing voters who tend to decide australian elections .
so in december 2006 he won the leadership , despite not having many close friends in the labor caucus and little personal following .
his public persona appeared to have no cracks and his character withstood attacks by government on his honesty , questioning whether he exaggerated stories of his childhood hardship , and even the death of his father .
if there was something mechanical about his rise , there is also something mechanical about the man , says the bbc news sydney correspondent nick bryant .
austere , cerebral and self-disciplined , he is easy to respect but harder to like , our correspondent says .
" tarnish " " there 's a clinical side to him , and sometimes he keeps his passion under wraps , " says political consultant bruce hawker , who has been a friend since the 1980s .
" but he 's genuinely funny , and as he becomes more comfortable in the role of leader , that side of his personality will come out more , " he said .
yet his so-called " armour-plating " could not protect him when news stories emerged in august this year of his visit to a new york strip club , four years ago .
the stories of his drunken trip in manhattan inevitably tarnished his image .
while many australians were left surprised at the revelations about this sober politician 's colourful background , jokes abounded in the media of " reckless rudd " .
tough talk and it drew mixed comment from the political pundits , some saying he would benefit from a new " everyman " tag and would not affect his core vote , others predicting the revelations could damage his chances .
yet mr rudd 's christianity still seems to give him protection .
his fiscal cautiousness makes it hard to portray him as a profligate tax and spender , while his years as a diplomat lend him strong national security credentials .
his experience also makes it harder for pundits to place the learner sticker on mr rudd than it was with his predecessor mark latham , says sol lebovic , the chairman of newspoll .
mr rudd has promised to withdraw australian troops from iraq and sign the kyoto climate pact .
he has also pledged sweeping reforms to health , education and controversial labour laws introduced by pm john howard .

born in september 1957 in the coastal hinterland north of brisbane , kevin michael rudd lost his father - a farmer - at the age of 11 .
apparently facing eviction from the farm and with nowhere else to go , his mother , margaret , was forced to sleep overnight in a car with two of her four young children .
four years later , mr rudd joined the australian labor party , his family 's experience of hardship having partly contributed to the decision .
there 's a clinical side to him , and sometimes he keeps his passion under wraps bruce hawker strip club visit dents rudd 's halo as a student , he studied chinese language and history at the australian national university , from where mr rudd joined the foreign service , serving as a diplomat in both sweden and china .
but in 1988 he decided to change paths and became the chief of staff to the labor premier in queensland .
ten years later , after carving out a reputation as a competent if slightly humourless technocrat - colleagues nicknamed him dr death - he won election to parliament for the queensland seat of griffith .
whilst he harboured prime ministerial ambitions when he first arrived in canberra , it would be eight years before he became labor leader , after impressing colleagues with his performance as shadow minister for foreign affairs .
a committed christian , with a neat turn in sound-bites , he seemed particularly well-equipped to appeal to the suburban swing voters who tend to decide australian elections .
so in december 2006 he won the leadership , despite not having many close friends in the labor caucus and little personal following .
kevin rudd -lrb- right -rrb- has overtaken john howard in popularity ratings his public persona appeared to have no cracks and his character withstood attacks by government on his honesty , questioning whether he exaggerated stories of his childhood hardship , and even the death of his father .
if there was something mechanical about his rise , there is also something mechanical about the man , says the bbc news sydney correspondent nick bryant .
austere , cerebral and self-disciplined , he is easy to respect but harder to like , our correspondent says .
" tarnish " " there 's a clinical side to him , and sometimes he keeps his passion under wraps , " says political consultant bruce hawker , who has been a friend since the 1980s .
" but he 's genuinely funny , and as he becomes more comfortable in the role of leader , that side of his personality will come out more , " he said .
yet his so-called " armour-plating " could not protect him when news stories emerged in august this year of his visit to a new york strip club , four years ago .
the stories of his drunken trip in manhattan inevitably tarnished his image .
while many australians were left surprised at the revelations about this sober politician 's colourful background , jokes abounded in the media of " reckless rudd " .
tough talk and it drew mixed comment from the political pundits , some saying he would benefit from a new " everyman " tag and would not affect his core vote , others predicting the revelations could damage his chances .
yet mr rudd 's christianity still seems to give him protection .
his fiscal cautiousness makes it hard to portray him as a profligate tax and spender , while his years as a diplomat lend him strong national security credentials .
his experience also makes it harder for pundits to place the learner sticker on mr rudd than it was with his predecessor mark latham , says sol lebovic , the chairman of newspoll .
mr rudd has promised to withdraw australian troops from iraq and sign the kyoto climate pact .
he has also pledged sweeping reforms to health , education and controversial labour laws introduced by pm john howard .

as head of the liberal party within the ruling liberal-national coalition , he has driven his government in the face of strong , sometimes violent opposition .
he took his country to war in iraq despite huge domestic opposition .
for a while , opinion swung in his favour when the war ended with no australian casualties .
but many australians now believe their government 's support for the war in the iraq has increased the likelihood of a terrorist attack on australian soil , according to the australian survey of social attitudes , quoted in the sydney morning herald .
mr howard 's opposition to the kyoto protocol on climate change - another sign of his loyalty to the bush administration - has likewise proved to be out of touch with voters ' feelings .
the prime minister has also pushed through laws on gun control , aboriginal land ownership , compulsory trade unionism and welfare spending - all in the face of strong resistance .
tough his tough stance on asylum seekers made headlines throughout the world , especially in 2001 when he refused to allow 400 migrants picked up by a norwegian cargo ship into the country .
australia stands proud and tall around the world .
we are seen as a nation prepared to take a stand on difficult international issues .
john howard , election campaign launch -lrb- october 2004 -rrb- while criticised by human right groups , his actions gained him the support of many middle-class australians .
successful interventions in east timor and the solomon islands also won him domestic - and international - praise .
but mr howard 's forthright policy moves eventually backfired , leading to a conclusive defeat in november 's election .
the australian survey of social attitudes suggests that while australian voters are concerned about high taxes , most would be reluctant to sacrifice social services in the name of a lower tax bill .
the liberals ' changes to labour laws , making it easier for employers to hire and fire staff , have also caused unease .
john howard is a close ally of george bush even the " aspirational voters " - upwardly-mobile , self-employed people who might be seen as the liberals ' core constituency - drifted to kevin rudd 's labor party .
many observers noted that at times of crisis , mr howard appeared to relish the opportunity to appear statesman-like and authoritative .
in 2004 , at the age of 65 - a time of life when most people are looking forward to a well-earned retirement - mr howard campaigned for and won a fourth term in office .
and in 2006 , following a public spat with his deputy and long-term heir apparent , peter costello , mr howard said he would stay on to fight 2007 elections .
but as the election loomed , some commentators wondered if he was losing his nerve .
after doggedly opposing the idea of a public apology to aborigines , in october mr howard suddenly proposed a referendum on constitutional change to give special recognition to aborigines ' historic status in australia .
rise to power mr howard was born in sydney on 26 july 1939 .
his parents ran a petrol station in a middle-class suburb .
at the age of 18 , mr howard joined the young liberal movement and was involved in student politics at the university of sydney .
but for his first career he shunned politics and became a solicitor .
in 1962 he was admitted to the new south wales supreme court , and then went on to become a partner in a sydney law firm .
it was during that time that he met and married a teacher , janette , with whom he has three children .
mr howard entered the political arena in 1974 when he ran for the federal seat of bennelong - a seat he has held ever since .
after a liberal victory under malcolm fraser in 1975 , he rapidly moved up the ranks and was elected deputy leader in 1982 .
we decide who comes into this country and the circumstances in which they come mr howard , explaining his approach to asylum -lrb- 2001 election campaign -rrb- the following year , however , his party lost the election to labor and struggled to regain its support-base for more than a decade .
mr howard was elected leader of the party , and thus leader of the opposition , in 1985 - losing it to andrew peacock in 1989 but regaining it after the resignation of alexander downer in 1995 .
soon afterwards , mr howard led the party - in coalition with the national party - to a huge victory over labor in the march 1996 poll , and john howard became the country 's 25th prime minister .
he was then to lead the liberal-national coalition to further wins in 1998 , 2001 and 2004 .
