the country also saw a surge of new passenger car registrations - mainly a result of buyers rushing to beat a tax hike . new car sales in germany reached their highest level in seven years in 2006 , the german automotive industry association -lrb- vda -rrb- said this week . a total of 3.47 million vehicles were sold in the 12 months ending in december , vda said .
the four percent increase from the previous year 's total was primarily a result of a surge in new car registrations in the last two months of 2006 . " those were two fabulous months , but the results are exceptions to the automakers ' normal sales levels , " said vda president bernd gottschalk . new models , incentives and improved consumer confidence , especially among private customers , contributed to the development , vda said .
but there was also a rush to buy ahead of the country 's value-added or sales tax -lrb- vat -rrb- increase .
germany raised this tax by three percent to 19 percent as of january 1 , 2007 . " business was booming at the end of the year ; the warehouses were emptied , " gottschalk said .
" now we have to hope that we do n't get off to a rocky start in the new year . " industry hopes positive trend will continue for 2007 , the market environment at the start of the year would be strained , especially by a reduced tax break for commuters and an additional hike in fuel prices , vda said .
the higher sales tax and insurance tax would also play a role . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vw bug has been one of the most famous german cars in history " now , everything depends on whether or not we 've cleared the hurdle and can look forward to strong economic growth and improved consumer confidence , " gottschalk said .
" there 's certainly no lack of new models , and lots of consumers need to replace older cars . " gottschalk said the average age of a passenger car in germany was over eight years .
this was older than ever before . exports remain strong exports reached a record high of 3.9 million vehicles in 2006 , a 2.5 percent increase .
even on the us market , which registered a decline of 3 percent , german companies still succeeded in boosting their sales by six percent to 921,000 vehicles , vda said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : audi is a popular car worldwide in production , a total of 5.4 million passenger cars rolled off german automakers ' assembly lines in 2006 .
this one percent increase represented a new production record and demonstrated the industry 's domestic success , gottschalk said . " at the same time , the german automakers ' 13 percent increase in production at plants abroad shows that they are playing an active role in the process of globalization , " gottschalk said . vda said it expected turnover to remain stable in 2007 . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vw sales hit record high as executive faces trial golfs , polos , passats and other favorite vw models have been selling like hotcakes , volkswagen has announced .

the country also saw a surge of new passenger car registrations - mainly a result of buyers rushing to beat a tax hike . new car sales in germany reached their highest level in seven years in 2006 , the german automotive industry association -lrb- vda -rrb- said this week . a total of 3.47 million vehicles were sold in the 12 months ending in december , vda said .
the four percent increase from the previous year 's total was primarily a result of a surge in new car registrations in the last two months of 2006 . " those were two fabulous months , but the results are exceptions to the automakers ' normal sales levels , " said vda president bernd gottschalk . new models , incentives and improved consumer confidence , especially among private customers , contributed to the development , vda said .
but there was also a rush to buy ahead of the country 's value-added or sales tax -lrb- vat -rrb- increase .
germany raised this tax by three percent to 19 percent as of january 1 , 2007 . " business was booming at the end of the year ; the warehouses were emptied , " gottschalk said .
" now we have to hope that we do n't get off to a rocky start in the new year . " industry hopes positive trend will continue for 2007 , the market environment at the start of the year would be strained , especially by a reduced tax break for commuters and an additional hike in fuel prices , vda said .
the higher sales tax and insurance tax would also play a role . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vw bug has been one of the most famous german cars in history " now , everything depends on whether or not we 've cleared the hurdle and can look forward to strong economic growth and improved consumer confidence , " gottschalk said .
" there 's certainly no lack of new models , and lots of consumers need to replace older cars . " gottschalk said the average age of a passenger car in germany was over eight years .
this was older than ever before . exports remain strong exports reached a record high of 3.9 million vehicles in 2006 , a 2.5 percent increase .
even on the us market , which registered a decline of 3 percent , german companies still succeeded in boosting their sales by six percent to 921,000 vehicles , vda said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : audi is a popular car worldwide in production , a total of 5.4 million passenger cars rolled off german automakers ' assembly lines in 2006 .
this one percent increase represented a new production record and demonstrated the industry 's domestic success , gottschalk said . " at the same time , the german automakers ' 13 percent increase in production at plants abroad shows that they are playing an active role in the process of globalization , " gottschalk said . vda said it expected turnover to remain stable in 2007 . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vw sales hit record high as executive faces trial golfs , polos , passats and other favorite vw models have been selling like hotcakes , volkswagen has announced .

villepin said the law would " make france one of the most advanced countries in terms of social rights . "
housing would become the third legally enforceable right in france , along with access to education and healthcare .
four months ahead of presidential elections , with the homeless issue thrust centre-stage , the housing measure was seen as a bid by the centre-right to underscore its commitment to social justice .

"
this is where hafida sadek lives with her two children .
as a maid , she earns 680 euros per month .
that is n't much in paris .
a 10-square-meter apartment in the french capital costs about 500 euros .
" i have been trying for 10 years to get a subsidized apartment but they keep telling me there are n't any available , " sadek said .
it is people like sadek - an estimated 100,000 of them in france - that an organization called the children of don quixote is fighting for .
it was this group which took over the abandoned office building in a ritzy part of paris to provide housing for people such as sadek and has been calling on the government to help them .
and it seems that these days , the french government is listening .
politicians jumping on the wagon this week , the french government announced plans to create a " legal right " to housing in response to a snowballing campaign that has seen a tent city for the homeless spring up in the heart of paris .
bildunterschrift : tent cities have sprung up all over france prime minister dominique de villepin said a bill would be presented to the cabinet on january 17 and hopefully adopted before parliament breaks up ahead of april 's presidential election .
the law , if passed , would make france the second european country to guarantee the right to housing , after scotland which adopted similar measures with its 2003 homeless act .

"
this is where hafida sadek lives with her two children .
as a maid , she earns 680 euros per month .
that is n't much in paris .
a 10-square-meter apartment in the french capital costs about 500 euros .
" i have been trying for 10 years to get a subsidized apartment but they keep telling me there are n't any available , " sadek said .
it is people like sadek - an estimated 100,000 of them in france - that an organization called the children of don quixote is fighting for .
it was this group which took over the abandoned office building in a ritzy part of paris to provide housing for people such as sadek and has been calling on the government to help them .
and it seems that these days , the french government is listening .
politicians jumping on the wagon this week , the french government announced plans to create a " legal right " to housing in response to a snowballing campaign that has seen a tent city for the homeless spring up in the heart of paris .
bildunterschrift : tent cities have sprung up all over france prime minister dominique de villepin said a bill would be presented to the cabinet on january 17 and hopefully adopted before parliament breaks up ahead of april 's presidential election .
the law , if passed , would make france the second european country to guarantee the right to housing , after scotland which adopted similar measures with its 2003 homeless act .

the country also saw a surge of new passenger car registrations - mainly a result of buyers rushing to beat a tax hike . new car sales in germany reached their highest level in seven years in 2006 , the german automotive industry association -lrb- vda -rrb- said this week . a total of 3.47 million vehicles were sold in the 12 months ending in december , vda said .
the four percent increase from the previous year 's total was primarily a result of a surge in new car registrations in the last two months of 2006 . " those were two fabulous months , but the results are exceptions to the automakers ' normal sales levels , " said vda president bernd gottschalk . new models , incentives and improved consumer confidence , especially among private customers , contributed to the development , vda said .
but there was also a rush to buy ahead of the country 's value-added or sales tax -lrb- vat -rrb- increase .
germany raised this tax by three percent to 19 percent as of january 1 , 2007 . " business was booming at the end of the year ; the warehouses were emptied , " gottschalk said .
" now we have to hope that we do n't get off to a rocky start in the new year . " industry hopes positive trend will continue for 2007 , the market environment at the start of the year would be strained , especially by a reduced tax break for commuters and an additional hike in fuel prices , vda said .
the higher sales tax and insurance tax would also play a role . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vw bug has been one of the most famous german cars in history " now , everything depends on whether or not we 've cleared the hurdle and can look forward to strong economic growth and improved consumer confidence , " gottschalk said .
" there 's certainly no lack of new models , and lots of consumers need to replace older cars . " gottschalk said the average age of a passenger car in germany was over eight years .
this was older than ever before . exports remain strong exports reached a record high of 3.9 million vehicles in 2006 , a 2.5 percent increase .
even on the us market , which registered a decline of 3 percent , german companies still succeeded in boosting their sales by six percent to 921,000 vehicles , vda said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : audi is a popular car worldwide in production , a total of 5.4 million passenger cars rolled off german automakers ' assembly lines in 2006 .
this one percent increase represented a new production record and demonstrated the industry 's domestic success , gottschalk said . " at the same time , the german automakers ' 13 percent increase in production at plants abroad shows that they are playing an active role in the process of globalization , " gottschalk said . vda said it expected turnover to remain stable in 2007 . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vw sales hit record high as executive faces trial golfs , polos , passats and other favorite vw models have been selling like hotcakes , volkswagen has announced .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the german eu presidency a dummy 's guide to the eu german fm : kosovo biggest problem right now commission proposes eu-wide green card for migrants germany determined to strengthen european police agency european union -pipe- 06.01.2007 " without values , this eu has no future " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pöttering has been a european parliamentarian since 1979 dw-tv talked to hans-gert pöttering , the likely new president of the european parliament , about the german eu presidency , the chances for an eu constitution and his plans as leader of the bloc 's legislative . dw-tv : germany has taken on the eu 's rotating presidency and with it the running of the bloc 's business for the next six months .
what can we expect ? hans-gert pöttering : i would like the german presidency to come up with a way of moving forward .
and i would like a decision on what mandate any conference on the european constitution would have - if such a conference takes place - in an attempt to realize the main goal of the constitution . when it comes down to the substance , though , the main thing will be to come up with some kind of timetable for a european constitution .
is that the least we can expect from the germans in the next six months ? we certainly expect that - but that is n't all that we expect .
i hope that the german presidency will be more ambitious than that - and i 'm sure it will be .
i hope there will be a discussion about how far we want to see the enlargement of the eu to go .
do we want to take in every country that wants to join the union - or do we want to say that there have to be limits , geographical limits as well ? are there geographical limits ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much further can the eu expand ?
in terms of the steps we take , there certainly are .
we first need to strengthen the structures of the european union - and that 's why we need to see the substance of the proposed constitution enacted .
if we do n't have that , then - with the possible exception of croatia , we can pretty much forget any further enlargement .
then we have to look at what 's going to happen with ukraine , and the balkan nations , what 's going to happen with the countries in the caucasus , and the countries in northern africa .
these are all neighboring countries , and there are lots of things that connect us to them - but also things that do n't connect .
and we need stable partnerships , we need policies for our neighbors , and i hope the debate on that will grow in intensity during the german presidency . the balkan nations have already been given a per spective on their eu aspirations - and one day they will probably join .
then the eu will comprise 33 or 34 nations .
independent of the debate on the constitution : would that already represent a critical mass , when the eu is no longer what it was , but effectively an organization for security and co-o per ation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- with a few differences in its substance ? yes , it ca n't just become another osce - it ca n't just be a loose union .
what we want is a strong europe that can act .
nonetheless , we should be happy that europe is as it is today .
to put it personally : i have been a member of the european parliament since 1979 , since the first direct elections .
and if someone had said back then that on may 1 , 2004 , we would see estonia , latvia , lithuania , poland , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary and slovenia joining the eu , then i would have said that 's wonderful , that 's visionary .
and this vision has become reality in our lifetimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrating eu membership in romania the people in those countries have chosen our values .
communism has vanished , fallen apart , and that is a wonderful development .
the european status quo of the 1950s , 60s , 70s and 80s , the division of the continent , the berlin wall , a divided germany - all of that is gone .
so we can be very happy with the way things have developed , and now , of course , we have to try to structure things in a way that makes sense , in a way that europe 's citizens can understand it .
and that is the main task we are facing . and that 's one of the tasks the constitution sought to address .
but it was rejected by voters in france and the netherlands , and there are other countries where it 's far from clear that it would be passed in a referendum - probably not in britain , for example .
what has to be salvaged from this constitution to make europe capable of action ? we certainly have to keep the core of the constitution .
and that includes majority voting in the council of ministers .
this european union can no longer be led if huge swathes of european legislation require a unanimous vote .
we have majority voting in the european parliament - and it has to be that way in the council of ministers too .
i would also argue strongly that the second part of the constitution , which deals with values , human dignity , democracy , the principle of law , the principle of solidarity , human rights - this part must be transferred into european law .
without values , this eu has no future .
that is why these values are so important . herr pöttering , you will most likely be elected as the next president of the european parliament in mid-january .
if you are elected , what are your goals for the next two and a half years ? bildunterschrift : the european parliament in strasbourg i would like to use that position - and i would need the support of the whole parliament , of course - to try to bring the eu and the european parliament closer to the people .
and i would like to make our relationship to the islamic world a high priority .
those are the things i think i would focus on . you said yourself that the last 50 years in europe have been a great success story .
and yet the eu is suffering a bit of a depression .
what would your answer be to this sense of melancholy ? i do n't know if the eu is suffering from depression .
sometimes the situation is very paradoxical .
in the polish capital , warsaw , we have a government that could certainly be more committed to europe than it is and yet opinion polls show that 80 percent of the people in poland support the european constitution .
so the situation is very varied . of course there is skepticism .
that has always been the case .
and that 's why it 's important that we press ahead with european projects , as commission president jose manuel barroso says .
it 's important that we have successes and we do have successes , and we need to talk about them .
above all , we need to make it clear to people that the glass is half full , not half empty .
and if we approach european policy with optimism and hope and confidence , then i think we will be able to get europe moving forwards again and the people of europe moving forward with us . alexander kudascheff interviewed hans-gert pöttering -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de drumming up support for the eu constitution german chancellor angela merkel has much on her agenda as she kicks off the eu presidency .

that 's not going to happen as he had a little too much faith in the reliability of his campaign helpers . ernst-ewald roth certainly showed that he was serious about his political aspirations when he announced his intention to run for the office of mayor of wiesbaden , the capital of the central german state of hesse . since a catholic priest is n't allowed to meddle in politics -lrb- at least officially -rrb- , the 53-year-old had to step down from his post as the city 's highest-ranking catholic priest , relying on a welfare salary from his church to get by while he was hoping to claim city hall come march 13 . wiesbaden 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- nominated roth , who is not a party member , for the post and posters went up around town to tell voters that the cleric was the best choice to run the wealthy but sleepy town of some 275,000 people that 's located just west of frankfurt . everything seemed to be going just fine - until someone noticed that spd campaign officials had missed a fairly important deadline last thursday .
no one had filed roth 's nomination with the civic election commission - bad news since that meant that he could no longer run in the election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiesbaden 's bound to be ruled by a conservative after the election " i 'm deeply disappointed , " roth told voters on his web site .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 06.01.2007 german automobile market ends 2006 with a bang großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers snapped up new cars in 2006 the german car industry zoomed to record levels of exports and production last year .
the country also saw a surge of new passenger car registrations - mainly a result of buyers rushing to beat a tax hike . new car sales in germany reached their highest level in seven years in 2006 , the german automotive industry association -lrb- vda -rrb- said this week . a total of 3.47 million vehicles were sold in the 12 months ending in december , vda said .
the four percent increase from the previous year 's total was primarily a result of a surge in new car registrations in the last two months of 2006 . " those were two fabulous months , but the results are exceptions to the automakers ' normal sales levels , " said vda president bernd gottschalk . new models , incentives and improved consumer confidence , especially among private customers , contributed to the development , vda said .
but there was also a rush to buy ahead of the country 's value-added or sales tax -lrb- vat -rrb- increase .
germany raised this tax by three percent to 19 percent as of january 1 , 2007 . " business was booming at the end of the year ; the warehouses were emptied , " gottschalk said .
" now we have to hope that we do n't get off to a rocky start in the new year . " industry hopes positive trend will continue for 2007 , the market environment at the start of the year would be strained , especially by a reduced tax break for commuters and an additional hike in fuel prices , vda said .
the higher sales tax and insurance tax would also play a role . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vw bug has been one of the most famous german cars in history " now , everything depends on whether or not we 've cleared the hurdle and can look forward to strong economic growth and improved consumer confidence , " gottschalk said .
" there 's certainly no lack of new models , and lots of consumers need to replace older cars . " gottschalk said the average age of a passenger car in germany was over eight years .
this was older than ever before . exports remain strong exports reached a record high of 3.9 million vehicles in 2006 , a 2.5 percent increase .
even on the us market , which registered a decline of 3 percent , german companies still succeeded in boosting their sales by six percent to 921,000 vehicles , vda said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : audi is a popular car worldwide in production , a total of 5.4 million passenger cars rolled off german automakers ' assembly lines in 2006 .
this one percent increase represented a new production record and demonstrated the industry 's domestic success , gottschalk said . " at the same time , the german automakers ' 13 percent increase in production at plants abroad shows that they are playing an active role in the process of globalization , " gottschalk said . vda said it expected turnover to remain stable in 2007 . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vw sales hit record high as executive faces trial golfs , polos , passats and other favorite vw models have been selling like hotcakes , volkswagen has announced .

what can we expect ? hans-gert pöttering : i would like the german presidency to come up with a way of moving forward .
and i would like a decision on what mandate any conference on the european constitution would have - if such a conference takes place - in an attempt to realize the main goal of the constitution . when it comes down to the substance , though , the main thing will be to come up with some kind of timetable for a european constitution .
is that the least we can expect from the germans in the next six months ? we certainly expect that - but that is n't all that we expect .
i hope that the german presidency will be more ambitious than that - and i 'm sure it will be .
i hope there will be a discussion about how far we want to see the enlargement of the eu to go .
do we want to take in every country that wants to join the union - or do we want to say that there have to be limits , geographical limits as well ? are there geographical limits ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much further can the eu expand ?
in terms of the steps we take , there certainly are .
we first need to strengthen the structures of the european union - and that 's why we need to see the substance of the proposed constitution enacted .
if we do n't have that , then - with the possible exception of croatia , we can pretty much forget any further enlargement .
then we have to look at what 's going to happen with ukraine , and the balkan nations , what 's going to happen with the countries in the caucasus , and the countries in northern africa .
these are all neighboring countries , and there are lots of things that connect us to them - but also things that do n't connect .
and we need stable partnerships , we need policies for our neighbors , and i hope the debate on that will grow in intensity during the german presidency . the balkan nations have already been given a per spective on their eu aspirations - and one day they will probably join .
then the eu will comprise 33 or 34 nations .
independent of the debate on the constitution : would that already represent a critical mass , when the eu is no longer what it was , but effectively an organization for security and co-o per ation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- with a few differences in its substance ? yes , it ca n't just become another osce - it ca n't just be a loose union .
what we want is a strong europe that can act .
nonetheless , we should be happy that europe is as it is today .
to put it personally : i have been a member of the european parliament since 1979 , since the first direct elections .
and if someone had said back then that on may 1 , 2004 , we would see estonia , latvia , lithuania , poland , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary and slovenia joining the eu , then i would have said that 's wonderful , that 's visionary .
and this vision has become reality in our lifetimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrating eu membership in romania the people in those countries have chosen our values .
communism has vanished , fallen apart , and that is a wonderful development .
the european status quo of the 1950s , 60s , 70s and 80s , the division of the continent , the berlin wall , a divided germany - all of that is gone .
so we can be very happy with the way things have developed , and now , of course , we have to try to structure things in a way that makes sense , in a way that europe 's citizens can understand it .
and that is the main task we are facing . and that 's one of the tasks the constitution sought to address .
but it was rejected by voters in france and the netherlands , and there are other countries where it 's far from clear that it would be passed in a referendum - probably not in britain , for example .
what has to be salvaged from this constitution to make europe capable of action ? we certainly have to keep the core of the constitution .
and that includes majority voting in the council of ministers .
this european union can no longer be led if huge swathes of european legislation require a unanimous vote .
we have majority voting in the european parliament - and it has to be that way in the council of ministers too .
i would also argue strongly that the second part of the constitution , which deals with values , human dignity , democracy , the principle of law , the principle of solidarity , human rights - this part must be transferred into european law .
without values , this eu has no future .
that is why these values are so important . herr pöttering , you will most likely be elected as the next president of the european parliament in mid-january .
if you are elected , what are your goals for the next two and a half years ? bildunterschrift : the european parliament in strasbourg i would like to use that position - and i would need the support of the whole parliament , of course - to try to bring the eu and the european parliament closer to the people .
and i would like to make our relationship to the islamic world a high priority .
those are the things i think i would focus on . you said yourself that the last 50 years in europe have been a great success story .
and yet the eu is suffering a bit of a depression .
what would your answer be to this sense of melancholy ? i do n't know if the eu is suffering from depression .
sometimes the situation is very paradoxical .
in the polish capital , warsaw , we have a government that could certainly be more committed to europe than it is and yet opinion polls show that 80 percent of the people in poland support the european constitution .
so the situation is very varied . of course there is skepticism .
that has always been the case .
and that 's why it 's important that we press ahead with european projects , as commission president jose manuel barroso says .
it 's important that we have successes and we do have successes , and we need to talk about them .
above all , we need to make it clear to people that the glass is half full , not half empty .
and if we approach european policy with optimism and hope and confidence , then i think we will be able to get europe moving forwards again and the people of europe moving forward with us . alexander kudascheff interviewed hans-gert pöttering -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de drumming up support for the eu constitution german chancellor angela merkel has much on her agenda as she kicks off the eu presidency .

that 's not going to happen as he had a little too much faith in the reliability of his campaign helpers . ernst-ewald roth certainly showed that he was serious about his political aspirations when he announced his intention to run for the office of mayor of wiesbaden , the capital of the central german state of hesse . since a catholic priest is n't allowed to meddle in politics -lrb- at least officially -rrb- , the 53-year-old had to step down from his post as the city 's highest-ranking catholic priest , relying on a welfare salary from his church to get by while he was hoping to claim city hall come march 13 . wiesbaden 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- nominated roth , who is not a party member , for the post and posters went up around town to tell voters that the cleric was the best choice to run the wealthy but sleepy town of some 275,000 people that 's located just west of frankfurt . everything seemed to be going just fine - until someone noticed that spd campaign officials had missed a fairly important deadline last thursday .
no one had filed roth 's nomination with the civic election commission - bad news since that meant that he could no longer run in the election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiesbaden 's bound to be ruled by a conservative after the election " i 'm deeply disappointed , " roth told voters on his web site .
he added that he wants to continue to work for the folks that have supported him during his campaign . the leaders of the local spd chapter have since resigned . " the mistakes that can be made in this world will be made , " said kurt beck , the national spd leader , who serves as premier of the neighboring state of rhineland-palatinate . the party 's general secretary , hubertus heil , put it more bluntly .

what can we expect ? hans-gert pöttering : i would like the german presidency to come up with a way of moving forward .
and i would like a decision on what mandate any conference on the european constitution would have - if such a conference takes place - in an attempt to realize the main goal of the constitution . when it comes down to the substance , though , the main thing will be to come up with some kind of timetable for a european constitution .
is that the least we can expect from the germans in the next six months ? we certainly expect that - but that is n't all that we expect .
i hope that the german presidency will be more ambitious than that - and i 'm sure it will be .
i hope there will be a discussion about how far we want to see the enlargement of the eu to go .
do we want to take in every country that wants to join the union - or do we want to say that there have to be limits , geographical limits as well ? are there geographical limits ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much further can the eu expand ?
in terms of the steps we take , there certainly are .
we first need to strengthen the structures of the european union - and that 's why we need to see the substance of the proposed constitution enacted .
if we do n't have that , then - with the possible exception of croatia , we can pretty much forget any further enlargement .
then we have to look at what 's going to happen with ukraine , and the balkan nations , what 's going to happen with the countries in the caucasus , and the countries in northern africa .
these are all neighboring countries , and there are lots of things that connect us to them - but also things that do n't connect .
and we need stable partnerships , we need policies for our neighbors , and i hope the debate on that will grow in intensity during the german presidency . the balkan nations have already been given a per spective on their eu aspirations - and one day they will probably join .
then the eu will comprise 33 or 34 nations .
independent of the debate on the constitution : would that already represent a critical mass , when the eu is no longer what it was , but effectively an organization for security and co-o per ation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- with a few differences in its substance ? yes , it ca n't just become another osce - it ca n't just be a loose union .
what we want is a strong europe that can act .
nonetheless , we should be happy that europe is as it is today .
to put it personally : i have been a member of the european parliament since 1979 , since the first direct elections .
and if someone had said back then that on may 1 , 2004 , we would see estonia , latvia , lithuania , poland , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary and slovenia joining the eu , then i would have said that 's wonderful , that 's visionary .
and this vision has become reality in our lifetimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrating eu membership in romania the people in those countries have chosen our values .
communism has vanished , fallen apart , and that is a wonderful development .
the european status quo of the 1950s , 60s , 70s and 80s , the division of the continent , the berlin wall , a divided germany - all of that is gone .
so we can be very happy with the way things have developed , and now , of course , we have to try to structure things in a way that makes sense , in a way that europe 's citizens can understand it .
and that is the main task we are facing . and that 's one of the tasks the constitution sought to address .
but it was rejected by voters in france and the netherlands , and there are other countries where it 's far from clear that it would be passed in a referendum - probably not in britain , for example .
what has to be salvaged from this constitution to make europe capable of action ? we certainly have to keep the core of the constitution .
and that includes majority voting in the council of ministers .
this european union can no longer be led if huge swathes of european legislation require a unanimous vote .
we have majority voting in the european parliament - and it has to be that way in the council of ministers too .
i would also argue strongly that the second part of the constitution , which deals with values , human dignity , democracy , the principle of law , the principle of solidarity , human rights - this part must be transferred into european law .
without values , this eu has no future .
that is why these values are so important . herr pöttering , you will most likely be elected as the next president of the european parliament in mid-january .
if you are elected , what are your goals for the next two and a half years ? bildunterschrift : the european parliament in strasbourg i would like to use that position - and i would need the support of the whole parliament , of course - to try to bring the eu and the european parliament closer to the people .
and i would like to make our relationship to the islamic world a high priority .
those are the things i think i would focus on . you said yourself that the last 50 years in europe have been a great success story .
and yet the eu is suffering a bit of a depression .
what would your answer be to this sense of melancholy ? i do n't know if the eu is suffering from depression .
sometimes the situation is very paradoxical .
in the polish capital , warsaw , we have a government that could certainly be more committed to europe than it is and yet opinion polls show that 80 percent of the people in poland support the european constitution .

that 's not going to happen as he had a little too much faith in the reliability of his campaign helpers . ernst-ewald roth certainly showed that he was serious about his political aspirations when he announced his intention to run for the office of mayor of wiesbaden , the capital of the central german state of hesse . since a catholic priest is n't allowed to meddle in politics -lrb- at least officially -rrb- , the 53-year-old had to step down from his post as the city 's highest-ranking catholic priest , relying on a welfare salary from his church to get by while he was hoping to claim city hall come march 13 . wiesbaden 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- nominated roth , who is not a party member , for the post and posters went up around town to tell voters that the cleric was the best choice to run the wealthy but sleepy town of some 275,000 people that 's located just west of frankfurt . everything seemed to be going just fine - until someone noticed that spd campaign officials had missed a fairly important deadline last thursday .

"
this is where hafida sadek lives with her two children .
as a maid , she earns 680 euros per month .
that is n't much in paris .
a 10-square-meter apartment in the french capital costs about 500 euros .
" i have been trying for 10 years to get a subsidized apartment but they keep telling me there are n't any available , " sadek said .
it is people like sadek - an estimated 100,000 of them in france - that an organization called the children of don quixote is fighting for .
it was this group which took over the abandoned office building in a ritzy part of paris to provide housing for people such as sadek and has been calling on the government to help them .
and it seems that these days , the french government is listening .
politicians jumping on the wagon this week , the french government announced plans to create a " legal right " to housing in response to a snowballing campaign that has seen a tent city for the homeless spring up in the heart of paris .
bildunterschrift : tent cities have sprung up all over france prime minister dominique de villepin said a bill would be presented to the cabinet on january 17 and hopefully adopted before parliament breaks up ahead of april 's presidential election .
the law , if passed , would make france the second european country to guarantee the right to housing , after scotland which adopted similar measures with its 2003 homeless act .
president jacques chirac used his new year 's address to promise swift government action on a " right to housing " - a key demand of the protestors .
legally enforceable villepin said the government wanted the right to become legally enforceable by 2008 for " people in the most difficult situations : the homeless , but also the working poor and single women with children . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests and tent cities have garnered much attention " that is the time necessary to ensure that all the people concerned can be provided with decent lodgings , whether in a transitional shelter or an individual home , " he said .
by 2012 , the government wants the right to housing to be legally enforceable for all , with a guarantee provided by the state , or in some cases regional or local authorities .
from that point onwards , " every person or family housed in unworthy or unsanitary conditions " will able to take legal action to have their rights enforced , he said .
villepin said the law would " make france one of the most advanced countries in terms of social rights . "
housing would become the third legally enforceable right in france , along with access to education and healthcare .
four months ahead of presidential elections , with the homeless issue thrust centre-stage , the housing measure was seen as a bid by the centre-right to underscore its commitment to social justice .
the children of don quixote the protest wave started last month when a small group of campaigners - called the children of don quixote - pitched a 200-strong tent camp along a trendy paris canal , housing homeless people as well as well-heeled citizens prepared to sleep rough for a few days out of solidarity .

"
this is where hafida sadek lives with her two children .
as a maid , she earns 680 euros per month .
that is n't much in paris .
a 10-square-meter apartment in the french capital costs about 500 euros .
" i have been trying for 10 years to get a subsidized apartment but they keep telling me there are n't any available , " sadek said .
it is people like sadek - an estimated 100,000 of them in france - that an organization called the children of don quixote is fighting for .
it was this group which took over the abandoned office building in a ritzy part of paris to provide housing for people such as sadek and has been calling on the government to help them .
and it seems that these days , the french government is listening .
politicians jumping on the wagon this week , the french government announced plans to create a " legal right " to housing in response to a snowballing campaign that has seen a tent city for the homeless spring up in the heart of paris .
bildunterschrift : tent cities have sprung up all over france prime minister dominique de villepin said a bill would be presented to the cabinet on january 17 and hopefully adopted before parliament breaks up ahead of april 's presidential election .
the law , if passed , would make france the second european country to guarantee the right to housing , after scotland which adopted similar measures with its 2003 homeless act .
president jacques chirac used his new year 's address to promise swift government action on a " right to housing " - a key demand of the protestors .
legally enforceable villepin said the government wanted the right to become legally enforceable by 2008 for " people in the most difficult situations : the homeless , but also the working poor and single women with children . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests and tent cities have garnered much attention " that is the time necessary to ensure that all the people concerned can be provided with decent lodgings , whether in a transitional shelter or an individual home , " he said .
by 2012 , the government wants the right to housing to be legally enforceable for all , with a guarantee provided by the state , or in some cases regional or local authorities .
from that point onwards , " every person or family housed in unworthy or unsanitary conditions " will able to take legal action to have their rights enforced , he said .
villepin said the law would " make france one of the most advanced countries in terms of social rights . "
housing would become the third legally enforceable right in france , along with access to education and healthcare .
four months ahead of presidential elections , with the homeless issue thrust centre-stage , the housing measure was seen as a bid by the centre-right to underscore its commitment to social justice .
the children of don quixote the protest wave started last month when a small group of campaigners - called the children of don quixote - pitched a 200-strong tent camp along a trendy paris canal , housing homeless people as well as well-heeled citizens prepared to sleep rough for a few days out of solidarity .

in the meantime , romanian actors , directors and screenwriters have started to rake in prizes from cannes to copenhagen and from thailand to turkey and the united states . among those most recently honored at cannes were dorotheea petre who won the " un certain regard " best actress award in 2006 for " the way i spent the end of the world " and director cristi puiu , who won in the same competition a year earlier for " the death of mr. lazarescu . "
coppola rediscovers himself the movie industry " is one of romania 's finest ambassadors , " a representative for the national center for cinematography -lrb- cnc -rrb- told afp . further , new york times critic stephen holden has rated " the death of mr. lazarescu " among the top 10 films of 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from " the death of mr. lazarescu " - one of stephen holden 's top 10 films of 2006 coppola has since finished filming but not yet released his personal , low-profile film , " youth without youth , " based on the work of romanian philosopher mircea eliade and with an almost exclusively romanian crew . local media quoted coppola as telling a university audience : " i have come here to rediscover myself as an artist . " puiu told afp that coppola choosing so many local technicians " means a lot more than any film school exam . " corruption still rife but cinema is not complete without controversy , and puiu also sharply criticized national shortcomings , adding that " corruption in romania has reached unbelievable heights . " personally , he said , when compromise and concessions were taken into account , " i had to pay , in a way , for the right to make films . " andrei boncea of mediapro pictures tempered that view , saying that regular contracts with international companies meant " we work to certain rules and standards " and competition for national subsidies was another issue . media pro and castel film studios are romania 's world-class private production companies , with movies like " amen " by costa-gavras , " cold mountain " with nicole kidman and more than 150 other feature films between them since 1998 . much of their work is contract production , but media pro also makes its own films and television series .
both groups together have more than two dozen soundstages along with water tanks , lakes , forests , post-production facilities and an army of multilingual contractors for everything from low-cost set construction to high-tech special effects . castel claims the biggest single studio in continental europe at 3,274 square meters -lrb- 35,241 square feet -rrb- , which is available for 10,000 euros per week . production costs are about half those in britain and 30 percent lower than in the czech republic , and a cutting-edge kodak lab now provides film processing . diverse landscape bogdan moncea of castel films called romania " a one-stop shop for foreign productions " offering unblemished rural to bleak industrial landscapes , and architectural styles from " german gothic in transylvania to french art nouveau or 21st century in bucharest . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania offers filmmakers unique scenery , such as bran castle in transylvania the executed dictator nicolae ceausescu 's megalomaniac people 's palace has served as a shooting location as well . in 1992 , french assistant director olivier jacquet was on his first romanian shoot when " the prop master showed up with his hands in his pockets and a tool belt that held a hammer and some nails , and that 's it . " with creation and production back on track , romanian film distribution must now be brought up to speed , and ways found to fill seats in theatres . " we are one of the countries with the lowest rate of admission in central and eastern europe , " said boncea of media pro . but , " that 's definitely going to change , " he vowed , adding that the media group had renovated a historic movie palace and was also building multiplex theatres . whether that happens remains to be seen , as does coppola 's film , which production director doina dragnea suggested might lead to more work given the positive chemistry between the us director and romanian crew .

mandelson himself will hold talks with us trade representative susan schwab in washington on the same day . " monday 's meeting is the opportunity for the eu and the us to invigorate the multilateral doha trade talks , " mandelson said in a statement .
" i hope both sides will signal strong new political commitment to rapid progress .
we have now entered a narrow window of opportunity lasting until easter during which success for the world trade talks is possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson at a wto conference in hong kong in 2005 " the quiet , constructive bilateral contacts of the last few months have made clear to us all the possible outline of a final deal , " he added .
" we now need the added momentum of political leadership from the highest level .
europe and the us have a shared responsibility to make this happen . " eu officials hope to see a change in political willingness to end the impasse with the passage of control in the us congress to the democrats . " it 's undeniable there was protectionist rhetoric around the elections in november but i think we have to look beyond that , " mandelson 's spokesman peter power said on friday . talks suspended in july the world trade organization suspended the so-called doha round in july after negotiators from six major players , including the us , eu , brazil and india , failed to hammer out a framework of an accord after five years of talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wto director-general french pascal lamy has been trying to bridge the gap the doha round , launched in the qatari capital in november 2001 , is mired in an impasse as western and developing countries remain split on issues such as agriculture subsidies and market access . developing countries are demanding lower tariffs on their agricultural exports to us and european markets while industrialized nations seek greater access to developing and emerging countries for their industrial goods and services . eu concessions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who will give in ?
mandelson 's office stressed that europe remains willing to improve its farm tariff offer by adding substantially to the 39 percent cuts it offered a year ago .
europe is ready to add more than 10 percentage points " and get within close reach of the average farm tariff cut demanded by developing countries , " which is 51.5 percent , the statement said . " we are ready to do this in a way that demonstrably gives new market access to the united states and other agricultural exporters in all products , " it added . the eu is asking washington to make for real cuts in its farm subsidies , also to levels close to those requested by developing countries .
this would mean a budget cut of around $ 8 billion dollars -lrb- six billion euros -rrb- from current ceilings of $ 23 billion to around $ 15 billion . big agenda apart from mandelson and barroso , the eu 's external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner will also take part in the visit to washington .
trade and economic ties aside , the talks are also expected to focus on energy security , climate change and the middle east .
the white house has said that afghanistan , darfur and the fight against terrorism will also be on the agenda . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , us come together to weigh future options jan techau , director of the center for european policy studies , spoke to dw-radio about the issues foreign minister steinmeier is expected to bring up when he meets secretary of state rice in washington .

in the meantime , romanian actors , directors and screenwriters have started to rake in prizes from cannes to copenhagen and from thailand to turkey and the united states . among those most recently honored at cannes were dorotheea petre who won the " un certain regard " best actress award in 2006 for " the way i spent the end of the world " and director cristi puiu , who won in the same competition a year earlier for " the death of mr. lazarescu . "
coppola rediscovers himself the movie industry " is one of romania 's finest ambassadors , " a representative for the national center for cinematography -lrb- cnc -rrb- told afp . further , new york times critic stephen holden has rated " the death of mr. lazarescu " among the top 10 films of 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from " the death of mr. lazarescu " - one of stephen holden 's top 10 films of 2006 coppola has since finished filming but not yet released his personal , low-profile film , " youth without youth , " based on the work of romanian philosopher mircea eliade and with an almost exclusively romanian crew . local media quoted coppola as telling a university audience : " i have come here to rediscover myself as an artist . " puiu told afp that coppola choosing so many local technicians " means a lot more than any film school exam . " corruption still rife but cinema is not complete without controversy , and puiu also sharply criticized national shortcomings , adding that " corruption in romania has reached unbelievable heights . " personally , he said , when compromise and concessions were taken into account , " i had to pay , in a way , for the right to make films . " andrei boncea of mediapro pictures tempered that view , saying that regular contracts with international companies meant " we work to certain rules and standards " and competition for national subsidies was another issue . media pro and castel film studios are romania 's world-class private production companies , with movies like " amen " by costa-gavras , " cold mountain " with nicole kidman and more than 150 other feature films between them since 1998 . much of their work is contract production , but media pro also makes its own films and television series .
both groups together have more than two dozen soundstages along with water tanks , lakes , forests , post-production facilities and an army of multilingual contractors for everything from low-cost set construction to high-tech special effects . castel claims the biggest single studio in continental europe at 3,274 square meters -lrb- 35,241 square feet -rrb- , which is available for 10,000 euros per week . production costs are about half those in britain and 30 percent lower than in the czech republic , and a cutting-edge kodak lab now provides film processing . diverse landscape bogdan moncea of castel films called romania " a one-stop shop for foreign productions " offering unblemished rural to bleak industrial landscapes , and architectural styles from " german gothic in transylvania to french art nouveau or 21st century in bucharest . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania offers filmmakers unique scenery , such as bran castle in transylvania the executed dictator nicolae ceausescu 's megalomaniac people 's palace has served as a shooting location as well . in 1992 , french assistant director olivier jacquet was on his first romanian shoot when " the prop master showed up with his hands in his pockets and a tool belt that held a hammer and some nails , and that 's it . " with creation and production back on track , romanian film distribution must now be brought up to speed , and ways found to fill seats in theatres . " we are one of the countries with the lowest rate of admission in central and eastern europe , " said boncea of media pro . but , " that 's definitely going to change , " he vowed , adding that the media group had renovated a historic movie palace and was also building multiplex theatres . whether that happens remains to be seen , as does coppola 's film , which production director doina dragnea suggested might lead to more work given the positive chemistry between the us director and romanian crew . " he says he will come back soon , " she said . dw staff / afp -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european papers give cool reception to new eu members european commentators on tuesday had mixed reactions about bulgaria and romania 's entry into the european union .

mandelson himself will hold talks with us trade representative susan schwab in washington on the same day . " monday 's meeting is the opportunity for the eu and the us to invigorate the multilateral doha trade talks , " mandelson said in a statement .

europe and the us have a shared responsibility to make this happen . " eu officials hope to see a change in political willingness to end the impasse with the passage of control in the us congress to the democrats . " it 's undeniable there was protectionist rhetoric around the elections in november but i think we have to look beyond that , " mandelson 's spokesman peter power said on friday . talks suspended in july the world trade organization suspended the so-called doha round in july after negotiators from six major players , including the us , eu , brazil and india , failed to hammer out a framework of an accord after five years of talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wto director-general french pascal lamy has been trying to bridge the gap the doha round , launched in the qatari capital in november 2001 , is mired in an impasse as western and developing countries remain split on issues such as agriculture subsidies and market access . developing countries are demanding lower tariffs on their agricultural exports to us and european markets while industrialized nations seek greater access to developing and emerging countries for their industrial goods and services . eu concessions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who will give in ?
mandelson 's office stressed that europe remains willing to improve its farm tariff offer by adding substantially to the 39 percent cuts it offered a year ago .
europe is ready to add more than 10 percentage points " and get within close reach of the average farm tariff cut demanded by developing countries , " which is 51.5 percent , the statement said . " we are ready to do this in a way that demonstrably gives new market access to the united states and other agricultural exporters in all products , " it added . the eu is asking washington to make for real cuts in its farm subsidies , also to levels close to those requested by developing countries .
this would mean a budget cut of around $ 8 billion dollars -lrb- six billion euros -rrb- from current ceilings of $ 23 billion to around $ 15 billion . big agenda apart from mandelson and barroso , the eu 's external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner will also take part in the visit to washington .
trade and economic ties aside , the talks are also expected to focus on energy security , climate change and the middle east .

mandelson himself will hold talks with us trade representative susan schwab in washington on the same day . " monday 's meeting is the opportunity for the eu and the us to invigorate the multilateral doha trade talks , " mandelson said in a statement .
" i hope both sides will signal strong new political commitment to rapid progress .

what can we expect ? hans-gert pöttering : i would like the german presidency to come up with a way of moving forward .
and i would like a decision on what mandate any conference on the european constitution would have - if such a conference takes place - in an attempt to realize the main goal of the constitution . when it comes down to the substance , though , the main thing will be to come up with some kind of timetable for a european constitution .
is that the least we can expect from the germans in the next six months ? we certainly expect that - but that is n't all that we expect .
i hope that the german presidency will be more ambitious than that - and i 'm sure it will be .
i hope there will be a discussion about how far we want to see the enlargement of the eu to go .
do we want to take in every country that wants to join the union - or do we want to say that there have to be limits , geographical limits as well ? are there geographical limits ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much further can the eu expand ?
in terms of the steps we take , there certainly are .
we first need to strengthen the structures of the european union - and that 's why we need to see the substance of the proposed constitution enacted .
if we do n't have that , then - with the possible exception of croatia , we can pretty much forget any further enlargement .
then we have to look at what 's going to happen with ukraine , and the balkan nations , what 's going to happen with the countries in the caucasus , and the countries in northern africa .
these are all neighboring countries , and there are lots of things that connect us to them - but also things that do n't connect .
and we need stable partnerships , we need policies for our neighbors , and i hope the debate on that will grow in intensity during the german presidency . the balkan nations have already been given a per spective on their eu aspirations - and one day they will probably join .
then the eu will comprise 33 or 34 nations .
independent of the debate on the constitution : would that already represent a critical mass , when the eu is no longer what it was , but effectively an organization for security and co-o per ation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- with a few differences in its substance ? yes , it ca n't just become another osce - it ca n't just be a loose union .
what we want is a strong europe that can act .
nonetheless , we should be happy that europe is as it is today .
to put it personally : i have been a member of the european parliament since 1979 , since the first direct elections .
and if someone had said back then that on may 1 , 2004 , we would see estonia , latvia , lithuania , poland , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary and slovenia joining the eu , then i would have said that 's wonderful , that 's visionary .
and this vision has become reality in our lifetimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrating eu membership in romania the people in those countries have chosen our values .
communism has vanished , fallen apart , and that is a wonderful development .
the european status quo of the 1950s , 60s , 70s and 80s , the division of the continent , the berlin wall , a divided germany - all of that is gone .
so we can be very happy with the way things have developed , and now , of course , we have to try to structure things in a way that makes sense , in a way that europe 's citizens can understand it .
and that is the main task we are facing . and that 's one of the tasks the constitution sought to address .
but it was rejected by voters in france and the netherlands , and there are other countries where it 's far from clear that it would be passed in a referendum - probably not in britain , for example .
what has to be salvaged from this constitution to make europe capable of action ? we certainly have to keep the core of the constitution .
and that includes majority voting in the council of ministers .
this european union can no longer be led if huge swathes of european legislation require a unanimous vote .
we have majority voting in the european parliament - and it has to be that way in the council of ministers too .
i would also argue strongly that the second part of the constitution , which deals with values , human dignity , democracy , the principle of law , the principle of solidarity , human rights - this part must be transferred into european law .
without values , this eu has no future .
that is why these values are so important . herr pöttering , you will most likely be elected as the next president of the european parliament in mid-january .
if you are elected , what are your goals for the next two and a half years ? bildunterschrift : the european parliament in strasbourg i would like to use that position - and i would need the support of the whole parliament , of course - to try to bring the eu and the european parliament closer to the people .
and i would like to make our relationship to the islamic world a high priority .
those are the things i think i would focus on . you said yourself that the last 50 years in europe have been a great success story .
and yet the eu is suffering a bit of a depression .
what would your answer be to this sense of melancholy ? i do n't know if the eu is suffering from depression .
sometimes the situation is very paradoxical .
in the polish capital , warsaw , we have a government that could certainly be more committed to europe than it is and yet opinion polls show that 80 percent of the people in poland support the european constitution .
so the situation is very varied . of course there is skepticism .
that has always been the case .
and that 's why it 's important that we press ahead with european projects , as commission president jose manuel barroso says .
it 's important that we have successes and we do have successes , and we need to talk about them .
above all , we need to make it clear to people that the glass is half full , not half empty .
and if we approach european policy with optimism and hope and confidence , then i think we will be able to get europe moving forwards again and the people of europe moving forward with us . alexander kudascheff interviewed hans-gert pöttering -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de drumming up support for the eu constitution german chancellor angela merkel has much on her agenda as she kicks off the eu presidency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the german eu presidency a dummy 's guide to the eu german fm : kosovo biggest problem right now commission proposes eu-wide green card for migrants germany determined to strengthen european police agency european union -pipe- 06.01.2007 " without values , this eu has no future " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pöttering has been a european parliamentarian since 1979 dw-tv talked to hans-gert pöttering , the likely new president of the european parliament , about the german eu presidency , the chances for an eu constitution and his plans as leader of the bloc 's legislative . dw-tv : germany has taken on the eu 's rotating presidency and with it the running of the bloc 's business for the next six months .
what can we expect ? hans-gert pöttering : i would like the german presidency to come up with a way of moving forward .
and i would like a decision on what mandate any conference on the european constitution would have - if such a conference takes place - in an attempt to realize the main goal of the constitution . when it comes down to the substance , though , the main thing will be to come up with some kind of timetable for a european constitution .
is that the least we can expect from the germans in the next six months ? we certainly expect that - but that is n't all that we expect .
i hope that the german presidency will be more ambitious than that - and i 'm sure it will be .
i hope there will be a discussion about how far we want to see the enlargement of the eu to go .
do we want to take in every country that wants to join the union - or do we want to say that there have to be limits , geographical limits as well ? are there geographical limits ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much further can the eu expand ?
in terms of the steps we take , there certainly are .
we first need to strengthen the structures of the european union - and that 's why we need to see the substance of the proposed constitution enacted .
if we do n't have that , then - with the possible exception of croatia , we can pretty much forget any further enlargement .
then we have to look at what 's going to happen with ukraine , and the balkan nations , what 's going to happen with the countries in the caucasus , and the countries in northern africa .
these are all neighboring countries , and there are lots of things that connect us to them - but also things that do n't connect .
and we need stable partnerships , we need policies for our neighbors , and i hope the debate on that will grow in intensity during the german presidency . the balkan nations have already been given a per spective on their eu aspirations - and one day they will probably join .
then the eu will comprise 33 or 34 nations .
independent of the debate on the constitution : would that already represent a critical mass , when the eu is no longer what it was , but effectively an organization for security and co-o per ation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- with a few differences in its substance ? yes , it ca n't just become another osce - it ca n't just be a loose union .
what we want is a strong europe that can act .
nonetheless , we should be happy that europe is as it is today .
to put it personally : i have been a member of the european parliament since 1979 , since the first direct elections .
and if someone had said back then that on may 1 , 2004 , we would see estonia , latvia , lithuania , poland , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary and slovenia joining the eu , then i would have said that 's wonderful , that 's visionary .
and this vision has become reality in our lifetimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrating eu membership in romania the people in those countries have chosen our values .
communism has vanished , fallen apart , and that is a wonderful development .
the european status quo of the 1950s , 60s , 70s and 80s , the division of the continent , the berlin wall , a divided germany - all of that is gone .
so we can be very happy with the way things have developed , and now , of course , we have to try to structure things in a way that makes sense , in a way that europe 's citizens can understand it .
and that is the main task we are facing . and that 's one of the tasks the constitution sought to address .
but it was rejected by voters in france and the netherlands , and there are other countries where it 's far from clear that it would be passed in a referendum - probably not in britain , for example .
what has to be salvaged from this constitution to make europe capable of action ? we certainly have to keep the core of the constitution .
and that includes majority voting in the council of ministers .
this european union can no longer be led if huge swathes of european legislation require a unanimous vote .
we have majority voting in the european parliament - and it has to be that way in the council of ministers too .
i would also argue strongly that the second part of the constitution , which deals with values , human dignity , democracy , the principle of law , the principle of solidarity , human rights - this part must be transferred into european law .
without values , this eu has no future .
that is why these values are so important . herr pöttering , you will most likely be elected as the next president of the european parliament in mid-january .
if you are elected , what are your goals for the next two and a half years ? bildunterschrift : the european parliament in strasbourg i would like to use that position - and i would need the support of the whole parliament , of course - to try to bring the eu and the european parliament closer to the people .
and i would like to make our relationship to the islamic world a high priority .
those are the things i think i would focus on . you said yourself that the last 50 years in europe have been a great success story .
and yet the eu is suffering a bit of a depression .
what would your answer be to this sense of melancholy ? i do n't know if the eu is suffering from depression .
sometimes the situation is very paradoxical .
in the polish capital , warsaw , we have a government that could certainly be more committed to europe than it is and yet opinion polls show that 80 percent of the people in poland support the european constitution .
so the situation is very varied . of course there is skepticism .
that has always been the case .
and that 's why it 's important that we press ahead with european projects , as commission president jose manuel barroso says .
it 's important that we have successes and we do have successes , and we need to talk about them .
above all , we need to make it clear to people that the glass is half full , not half empty .
and if we approach european policy with optimism and hope and confidence , then i think we will be able to get europe moving forwards again and the people of europe moving forward with us . alexander kudascheff interviewed hans-gert pöttering -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de drumming up support for the eu constitution german chancellor angela merkel has much on her agenda as she kicks off the eu presidency .

the four percent increase from the previous year 's total was primarily a result of a surge in new car registrations in the last two months of 2006 . " those were two fabulous months , but the results are exceptions to the automakers ' normal sales levels , " said vda president bernd gottschalk . new models , incentives and improved consumer confidence , especially among private customers , contributed to the development , vda said .

germany raised this tax by three percent to 19 percent as of january 1 , 2007 . " business was booming at the end of the year ; the warehouses were emptied , " gottschalk said .

the four percent increase from the previous year 's total was primarily a result of a surge in new car registrations in the last two months of 2006 .

germany raised this tax by three percent to 19 percent as of january 1 , 2007 . " business was booming at the end of the year ; the warehouses were emptied , " gottschalk said .

from that point onwards , " every person or family housed in unworthy or unsanitary conditions " will able to take legal action to have their rights enforced , he said .
villepin said the law would " make france one of the most advanced countries in terms of social rights . "
housing would become the third legally enforceable right in france , along with access to education and healthcare .
four months ahead of presidential elections , with the homeless issue thrust centre-stage , the housing measure was seen as a bid by the centre-right to underscore its commitment to social justice .
the children of don quixote the protest wave started last month when a small group of campaigners - called the children of don quixote - pitched a 200-strong tent camp along a trendy paris canal , housing homeless people as well as well-heeled citizens prepared to sleep rough for a few days out of solidarity .

what can we expect ? hans-gert pöttering : i would like the german presidency to come up with a way of moving forward .
and i would like a decision on what mandate any conference on the european constitution would have - if such a conference takes place - in an attempt to realize the main goal of the constitution . when it comes down to the substance , though , the main thing will be to come up with some kind of timetable for a european constitution .
is that the least we can expect from the germans in the next six months ? we certainly expect that - but that is n't all that we expect .
i hope that the german presidency will be more ambitious than that - and i 'm sure it will be .
i hope there will be a discussion about how far we want to see the enlargement of the eu to go .
do we want to take in every country that wants to join the union - or do we want to say that there have to be limits , geographical limits as well ? are there geographical limits ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much further can the eu expand ?
in terms of the steps we take , there certainly are .
we first need to strengthen the structures of the european union - and that 's why we need to see the substance of the proposed constitution enacted .
if we do n't have that , then - with the possible exception of croatia , we can pretty much forget any further enlargement .
then we have to look at what 's going to happen with ukraine , and the balkan nations , what 's going to happen with the countries in the caucasus , and the countries in northern africa .
these are all neighboring countries , and there are lots of things that connect us to them - but also things that do n't connect .
and we need stable partnerships , we need policies for our neighbors , and i hope the debate on that will grow in intensity during the german presidency . the balkan nations have already been given a per spective on their eu aspirations - and one day they will probably join .
then the eu will comprise 33 or 34 nations .
independent of the debate on the constitution : would that already represent a critical mass , when the eu is no longer what it was , but effectively an organization for security and co-o per ation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- with a few differences in its substance ? yes , it ca n't just become another osce - it ca n't just be a loose union .
what we want is a strong europe that can act .
nonetheless , we should be happy that europe is as it is today .
to put it personally : i have been a member of the european parliament since 1979 , since the first direct elections .
and if someone had said back then that on may 1 , 2004 , we would see estonia , latvia , lithuania , poland , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary and slovenia joining the eu , then i would have said that 's wonderful , that 's visionary .
and this vision has become reality in our lifetimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrating eu membership in romania the people in those countries have chosen our values .
communism has vanished , fallen apart , and that is a wonderful development .
the european status quo of the 1950s , 60s , 70s and 80s , the division of the continent , the berlin wall , a divided germany - all of that is gone .
so we can be very happy with the way things have developed , and now , of course , we have to try to structure things in a way that makes sense , in a way that europe 's citizens can understand it .
and that is the main task we are facing . and that 's one of the tasks the constitution sought to address .
but it was rejected by voters in france and the netherlands , and there are other countries where it 's far from clear that it would be passed in a referendum - probably not in britain , for example .
what has to be salvaged from this constitution to make europe capable of action ? we certainly have to keep the core of the constitution .
and that includes majority voting in the council of ministers .
this european union can no longer be led if huge swathes of european legislation require a unanimous vote .
we have majority voting in the european parliament - and it has to be that way in the council of ministers too .
i would also argue strongly that the second part of the constitution , which deals with values , human dignity , democracy , the principle of law , the principle of solidarity , human rights - this part must be transferred into european law .
without values , this eu has no future .
that is why these values are so important . herr pöttering , you will most likely be elected as the next president of the european parliament in mid-january .
if you are elected , what are your goals for the next two and a half years ? bildunterschrift : the european parliament in strasbourg i would like to use that position - and i would need the support of the whole parliament , of course - to try to bring the eu and the european parliament closer to the people .
and i would like to make our relationship to the islamic world a high priority .
those are the things i think i would focus on . you said yourself that the last 50 years in europe have been a great success story .
and yet the eu is suffering a bit of a depression .
what would your answer be to this sense of melancholy ? i do n't know if the eu is suffering from depression .
sometimes the situation is very paradoxical .
in the polish capital , warsaw , we have a government that could certainly be more committed to europe than it is and yet opinion polls show that 80 percent of the people in poland support the european constitution .
so the situation is very varied . of course there is skepticism .
that has always been the case .
and that 's why it 's important that we press ahead with european projects , as commission president jose manuel barroso says .
it 's important that we have successes and we do have successes , and we need to talk about them .
above all , we need to make it clear to people that the glass is half full , not half empty .
and if we approach european policy with optimism and hope and confidence , then i think we will be able to get europe moving forwards again and the people of europe moving forward with us . alexander kudascheff interviewed hans-gert pöttering -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de drumming up support for the eu constitution german chancellor angela merkel has much on her agenda as she kicks off the eu presidency .

these are all neighboring countries , and there are lots of things that connect us to them - but also things that do n't connect .
and we need stable partnerships , we need policies for our neighbors , and i hope the debate on that will grow in intensity during the german presidency . the balkan nations have already been given a per spective on their eu aspirations - and one day they will probably join .
then the eu will comprise 33 or 34 nations .
independent of the debate on the constitution : would that already represent a critical mass , when the eu is no longer what it was , but effectively an organization for security and co-o per ation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- with a few differences in its substance ? yes , it ca n't just become another osce - it ca n't just be a loose union .
what we want is a strong europe that can act .
nonetheless , we should be happy that europe is as it is today .
to put it personally : i have been a member of the european parliament since 1979 , since the first direct elections .
and if someone had said back then that on may 1 , 2004 , we would see estonia , latvia , lithuania , poland , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary and slovenia joining the eu , then i would have said that 's wonderful , that 's visionary .
and this vision has become reality in our lifetimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrating eu membership in romania the people in those countries have chosen our values .
communism has vanished , fallen apart , and that is a wonderful development .
the european status quo of the 1950s , 60s , 70s and 80s , the division of the continent , the berlin wall , a divided germany - all of that is gone .
so we can be very happy with the way things have developed , and now , of course , we have to try to structure things in a way that makes sense , in a way that europe 's citizens can understand it .
and that is the main task we are facing . and that 's one of the tasks the constitution sought to address .
but it was rejected by voters in france and the netherlands , and there are other countries where it 's far from clear that it would be passed in a referendum - probably not in britain , for example .
what has to be salvaged from this constitution to make europe capable of action ? we certainly have to keep the core of the constitution .
and that includes majority voting in the council of ministers .
this european union can no longer be led if huge swathes of european legislation require a unanimous vote .
we have majority voting in the european parliament - and it has to be that way in the council of ministers too .
i would also argue strongly that the second part of the constitution , which deals with values , human dignity , democracy , the principle of law , the principle of solidarity , human rights - this part must be transferred into european law .
without values , this eu has no future .
that is why these values are so important . herr pöttering , you will most likely be elected as the next president of the european parliament in mid-january .
if you are elected , what are your goals for the next two and a half years ? bildunterschrift : the european parliament in strasbourg i would like to use that position - and i would need the support of the whole parliament , of course - to try to bring the eu and the european parliament closer to the people .
and i would like to make our relationship to the islamic world a high priority .
those are the things i think i would focus on . you said yourself that the last 50 years in europe have been a great success story .
and yet the eu is suffering a bit of a depression .
what would your answer be to this sense of melancholy ? i do n't know if the eu is suffering from depression .
sometimes the situation is very paradoxical .
in the polish capital , warsaw , we have a government that could certainly be more committed to europe than it is and yet opinion polls show that 80 percent of the people in poland support the european constitution .
so the situation is very varied . of course there is skepticism .
that has always been the case .
and that 's why it 's important that we press ahead with european projects , as commission president jose manuel barroso says .
it 's important that we have successes and we do have successes , and we need to talk about them .
above all , we need to make it clear to people that the glass is half full , not half empty .
and if we approach european policy with optimism and hope and confidence , then i think we will be able to get europe moving forwards again and the people of europe moving forward with us . alexander kudascheff interviewed hans-gert pöttering -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de drumming up support for the eu constitution german chancellor angela merkel has much on her agenda as she kicks off the eu presidency .

what can we expect ? hans-gert pöttering : i would like the german presidency to come up with a way of moving forward .
and i would like a decision on what mandate any conference on the european constitution would have - if such a conference takes place - in an attempt to realize the main goal of the constitution . when it comes down to the substance , though , the main thing will be to come up with some kind of timetable for a european constitution .
is that the least we can expect from the germans in the next six months ? we certainly expect that - but that is n't all that we expect .
i hope that the german presidency will be more ambitious than that - and i 'm sure it will be .
i hope there will be a discussion about how far we want to see the enlargement of the eu to go .
do we want to take in every country that wants to join the union - or do we want to say that there have to be limits , geographical limits as well ? are there geographical limits ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much further can the eu expand ?
in terms of the steps we take , there certainly are .
we first need to strengthen the structures of the european union - and that 's why we need to see the substance of the proposed constitution enacted .
if we do n't have that , then - with the possible exception of croatia , we can pretty much forget any further enlargement .
then we have to look at what 's going to happen with ukraine , and the balkan nations , what 's going to happen with the countries in the caucasus , and the countries in northern africa .
these are all neighboring countries , and there are lots of things that connect us to them - but also things that do n't connect .

"
this is where hafida sadek lives with her two children .
as a maid , she earns 680 euros per month .
that is n't much in paris .
a 10-square-meter apartment in the french capital costs about 500 euros .
" i have been trying for 10 years to get a subsidized apartment but they keep telling me there are n't any available , " sadek said .
it is people like sadek - an estimated 100,000 of them in france - that an organization called the children of don quixote is fighting for .
it was this group which took over the abandoned office building in a ritzy part of paris to provide housing for people such as sadek and has been calling on the government to help them .
and it seems that these days , the french government is listening .
politicians jumping on the wagon this week , the french government announced plans to create a " legal right " to housing in response to a snowballing campaign that has seen a tent city for the homeless spring up in the heart of paris .
bildunterschrift : tent cities have sprung up all over france prime minister dominique de villepin said a bill would be presented to the cabinet on january 17 and hopefully adopted before parliament breaks up ahead of april 's presidential election .
the law , if passed , would make france the second european country to guarantee the right to housing , after scotland which adopted similar measures with its 2003 homeless act .
president jacques chirac used his new year 's address to promise swift government action on a " right to housing " - a key demand of the protestors .
legally enforceable villepin said the government wanted the right to become legally enforceable by 2008 for " people in the most difficult situations : the homeless , but also the working poor and single women with children . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests and tent cities have garnered much attention " that is the time necessary to ensure that all the people concerned can be provided with decent lodgings , whether in a transitional shelter or an individual home , " he said .
by 2012 , the government wants the right to housing to be legally enforceable for all , with a guarantee provided by the state , or in some cases regional or local authorities .
from that point onwards , " every person or family housed in unworthy or unsanitary conditions " will able to take legal action to have their rights enforced , he said .
villepin said the law would " make france one of the most advanced countries in terms of social rights . "
housing would become the third legally enforceable right in france , along with access to education and healthcare .
four months ahead of presidential elections , with the homeless issue thrust centre-stage , the housing measure was seen as a bid by the centre-right to underscore its commitment to social justice .
the children of don quixote the protest wave started last month when a small group of campaigners - called the children of don quixote - pitched a 200-strong tent camp along a trendy paris canal , housing homeless people as well as well-heeled citizens prepared to sleep rough for a few days out of solidarity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebritites have come out to support the homeless makeshift camps have since sprung up all over france , including in the mediterranean port of marseille , the historic town of orleans , and the southern cities of lyon and toulouse .
on tuesday a group of eight struggling families , backed by campaigners , moved into a vacant office block near the paris stock exchange , a giant squat that has been dubbed a " ministry " for the homeless and ill-housed .
politicians of all stripes - including presidential frontrunners nicolas sarkozy on the right and segolene royal on the left - had responded on cue , lining up with pledges to tackle the plight of the homeless .
emergency plan according to the charity emmaus , one million people in france do not have a home of their own : 100,000 sleep rough , while the rest live in campsites , hotels or shelters .
another two million people have housing " problems . "
the " right to housing " measures comes in addition to a 70-million-euro -lrb- $ 90 million -rrb- emergency plan for the homeless announced last month .
but a spokesman for segolene royal , the socialist presidential frontrunner , warned the government against making " great announcements , " saying what was needed was a massive commitment to build more public housing . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's homeless must leap hurdles to get help germany is a wealthy country with a cushy social welfare system , but drugs , red tape and a lack of motivation keep some people on the streets .

the country also saw a surge of new passenger car registrations - mainly a result of buyers rushing to beat a tax hike . new car sales in germany reached their highest level in seven years in 2006 , the german automotive industry association -lrb- vda -rrb- said this week . a total of 3.47 million vehicles were sold in the 12 months ending in december , vda said .
the four percent increase from the previous year 's total was primarily a result of a surge in new car registrations in the last two months of 2006 . " those were two fabulous months , but the results are exceptions to the automakers ' normal sales levels , " said vda president bernd gottschalk . new models , incentives and improved consumer confidence , especially among private customers , contributed to the development , vda said .
but there was also a rush to buy ahead of the country 's value-added or sales tax -lrb- vat -rrb- increase .
germany raised this tax by three percent to 19 percent as of january 1 , 2007 . " business was booming at the end of the year ; the warehouses were emptied , " gottschalk said .
" now we have to hope that we do n't get off to a rocky start in the new year . " industry hopes positive trend will continue for 2007 , the market environment at the start of the year would be strained , especially by a reduced tax break for commuters and an additional hike in fuel prices , vda said .
the higher sales tax and insurance tax would also play a role . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vw bug has been one of the most famous german cars in history " now , everything depends on whether or not we 've cleared the hurdle and can look forward to strong economic growth and improved consumer confidence , " gottschalk said .
" there 's certainly no lack of new models , and lots of consumers need to replace older cars . " gottschalk said the average age of a passenger car in germany was over eight years .
this was older than ever before . exports remain strong exports reached a record high of 3.9 million vehicles in 2006 , a 2.5 percent increase .
even on the us market , which registered a decline of 3 percent , german companies still succeeded in boosting their sales by six percent to 921,000 vehicles , vda said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : audi is a popular car worldwide in production , a total of 5.4 million passenger cars rolled off german automakers ' assembly lines in 2006 .
this one percent increase represented a new production record and demonstrated the industry 's domestic success , gottschalk said . " at the same time , the german automakers ' 13 percent increase in production at plants abroad shows that they are playing an active role in the process of globalization , " gottschalk said . vda said it expected turnover to remain stable in 2007 . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vw sales hit record high as executive faces trial golfs , polos , passats and other favorite vw models have been selling like hotcakes , volkswagen has announced .

what can we expect ? hans-gert pöttering : i would like the german presidency to come up with a way of moving forward .
and i would like a decision on what mandate any conference on the european constitution would have - if such a conference takes place - in an attempt to realize the main goal of the constitution . when it comes down to the substance , though , the main thing will be to come up with some kind of timetable for a european constitution .
is that the least we can expect from the germans in the next six months ? we certainly expect that - but that is n't all that we expect .
i hope that the german presidency will be more ambitious than that - and i 'm sure it will be .
i hope there will be a discussion about how far we want to see the enlargement of the eu to go .
do we want to take in every country that wants to join the union - or do we want to say that there have to be limits , geographical limits as well ? are there geographical limits ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much further can the eu expand ?
in terms of the steps we take , there certainly are .
we first need to strengthen the structures of the european union - and that 's why we need to see the substance of the proposed constitution enacted .
if we do n't have that , then - with the possible exception of croatia , we can pretty much forget any further enlargement .
then we have to look at what 's going to happen with ukraine , and the balkan nations , what 's going to happen with the countries in the caucasus , and the countries in northern africa .
these are all neighboring countries , and there are lots of things that connect us to them - but also things that do n't connect .
and we need stable partnerships , we need policies for our neighbors , and i hope the debate on that will grow in intensity during the german presidency . the balkan nations have already been given a per spective on their eu aspirations - and one day they will probably join .
then the eu will comprise 33 or 34 nations .
independent of the debate on the constitution : would that already represent a critical mass , when the eu is no longer what it was , but effectively an organization for security and co-o per ation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- with a few differences in its substance ? yes , it ca n't just become another osce - it ca n't just be a loose union .
what we want is a strong europe that can act .
nonetheless , we should be happy that europe is as it is today .
to put it personally : i have been a member of the european parliament since 1979 , since the first direct elections .
and if someone had said back then that on may 1 , 2004 , we would see estonia , latvia , lithuania , poland , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary and slovenia joining the eu , then i would have said that 's wonderful , that 's visionary .
and this vision has become reality in our lifetimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrating eu membership in romania the people in those countries have chosen our values .
communism has vanished , fallen apart , and that is a wonderful development .
the european status quo of the 1950s , 60s , 70s and 80s , the division of the continent , the berlin wall , a divided germany - all of that is gone .
so we can be very happy with the way things have developed , and now , of course , we have to try to structure things in a way that makes sense , in a way that europe 's citizens can understand it .
and that is the main task we are facing . and that 's one of the tasks the constitution sought to address .
but it was rejected by voters in france and the netherlands , and there are other countries where it 's far from clear that it would be passed in a referendum - probably not in britain , for example .
what has to be salvaged from this constitution to make europe capable of action ? we certainly have to keep the core of the constitution .
and that includes majority voting in the council of ministers .
this european union can no longer be led if huge swathes of european legislation require a unanimous vote .
we have majority voting in the european parliament - and it has to be that way in the council of ministers too .
i would also argue strongly that the second part of the constitution , which deals with values , human dignity , democracy , the principle of law , the principle of solidarity , human rights - this part must be transferred into european law .
without values , this eu has no future .
that is why these values are so important . herr pöttering , you will most likely be elected as the next president of the european parliament in mid-january .
if you are elected , what are your goals for the next two and a half years ? bildunterschrift : the european parliament in strasbourg i would like to use that position - and i would need the support of the whole parliament , of course - to try to bring the eu and the european parliament closer to the people .
and i would like to make our relationship to the islamic world a high priority .
those are the things i think i would focus on . you said yourself that the last 50 years in europe have been a great success story .
and yet the eu is suffering a bit of a depression .
what would your answer be to this sense of melancholy ? i do n't know if the eu is suffering from depression .
sometimes the situation is very paradoxical .
in the polish capital , warsaw , we have a government that could certainly be more committed to europe than it is and yet opinion polls show that 80 percent of the people in poland support the european constitution .
so the situation is very varied . of course there is skepticism .
that has always been the case .
and that 's why it 's important that we press ahead with european projects , as commission president jose manuel barroso says .
it 's important that we have successes and we do have successes , and we need to talk about them .
above all , we need to make it clear to people that the glass is half full , not half empty .
and if we approach european policy with optimism and hope and confidence , then i think we will be able to get europe moving forwards again and the people of europe moving forward with us . alexander kudascheff interviewed hans-gert pöttering -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de drumming up support for the eu constitution german chancellor angela merkel has much on her agenda as she kicks off the eu presidency .

that 's not going to happen as he had a little too much faith in the reliability of his campaign helpers . ernst-ewald roth certainly showed that he was serious about his political aspirations when he announced his intention to run for the office of mayor of wiesbaden , the capital of the central german state of hesse . since a catholic priest is n't allowed to meddle in politics -lrb- at least officially -rrb- , the 53-year-old had to step down from his post as the city 's highest-ranking catholic priest , relying on a welfare salary from his church to get by while he was hoping to claim city hall come march 13 . wiesbaden 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- nominated roth , who is not a party member , for the post and posters went up around town to tell voters that the cleric was the best choice to run the wealthy but sleepy town of some 275,000 people that 's located just west of frankfurt . everything seemed to be going just fine - until someone noticed that spd campaign officials had missed a fairly important deadline last thursday .

"
this is where hafida sadek lives with her two children .
as a maid , she earns 680 euros per month .
that is n't much in paris .
a 10-square-meter apartment in the french capital costs about 500 euros .
" i have been trying for 10 years to get a subsidized apartment but they keep telling me there are n't any available , " sadek said .
it is people like sadek - an estimated 100,000 of them in france - that an organization called the children of don quixote is fighting for .
it was this group which took over the abandoned office building in a ritzy part of paris to provide housing for people such as sadek and has been calling on the government to help them .
and it seems that these days , the french government is listening .
politicians jumping on the wagon this week , the french government announced plans to create a " legal right " to housing in response to a snowballing campaign that has seen a tent city for the homeless spring up in the heart of paris .
bildunterschrift : tent cities have sprung up all over france prime minister dominique de villepin said a bill would be presented to the cabinet on january 17 and hopefully adopted before parliament breaks up ahead of april 's presidential election .
the law , if passed , would make france the second european country to guarantee the right to housing , after scotland which adopted similar measures with its 2003 homeless act .
president jacques chirac used his new year 's address to promise swift government action on a " right to housing " - a key demand of the protestors .
legally enforceable villepin said the government wanted the right to become legally enforceable by 2008 for " people in the most difficult situations : the homeless , but also the working poor and single women with children . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests and tent cities have garnered much attention " that is the time necessary to ensure that all the people concerned can be provided with decent lodgings , whether in a transitional shelter or an individual home , " he said .
by 2012 , the government wants the right to housing to be legally enforceable for all , with a guarantee provided by the state , or in some cases regional or local authorities .
from that point onwards , " every person or family housed in unworthy or unsanitary conditions " will able to take legal action to have their rights enforced , he said .
villepin said the law would " make france one of the most advanced countries in terms of social rights . "
housing would become the third legally enforceable right in france , along with access to education and healthcare .
four months ahead of presidential elections , with the homeless issue thrust centre-stage , the housing measure was seen as a bid by the centre-right to underscore its commitment to social justice .
the children of don quixote the protest wave started last month when a small group of campaigners - called the children of don quixote - pitched a 200-strong tent camp along a trendy paris canal , housing homeless people as well as well-heeled citizens prepared to sleep rough for a few days out of solidarity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebritites have come out to support the homeless makeshift camps have since sprung up all over france , including in the mediterranean port of marseille , the historic town of orleans , and the southern cities of lyon and toulouse .
on tuesday a group of eight struggling families , backed by campaigners , moved into a vacant office block near the paris stock exchange , a giant squat that has been dubbed a " ministry " for the homeless and ill-housed .
politicians of all stripes - including presidential frontrunners nicolas sarkozy on the right and segolene royal on the left - had responded on cue , lining up with pledges to tackle the plight of the homeless .
emergency plan according to the charity emmaus , one million people in france do not have a home of their own : 100,000 sleep rough , while the rest live in campsites , hotels or shelters .
another two million people have housing " problems . "
the " right to housing " measures comes in addition to a 70-million-euro -lrb- $ 90 million -rrb- emergency plan for the homeless announced last month .
but a spokesman for segolene royal , the socialist presidential frontrunner , warned the government against making " great announcements , " saying what was needed was a massive commitment to build more public housing . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's homeless must leap hurdles to get help germany is a wealthy country with a cushy social welfare system , but drugs , red tape and a lack of motivation keep some people on the streets .

the four percent increase from the previous year 's total was primarily a result of a surge in new car registrations in the last two months of 2006 . " those were two fabulous months , but the results are exceptions to the automakers ' normal sales levels , " said vda president bernd gottschalk . new models , incentives and improved consumer confidence , especially among private customers , contributed to the development , vda said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the german eu presidency a dummy 's guide to the eu german fm : kosovo biggest problem right now commission proposes eu-wide green card for migrants germany determined to strengthen european police agency european union -pipe- 06.01.2007 " without values , this eu has no future " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pöttering has been a european parliamentarian since 1979 dw-tv talked to hans-gert pöttering , the likely new president of the european parliament , about the german eu presidency , the chances for an eu constitution and his plans as leader of the bloc 's legislative . dw-tv : germany has taken on the eu 's rotating presidency and with it the running of the bloc 's business for the next six months .
what can we expect ? hans-gert pöttering : i would like the german presidency to come up with a way of moving forward .
and i would like a decision on what mandate any conference on the european constitution would have - if such a conference takes place - in an attempt to realize the main goal of the constitution . when it comes down to the substance , though , the main thing will be to come up with some kind of timetable for a european constitution .
is that the least we can expect from the germans in the next six months ? we certainly expect that - but that is n't all that we expect .
i hope that the german presidency will be more ambitious than that - and i 'm sure it will be .
i hope there will be a discussion about how far we want to see the enlargement of the eu to go .
do we want to take in every country that wants to join the union - or do we want to say that there have to be limits , geographical limits as well ? are there geographical limits ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much further can the eu expand ?
in terms of the steps we take , there certainly are .
we first need to strengthen the structures of the european union - and that 's why we need to see the substance of the proposed constitution enacted .
if we do n't have that , then - with the possible exception of croatia , we can pretty much forget any further enlargement .
then we have to look at what 's going to happen with ukraine , and the balkan nations , what 's going to happen with the countries in the caucasus , and the countries in northern africa .
these are all neighboring countries , and there are lots of things that connect us to them - but also things that do n't connect .
and we need stable partnerships , we need policies for our neighbors , and i hope the debate on that will grow in intensity during the german presidency . the balkan nations have already been given a per spective on their eu aspirations - and one day they will probably join .
then the eu will comprise 33 or 34 nations .
independent of the debate on the constitution : would that already represent a critical mass , when the eu is no longer what it was , but effectively an organization for security and co-o per ation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- with a few differences in its substance ? yes , it ca n't just become another osce - it ca n't just be a loose union .
what we want is a strong europe that can act .
nonetheless , we should be happy that europe is as it is today .
to put it personally : i have been a member of the european parliament since 1979 , since the first direct elections .
and if someone had said back then that on may 1 , 2004 , we would see estonia , latvia , lithuania , poland , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary and slovenia joining the eu , then i would have said that 's wonderful , that 's visionary .
and this vision has become reality in our lifetimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrating eu membership in romania the people in those countries have chosen our values .
communism has vanished , fallen apart , and that is a wonderful development .
the european status quo of the 1950s , 60s , 70s and 80s , the division of the continent , the berlin wall , a divided germany - all of that is gone .
so we can be very happy with the way things have developed , and now , of course , we have to try to structure things in a way that makes sense , in a way that europe 's citizens can understand it .
and that is the main task we are facing . and that 's one of the tasks the constitution sought to address .
but it was rejected by voters in france and the netherlands , and there are other countries where it 's far from clear that it would be passed in a referendum - probably not in britain , for example .
what has to be salvaged from this constitution to make europe capable of action ? we certainly have to keep the core of the constitution .
and that includes majority voting in the council of ministers .
this european union can no longer be led if huge swathes of european legislation require a unanimous vote .
we have majority voting in the european parliament - and it has to be that way in the council of ministers too .
i would also argue strongly that the second part of the constitution , which deals with values , human dignity , democracy , the principle of law , the principle of solidarity , human rights - this part must be transferred into european law .
without values , this eu has no future .
that is why these values are so important . herr pöttering , you will most likely be elected as the next president of the european parliament in mid-january .
if you are elected , what are your goals for the next two and a half years ? bildunterschrift : the european parliament in strasbourg i would like to use that position - and i would need the support of the whole parliament , of course - to try to bring the eu and the european parliament closer to the people .
and i would like to make our relationship to the islamic world a high priority .
those are the things i think i would focus on . you said yourself that the last 50 years in europe have been a great success story .
and yet the eu is suffering a bit of a depression .
what would your answer be to this sense of melancholy ? i do n't know if the eu is suffering from depression .
sometimes the situation is very paradoxical .
in the polish capital , warsaw , we have a government that could certainly be more committed to europe than it is and yet opinion polls show that 80 percent of the people in poland support the european constitution .
so the situation is very varied . of course there is skepticism .
that has always been the case .
and that 's why it 's important that we press ahead with european projects , as commission president jose manuel barroso says .
it 's important that we have successes and we do have successes , and we need to talk about them .
above all , we need to make it clear to people that the glass is half full , not half empty .
and if we approach european policy with optimism and hope and confidence , then i think we will be able to get europe moving forwards again and the people of europe moving forward with us . alexander kudascheff interviewed hans-gert pöttering -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de drumming up support for the eu constitution german chancellor angela merkel has much on her agenda as she kicks off the eu presidency .

that 's not going to happen as he had a little too much faith in the reliability of his campaign helpers . ernst-ewald roth certainly showed that he was serious about his political aspirations when he announced his intention to run for the office of mayor of wiesbaden , the capital of the central german state of hesse . since a catholic priest is n't allowed to meddle in politics -lrb- at least officially -rrb- , the 53-year-old had to step down from his post as the city 's highest-ranking catholic priest , relying on a welfare salary from his church to get by while he was hoping to claim city hall come march 13 . wiesbaden 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- nominated roth , who is not a party member , for the post and posters went up around town to tell voters that the cleric was the best choice to run the wealthy but sleepy town of some 275,000 people that 's located just west of frankfurt . everything seemed to be going just fine - until someone noticed that spd campaign officials had missed a fairly important deadline last thursday .

the country also saw a surge of new passenger car registrations - mainly a result of buyers rushing to beat a tax hike . new car sales in germany reached their highest level in seven years in 2006 , the german automotive industry association -lrb- vda -rrb- said this week . a total of 3.47 million vehicles were sold in the 12 months ending in december , vda said .
the four percent increase from the previous year 's total was primarily a result of a surge in new car registrations in the last two months of 2006 . " those were two fabulous months , but the results are exceptions to the automakers ' normal sales levels , " said vda president bernd gottschalk . new models , incentives and improved consumer confidence , especially among private customers , contributed to the development , vda said .

germany raised this tax by three percent to 19 percent as of january 1 , 2007 . " business was booming at the end of the year ; the warehouses were emptied , " gottschalk said .
" now we have to hope that we do n't get off to a rocky start in the new year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the german eu presidency a dummy 's guide to the eu german fm : kosovo biggest problem right now commission proposes eu-wide green card for migrants germany determined to strengthen european police agency european union -pipe- 06.01.2007 " without values , this eu has no future " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pöttering has been a european parliamentarian since 1979 dw-tv talked to hans-gert pöttering , the likely new president of the european parliament , about the german eu presidency , the chances for an eu constitution and his plans as leader of the bloc 's legislative . dw-tv : germany has taken on the eu 's rotating presidency and with it the running of the bloc 's business for the next six months .
what can we expect ? hans-gert pöttering : i would like the german presidency to come up with a way of moving forward .
and i would like a decision on what mandate any conference on the european constitution would have - if such a conference takes place - in an attempt to realize the main goal of the constitution . when it comes down to the substance , though , the main thing will be to come up with some kind of timetable for a european constitution .
is that the least we can expect from the germans in the next six months ? we certainly expect that - but that is n't all that we expect .
i hope that the german presidency will be more ambitious than that - and i 'm sure it will be .
i hope there will be a discussion about how far we want to see the enlargement of the eu to go .
do we want to take in every country that wants to join the union - or do we want to say that there have to be limits , geographical limits as well ? are there geographical limits ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much further can the eu expand ?
in terms of the steps we take , there certainly are .
we first need to strengthen the structures of the european union - and that 's why we need to see the substance of the proposed constitution enacted .
if we do n't have that , then - with the possible exception of croatia , we can pretty much forget any further enlargement .
then we have to look at what 's going to happen with ukraine , and the balkan nations , what 's going to happen with the countries in the caucasus , and the countries in northern africa .
these are all neighboring countries , and there are lots of things that connect us to them - but also things that do n't connect .
and we need stable partnerships , we need policies for our neighbors , and i hope the debate on that will grow in intensity during the german presidency . the balkan nations have already been given a per spective on their eu aspirations - and one day they will probably join .
then the eu will comprise 33 or 34 nations .
independent of the debate on the constitution : would that already represent a critical mass , when the eu is no longer what it was , but effectively an organization for security and co-o per ation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- with a few differences in its substance ? yes , it ca n't just become another osce - it ca n't just be a loose union .
what we want is a strong europe that can act .
nonetheless , we should be happy that europe is as it is today .
to put it personally : i have been a member of the european parliament since 1979 , since the first direct elections .
and if someone had said back then that on may 1 , 2004 , we would see estonia , latvia , lithuania , poland , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary and slovenia joining the eu , then i would have said that 's wonderful , that 's visionary .
and this vision has become reality in our lifetimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrating eu membership in romania the people in those countries have chosen our values .
communism has vanished , fallen apart , and that is a wonderful development .
the european status quo of the 1950s , 60s , 70s and 80s , the division of the continent , the berlin wall , a divided germany - all of that is gone .
so we can be very happy with the way things have developed , and now , of course , we have to try to structure things in a way that makes sense , in a way that europe 's citizens can understand it .
and that is the main task we are facing . and that 's one of the tasks the constitution sought to address .
but it was rejected by voters in france and the netherlands , and there are other countries where it 's far from clear that it would be passed in a referendum - probably not in britain , for example .
what has to be salvaged from this constitution to make europe capable of action ? we certainly have to keep the core of the constitution .
and that includes majority voting in the council of ministers .
this european union can no longer be led if huge swathes of european legislation require a unanimous vote .
we have majority voting in the european parliament - and it has to be that way in the council of ministers too .
i would also argue strongly that the second part of the constitution , which deals with values , human dignity , democracy , the principle of law , the principle of solidarity , human rights - this part must be transferred into european law .
without values , this eu has no future .
that is why these values are so important . herr pöttering , you will most likely be elected as the next president of the european parliament in mid-january .
if you are elected , what are your goals for the next two and a half years ? bildunterschrift : the european parliament in strasbourg i would like to use that position - and i would need the support of the whole parliament , of course - to try to bring the eu and the european parliament closer to the people .
and i would like to make our relationship to the islamic world a high priority .
those are the things i think i would focus on . you said yourself that the last 50 years in europe have been a great success story .
and yet the eu is suffering a bit of a depression .
what would your answer be to this sense of melancholy ? i do n't know if the eu is suffering from depression .
sometimes the situation is very paradoxical .
in the polish capital , warsaw , we have a government that could certainly be more committed to europe than it is and yet opinion polls show that 80 percent of the people in poland support the european constitution .
so the situation is very varied . of course there is skepticism .
that has always been the case .
and that 's why it 's important that we press ahead with european projects , as commission president jose manuel barroso says .
it 's important that we have successes and we do have successes , and we need to talk about them .
above all , we need to make it clear to people that the glass is half full , not half empty .
and if we approach european policy with optimism and hope and confidence , then i think we will be able to get europe moving forwards again and the people of europe moving forward with us . alexander kudascheff interviewed hans-gert pöttering -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de drumming up support for the eu constitution german chancellor angela merkel has much on her agenda as she kicks off the eu presidency .

that 's not going to happen as he had a little too much faith in the reliability of his campaign helpers . ernst-ewald roth certainly showed that he was serious about his political aspirations when he announced his intention to run for the office of mayor of wiesbaden , the capital of the central german state of hesse . since a catholic priest is n't allowed to meddle in politics -lrb- at least officially -rrb- , the 53-year-old had to step down from his post as the city 's highest-ranking catholic priest , relying on a welfare salary from his church to get by while he was hoping to claim city hall come march 13 . wiesbaden 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- nominated roth , who is not a party member , for the post and posters went up around town to tell voters that the cleric was the best choice to run the wealthy but sleepy town of some 275,000 people that 's located just west of frankfurt . everything seemed to be going just fine - until someone noticed that spd campaign officials had missed a fairly important deadline last thursday .
no one had filed roth 's nomination with the civic election commission - bad news since that meant that he could no longer run in the election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiesbaden 's bound to be ruled by a conservative after the election " i 'm deeply disappointed , " roth told voters on his web site .
he added that he wants to continue to work for the folks that have supported him during his campaign . the leaders of the local spd chapter have since resigned . " the mistakes that can be made in this world will be made , " said kurt beck , the national spd leader , who serves as premier of the neighboring state of rhineland-palatinate . the party 's general secretary , hubertus heil , put it more bluntly .

what has to be salvaged from this constitution to make europe capable of action ? we certainly have to keep the core of the constitution .
and that includes majority voting in the council of ministers .
this european union can no longer be led if huge swathes of european legislation require a unanimous vote .
we have majority voting in the european parliament - and it has to be that way in the council of ministers too .
i would also argue strongly that the second part of the constitution , which deals with values , human dignity , democracy , the principle of law , the principle of solidarity , human rights - this part must be transferred into european law .
without values , this eu has no future .
that is why these values are so important . herr pöttering , you will most likely be elected as the next president of the european parliament in mid-january .
if you are elected , what are your goals for the next two and a half years ? bildunterschrift : the european parliament in strasbourg i would like to use that position - and i would need the support of the whole parliament , of course - to try to bring the eu and the european parliament closer to the people .
and i would like to make our relationship to the islamic world a high priority .
those are the things i think i would focus on . you said yourself that the last 50 years in europe have been a great success story .
and yet the eu is suffering a bit of a depression .
what would your answer be to this sense of melancholy ? i do n't know if the eu is suffering from depression .
sometimes the situation is very paradoxical .
in the polish capital , warsaw , we have a government that could certainly be more committed to europe than it is and yet opinion polls show that 80 percent of the people in poland support the european constitution .
so the situation is very varied . of course there is skepticism .
that has always been the case .
and that 's why it 's important that we press ahead with european projects , as commission president jose manuel barroso says .
it 's important that we have successes and we do have successes , and we need to talk about them .
above all , we need to make it clear to people that the glass is half full , not half empty .
and if we approach european policy with optimism and hope and confidence , then i think we will be able to get europe moving forwards again and the people of europe moving forward with us . alexander kudascheff interviewed hans-gert pöttering -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de drumming up support for the eu constitution german chancellor angela merkel has much on her agenda as she kicks off the eu presidency .

in the meantime , romanian actors , directors and screenwriters have started to rake in prizes from cannes to copenhagen and from thailand to turkey and the united states . among those most recently honored at cannes were dorotheea petre who won the " un certain regard " best actress award in 2006 for " the way i spent the end of the world " and director cristi puiu , who won in the same competition a year earlier for " the death of mr. lazarescu . "
coppola rediscovers himself the movie industry " is one of romania 's finest ambassadors , " a representative for the national center for cinematography -lrb- cnc -rrb- told afp . further , new york times critic stephen holden has rated " the death of mr. lazarescu " among the top 10 films of 2006 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from " the death of mr. lazarescu " - one of stephen holden 's top 10 films of 2006 coppola has since finished filming but not yet released his personal , low-profile film , " youth without youth , " based on the work of romanian philosopher mircea eliade and with an almost exclusively romanian crew . local media quoted coppola as telling a university audience : " i have come here to rediscover myself as an artist . " puiu told afp that coppola choosing so many local technicians " means a lot more than any film school exam . " corruption still rife but cinema is not complete without controversy , and puiu also sharply criticized national shortcomings , adding that " corruption in romania has reached unbelievable heights . " personally , he said , when compromise and concessions were taken into account , " i had to pay , in a way , for the right to make films . " andrei boncea of mediapro pictures tempered that view , saying that regular contracts with international companies meant " we work to certain rules and standards " and competition for national subsidies was another issue . media pro and castel film studios are romania 's world-class private production companies , with movies like " amen " by costa-gavras , " cold mountain " with nicole kidman and more than 150 other feature films between them since 1998 . much of their work is contract production , but media pro also makes its own films and television series .
both groups together have more than two dozen soundstages along with water tanks , lakes , forests , post-production facilities and an army of multilingual contractors for everything from low-cost set construction to high-tech special effects . castel claims the biggest single studio in continental europe at 3,274 square meters -lrb- 35,241 square feet -rrb- , which is available for 10,000 euros per week . production costs are about half those in britain and 30 percent lower than in the czech republic , and a cutting-edge kodak lab now provides film processing . diverse landscape bogdan moncea of castel films called romania " a one-stop shop for foreign productions " offering unblemished rural to bleak industrial landscapes , and architectural styles from " german gothic in transylvania to french art nouveau or 21st century in bucharest . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania offers filmmakers unique scenery , such as bran castle in transylvania the executed dictator nicolae ceausescu 's megalomaniac people 's palace has served as a shooting location as well . in 1992 , french assistant director olivier jacquet was on his first romanian shoot when " the prop master showed up with his hands in his pockets and a tool belt that held a hammer and some nails , and that 's it . " with creation and production back on track , romanian film distribution must now be brought up to speed , and ways found to fill seats in theatres . " we are one of the countries with the lowest rate of admission in central and eastern europe , " said boncea of media pro . but , " that 's definitely going to change , " he vowed , adding that the media group had renovated a historic movie palace and was also building multiplex theatres . whether that happens remains to be seen , as does coppola 's film , which production director doina dragnea suggested might lead to more work given the positive chemistry between the us director and romanian crew . " he says he will come back soon , " she said . dw staff / afp -lrb- rar -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european papers give cool reception to new eu members european commentators on tuesday had mixed reactions about bulgaria and romania 's entry into the european union .

that 's not going to happen as he had a little too much faith in the reliability of his campaign helpers . ernst-ewald roth certainly showed that he was serious about his political aspirations when he announced his intention to run for the office of mayor of wiesbaden , the capital of the central german state of hesse . since a catholic priest is n't allowed to meddle in politics -lrb- at least officially -rrb- , the 53-year-old had to step down from his post as the city 's highest-ranking catholic priest , relying on a welfare salary from his church to get by while he was hoping to claim city hall come march 13 . wiesbaden 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- nominated roth , who is not a party member , for the post and posters went up around town to tell voters that the cleric was the best choice to run the wealthy but sleepy town of some 275,000 people that 's located just west of frankfurt . everything seemed to be going just fine - until someone noticed that spd campaign officials had missed a fairly important deadline last thursday .
no one had filed roth 's nomination with the civic election commission - bad news since that meant that he could no longer run in the election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiesbaden 's bound to be ruled by a conservative after the election " i 'm deeply disappointed , " roth told voters on his web site .
he added that he wants to continue to work for the folks that have supported him during his campaign . the leaders of the local spd chapter have since resigned . " the mistakes that can be made in this world will be made , " said kurt beck , the national spd leader , who serves as premier of the neighboring state of rhineland-palatinate . the party 's general secretary , hubertus heil , put it more bluntly .

"
this is where hafida sadek lives with her two children .
as a maid , she earns 680 euros per month .
that is n't much in paris .
a 10-square-meter apartment in the french capital costs about 500 euros .
" i have been trying for 10 years to get a subsidized apartment but they keep telling me there are n't any available , " sadek said .
it is people like sadek - an estimated 100,000 of them in france - that an organization called the children of don quixote is fighting for .
it was this group which took over the abandoned office building in a ritzy part of paris to provide housing for people such as sadek and has been calling on the government to help them .
and it seems that these days , the french government is listening .
politicians jumping on the wagon this week , the french government announced plans to create a " legal right " to housing in response to a snowballing campaign that has seen a tent city for the homeless spring up in the heart of paris .
bildunterschrift : tent cities have sprung up all over france prime minister dominique de villepin said a bill would be presented to the cabinet on january 17 and hopefully adopted before parliament breaks up ahead of april 's presidential election .
the law , if passed , would make france the second european country to guarantee the right to housing , after scotland which adopted similar measures with its 2003 homeless act .
president jacques chirac used his new year 's address to promise swift government action on a " right to housing " - a key demand of the protestors .
legally enforceable villepin said the government wanted the right to become legally enforceable by 2008 for " people in the most difficult situations : the homeless , but also the working poor and single women with children . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests and tent cities have garnered much attention " that is the time necessary to ensure that all the people concerned can be provided with decent lodgings , whether in a transitional shelter or an individual home , " he said .
by 2012 , the government wants the right to housing to be legally enforceable for all , with a guarantee provided by the state , or in some cases regional or local authorities .
from that point onwards , " every person or family housed in unworthy or unsanitary conditions " will able to take legal action to have their rights enforced , he said .
villepin said the law would " make france one of the most advanced countries in terms of social rights . "
housing would become the third legally enforceable right in france , along with access to education and healthcare .
four months ahead of presidential elections , with the homeless issue thrust centre-stage , the housing measure was seen as a bid by the centre-right to underscore its commitment to social justice .
the children of don quixote the protest wave started last month when a small group of campaigners - called the children of don quixote - pitched a 200-strong tent camp along a trendy paris canal , housing homeless people as well as well-heeled citizens prepared to sleep rough for a few days out of solidarity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebritites have come out to support the homeless makeshift camps have since sprung up all over france , including in the mediterranean port of marseille , the historic town of orleans , and the southern cities of lyon and toulouse .
on tuesday a group of eight struggling families , backed by campaigners , moved into a vacant office block near the paris stock exchange , a giant squat that has been dubbed a " ministry " for the homeless and ill-housed .
politicians of all stripes - including presidential frontrunners nicolas sarkozy on the right and segolene royal on the left - had responded on cue , lining up with pledges to tackle the plight of the homeless .
emergency plan according to the charity emmaus , one million people in france do not have a home of their own : 100,000 sleep rough , while the rest live in campsites , hotels or shelters .
another two million people have housing " problems . "
the " right to housing " measures comes in addition to a 70-million-euro -lrb- $ 90 million -rrb- emergency plan for the homeless announced last month .

the country also saw a surge of new passenger car registrations - mainly a result of buyers rushing to beat a tax hike . new car sales in germany reached their highest level in seven years in 2006 , the german automotive industry association -lrb- vda -rrb- said this week . a total of 3.47 million vehicles were sold in the 12 months ending in december , vda said .
the four percent increase from the previous year 's total was primarily a result of a surge in new car registrations in the last two months of 2006 . " those were two fabulous months , but the results are exceptions to the automakers ' normal sales levels , " said vda president bernd gottschalk . new models , incentives and improved consumer confidence , especially among private customers , contributed to the development , vda said .
but there was also a rush to buy ahead of the country 's value-added or sales tax -lrb- vat -rrb- increase .
germany raised this tax by three percent to 19 percent as of january 1 , 2007 . " business was booming at the end of the year ; the warehouses were emptied , " gottschalk said .
" now we have to hope that we do n't get off to a rocky start in the new year . " industry hopes positive trend will continue for 2007 , the market environment at the start of the year would be strained , especially by a reduced tax break for commuters and an additional hike in fuel prices , vda said .
the higher sales tax and insurance tax would also play a role . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vw bug has been one of the most famous german cars in history " now , everything depends on whether or not we 've cleared the hurdle and can look forward to strong economic growth and improved consumer confidence , " gottschalk said .
" there 's certainly no lack of new models , and lots of consumers need to replace older cars . " gottschalk said the average age of a passenger car in germany was over eight years .
this was older than ever before . exports remain strong exports reached a record high of 3.9 million vehicles in 2006 , a 2.5 percent increase .
even on the us market , which registered a decline of 3 percent , german companies still succeeded in boosting their sales by six percent to 921,000 vehicles , vda said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : audi is a popular car worldwide in production , a total of 5.4 million passenger cars rolled off german automakers ' assembly lines in 2006 .
this one percent increase represented a new production record and demonstrated the industry 's domestic success , gottschalk said . " at the same time , the german automakers ' 13 percent increase in production at plants abroad shows that they are playing an active role in the process of globalization , " gottschalk said . vda said it expected turnover to remain stable in 2007 . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vw sales hit record high as executive faces trial golfs , polos , passats and other favorite vw models have been selling like hotcakes , volkswagen has announced .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the german eu presidency a dummy 's guide to the eu german fm : kosovo biggest problem right now commission proposes eu-wide green card for migrants germany determined to strengthen european police agency european union -pipe- 06.01.2007 " without values , this eu has no future " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pöttering has been a european parliamentarian since 1979 dw-tv talked to hans-gert pöttering , the likely new president of the european parliament , about the german eu presidency , the chances for an eu constitution and his plans as leader of the bloc 's legislative . dw-tv : germany has taken on the eu 's rotating presidency and with it the running of the bloc 's business for the next six months .
what can we expect ? hans-gert pöttering : i would like the german presidency to come up with a way of moving forward .
and i would like a decision on what mandate any conference on the european constitution would have - if such a conference takes place - in an attempt to realize the main goal of the constitution . when it comes down to the substance , though , the main thing will be to come up with some kind of timetable for a european constitution .
is that the least we can expect from the germans in the next six months ? we certainly expect that - but that is n't all that we expect .
i hope that the german presidency will be more ambitious than that - and i 'm sure it will be .
i hope there will be a discussion about how far we want to see the enlargement of the eu to go .
do we want to take in every country that wants to join the union - or do we want to say that there have to be limits , geographical limits as well ? are there geographical limits ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much further can the eu expand ?
in terms of the steps we take , there certainly are .
we first need to strengthen the structures of the european union - and that 's why we need to see the substance of the proposed constitution enacted .
if we do n't have that , then - with the possible exception of croatia , we can pretty much forget any further enlargement .
then we have to look at what 's going to happen with ukraine , and the balkan nations , what 's going to happen with the countries in the caucasus , and the countries in northern africa .
these are all neighboring countries , and there are lots of things that connect us to them - but also things that do n't connect .
and we need stable partnerships , we need policies for our neighbors , and i hope the debate on that will grow in intensity during the german presidency . the balkan nations have already been given a per spective on their eu aspirations - and one day they will probably join .
then the eu will comprise 33 or 34 nations .
independent of the debate on the constitution : would that already represent a critical mass , when the eu is no longer what it was , but effectively an organization for security and co-o per ation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- with a few differences in its substance ? yes , it ca n't just become another osce - it ca n't just be a loose union .
what we want is a strong europe that can act .
nonetheless , we should be happy that europe is as it is today .
to put it personally : i have been a member of the european parliament since 1979 , since the first direct elections .
and if someone had said back then that on may 1 , 2004 , we would see estonia , latvia , lithuania , poland , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary and slovenia joining the eu , then i would have said that 's wonderful , that 's visionary .
and this vision has become reality in our lifetimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrating eu membership in romania the people in those countries have chosen our values .
communism has vanished , fallen apart , and that is a wonderful development .
the european status quo of the 1950s , 60s , 70s and 80s , the division of the continent , the berlin wall , a divided germany - all of that is gone .
so we can be very happy with the way things have developed , and now , of course , we have to try to structure things in a way that makes sense , in a way that europe 's citizens can understand it .
and that is the main task we are facing . and that 's one of the tasks the constitution sought to address .
but it was rejected by voters in france and the netherlands , and there are other countries where it 's far from clear that it would be passed in a referendum - probably not in britain , for example .
what has to be salvaged from this constitution to make europe capable of action ? we certainly have to keep the core of the constitution .
and that includes majority voting in the council of ministers .
this european union can no longer be led if huge swathes of european legislation require a unanimous vote .
we have majority voting in the european parliament - and it has to be that way in the council of ministers too .
i would also argue strongly that the second part of the constitution , which deals with values , human dignity , democracy , the principle of law , the principle of solidarity , human rights - this part must be transferred into european law .
without values , this eu has no future .
that is why these values are so important . herr pöttering , you will most likely be elected as the next president of the european parliament in mid-january .
if you are elected , what are your goals for the next two and a half years ? bildunterschrift : the european parliament in strasbourg i would like to use that position - and i would need the support of the whole parliament , of course - to try to bring the eu and the european parliament closer to the people .
and i would like to make our relationship to the islamic world a high priority .
those are the things i think i would focus on . you said yourself that the last 50 years in europe have been a great success story .
and yet the eu is suffering a bit of a depression .
what would your answer be to this sense of melancholy ? i do n't know if the eu is suffering from depression .
sometimes the situation is very paradoxical .
in the polish capital , warsaw , we have a government that could certainly be more committed to europe than it is and yet opinion polls show that 80 percent of the people in poland support the european constitution .
so the situation is very varied . of course there is skepticism .
that has always been the case .
and that 's why it 's important that we press ahead with european projects , as commission president jose manuel barroso says .
it 's important that we have successes and we do have successes , and we need to talk about them .
above all , we need to make it clear to people that the glass is half full , not half empty .
and if we approach european policy with optimism and hope and confidence , then i think we will be able to get europe moving forwards again and the people of europe moving forward with us . alexander kudascheff interviewed hans-gert pöttering -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de drumming up support for the eu constitution german chancellor angela merkel has much on her agenda as she kicks off the eu presidency .

that 's not going to happen as he had a little too much faith in the reliability of his campaign helpers . ernst-ewald roth certainly showed that he was serious about his political aspirations when he announced his intention to run for the office of mayor of wiesbaden , the capital of the central german state of hesse . since a catholic priest is n't allowed to meddle in politics -lrb- at least officially -rrb- , the 53-year-old had to step down from his post as the city 's highest-ranking catholic priest , relying on a welfare salary from his church to get by while he was hoping to claim city hall come march 13 . wiesbaden 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- nominated roth , who is not a party member , for the post and posters went up around town to tell voters that the cleric was the best choice to run the wealthy but sleepy town of some 275,000 people that 's located just west of frankfurt . everything seemed to be going just fine - until someone noticed that spd campaign officials had missed a fairly important deadline last thursday .
no one had filed roth 's nomination with the civic election commission - bad news since that meant that he could no longer run in the election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wiesbaden 's bound to be ruled by a conservative after the election " i 'm deeply disappointed , " roth told voters on his web site .

mandelson himself will hold talks with us trade representative susan schwab in washington on the same day . " monday 's meeting is the opportunity for the eu and the us to invigorate the multilateral doha trade talks , " mandelson said in a statement .
" i hope both sides will signal strong new political commitment to rapid progress .
we have now entered a narrow window of opportunity lasting until easter during which success for the world trade talks is possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson at a wto conference in hong kong in 2005 " the quiet , constructive bilateral contacts of the last few months have made clear to us all the possible outline of a final deal , " he added .
" we now need the added momentum of political leadership from the highest level .
europe and the us have a shared responsibility to make this happen . " eu officials hope to see a change in political willingness to end the impasse with the passage of control in the us congress to the democrats . " it 's undeniable there was protectionist rhetoric around the elections in november but i think we have to look beyond that , " mandelson 's spokesman peter power said on friday . talks suspended in july the world trade organization suspended the so-called doha round in july after negotiators from six major players , including the us , eu , brazil and india , failed to hammer out a framework of an accord after five years of talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wto director-general french pascal lamy has been trying to bridge the gap the doha round , launched in the qatari capital in november 2001 , is mired in an impasse as western and developing countries remain split on issues such as agriculture subsidies and market access . developing countries are demanding lower tariffs on their agricultural exports to us and european markets while industrialized nations seek greater access to developing and emerging countries for their industrial goods and services . eu concessions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who will give in ?
mandelson 's office stressed that europe remains willing to improve its farm tariff offer by adding substantially to the 39 percent cuts it offered a year ago .
europe is ready to add more than 10 percentage points " and get within close reach of the average farm tariff cut demanded by developing countries , " which is 51.5 percent , the statement said . " we are ready to do this in a way that demonstrably gives new market access to the united states and other agricultural exporters in all products , " it added . the eu is asking washington to make for real cuts in its farm subsidies , also to levels close to those requested by developing countries .
this would mean a budget cut of around $ 8 billion dollars -lrb- six billion euros -rrb- from current ceilings of $ 23 billion to around $ 15 billion . big agenda apart from mandelson and barroso , the eu 's external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner will also take part in the visit to washington .
trade and economic ties aside , the talks are also expected to focus on energy security , climate change and the middle east .

what can we expect ? hans-gert pöttering : i would like the german presidency to come up with a way of moving forward .
and i would like a decision on what mandate any conference on the european constitution would have - if such a conference takes place - in an attempt to realize the main goal of the constitution . when it comes down to the substance , though , the main thing will be to come up with some kind of timetable for a european constitution .
is that the least we can expect from the germans in the next six months ? we certainly expect that - but that is n't all that we expect .
i hope that the german presidency will be more ambitious than that - and i 'm sure it will be .
i hope there will be a discussion about how far we want to see the enlargement of the eu to go .
do we want to take in every country that wants to join the union - or do we want to say that there have to be limits , geographical limits as well ? are there geographical limits ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much further can the eu expand ?
in terms of the steps we take , there certainly are .
we first need to strengthen the structures of the european union - and that 's why we need to see the substance of the proposed constitution enacted .
if we do n't have that , then - with the possible exception of croatia , we can pretty much forget any further enlargement .
then we have to look at what 's going to happen with ukraine , and the balkan nations , what 's going to happen with the countries in the caucasus , and the countries in northern africa .
these are all neighboring countries , and there are lots of things that connect us to them - but also things that do n't connect .
and we need stable partnerships , we need policies for our neighbors , and i hope the debate on that will grow in intensity during the german presidency . the balkan nations have already been given a per spective on their eu aspirations - and one day they will probably join .
then the eu will comprise 33 or 34 nations .
independent of the debate on the constitution : would that already represent a critical mass , when the eu is no longer what it was , but effectively an organization for security and co-o per ation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- with a few differences in its substance ? yes , it ca n't just become another osce - it ca n't just be a loose union .
what we want is a strong europe that can act .
nonetheless , we should be happy that europe is as it is today .
to put it personally : i have been a member of the european parliament since 1979 , since the first direct elections .
and if someone had said back then that on may 1 , 2004 , we would see estonia , latvia , lithuania , poland , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary and slovenia joining the eu , then i would have said that 's wonderful , that 's visionary .
and this vision has become reality in our lifetimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrating eu membership in romania the people in those countries have chosen our values .
communism has vanished , fallen apart , and that is a wonderful development .
the european status quo of the 1950s , 60s , 70s and 80s , the division of the continent , the berlin wall , a divided germany - all of that is gone .
so we can be very happy with the way things have developed , and now , of course , we have to try to structure things in a way that makes sense , in a way that europe 's citizens can understand it .
and that is the main task we are facing . and that 's one of the tasks the constitution sought to address .
but it was rejected by voters in france and the netherlands , and there are other countries where it 's far from clear that it would be passed in a referendum - probably not in britain , for example .
what has to be salvaged from this constitution to make europe capable of action ? we certainly have to keep the core of the constitution .
and that includes majority voting in the council of ministers .
this european union can no longer be led if huge swathes of european legislation require a unanimous vote .
we have majority voting in the european parliament - and it has to be that way in the council of ministers too .
i would also argue strongly that the second part of the constitution , which deals with values , human dignity , democracy , the principle of law , the principle of solidarity , human rights - this part must be transferred into european law .
without values , this eu has no future .
that is why these values are so important . herr pöttering , you will most likely be elected as the next president of the european parliament in mid-january .
if you are elected , what are your goals for the next two and a half years ? bildunterschrift : the european parliament in strasbourg i would like to use that position - and i would need the support of the whole parliament , of course - to try to bring the eu and the european parliament closer to the people .
and i would like to make our relationship to the islamic world a high priority .
those are the things i think i would focus on . you said yourself that the last 50 years in europe have been a great success story .
and yet the eu is suffering a bit of a depression .
what would your answer be to this sense of melancholy ? i do n't know if the eu is suffering from depression .
sometimes the situation is very paradoxical .
in the polish capital , warsaw , we have a government that could certainly be more committed to europe than it is and yet opinion polls show that 80 percent of the people in poland support the european constitution .
so the situation is very varied . of course there is skepticism .
that has always been the case .
and that 's why it 's important that we press ahead with european projects , as commission president jose manuel barroso says .
it 's important that we have successes and we do have successes , and we need to talk about them .
above all , we need to make it clear to people that the glass is half full , not half empty .
and if we approach european policy with optimism and hope and confidence , then i think we will be able to get europe moving forwards again and the people of europe moving forward with us . alexander kudascheff interviewed hans-gert pöttering -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de drumming up support for the eu constitution german chancellor angela merkel has much on her agenda as she kicks off the eu presidency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the german eu presidency a dummy 's guide to the eu german fm : kosovo biggest problem right now commission proposes eu-wide green card for migrants germany determined to strengthen european police agency european union -pipe- 06.01.2007 " without values , this eu has no future " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pöttering has been a european parliamentarian since 1979 dw-tv talked to hans-gert pöttering , the likely new president of the european parliament , about the german eu presidency , the chances for an eu constitution and his plans as leader of the bloc 's legislative . dw-tv : germany has taken on the eu 's rotating presidency and with it the running of the bloc 's business for the next six months .
what can we expect ? hans-gert pöttering : i would like the german presidency to come up with a way of moving forward .
and i would like a decision on what mandate any conference on the european constitution would have - if such a conference takes place - in an attempt to realize the main goal of the constitution . when it comes down to the substance , though , the main thing will be to come up with some kind of timetable for a european constitution .
is that the least we can expect from the germans in the next six months ? we certainly expect that - but that is n't all that we expect .
i hope that the german presidency will be more ambitious than that - and i 'm sure it will be .
i hope there will be a discussion about how far we want to see the enlargement of the eu to go .
do we want to take in every country that wants to join the union - or do we want to say that there have to be limits , geographical limits as well ? are there geographical limits ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much further can the eu expand ?
in terms of the steps we take , there certainly are .
we first need to strengthen the structures of the european union - and that 's why we need to see the substance of the proposed constitution enacted .
if we do n't have that , then - with the possible exception of croatia , we can pretty much forget any further enlargement .
then we have to look at what 's going to happen with ukraine , and the balkan nations , what 's going to happen with the countries in the caucasus , and the countries in northern africa .
these are all neighboring countries , and there are lots of things that connect us to them - but also things that do n't connect .
and we need stable partnerships , we need policies for our neighbors , and i hope the debate on that will grow in intensity during the german presidency . the balkan nations have already been given a per spective on their eu aspirations - and one day they will probably join .
then the eu will comprise 33 or 34 nations .
independent of the debate on the constitution : would that already represent a critical mass , when the eu is no longer what it was , but effectively an organization for security and co-o per ation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- with a few differences in its substance ? yes , it ca n't just become another osce - it ca n't just be a loose union .
what we want is a strong europe that can act .
nonetheless , we should be happy that europe is as it is today .
to put it personally : i have been a member of the european parliament since 1979 , since the first direct elections .
and if someone had said back then that on may 1 , 2004 , we would see estonia , latvia , lithuania , poland , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary and slovenia joining the eu , then i would have said that 's wonderful , that 's visionary .
and this vision has become reality in our lifetimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrating eu membership in romania the people in those countries have chosen our values .
communism has vanished , fallen apart , and that is a wonderful development .
the european status quo of the 1950s , 60s , 70s and 80s , the division of the continent , the berlin wall , a divided germany - all of that is gone .
so we can be very happy with the way things have developed , and now , of course , we have to try to structure things in a way that makes sense , in a way that europe 's citizens can understand it .
and that is the main task we are facing . and that 's one of the tasks the constitution sought to address .
but it was rejected by voters in france and the netherlands , and there are other countries where it 's far from clear that it would be passed in a referendum - probably not in britain , for example .
what has to be salvaged from this constitution to make europe capable of action ? we certainly have to keep the core of the constitution .
and that includes majority voting in the council of ministers .
this european union can no longer be led if huge swathes of european legislation require a unanimous vote .
we have majority voting in the european parliament - and it has to be that way in the council of ministers too .
i would also argue strongly that the second part of the constitution , which deals with values , human dignity , democracy , the principle of law , the principle of solidarity , human rights - this part must be transferred into european law .
without values , this eu has no future .
that is why these values are so important . herr pöttering , you will most likely be elected as the next president of the european parliament in mid-january .
if you are elected , what are your goals for the next two and a half years ? bildunterschrift : the european parliament in strasbourg i would like to use that position - and i would need the support of the whole parliament , of course - to try to bring the eu and the european parliament closer to the people .
and i would like to make our relationship to the islamic world a high priority .
those are the things i think i would focus on . you said yourself that the last 50 years in europe have been a great success story .
and yet the eu is suffering a bit of a depression .
what would your answer be to this sense of melancholy ? i do n't know if the eu is suffering from depression .
sometimes the situation is very paradoxical .
in the polish capital , warsaw , we have a government that could certainly be more committed to europe than it is and yet opinion polls show that 80 percent of the people in poland support the european constitution .
so the situation is very varied . of course there is skepticism .
that has always been the case .
and that 's why it 's important that we press ahead with european projects , as commission president jose manuel barroso says .
it 's important that we have successes and we do have successes , and we need to talk about them .
above all , we need to make it clear to people that the glass is half full , not half empty .
and if we approach european policy with optimism and hope and confidence , then i think we will be able to get europe moving forwards again and the people of europe moving forward with us . alexander kudascheff interviewed hans-gert pöttering -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de drumming up support for the eu constitution german chancellor angela merkel has much on her agenda as she kicks off the eu presidency .

a 10-square-meter apartment in the french capital costs about 500 euros .
" i have been trying for 10 years to get a subsidized apartment but they keep telling me there are n't any available , " sadek said .
it is people like sadek - an estimated 100,000 of them in france - that an organization called the children of don quixote is fighting for .
it was this group which took over the abandoned office building in a ritzy part of paris to provide housing for people such as sadek and has been calling on the government to help them .

politicians jumping on the wagon this week , the french government announced plans to create a " legal right " to housing in response to a snowballing campaign that has seen a tent city for the homeless spring up in the heart of paris .
bildunterschrift : tent cities have sprung up all over france prime minister dominique de villepin said a bill would be presented to the cabinet on january 17 and hopefully adopted before parliament breaks up ahead of april 's presidential election .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests and tent cities have garnered much attention " that is the time necessary to ensure that all the people concerned can be provided with decent lodgings , whether in a transitional shelter or an individual home , " he said .

from that point onwards , " every person or family housed in unworthy or unsanitary conditions " will able to take legal action to have their rights enforced , he said .
villepin said the law would " make france one of the most advanced countries in terms of social rights . "
housing would become the third legally enforceable right in france , along with access to education and healthcare .
four months ahead of presidential elections , with the homeless issue thrust centre-stage , the housing measure was seen as a bid by the centre-right to underscore its commitment to social justice .
the children of don quixote the protest wave started last month when a small group of campaigners - called the children of don quixote - pitched a 200-strong tent camp along a trendy paris canal , housing homeless people as well as well-heeled citizens prepared to sleep rough for a few days out of solidarity .

"
this is where hafida sadek lives with her two children .
as a maid , she earns 680 euros per month .
that is n't much in paris .
a 10-square-meter apartment in the french capital costs about 500 euros .
" i have been trying for 10 years to get a subsidized apartment but they keep telling me there are n't any available , " sadek said .
it is people like sadek - an estimated 100,000 of them in france - that an organization called the children of don quixote is fighting for .
it was this group which took over the abandoned office building in a ritzy part of paris to provide housing for people such as sadek and has been calling on the government to help them .
and it seems that these days , the french government is listening .
politicians jumping on the wagon this week , the french government announced plans to create a " legal right " to housing in response to a snowballing campaign that has seen a tent city for the homeless spring up in the heart of paris .
bildunterschrift : tent cities have sprung up all over france prime minister dominique de villepin said a bill would be presented to the cabinet on january 17 and hopefully adopted before parliament breaks up ahead of april 's presidential election .
the law , if passed , would make france the second european country to guarantee the right to housing , after scotland which adopted similar measures with its 2003 homeless act .
president jacques chirac used his new year 's address to promise swift government action on a " right to housing " - a key demand of the protestors .
legally enforceable villepin said the government wanted the right to become legally enforceable by 2008 for " people in the most difficult situations : the homeless , but also the working poor and single women with children . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests and tent cities have garnered much attention " that is the time necessary to ensure that all the people concerned can be provided with decent lodgings , whether in a transitional shelter or an individual home , " he said .
by 2012 , the government wants the right to housing to be legally enforceable for all , with a guarantee provided by the state , or in some cases regional or local authorities .
from that point onwards , " every person or family housed in unworthy or unsanitary conditions " will able to take legal action to have their rights enforced , he said .
villepin said the law would " make france one of the most advanced countries in terms of social rights . "
housing would become the third legally enforceable right in france , along with access to education and healthcare .
four months ahead of presidential elections , with the homeless issue thrust centre-stage , the housing measure was seen as a bid by the centre-right to underscore its commitment to social justice .
the children of don quixote the protest wave started last month when a small group of campaigners - called the children of don quixote - pitched a 200-strong tent camp along a trendy paris canal , housing homeless people as well as well-heeled citizens prepared to sleep rough for a few days out of solidarity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebritites have come out to support the homeless makeshift camps have since sprung up all over france , including in the mediterranean port of marseille , the historic town of orleans , and the southern cities of lyon and toulouse .
on tuesday a group of eight struggling families , backed by campaigners , moved into a vacant office block near the paris stock exchange , a giant squat that has been dubbed a " ministry " for the homeless and ill-housed .
politicians of all stripes - including presidential frontrunners nicolas sarkozy on the right and segolene royal on the left - had responded on cue , lining up with pledges to tackle the plight of the homeless .
emergency plan according to the charity emmaus , one million people in france do not have a home of their own : 100,000 sleep rough , while the rest live in campsites , hotels or shelters .
another two million people have housing " problems . "
the " right to housing " measures comes in addition to a 70-million-euro -lrb- $ 90 million -rrb- emergency plan for the homeless announced last month .

what can we expect ? hans-gert pöttering : i would like the german presidency to come up with a way of moving forward .
and i would like a decision on what mandate any conference on the european constitution would have - if such a conference takes place - in an attempt to realize the main goal of the constitution . when it comes down to the substance , though , the main thing will be to come up with some kind of timetable for a european constitution .
is that the least we can expect from the germans in the next six months ? we certainly expect that - but that is n't all that we expect .
i hope that the german presidency will be more ambitious than that - and i 'm sure it will be .
i hope there will be a discussion about how far we want to see the enlargement of the eu to go .
do we want to take in every country that wants to join the union - or do we want to say that there have to be limits , geographical limits as well ? are there geographical limits ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much further can the eu expand ?
in terms of the steps we take , there certainly are .
we first need to strengthen the structures of the european union - and that 's why we need to see the substance of the proposed constitution enacted .
if we do n't have that , then - with the possible exception of croatia , we can pretty much forget any further enlargement .
then we have to look at what 's going to happen with ukraine , and the balkan nations , what 's going to happen with the countries in the caucasus , and the countries in northern africa .
these are all neighboring countries , and there are lots of things that connect us to them - but also things that do n't connect .
and we need stable partnerships , we need policies for our neighbors , and i hope the debate on that will grow in intensity during the german presidency . the balkan nations have already been given a per spective on their eu aspirations - and one day they will probably join .
then the eu will comprise 33 or 34 nations .
independent of the debate on the constitution : would that already represent a critical mass , when the eu is no longer what it was , but effectively an organization for security and co-o per ation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- with a few differences in its substance ? yes , it ca n't just become another osce - it ca n't just be a loose union .
what we want is a strong europe that can act .
nonetheless , we should be happy that europe is as it is today .
to put it personally : i have been a member of the european parliament since 1979 , since the first direct elections .
and if someone had said back then that on may 1 , 2004 , we would see estonia , latvia , lithuania , poland , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary and slovenia joining the eu , then i would have said that 's wonderful , that 's visionary .
and this vision has become reality in our lifetimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrating eu membership in romania the people in those countries have chosen our values .
communism has vanished , fallen apart , and that is a wonderful development .
the european status quo of the 1950s , 60s , 70s and 80s , the division of the continent , the berlin wall , a divided germany - all of that is gone .
so we can be very happy with the way things have developed , and now , of course , we have to try to structure things in a way that makes sense , in a way that europe 's citizens can understand it .
and that is the main task we are facing . and that 's one of the tasks the constitution sought to address .
but it was rejected by voters in france and the netherlands , and there are other countries where it 's far from clear that it would be passed in a referendum - probably not in britain , for example .
what has to be salvaged from this constitution to make europe capable of action ? we certainly have to keep the core of the constitution .
and that includes majority voting in the council of ministers .
this european union can no longer be led if huge swathes of european legislation require a unanimous vote .
we have majority voting in the european parliament - and it has to be that way in the council of ministers too .
i would also argue strongly that the second part of the constitution , which deals with values , human dignity , democracy , the principle of law , the principle of solidarity , human rights - this part must be transferred into european law .
without values , this eu has no future .
that is why these values are so important . herr pöttering , you will most likely be elected as the next president of the european parliament in mid-january .
if you are elected , what are your goals for the next two and a half years ? bildunterschrift : the european parliament in strasbourg i would like to use that position - and i would need the support of the whole parliament , of course - to try to bring the eu and the european parliament closer to the people .
and i would like to make our relationship to the islamic world a high priority .
those are the things i think i would focus on . you said yourself that the last 50 years in europe have been a great success story .
and yet the eu is suffering a bit of a depression .
what would your answer be to this sense of melancholy ? i do n't know if the eu is suffering from depression .
sometimes the situation is very paradoxical .
in the polish capital , warsaw , we have a government that could certainly be more committed to europe than it is and yet opinion polls show that 80 percent of the people in poland support the european constitution .
so the situation is very varied . of course there is skepticism .
that has always been the case .
and that 's why it 's important that we press ahead with european projects , as commission president jose manuel barroso says .
it 's important that we have successes and we do have successes , and we need to talk about them .
above all , we need to make it clear to people that the glass is half full , not half empty .
and if we approach european policy with optimism and hope and confidence , then i think we will be able to get europe moving forwards again and the people of europe moving forward with us . alexander kudascheff interviewed hans-gert pöttering -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de drumming up support for the eu constitution german chancellor angela merkel has much on her agenda as she kicks off the eu presidency .

the country also saw a surge of new passenger car registrations - mainly a result of buyers rushing to beat a tax hike . new car sales in germany reached their highest level in seven years in 2006 , the german automotive industry association -lrb- vda -rrb- said this week . a total of 3.47 million vehicles were sold in the 12 months ending in december , vda said .

villepin said the law would " make france one of the most advanced countries in terms of social rights . "
housing would become the third legally enforceable right in france , along with access to education and healthcare .
four months ahead of presidential elections , with the homeless issue thrust centre-stage , the housing measure was seen as a bid by the centre-right to underscore its commitment to social justice .
the children of don quixote the protest wave started last month when a small group of campaigners - called the children of don quixote - pitched a 200-strong tent camp along a trendy paris canal , housing homeless people as well as well-heeled citizens prepared to sleep rough for a few days out of solidarity .

a 10-square-meter apartment in the french capital costs about 500 euros .
" i have been trying for 10 years to get a subsidized apartment but they keep telling me there are n't any available , " sadek said .
it is people like sadek - an estimated 100,000 of them in france - that an organization called the children of don quixote is fighting for .
it was this group which took over the abandoned office building in a ritzy part of paris to provide housing for people such as sadek and has been calling on the government to help them .
and it seems that these days , the french government is listening .
politicians jumping on the wagon this week , the french government announced plans to create a " legal right " to housing in response to a snowballing campaign that has seen a tent city for the homeless spring up in the heart of paris .
bildunterschrift : tent cities have sprung up all over france prime minister dominique de villepin said a bill would be presented to the cabinet on january 17 and hopefully adopted before parliament breaks up ahead of april 's presidential election .
the law , if passed , would make france the second european country to guarantee the right to housing , after scotland which adopted similar measures with its 2003 homeless act .
president jacques chirac used his new year 's address to promise swift government action on a " right to housing " - a key demand of the protestors .
legally enforceable villepin said the government wanted the right to become legally enforceable by 2008 for " people in the most difficult situations : the homeless , but also the working poor and single women with children . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests and tent cities have garnered much attention " that is the time necessary to ensure that all the people concerned can be provided with decent lodgings , whether in a transitional shelter or an individual home , " he said .
by 2012 , the government wants the right to housing to be legally enforceable for all , with a guarantee provided by the state , or in some cases regional or local authorities .
from that point onwards , " every person or family housed in unworthy or unsanitary conditions " will able to take legal action to have their rights enforced , he said .
villepin said the law would " make france one of the most advanced countries in terms of social rights . "
housing would become the third legally enforceable right in france , along with access to education and healthcare .
four months ahead of presidential elections , with the homeless issue thrust centre-stage , the housing measure was seen as a bid by the centre-right to underscore its commitment to social justice .
the children of don quixote the protest wave started last month when a small group of campaigners - called the children of don quixote - pitched a 200-strong tent camp along a trendy paris canal , housing homeless people as well as well-heeled citizens prepared to sleep rough for a few days out of solidarity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebritites have come out to support the homeless makeshift camps have since sprung up all over france , including in the mediterranean port of marseille , the historic town of orleans , and the southern cities of lyon and toulouse .
on tuesday a group of eight struggling families , backed by campaigners , moved into a vacant office block near the paris stock exchange , a giant squat that has been dubbed a " ministry " for the homeless and ill-housed .
politicians of all stripes - including presidential frontrunners nicolas sarkozy on the right and segolene royal on the left - had responded on cue , lining up with pledges to tackle the plight of the homeless .

what can we expect ? hans-gert pöttering : i would like the german presidency to come up with a way of moving forward .
and i would like a decision on what mandate any conference on the european constitution would have - if such a conference takes place - in an attempt to realize the main goal of the constitution . when it comes down to the substance , though , the main thing will be to come up with some kind of timetable for a european constitution .
is that the least we can expect from the germans in the next six months ? we certainly expect that - but that is n't all that we expect .
i hope that the german presidency will be more ambitious than that - and i 'm sure it will be .
i hope there will be a discussion about how far we want to see the enlargement of the eu to go .
do we want to take in every country that wants to join the union - or do we want to say that there have to be limits , geographical limits as well ? are there geographical limits ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much further can the eu expand ?
in terms of the steps we take , there certainly are .
we first need to strengthen the structures of the european union - and that 's why we need to see the substance of the proposed constitution enacted .
if we do n't have that , then - with the possible exception of croatia , we can pretty much forget any further enlargement .
then we have to look at what 's going to happen with ukraine , and the balkan nations , what 's going to happen with the countries in the caucasus , and the countries in northern africa .
these are all neighboring countries , and there are lots of things that connect us to them - but also things that do n't connect .
and we need stable partnerships , we need policies for our neighbors , and i hope the debate on that will grow in intensity during the german presidency . the balkan nations have already been given a per spective on their eu aspirations - and one day they will probably join .
then the eu will comprise 33 or 34 nations .
independent of the debate on the constitution : would that already represent a critical mass , when the eu is no longer what it was , but effectively an organization for security and co-o per ation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- with a few differences in its substance ? yes , it ca n't just become another osce - it ca n't just be a loose union .
what we want is a strong europe that can act .
nonetheless , we should be happy that europe is as it is today .
to put it personally : i have been a member of the european parliament since 1979 , since the first direct elections .
and if someone had said back then that on may 1 , 2004 , we would see estonia , latvia , lithuania , poland , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary and slovenia joining the eu , then i would have said that 's wonderful , that 's visionary .
and this vision has become reality in our lifetimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrating eu membership in romania the people in those countries have chosen our values .
communism has vanished , fallen apart , and that is a wonderful development .
the european status quo of the 1950s , 60s , 70s and 80s , the division of the continent , the berlin wall , a divided germany - all of that is gone .
so we can be very happy with the way things have developed , and now , of course , we have to try to structure things in a way that makes sense , in a way that europe 's citizens can understand it .
and that is the main task we are facing . and that 's one of the tasks the constitution sought to address .
but it was rejected by voters in france and the netherlands , and there are other countries where it 's far from clear that it would be passed in a referendum - probably not in britain , for example .
what has to be salvaged from this constitution to make europe capable of action ? we certainly have to keep the core of the constitution .
and that includes majority voting in the council of ministers .
this european union can no longer be led if huge swathes of european legislation require a unanimous vote .
we have majority voting in the european parliament - and it has to be that way in the council of ministers too .
i would also argue strongly that the second part of the constitution , which deals with values , human dignity , democracy , the principle of law , the principle of solidarity , human rights - this part must be transferred into european law .
without values , this eu has no future .
that is why these values are so important . herr pöttering , you will most likely be elected as the next president of the european parliament in mid-january .
if you are elected , what are your goals for the next two and a half years ? bildunterschrift : the european parliament in strasbourg i would like to use that position - and i would need the support of the whole parliament , of course - to try to bring the eu and the european parliament closer to the people .
and i would like to make our relationship to the islamic world a high priority .
those are the things i think i would focus on . you said yourself that the last 50 years in europe have been a great success story .
and yet the eu is suffering a bit of a depression .
what would your answer be to this sense of melancholy ? i do n't know if the eu is suffering from depression .
sometimes the situation is very paradoxical .
in the polish capital , warsaw , we have a government that could certainly be more committed to europe than it is and yet opinion polls show that 80 percent of the people in poland support the european constitution .
so the situation is very varied . of course there is skepticism .
that has always been the case .
and that 's why it 's important that we press ahead with european projects , as commission president jose manuel barroso says .
it 's important that we have successes and we do have successes , and we need to talk about them .
above all , we need to make it clear to people that the glass is half full , not half empty .
and if we approach european policy with optimism and hope and confidence , then i think we will be able to get europe moving forwards again and the people of europe moving forward with us . alexander kudascheff interviewed hans-gert pöttering -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de drumming up support for the eu constitution german chancellor angela merkel has much on her agenda as she kicks off the eu presidency .

what can we expect ? hans-gert pöttering : i would like the german presidency to come up with a way of moving forward .
and i would like a decision on what mandate any conference on the european constitution would have - if such a conference takes place - in an attempt to realize the main goal of the constitution . when it comes down to the substance , though , the main thing will be to come up with some kind of timetable for a european constitution .
is that the least we can expect from the germans in the next six months ? we certainly expect that - but that is n't all that we expect .
i hope that the german presidency will be more ambitious than that - and i 'm sure it will be .
i hope there will be a discussion about how far we want to see the enlargement of the eu to go .
do we want to take in every country that wants to join the union - or do we want to say that there have to be limits , geographical limits as well ? are there geographical limits ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much further can the eu expand ?
in terms of the steps we take , there certainly are .
we first need to strengthen the structures of the european union - and that 's why we need to see the substance of the proposed constitution enacted .
if we do n't have that , then - with the possible exception of croatia , we can pretty much forget any further enlargement .
then we have to look at what 's going to happen with ukraine , and the balkan nations , what 's going to happen with the countries in the caucasus , and the countries in northern africa .
these are all neighboring countries , and there are lots of things that connect us to them - but also things that do n't connect .
and we need stable partnerships , we need policies for our neighbors , and i hope the debate on that will grow in intensity during the german presidency . the balkan nations have already been given a per spective on their eu aspirations - and one day they will probably join .
then the eu will comprise 33 or 34 nations .
independent of the debate on the constitution : would that already represent a critical mass , when the eu is no longer what it was , but effectively an organization for security and co-o per ation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- with a few differences in its substance ? yes , it ca n't just become another osce - it ca n't just be a loose union .
what we want is a strong europe that can act .
nonetheless , we should be happy that europe is as it is today .
to put it personally : i have been a member of the european parliament since 1979 , since the first direct elections .
and if someone had said back then that on may 1 , 2004 , we would see estonia , latvia , lithuania , poland , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary and slovenia joining the eu , then i would have said that 's wonderful , that 's visionary .
and this vision has become reality in our lifetimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrating eu membership in romania the people in those countries have chosen our values .
communism has vanished , fallen apart , and that is a wonderful development .
the european status quo of the 1950s , 60s , 70s and 80s , the division of the continent , the berlin wall , a divided germany - all of that is gone .
so we can be very happy with the way things have developed , and now , of course , we have to try to structure things in a way that makes sense , in a way that europe 's citizens can understand it .
and that is the main task we are facing . and that 's one of the tasks the constitution sought to address .
but it was rejected by voters in france and the netherlands , and there are other countries where it 's far from clear that it would be passed in a referendum - probably not in britain , for example .
what has to be salvaged from this constitution to make europe capable of action ? we certainly have to keep the core of the constitution .
and that includes majority voting in the council of ministers .
this european union can no longer be led if huge swathes of european legislation require a unanimous vote .
we have majority voting in the european parliament - and it has to be that way in the council of ministers too .
i would also argue strongly that the second part of the constitution , which deals with values , human dignity , democracy , the principle of law , the principle of solidarity , human rights - this part must be transferred into european law .
without values , this eu has no future .
that is why these values are so important . herr pöttering , you will most likely be elected as the next president of the european parliament in mid-january .
if you are elected , what are your goals for the next two and a half years ? bildunterschrift : the european parliament in strasbourg i would like to use that position - and i would need the support of the whole parliament , of course - to try to bring the eu and the european parliament closer to the people .
and i would like to make our relationship to the islamic world a high priority .
those are the things i think i would focus on . you said yourself that the last 50 years in europe have been a great success story .
and yet the eu is suffering a bit of a depression .
what would your answer be to this sense of melancholy ? i do n't know if the eu is suffering from depression .
sometimes the situation is very paradoxical .
in the polish capital , warsaw , we have a government that could certainly be more committed to europe than it is and yet opinion polls show that 80 percent of the people in poland support the european constitution .
so the situation is very varied . of course there is skepticism .
that has always been the case .
and that 's why it 's important that we press ahead with european projects , as commission president jose manuel barroso says .
it 's important that we have successes and we do have successes , and we need to talk about them .
above all , we need to make it clear to people that the glass is half full , not half empty .
and if we approach european policy with optimism and hope and confidence , then i think we will be able to get europe moving forwards again and the people of europe moving forward with us . alexander kudascheff interviewed hans-gert pöttering -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de drumming up support for the eu constitution german chancellor angela merkel has much on her agenda as she kicks off the eu presidency .

is that the least we can expect from the germans in the next six months ? we certainly expect that - but that is n't all that we expect .
i hope that the german presidency will be more ambitious than that - and i 'm sure it will be .
i hope there will be a discussion about how far we want to see the enlargement of the eu to go .
do we want to take in every country that wants to join the union - or do we want to say that there have to be limits , geographical limits as well ? are there geographical limits ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much further can the eu expand ?
in terms of the steps we take , there certainly are .
we first need to strengthen the structures of the european union - and that 's why we need to see the substance of the proposed constitution enacted .
if we do n't have that , then - with the possible exception of croatia , we can pretty much forget any further enlargement .
then we have to look at what 's going to happen with ukraine , and the balkan nations , what 's going to happen with the countries in the caucasus , and the countries in northern africa .
these are all neighboring countries , and there are lots of things that connect us to them - but also things that do n't connect .
and we need stable partnerships , we need policies for our neighbors , and i hope the debate on that will grow in intensity during the german presidency . the balkan nations have already been given a per spective on their eu aspirations - and one day they will probably join .
then the eu will comprise 33 or 34 nations .
independent of the debate on the constitution : would that already represent a critical mass , when the eu is no longer what it was , but effectively an organization for security and co-o per ation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- with a few differences in its substance ? yes , it ca n't just become another osce - it ca n't just be a loose union .
what we want is a strong europe that can act .
nonetheless , we should be happy that europe is as it is today .
to put it personally : i have been a member of the european parliament since 1979 , since the first direct elections .
and if someone had said back then that on may 1 , 2004 , we would see estonia , latvia , lithuania , poland , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary and slovenia joining the eu , then i would have said that 's wonderful , that 's visionary .
and this vision has become reality in our lifetimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrating eu membership in romania the people in those countries have chosen our values .
communism has vanished , fallen apart , and that is a wonderful development .
the european status quo of the 1950s , 60s , 70s and 80s , the division of the continent , the berlin wall , a divided germany - all of that is gone .
so we can be very happy with the way things have developed , and now , of course , we have to try to structure things in a way that makes sense , in a way that europe 's citizens can understand it .
and that is the main task we are facing . and that 's one of the tasks the constitution sought to address .
but it was rejected by voters in france and the netherlands , and there are other countries where it 's far from clear that it would be passed in a referendum - probably not in britain , for example .
what has to be salvaged from this constitution to make europe capable of action ? we certainly have to keep the core of the constitution .
and that includes majority voting in the council of ministers .
this european union can no longer be led if huge swathes of european legislation require a unanimous vote .
we have majority voting in the european parliament - and it has to be that way in the council of ministers too .
i would also argue strongly that the second part of the constitution , which deals with values , human dignity , democracy , the principle of law , the principle of solidarity , human rights - this part must be transferred into european law .
without values , this eu has no future .
that is why these values are so important . herr pöttering , you will most likely be elected as the next president of the european parliament in mid-january .
if you are elected , what are your goals for the next two and a half years ? bildunterschrift : the european parliament in strasbourg i would like to use that position - and i would need the support of the whole parliament , of course - to try to bring the eu and the european parliament closer to the people .
and i would like to make our relationship to the islamic world a high priority .
those are the things i think i would focus on . you said yourself that the last 50 years in europe have been a great success story .
and yet the eu is suffering a bit of a depression .
what would your answer be to this sense of melancholy ? i do n't know if the eu is suffering from depression .
sometimes the situation is very paradoxical .
in the polish capital , warsaw , we have a government that could certainly be more committed to europe than it is and yet opinion polls show that 80 percent of the people in poland support the european constitution .
so the situation is very varied . of course there is skepticism .
that has always been the case .
and that 's why it 's important that we press ahead with european projects , as commission president jose manuel barroso says .
it 's important that we have successes and we do have successes , and we need to talk about them .
above all , we need to make it clear to people that the glass is half full , not half empty .
and if we approach european policy with optimism and hope and confidence , then i think we will be able to get europe moving forwards again and the people of europe moving forward with us . alexander kudascheff interviewed hans-gert pöttering -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de drumming up support for the eu constitution german chancellor angela merkel has much on her agenda as she kicks off the eu presidency .

mandelson himself will hold talks with us trade representative susan schwab in washington on the same day . " monday 's meeting is the opportunity for the eu and the us to invigorate the multilateral doha trade talks , " mandelson said in a statement .
" i hope both sides will signal strong new political commitment to rapid progress .
we have now entered a narrow window of opportunity lasting until easter during which success for the world trade talks is possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson at a wto conference in hong kong in 2005 " the quiet , constructive bilateral contacts of the last few months have made clear to us all the possible outline of a final deal , " he added .
" we now need the added momentum of political leadership from the highest level .
europe and the us have a shared responsibility to make this happen . " eu officials hope to see a change in political willingness to end the impasse with the passage of control in the us congress to the democrats . " it 's undeniable there was protectionist rhetoric around the elections in november but i think we have to look beyond that , " mandelson 's spokesman peter power said on friday . talks suspended in july the world trade organization suspended the so-called doha round in july after negotiators from six major players , including the us , eu , brazil and india , failed to hammer out a framework of an accord after five years of talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wto director-general french pascal lamy has been trying to bridge the gap the doha round , launched in the qatari capital in november 2001 , is mired in an impasse as western and developing countries remain split on issues such as agriculture subsidies and market access . developing countries are demanding lower tariffs on their agricultural exports to us and european markets while industrialized nations seek greater access to developing and emerging countries for their industrial goods and services . eu concessions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who will give in ?
mandelson 's office stressed that europe remains willing to improve its farm tariff offer by adding substantially to the 39 percent cuts it offered a year ago .
europe is ready to add more than 10 percentage points " and get within close reach of the average farm tariff cut demanded by developing countries , " which is 51.5 percent , the statement said . " we are ready to do this in a way that demonstrably gives new market access to the united states and other agricultural exporters in all products , " it added . the eu is asking washington to make for real cuts in its farm subsidies , also to levels close to those requested by developing countries .
this would mean a budget cut of around $ 8 billion dollars -lrb- six billion euros -rrb- from current ceilings of $ 23 billion to around $ 15 billion . big agenda apart from mandelson and barroso , the eu 's external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner will also take part in the visit to washington .
trade and economic ties aside , the talks are also expected to focus on energy security , climate change and the middle east .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 06.01.2007 german automobile market ends 2006 with a bang großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers snapped up new cars in 2006 the german car industry zoomed to record levels of exports and production last year .
the country also saw a surge of new passenger car registrations - mainly a result of buyers rushing to beat a tax hike . new car sales in germany reached their highest level in seven years in 2006 , the german automotive industry association -lrb- vda -rrb- said this week . a total of 3.47 million vehicles were sold in the 12 months ending in december , vda said .
the four percent increase from the previous year 's total was primarily a result of a surge in new car registrations in the last two months of 2006 . " those were two fabulous months , but the results are exceptions to the automakers ' normal sales levels , " said vda president bernd gottschalk . new models , incentives and improved consumer confidence , especially among private customers , contributed to the development , vda said .
but there was also a rush to buy ahead of the country 's value-added or sales tax -lrb- vat -rrb- increase .
germany raised this tax by three percent to 19 percent as of january 1 , 2007 . " business was booming at the end of the year ; the warehouses were emptied , " gottschalk said .
" now we have to hope that we do n't get off to a rocky start in the new year . " industry hopes positive trend will continue for 2007 , the market environment at the start of the year would be strained , especially by a reduced tax break for commuters and an additional hike in fuel prices , vda said .

the country also saw a surge of new passenger car registrations - mainly a result of buyers rushing to beat a tax hike . new car sales in germany reached their highest level in seven years in 2006 , the german automotive industry association -lrb- vda -rrb- said this week . a total of 3.47 million vehicles were sold in the 12 months ending in december , vda said .
the four percent increase from the previous year 's total was primarily a result of a surge in new car registrations in the last two months of 2006 . " those were two fabulous months , but the results are exceptions to the automakers ' normal sales levels , " said vda president bernd gottschalk . new models , incentives and improved consumer confidence , especially among private customers , contributed to the development , vda said .
but there was also a rush to buy ahead of the country 's value-added or sales tax -lrb- vat -rrb- increase .
germany raised this tax by three percent to 19 percent as of january 1 , 2007 . " business was booming at the end of the year ; the warehouses were emptied , " gottschalk said .
" now we have to hope that we do n't get off to a rocky start in the new year . " industry hopes positive trend will continue for 2007 , the market environment at the start of the year would be strained , especially by a reduced tax break for commuters and an additional hike in fuel prices , vda said .
the higher sales tax and insurance tax would also play a role . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vw bug has been one of the most famous german cars in history " now , everything depends on whether or not we 've cleared the hurdle and can look forward to strong economic growth and improved consumer confidence , " gottschalk said .

"
this is where hafida sadek lives with her two children .
as a maid , she earns 680 euros per month .
that is n't much in paris .
a 10-square-meter apartment in the french capital costs about 500 euros .
" i have been trying for 10 years to get a subsidized apartment but they keep telling me there are n't any available , " sadek said .
it is people like sadek - an estimated 100,000 of them in france - that an organization called the children of don quixote is fighting for .
it was this group which took over the abandoned office building in a ritzy part of paris to provide housing for people such as sadek and has been calling on the government to help them .
and it seems that these days , the french government is listening .
politicians jumping on the wagon this week , the french government announced plans to create a " legal right " to housing in response to a snowballing campaign that has seen a tent city for the homeless spring up in the heart of paris .
bildunterschrift : tent cities have sprung up all over france prime minister dominique de villepin said a bill would be presented to the cabinet on january 17 and hopefully adopted before parliament breaks up ahead of april 's presidential election .
the law , if passed , would make france the second european country to guarantee the right to housing , after scotland which adopted similar measures with its 2003 homeless act .
president jacques chirac used his new year 's address to promise swift government action on a " right to housing " - a key demand of the protestors .
legally enforceable villepin said the government wanted the right to become legally enforceable by 2008 for " people in the most difficult situations : the homeless , but also the working poor and single women with children . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests and tent cities have garnered much attention " that is the time necessary to ensure that all the people concerned can be provided with decent lodgings , whether in a transitional shelter or an individual home , " he said .
by 2012 , the government wants the right to housing to be legally enforceable for all , with a guarantee provided by the state , or in some cases regional or local authorities .
from that point onwards , " every person or family housed in unworthy or unsanitary conditions " will able to take legal action to have their rights enforced , he said .
villepin said the law would " make france one of the most advanced countries in terms of social rights . "
housing would become the third legally enforceable right in france , along with access to education and healthcare .

the " right to housing " measures comes in addition to a 70-million-euro -lrb- $ 90 million -rrb- emergency plan for the homeless announced last month .
but a spokesman for segolene royal , the socialist presidential frontrunner , warned the government against making " great announcements , " saying what was needed was a massive commitment to build more public housing . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's homeless must leap hurdles to get help germany is a wealthy country with a cushy social welfare system , but drugs , red tape and a lack of motivation keep some people on the streets .

a 10-square-meter apartment in the french capital costs about 500 euros .
" i have been trying for 10 years to get a subsidized apartment but they keep telling me there are n't any available , " sadek said .
it is people like sadek - an estimated 100,000 of them in france - that an organization called the children of don quixote is fighting for .
it was this group which took over the abandoned office building in a ritzy part of paris to provide housing for people such as sadek and has been calling on the government to help them .
and it seems that these days , the french government is listening .
politicians jumping on the wagon this week , the french government announced plans to create a " legal right " to housing in response to a snowballing campaign that has seen a tent city for the homeless spring up in the heart of paris .
bildunterschrift : tent cities have sprung up all over france prime minister dominique de villepin said a bill would be presented to the cabinet on january 17 and hopefully adopted before parliament breaks up ahead of april 's presidential election .
the law , if passed , would make france the second european country to guarantee the right to housing , after scotland which adopted similar measures with its 2003 homeless act .
president jacques chirac used his new year 's address to promise swift government action on a " right to housing " - a key demand of the protestors .
legally enforceable villepin said the government wanted the right to become legally enforceable by 2008 for " people in the most difficult situations : the homeless , but also the working poor and single women with children . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests and tent cities have garnered much attention " that is the time necessary to ensure that all the people concerned can be provided with decent lodgings , whether in a transitional shelter or an individual home , " he said .
by 2012 , the government wants the right to housing to be legally enforceable for all , with a guarantee provided by the state , or in some cases regional or local authorities .
from that point onwards , " every person or family housed in unworthy or unsanitary conditions " will able to take legal action to have their rights enforced , he said .
villepin said the law would " make france one of the most advanced countries in terms of social rights . "
housing would become the third legally enforceable right in france , along with access to education and healthcare .
four months ahead of presidential elections , with the homeless issue thrust centre-stage , the housing measure was seen as a bid by the centre-right to underscore its commitment to social justice .
the children of don quixote the protest wave started last month when a small group of campaigners - called the children of don quixote - pitched a 200-strong tent camp along a trendy paris canal , housing homeless people as well as well-heeled citizens prepared to sleep rough for a few days out of solidarity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebritites have come out to support the homeless makeshift camps have since sprung up all over france , including in the mediterranean port of marseille , the historic town of orleans , and the southern cities of lyon and toulouse .
on tuesday a group of eight struggling families , backed by campaigners , moved into a vacant office block near the paris stock exchange , a giant squat that has been dubbed a " ministry " for the homeless and ill-housed .
politicians of all stripes - including presidential frontrunners nicolas sarkozy on the right and segolene royal on the left - had responded on cue , lining up with pledges to tackle the plight of the homeless .
emergency plan according to the charity emmaus , one million people in france do not have a home of their own : 100,000 sleep rough , while the rest live in campsites , hotels or shelters .
another two million people have housing " problems . "
the " right to housing " measures comes in addition to a 70-million-euro -lrb- $ 90 million -rrb- emergency plan for the homeless announced last month .
but a spokesman for segolene royal , the socialist presidential frontrunner , warned the government against making " great announcements , " saying what was needed was a massive commitment to build more public housing . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's homeless must leap hurdles to get help germany is a wealthy country with a cushy social welfare system , but drugs , red tape and a lack of motivation keep some people on the streets .

it was this group which took over the abandoned office building in a ritzy part of paris to provide housing for people such as sadek and has been calling on the government to help them .
and it seems that these days , the french government is listening .
politicians jumping on the wagon this week , the french government announced plans to create a " legal right " to housing in response to a snowballing campaign that has seen a tent city for the homeless spring up in the heart of paris .
bildunterschrift : tent cities have sprung up all over france prime minister dominique de villepin said a bill would be presented to the cabinet on january 17 and hopefully adopted before parliament breaks up ahead of april 's presidential election .
the law , if passed , would make france the second european country to guarantee the right to housing , after scotland which adopted similar measures with its 2003 homeless act .
president jacques chirac used his new year 's address to promise swift government action on a " right to housing " - a key demand of the protestors .
legally enforceable villepin said the government wanted the right to become legally enforceable by 2008 for " people in the most difficult situations : the homeless , but also the working poor and single women with children . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests and tent cities have garnered much attention " that is the time necessary to ensure that all the people concerned can be provided with decent lodgings , whether in a transitional shelter or an individual home , " he said .
by 2012 , the government wants the right to housing to be legally enforceable for all , with a guarantee provided by the state , or in some cases regional or local authorities .
from that point onwards , " every person or family housed in unworthy or unsanitary conditions " will able to take legal action to have their rights enforced , he said .
villepin said the law would " make france one of the most advanced countries in terms of social rights . "
housing would become the third legally enforceable right in france , along with access to education and healthcare .
four months ahead of presidential elections , with the homeless issue thrust centre-stage , the housing measure was seen as a bid by the centre-right to underscore its commitment to social justice .
the children of don quixote the protest wave started last month when a small group of campaigners - called the children of don quixote - pitched a 200-strong tent camp along a trendy paris canal , housing homeless people as well as well-heeled citizens prepared to sleep rough for a few days out of solidarity .

politicians of all stripes - including presidential frontrunners nicolas sarkozy on the right and segolene royal on the left - had responded on cue , lining up with pledges to tackle the plight of the homeless .
emergency plan according to the charity emmaus , one million people in france do not have a home of their own : 100,000 sleep rough , while the rest live in campsites , hotels or shelters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the german eu presidency a dummy 's guide to the eu german fm : kosovo biggest problem right now commission proposes eu-wide green card for migrants germany determined to strengthen european police agency european union -pipe- 06.01.2007 " without values , this eu has no future " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pöttering has been a european parliamentarian since 1979 dw-tv talked to hans-gert pöttering , the likely new president of the european parliament , about the german eu presidency , the chances for an eu constitution and his plans as leader of the bloc 's legislative . dw-tv : germany has taken on the eu 's rotating presidency and with it the running of the bloc 's business for the next six months .
what can we expect ? hans-gert pöttering : i would like the german presidency to come up with a way of moving forward .
and i would like a decision on what mandate any conference on the european constitution would have - if such a conference takes place - in an attempt to realize the main goal of the constitution . when it comes down to the substance , though , the main thing will be to come up with some kind of timetable for a european constitution .
is that the least we can expect from the germans in the next six months ? we certainly expect that - but that is n't all that we expect .
i hope that the german presidency will be more ambitious than that - and i 'm sure it will be .
i hope there will be a discussion about how far we want to see the enlargement of the eu to go .
do we want to take in every country that wants to join the union - or do we want to say that there have to be limits , geographical limits as well ? are there geographical limits ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much further can the eu expand ?
in terms of the steps we take , there certainly are .
we first need to strengthen the structures of the european union - and that 's why we need to see the substance of the proposed constitution enacted .
if we do n't have that , then - with the possible exception of croatia , we can pretty much forget any further enlargement .
then we have to look at what 's going to happen with ukraine , and the balkan nations , what 's going to happen with the countries in the caucasus , and the countries in northern africa .
these are all neighboring countries , and there are lots of things that connect us to them - but also things that do n't connect .
and we need stable partnerships , we need policies for our neighbors , and i hope the debate on that will grow in intensity during the german presidency . the balkan nations have already been given a per spective on their eu aspirations - and one day they will probably join .
then the eu will comprise 33 or 34 nations .
independent of the debate on the constitution : would that already represent a critical mass , when the eu is no longer what it was , but effectively an organization for security and co-o per ation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- with a few differences in its substance ? yes , it ca n't just become another osce - it ca n't just be a loose union .
what we want is a strong europe that can act .
nonetheless , we should be happy that europe is as it is today .
to put it personally : i have been a member of the european parliament since 1979 , since the first direct elections .
and if someone had said back then that on may 1 , 2004 , we would see estonia , latvia , lithuania , poland , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary and slovenia joining the eu , then i would have said that 's wonderful , that 's visionary .
and this vision has become reality in our lifetimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrating eu membership in romania the people in those countries have chosen our values .
communism has vanished , fallen apart , and that is a wonderful development .
the european status quo of the 1950s , 60s , 70s and 80s , the division of the continent , the berlin wall , a divided germany - all of that is gone .
so we can be very happy with the way things have developed , and now , of course , we have to try to structure things in a way that makes sense , in a way that europe 's citizens can understand it .
and that is the main task we are facing . and that 's one of the tasks the constitution sought to address .
but it was rejected by voters in france and the netherlands , and there are other countries where it 's far from clear that it would be passed in a referendum - probably not in britain , for example .
what has to be salvaged from this constitution to make europe capable of action ? we certainly have to keep the core of the constitution .
and that includes majority voting in the council of ministers .
this european union can no longer be led if huge swathes of european legislation require a unanimous vote .
we have majority voting in the european parliament - and it has to be that way in the council of ministers too .
i would also argue strongly that the second part of the constitution , which deals with values , human dignity , democracy , the principle of law , the principle of solidarity , human rights - this part must be transferred into european law .
without values , this eu has no future .
that is why these values are so important . herr pöttering , you will most likely be elected as the next president of the european parliament in mid-january .
if you are elected , what are your goals for the next two and a half years ? bildunterschrift : the european parliament in strasbourg i would like to use that position - and i would need the support of the whole parliament , of course - to try to bring the eu and the european parliament closer to the people .
and i would like to make our relationship to the islamic world a high priority .
those are the things i think i would focus on . you said yourself that the last 50 years in europe have been a great success story .
and yet the eu is suffering a bit of a depression .
what would your answer be to this sense of melancholy ? i do n't know if the eu is suffering from depression .
sometimes the situation is very paradoxical .
in the polish capital , warsaw , we have a government that could certainly be more committed to europe than it is and yet opinion polls show that 80 percent of the people in poland support the european constitution .
so the situation is very varied . of course there is skepticism .
that has always been the case .
and that 's why it 's important that we press ahead with european projects , as commission president jose manuel barroso says .
it 's important that we have successes and we do have successes , and we need to talk about them .
above all , we need to make it clear to people that the glass is half full , not half empty .
and if we approach european policy with optimism and hope and confidence , then i think we will be able to get europe moving forwards again and the people of europe moving forward with us . alexander kudascheff interviewed hans-gert pöttering -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de drumming up support for the eu constitution german chancellor angela merkel has much on her agenda as she kicks off the eu presidency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the german eu presidency a dummy 's guide to the eu german fm : kosovo biggest problem right now commission proposes eu-wide green card for migrants germany determined to strengthen european police agency european union -pipe- 06.01.2007 " without values , this eu has no future " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pöttering has been a european parliamentarian since 1979 dw-tv talked to hans-gert pöttering , the likely new president of the european parliament , about the german eu presidency , the chances for an eu constitution and his plans as leader of the bloc 's legislative . dw-tv : germany has taken on the eu 's rotating presidency and with it the running of the bloc 's business for the next six months .
what can we expect ? hans-gert pöttering : i would like the german presidency to come up with a way of moving forward .
and i would like a decision on what mandate any conference on the european constitution would have - if such a conference takes place - in an attempt to realize the main goal of the constitution . when it comes down to the substance , though , the main thing will be to come up with some kind of timetable for a european constitution .
is that the least we can expect from the germans in the next six months ? we certainly expect that - but that is n't all that we expect .
i hope that the german presidency will be more ambitious than that - and i 'm sure it will be .
i hope there will be a discussion about how far we want to see the enlargement of the eu to go .
do we want to take in every country that wants to join the union - or do we want to say that there have to be limits , geographical limits as well ? are there geographical limits ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much further can the eu expand ?
in terms of the steps we take , there certainly are .
we first need to strengthen the structures of the european union - and that 's why we need to see the substance of the proposed constitution enacted .
if we do n't have that , then - with the possible exception of croatia , we can pretty much forget any further enlargement .
then we have to look at what 's going to happen with ukraine , and the balkan nations , what 's going to happen with the countries in the caucasus , and the countries in northern africa .
these are all neighboring countries , and there are lots of things that connect us to them - but also things that do n't connect .
and we need stable partnerships , we need policies for our neighbors , and i hope the debate on that will grow in intensity during the german presidency . the balkan nations have already been given a per spective on their eu aspirations - and one day they will probably join .
then the eu will comprise 33 or 34 nations .
independent of the debate on the constitution : would that already represent a critical mass , when the eu is no longer what it was , but effectively an organization for security and co-o per ation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- with a few differences in its substance ? yes , it ca n't just become another osce - it ca n't just be a loose union .
what we want is a strong europe that can act .
nonetheless , we should be happy that europe is as it is today .
to put it personally : i have been a member of the european parliament since 1979 , since the first direct elections .
and if someone had said back then that on may 1 , 2004 , we would see estonia , latvia , lithuania , poland , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary and slovenia joining the eu , then i would have said that 's wonderful , that 's visionary .
and this vision has become reality in our lifetimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrating eu membership in romania the people in those countries have chosen our values .
communism has vanished , fallen apart , and that is a wonderful development .
the european status quo of the 1950s , 60s , 70s and 80s , the division of the continent , the berlin wall , a divided germany - all of that is gone .
so we can be very happy with the way things have developed , and now , of course , we have to try to structure things in a way that makes sense , in a way that europe 's citizens can understand it .
and that is the main task we are facing . and that 's one of the tasks the constitution sought to address .
but it was rejected by voters in france and the netherlands , and there are other countries where it 's far from clear that it would be passed in a referendum - probably not in britain , for example .
what has to be salvaged from this constitution to make europe capable of action ? we certainly have to keep the core of the constitution .
and that includes majority voting in the council of ministers .
this european union can no longer be led if huge swathes of european legislation require a unanimous vote .
we have majority voting in the european parliament - and it has to be that way in the council of ministers too .
i would also argue strongly that the second part of the constitution , which deals with values , human dignity , democracy , the principle of law , the principle of solidarity , human rights - this part must be transferred into european law .
without values , this eu has no future .
that is why these values are so important . herr pöttering , you will most likely be elected as the next president of the european parliament in mid-january .
if you are elected , what are your goals for the next two and a half years ? bildunterschrift : the european parliament in strasbourg i would like to use that position - and i would need the support of the whole parliament , of course - to try to bring the eu and the european parliament closer to the people .
and i would like to make our relationship to the islamic world a high priority .
those are the things i think i would focus on . you said yourself that the last 50 years in europe have been a great success story .
and yet the eu is suffering a bit of a depression .
what would your answer be to this sense of melancholy ? i do n't know if the eu is suffering from depression .
sometimes the situation is very paradoxical .
in the polish capital , warsaw , we have a government that could certainly be more committed to europe than it is and yet opinion polls show that 80 percent of the people in poland support the european constitution .
so the situation is very varied . of course there is skepticism .
that has always been the case .
and that 's why it 's important that we press ahead with european projects , as commission president jose manuel barroso says .
it 's important that we have successes and we do have successes , and we need to talk about them .
above all , we need to make it clear to people that the glass is half full , not half empty .
and if we approach european policy with optimism and hope and confidence , then i think we will be able to get europe moving forwards again and the people of europe moving forward with us . alexander kudascheff interviewed hans-gert pöttering -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de drumming up support for the eu constitution german chancellor angela merkel has much on her agenda as she kicks off the eu presidency .

we first need to strengthen the structures of the european union - and that 's why we need to see the substance of the proposed constitution enacted .
if we do n't have that , then - with the possible exception of croatia , we can pretty much forget any further enlargement .
then we have to look at what 's going to happen with ukraine , and the balkan nations , what 's going to happen with the countries in the caucasus , and the countries in northern africa .
these are all neighboring countries , and there are lots of things that connect us to them - but also things that do n't connect .
and we need stable partnerships , we need policies for our neighbors , and i hope the debate on that will grow in intensity during the german presidency . the balkan nations have already been given a per spective on their eu aspirations - and one day they will probably join .
then the eu will comprise 33 or 34 nations .
independent of the debate on the constitution : would that already represent a critical mass , when the eu is no longer what it was , but effectively an organization for security and co-o per ation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- with a few differences in its substance ? yes , it ca n't just become another osce - it ca n't just be a loose union .
what we want is a strong europe that can act .
nonetheless , we should be happy that europe is as it is today .
to put it personally : i have been a member of the european parliament since 1979 , since the first direct elections .
and if someone had said back then that on may 1 , 2004 , we would see estonia , latvia , lithuania , poland , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary and slovenia joining the eu , then i would have said that 's wonderful , that 's visionary .
and this vision has become reality in our lifetimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrating eu membership in romania the people in those countries have chosen our values .
communism has vanished , fallen apart , and that is a wonderful development .
the european status quo of the 1950s , 60s , 70s and 80s , the division of the continent , the berlin wall , a divided germany - all of that is gone .
so we can be very happy with the way things have developed , and now , of course , we have to try to structure things in a way that makes sense , in a way that europe 's citizens can understand it .
and that is the main task we are facing . and that 's one of the tasks the constitution sought to address .
but it was rejected by voters in france and the netherlands , and there are other countries where it 's far from clear that it would be passed in a referendum - probably not in britain , for example .
what has to be salvaged from this constitution to make europe capable of action ? we certainly have to keep the core of the constitution .
and that includes majority voting in the council of ministers .
this european union can no longer be led if huge swathes of european legislation require a unanimous vote .
we have majority voting in the european parliament - and it has to be that way in the council of ministers too .
i would also argue strongly that the second part of the constitution , which deals with values , human dignity , democracy , the principle of law , the principle of solidarity , human rights - this part must be transferred into european law .
without values , this eu has no future .
that is why these values are so important . herr pöttering , you will most likely be elected as the next president of the european parliament in mid-january .
if you are elected , what are your goals for the next two and a half years ? bildunterschrift : the european parliament in strasbourg i would like to use that position - and i would need the support of the whole parliament , of course - to try to bring the eu and the european parliament closer to the people .
and i would like to make our relationship to the islamic world a high priority .
those are the things i think i would focus on . you said yourself that the last 50 years in europe have been a great success story .
and yet the eu is suffering a bit of a depression .
what would your answer be to this sense of melancholy ? i do n't know if the eu is suffering from depression .
sometimes the situation is very paradoxical .
in the polish capital , warsaw , we have a government that could certainly be more committed to europe than it is and yet opinion polls show that 80 percent of the people in poland support the european constitution .
so the situation is very varied . of course there is skepticism .
that has always been the case .
and that 's why it 's important that we press ahead with european projects , as commission president jose manuel barroso says .
it 's important that we have successes and we do have successes , and we need to talk about them .
above all , we need to make it clear to people that the glass is half full , not half empty .
and if we approach european policy with optimism and hope and confidence , then i think we will be able to get europe moving forwards again and the people of europe moving forward with us . alexander kudascheff interviewed hans-gert pöttering -lrb- win -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de drumming up support for the eu constitution german chancellor angela merkel has much on her agenda as she kicks off the eu presidency .

" the mistakes that can be made in this world will be made , " said kurt beck , the national spd leader , who serves as premier of the neighboring state of rhineland-palatinate . the party 's general secretary , hubertus heil , put it more bluntly .

it was discovered by workers at the airbus plant in broughton , flintshire .
it is thought the spider , which is the size of a thumbnail , may have arrived with a delivery from the usa .
the black widow 's new home , the north wales raptor and reptile centre near ruthin , denbighshire , is now licensed under the dangerous wild animals act .
the centre 's owner gary dickinson said handling the spider could be dangerous . "
she 's fed on a diet of insects and crickets , which are also used for feeding the reptiles at the centre " gary dickinson know for its neurotoxic venom , mr dickinson and his colleagues said they were " not taking any risks " with the black widow and had easy access to a supply of anti-venom .
he added : " it 's lethal - we have to keep it in an airtight box within a box and if we do need to handle it we nudge it with chopsticks .
" she 's fed on a diet of insects and crickets , which are also used for feeding the reptiles at the centre , " he added .
even though the black widow normally has a lifespan of around three years mr dickinson does not know the age of the spider .
it is being kept securely in a locked container , in a locked room .
mr dickinson said it had produced numerous egg sacks which he had to incinerate .
he added the spider tried to attack when they removed some of the egg sacks .
the term black widow usually refers to the three north american species , best known for their dark coloration and red hourglass pattern .
the black widow is among the most venomous spiders in north america , with its venom 15 times as toxic as that of the prairie rattlesnake .
but the spiders are usually not deadly to humans because they inject only a small amount of venom .

it is thought the spider , which is the size of a thumbnail , may have arrived with a delivery from the usa .
the black widow 's new home , the north wales raptor and reptile centre near ruthin , denbighshire , is now licensed under the dangerous wild animals act .
the centre 's owner gary dickinson said handling the spider could be dangerous .
she 's fed on a diet of insects and crickets , which are also used for feeding the reptiles at the centre gary dickinson know for its neurotoxic venom , mr dickinson and his colleagues said they were " not taking any risks " with the black widow and had easy access to a supply of anti-venom .
he added : " it 's lethal - we have to keep it in an airtight box within a box and if we do need to handle it we nudge it with chopsticks .
" she 's fed on a diet of insects and crickets , which are also used for feeding the reptiles at the centre , " he added .
even though the black widow normally has a lifespan of around three years mr dickinson does not know the age of the spider .
it is being kept securely in a locked container , in a locked room .
mr dickinson said it had produced numerous egg sacks which he had to incinerate .
he added the spider tried to attack when they removed some of the egg sacks .
the term black widow usually refers to the three north american species , best known for their dark coloration and red hourglass pattern .
the black widow is among the most venomous spiders in north america , with its venom 15 times as toxic as that of the prairie rattlesnake .
but the spiders are usually not deadly to humans because they inject only a small amount of venom .

experts say so-called " pro-ana " sites claim to offer support , but actually glorify the diseases and discourage people from seeking medical treatment .
they say these sites give tips on how to lose weight and keep it off , and present the illnesses as normal .
one doctor is urging service providers to shut the sites when they appear .
a young university student , who uses the online identity " kasia " , explained the appeal of the websites .
" i think i am quite glad that i found them because otherwise i would have just felt absolutely , totally alone , " she told bbc radio five live .
" you do n't choose to be like that .
it can just be that you feel that your life is so empty that all you can do is try and change yourself to kind of put meaning there , " she said .
life-threatening illness but dr dee dawson , medical director at rhodes farm , who treats people with eating disorders says the sites promote the diseases as being " normal " . "
it perpetuates the illness in a way that it encourages them not to seek treatment " amanda hills , national centre for eating disorders " really they 're not in recovery these people .
they 're really in the grips of a life-threatening illness and they 're trying very hard to promote that illness as being normal and wanting to recruit people into their very weird club .
" i think the servers should shut them down immediately they see them on the computers , " she told bbc radio five live .
amanda hills , a psychologist and counsellor at the national centre for eating disorders said the sites " keep people in their illness " instead of helping them out of it .
" the danger of them is that actually it 's for people who actively choose to be ill and it perpetuates the illness in a way that it encourages them not to seek treatment .
" seeking treatment is the way forward but these sites actually seek to keep people in their illness by giving them tips and all sorts of things that they might not have thought of themselves . "
steve bloomfield from the eating disorders association said the sites could appear " seductive " to those with anorexia or bulimia .
" they extol it as a lifestyle , as a choice and because of that , when people come onto these sites ... they find somebody who has an eating disorder who really seems to understand what it 's like . "
survey the mental health charity sane carried out a survey of people using pro-ana sites .
preliminary analysis showed 97 % respondents were women between 13 and 49 years , with 41 % aged between 16 to 19 .
almost half the respondents visited a site several times a day .
marjorie wallace , chief executive of sane , said : " sane 's concern is that these sites encourage people to hold onto their illness , reinforcing their belief and supporting them in a pattern of damaging behaviour , without encouraging them to seek treatment .
" we believe there are serious dangers in people relying on theses websites , using them as a substitute for social and family contact and emotional support .
" we call on those publishing these sites to review their content urgently and to remove extreme exhortations and images and take responsibility for messages which sustain self-destructive and potentially lethal behaviours . "

experts say so-called " pro-ana " sites claim to offer support , but actually glorify the diseases and discourage people from seeking medical treatment .
they say these sites give tips on how to lose weight and keep it off , and present the illnesses as normal .
one doctor is urging service providers to shut the sites when they appear .
a young university student , who uses the online identity " kasia " , explained the appeal of the websites .
" i think i am quite glad that i found them because otherwise i would have just felt absolutely , totally alone , " she told bbc radio five live .

it perpetuates the illness in a way that it encourages them not to seek treatment amanda hills , national centre for eating disorders " really they 're not in recovery these people .
they 're really in the grips of a life-threatening illness and they 're trying very hard to promote that illness as being normal and wanting to recruit people into their very weird club .

amanda hills , a psychologist and counsellor at the national centre for eating disorders said the sites " keep people in their illness " instead of helping them out of it .
" the danger of them is that actually it 's for people who actively choose to be ill and it perpetuates the illness in a way that it encourages them not to seek treatment .
" seeking treatment is the way forward but these sites actually seek to keep people in their illness by giving them tips and all sorts of things that they might not have thought of themselves . "
steve bloomfield from the eating disorders association said the sites could appear " seductive " to those with anorexia or bulimia .
" they extol it as a lifestyle , as a choice and because of that , when people come onto these sites ... they find somebody who has an eating disorder who really seems to understand what it 's like . "
survey the mental health charity sane carried out a survey of people using pro-ana sites .
preliminary analysis showed 97 % respondents were women between 13 and 49 years , with 41 % aged between 16 to 19 .
almost half the respondents visited a site several times a day .
marjorie wallace , chief executive of sane , said : " sane 's concern is that these sites encourage people to hold onto their illness , reinforcing their belief and supporting them in a pattern of damaging behaviour , without encouraging them to seek treatment .
" we believe there are serious dangers in people relying on theses websites , using them as a substitute for social and family contact and emotional support .
" we call on those publishing these sites to review their content urgently and to remove extreme exhortations and images and take responsibility for messages which sustain self-destructive and potentially lethal behaviours . "

amanda hills , a psychologist and counsellor at the national centre for eating disorders said the sites " keep people in their illness " instead of helping them out of it .
" the danger of them is that actually it 's for people who actively choose to be ill and it perpetuates the illness in a way that it encourages them not to seek treatment .
" seeking treatment is the way forward but these sites actually seek to keep people in their illness by giving them tips and all sorts of things that they might not have thought of themselves . "
steve bloomfield from the eating disorders association said the sites could appear " seductive " to those with anorexia or bulimia .
" they extol it as a lifestyle , as a choice and because of that , when people come onto these sites ... they find somebody who has an eating disorder who really seems to understand what it 's like . "
survey the mental health charity sane carried out a survey of people using pro-ana sites .
preliminary analysis showed 97 % respondents were women between 13 and 49 years , with 41 % aged between 16 to 19 .
almost half the respondents visited a site several times a day .
marjorie wallace , chief executive of sane , said : " sane 's concern is that these sites encourage people to hold onto their illness , reinforcing their belief and supporting them in a pattern of damaging behaviour , without encouraging them to seek treatment .
" we believe there are serious dangers in people relying on theses websites , using them as a substitute for social and family contact and emotional support .
" we call on those publishing these sites to review their content urgently and to remove extreme exhortations and images and take responsibility for messages which sustain self-destructive and potentially lethal behaviours . "

a report said unless money is spent the hospital could be sued if a patient dies due to the electricity failing .
the report went before the trust 's board this week .
the spending now needs to be agreed by the east of england strategic health authority .
the trust currently hires a mobile generator and faces loss of electrical power at peak times of day .
steve harrup , the trust 's director of estate and facilities , said in the report that the investment would buy the hospital a new generator , a generator back-up and mobile generators .
it would also see the replacement of old generator control panels and switches to allow the 800-bed hospital to have a secure supply of electricity over the next 20 years .
the report adds that if the electrical system at the hospital is not upgraded , the trust would face the possibility of the electricity failing and could be sued if a patient is injured or dies due to this .
it says the trust would not only have its reputation damaged but could face having to pay substantial damages .

a report said unless money is spent the hospital could be sued if a patient dies due to the electricity failing .
the report went before the trust 's board this week .
the spending now needs to be agreed by the east of england strategic health authority .
the trust currently hires a mobile generator and faces loss of electrical power at peak times of day .
steve harrup , the trust 's director of estate and facilities , said in the report that the investment would buy the hospital a new generator , a generator back-up and mobile generators .
it would also see the replacement of old generator control panels and switches to allow the 800-bed hospital to have a secure supply of electricity over the next 20 years .
the report adds that if the electrical system at the hospital is not upgraded , the trust would face the possibility of the electricity failing and could be sued if a patient is injured or dies due to this .
it says the trust would not only have its reputation damaged but could face having to pay substantial damages .

the deal will help a country once regarded as a backwater to catch up with its economically successful neighbours .
out there in the mekong delta , at the bottom of long thin vietnam , hien van le is very , very proud of his catfish .
every day , seven days a week , he takes a boat across the river to look at his fish , millions of them in great ponds he has had excavated along the river bank .
in the rapidly dwindling light of a sultry evening , two workers on a tiny boat struggle with sacks of feed , letting it cascade into the fishpond .
the surface of the water erupts like a sudden rainfall as the catfish surface to fight for food .
hien van le is a returnee : a vietnam-born plastic surgeon who practised in japan and los angeles for many years .
but in 2002 he came home , and here in the mekong delta with two local partners he started this 500-acre fish farm which now supplies 50 million fish a year to the export market . "
vietnam now attracts more overseas investment than india does ; it is second only to china in the asian economic growth league " elsewhere in the mekong delta , they grow rice , in profusion .
a nation that had to import rice 20 years ago has now become the biggest rice exporter in the world .
and it is not just food .
vietnam is exporting steel , and computer parts and now , highly skilled outsourced services , the kind on which india has built a huge new reputation .
vietnam is making waves .
the mekong catfish farmers , with two harvests a year , have their less productive american rivals worried enough for the us to impose anti-dumping duties .
foreign investment this is all happening in a place cut off from the rest of the world for much of the past three decades , after the end of what we call the vietnam war and the vietnamese call the american war .
vietnam still has a communist government but , just as china did in the late 1970s , so in the year 2000 the vietnamese authorities unveiled big reforms which legitimised private business and turned many state-owned firms into shareholder-owned companies .
the impact has been as dramatic as the chinese industrial revolution .
foreign investment is pouring in .
vietnam now attracts more overseas investment than india does ; it is second only to china in the asian economic growth league , and 50 % of the vietnam population is aged 35 or under .
the trite way of putting it is that when they stopped making war here , they made love .
the hordes of young people simply do n't remember the war ; they are well-educated , and very ambitious .
skills chain the computer chip giant intel this year announced it was investing £ 600m in a new plant to test and mount chips flown in from abroad - an investment by an international giant that opened the eyes of many other companies to the attractions of the country as a base .
intel 's main man in vietnam is phu than , a local who was helicoptered out of the grounds of the american embassy on the day that saigon fell in 1975 .
though he vividly remembers the feeling of a new life beginning on that chaotic morning , in the year 2000 he came back .
communist or not , intel 's chairman admiringly remarked that the experience was very similar to the welcome intel received from the authorities in ireland , a place in which it has now enthusiastically invested billions .
another incomer is atlas industries , an outsourcing firm run by an englishman called joe woolf that uses cheap vietnamese technicians to make construction drawings and 3d computer simulations for architects far away in britain and australia .
this is outsourcing driving up the skills chain .
it is a far cry from the call centre mentality .
the youthfulness of the vietnamese cities is particularly apparent in the millions of mopeds now scooting round ho chi minh city , the current name for what used to be saigon .
it still bears the mark of elegant french colonialism , but as i wove past the reconciliation palace and the elegant municipal theatre in a tooting ballet of motor scooters , darting and weaving like the feeding catfish in the delta , i had an ugly premonition .
economists say that soon - maybe as soon as next year - the income of vietnam 's city families will reach the size when they will start to buy cars .
and if that happens , then the flow of the hordes of mopeds will be replaced by logjams , and the human scale and amiability of this low-rise city will be shoved aside by angry people in static tin boxes and looming skyscrapers like the other cities of asia .
the authorities have big plans for public transport , and as this is still a centrally directed economy they may be able to get their way .
but cars have a habit of winning people 's hearts and minds , in a way that the american military never managed to do , back in the 1970s .

the deal will help a country once regarded as a backwater to catch up with its economically successful neighbours .
vietnamese traditions are still in evidence despite new wealth .
out there in the mekong delta , at the bottom of long thin vietnam , hien van le is very , very proud of his catfish .
every day , seven days a week , he takes a boat across the river to look at his fish , millions of them in great ponds he has had excavated along the river bank .
in the rapidly dwindling light of a sultry evening , two workers on a tiny boat struggle with sacks of feed , letting it cascade into the fishpond .
the surface of the water erupts like a sudden rainfall as the catfish surface to fight for food .
hien van le is a returnee : a vietnam-born plastic surgeon who practised in japan and los angeles for many years .
but in 2002 he came home , and here in the mekong delta with two local partners he started this 500-acre fish farm which now supplies 50 million fish a year to the export market .
vietnam now attracts more overseas investment than india does ; it is second only to china in the asian economic growth league elsewhere in the mekong delta , they grow rice , in profusion .
a nation that had to import rice 20 years ago has now become the biggest rice exporter in the world .
and it is not just food .
vietnam is exporting steel , and computer parts and now , highly skilled outsourced services , the kind on which india has built a huge new reputation .
vietnam is making waves .
the mekong catfish farmers , with two harvests a year , have their less productive american rivals worried enough for the us to impose anti-dumping duties .
foreign investment this is all happening in a place cut off from the rest of the world for much of the past three decades , after the end of what we call the vietnam war and the vietnamese call the american war .
the streets of ho chi minh city may not be free of cars for much longer vietnam still has a communist government but , just as china did in the late 1970s , so in the year 2000 the vietnamese authorities unveiled big reforms which legitimised private business and turned many state-owned firms into shareholder-owned companies .
the impact has been as dramatic as the chinese industrial revolution .
foreign investment is pouring in .
vietnam now attracts more overseas investment than india does ; it is second only to china in the asian economic growth league , and 50 % of the vietnam population is aged 35 or under .
the trite way of putting it is that when they stopped making war here , they made love .
the hordes of young people simply do n't remember the war ; they are well-educated , and very ambitious .
skills chain the computer chip giant intel this year announced it was investing £ 600m in a new plant to test and mount chips flown in from abroad - an investment by an international giant that opened the eyes of many other companies to the attractions of the country as a base .
intel 's main man in vietnam is phu than , a local who was helicoptered out of the grounds of the american embassy on the day that saigon fell in 1975 .
though he vividly remembers the feeling of a new life beginning on that chaotic morning , in the year 2000 he came back .
more trade will bring new wealth to vietnam 's young population .
communist or not , intel 's chairman admiringly remarked that the experience was very similar to the welcome intel received from the authorities in ireland , a place in which it has now enthusiastically invested billions .
another incomer is atlas industries , an outsourcing firm run by an englishman called joe woolf that uses cheap vietnamese technicians to make construction drawings and 3d computer simulations for architects far away in britain and australia .
this is outsourcing driving up the skills chain .
it is a far cry from the call centre mentality .
the youthfulness of the vietnamese cities is particularly apparent in the millions of mopeds now scooting round ho chi minh city , the current name for what used to be saigon .
it still bears the mark of elegant french colonialism , but as i wove past the reconciliation palace and the elegant municipal theatre in a tooting ballet of motor scooters , darting and weaving like the feeding catfish in the delta , i had an ugly premonition .
economists say that soon - maybe as soon as next year - the income of vietnam 's city families will reach the size when they will start to buy cars .
and if that happens , then the flow of the hordes of mopeds will be replaced by logjams , and the human scale and amiability of this low-rise city will be shoved aside by angry people in static tin boxes and looming skyscrapers like the other cities of asia .
the authorities have big plans for public transport , and as this is still a centrally directed economy they may be able to get their way .
but cars have a habit of winning people 's hearts and minds , in a way that the american military never managed to do , back in the 1970s .

mr maliki said the hanging was a " domestic affair " for the benefit of iraq 's unity , adding that the former president had received a fair trial .
mobile phone images showing saddam hussein being taunted appeared on the internet days after the execution .
several sunni arab countries have criticised the hanging as sectarian . "
we find that this conduct is inciting sedition and flagrant interference in the internal affairs of iraq and abuses feelings of the families of the victims " nouri maliki hanging ' makes martyr of saddam ' egyptian president hosni mubarak said it had turned the former leader into a martyr .
mr maliki 's remarks came in a speech to mark iraqi army day , in which he promised to take action against all armed groups in baghdad .
he said that iraqi troops were now fully prepared to tighten security in the capital with us forces operating in support .
the new neighbourhood-by-neighbourhood operation which starts this weekend would be carried out regardless of the groups ' political affiliations , he added .
the announcement comes only days before us president george bush is due to outline his new strategy for iraq .
the american president is widely expected to send thousands more troops to iraq , despite calls from the new democratic party leaders of congress for the us to begin withdrawing its forces .
' disgraceful crimes ' but in a speech to mark iraqi army day , mr maliki said the decision to execute saddam hussein was not a political but a judicial one .
condemned men barzan ibrahim al-tikriti -lrb- right -rrb- - saddam hussein 's half-brother , former head of the intelligence service awad al bandar - former chief judge of revolutionary court profile : barzan ibrahim verdicts in detail " the decision was implemented after a just trial which the dictator did not deserve as the crimes he committed against the people , the country and its institutions were disgraceful , " he said .
he attacked criticism of the hanging as provocative and insensitive .
" we find that this conduct is inciting sedition and flagrant interference in the internal affairs of iraq and abuses feelings of the families of the victims , " he added .
other members of the former regime would also feel the full force of the law , he said .
he was apparently referring to saddam hussein 's half-brother barzan ibrahim al-tikriti and former chief judge awad al-bandar , both of whom were found guilty at the same time .
no date has yet been announced for their execution .

mobile phone images showing saddam hussein being taunted appeared on the internet days after the execution .
several sunni arab countries have criticised the hanging as sectarian .
we find that this conduct is inciting sedition and flagrant interference in the internal affairs of iraq and abuses feelings of the families of the victims nouri maliki hanging ' makes martyr of saddam ' egyptian president hosni mubarak said it had turned the former leader into a martyr .
mr maliki 's remarks came in a speech to mark iraqi army day , in which he promised to take action against all armed groups in baghdad .
he said that iraqi troops were now fully prepared to tighten security in the capital with us forces operating in support .
the new neighbourhood-by-neighbourhood operation which starts this weekend would be carried out regardless of the groups ' political affiliations , he added .

condemned men barzan ibrahim al-tikriti -lrb- right -rrb- - saddam hussein 's half-brother , former head of the intelligence service awad al bandar - former chief judge of revolutionary court profile : barzan ibrahim verdicts in detail " the decision was implemented after a just trial which the dictator did not deserve as the crimes he committed against the people , the country and its institutions were disgraceful , " he said .
he attacked criticism of the hanging as provocative and insensitive .
" we find that this conduct is inciting sedition and flagrant interference in the internal affairs of iraq and abuses feelings of the families of the victims , " he added .
other members of the former regime would also feel the full force of the law , he said .
he was apparently referring to saddam hussein 's half-brother barzan ibrahim al-tikriti and former chief judge awad al-bandar , both of whom were found guilty at the same time .
no date has yet been announced for their execution .
