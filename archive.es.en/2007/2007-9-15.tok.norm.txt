12 .
" there actually was a tsunami , " jochen zschau , director of the geophysics department of the gfz earth sciences institute , told german news service dpa .
" fortunately it was only about one meter -lrb- three feet -rrb- high when it made landfall on the indonesian west coast .
even a little bit bigger would have been quite dangerous . " time of the essence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least 10 people were killed and more injured by wednesday 's tsunami zschau said a first automatic alert from the gfz-installed seismographs and buoys arrived in jakarta and potsdam near berlin , enabling his team to inform indonesian officials earlier than other scientists .

but studying in germany is proving unaffordable for many students from poorer countries . " foreign students are increasingly coming to student unions for advice because they do n't know how to finance their studies anymore , " isabelle kappus of the german student union organization said .
" but there is n't much we can offer foreign students . "
foreigners who got their university entrance qualification abroad generally do not have the same opportunities that german students do .
they do not receive federal support , and few scholarships are available .
academic loans are dependent on security guarantees that most foreigners can not afford .
few exchange programs for poor countries " coming to germany to study has become more expensive , " said johannes glembek , head of the federal association of foreign students .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese students are one of the largest groups of foreign students in germany but it 's not the tuition fees that were recently introduced by some federal states that burden foreign students the most .
rather it is the rising costs for language courses , placement tests and application fees that have been in place for three to four years that are the highest hurdles for foreign students with limited financial means . " those fees discourage them , " he said .
those wanting to study at a german university should expect initial costs equivalent to two to three months ' living expenses .
this is especially applicable to " freemovers " - the students who have not come to germany as part of a particular exchange program at their colleges or the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- .
this hits students from the developing world especially hard , since germany has few exchange programs with poorer countries .
fewer freshmen from abroad " when i started my studies seven years ago , a german course cost me about 40 euros -lrb- $ 55.50 -rrb- per level - for photocopies and other organizational costs , " said erick tambo de gankam , an african student in dortmund .
these days , a german course consisting of three basic levels and two advanced levels will set students back around 1,250 euros -lrb- $ 1,736 -rrb- .
additionally , universities often have application fees and some subjects , such as medicine , can require from 20 to 30 separate applications .
in many cities , foreigners are given work permits only after the application fees are paid .
they are only allowed to work for 90 days during semester breaks , and the jobs are generally poorly paid .
normally they get between five to eight euros per hour , tambo said .
because of the tough financial situation , the number of " freemovers " has sunk .
in 2003 , there were 60,000 foreign freshmen in germany 's higher education programs .
in 2005 , that number has sunk by 5,000 .
the number of freshmen from china has fallen dramatically - from 7,000 in 2002 to 4,000 in 2005 .
are fees the main reason ?
but consultants at the daad student exchange service doubt that the rising fees are the main reason for the student decline .
they see it as a natural slowing after an earlier boom in the number of new foreign students .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are not many student exchange programs with african countries according to daad , improved higher education possibilities in china are behind the declining number of students from that country , as well tougher entrance requirements and more safeguards against falsified documents . " the numbers will rise , and we now will have better students , " said klaus birk , a daad expert on china .
but according to cheng ni , assistant director of the german association of chinese students and graduates , more and more chinese students wishing to study abroad are simply choosing to go to countries besides germany .
according to official chinese statistics , more people are choosing to study abroad , but fewer are choosing germany .
the preliminary examination for students wanting to study in germany itself costs 250 euros , and must be taken in beijing .
traveling expenses , of course , are not included .
" the highly qualified do n't always have the money " when new university fees were introduced , they were accompanied by student protests all over germany .
yet the effect that these new fees will have on foreign students is still uncertain .
according to a survey conducted two years ago by the student union , money , or a lack thereof , is one of the biggest issues for foreign students .
" germany 's argument has always been that the studies are not expensive , " tambo de gankam said .
" if somebody asks me today if they should study in germany , i try to discourage them . "
belgium or france are more expensive but they do n't require learning a new language .
popular places for studying for his fellow countrymen are nigeria , senegal , mali , ghana , south africa , morocco and russia .

rather it is the rising costs for language courses , placement tests and application fees that have been in place for three to four years that are the highest hurdles for foreign students with limited financial means . " those fees discourage them , " he said .
those wanting to study at a german university should expect initial costs equivalent to two to three months ' living expenses .
this is especially applicable to " freemovers " - the students who have not come to germany as part of a particular exchange program at their colleges or the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- .
this hits students from the developing world especially hard , since germany has few exchange programs with poorer countries .
fewer freshmen from abroad " when i started my studies seven years ago , a german course cost me about 40 euros -lrb- $ 55.50 -rrb- per level - for photocopies and other organizational costs , " said erick tambo de gankam , an african student in dortmund .
these days , a german course consisting of three basic levels and two advanced levels will set students back around 1,250 euros -lrb- $ 1,736 -rrb- .
additionally , universities often have application fees and some subjects , such as medicine , can require from 20 to 30 separate applications .
in many cities , foreigners are given work permits only after the application fees are paid .
they are only allowed to work for 90 days during semester breaks , and the jobs are generally poorly paid .
normally they get between five to eight euros per hour , tambo said .
because of the tough financial situation , the number of " freemovers " has sunk .
in 2003 , there were 60,000 foreign freshmen in germany 's higher education programs .
in 2005 , that number has sunk by 5,000 .
the number of freshmen from china has fallen dramatically - from 7,000 in 2002 to 4,000 in 2005 .
are fees the main reason ?
but consultants at the daad student exchange service doubt that the rising fees are the main reason for the student decline .
they see it as a natural slowing after an earlier boom in the number of new foreign students .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are not many student exchange programs with african countries according to daad , improved higher education possibilities in china are behind the declining number of students from that country , as well tougher entrance requirements and more safeguards against falsified documents . " the numbers will rise , and we now will have better students , " said klaus birk , a daad expert on china .
but according to cheng ni , assistant director of the german association of chinese students and graduates , more and more chinese students wishing to study abroad are simply choosing to go to countries besides germany .
according to official chinese statistics , more people are choosing to study abroad , but fewer are choosing germany .
the preliminary examination for students wanting to study in germany itself costs 250 euros , and must be taken in beijing .
traveling expenses , of course , are not included .
" the highly qualified do n't always have the money " when new university fees were introduced , they were accompanied by student protests all over germany .
yet the effect that these new fees will have on foreign students is still uncertain .
according to a survey conducted two years ago by the student union , money , or a lack thereof , is one of the biggest issues for foreign students .
" germany 's argument has always been that the studies are not expensive , " tambo de gankam said .
" if somebody asks me today if they should study in germany , i try to discourage them . "
belgium or france are more expensive but they do n't require learning a new language .
popular places for studying for his fellow countrymen are nigeria , senegal , mali , ghana , south africa , morocco and russia .
the german student union worries that germany could become less attractive for foreign students . " the internationalization of higher education ca n't be achieved just by marketing , " isabelle kappus said .
" the social interests can not be forgotten . "
glembek of the foreign students association warned : " highly qualified students are not always the richest . " stefan dietrich -lrb- tip -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but studying in germany is proving unaffordable for many students from poorer countries . " foreign students are increasingly coming to student unions for advice because they do n't know how to finance their studies anymore , " isabelle kappus of the german student union organization said .
" but there is n't much we can offer foreign students . "
foreigners who got their university entrance qualification abroad generally do not have the same opportunities that german students do .
they do not receive federal support , and few scholarships are available .
academic loans are dependent on security guarantees that most foreigners can not afford .
few exchange programs for poor countries " coming to germany to study has become more expensive , " said johannes glembek , head of the federal association of foreign students .

" there actually was a tsunami , " jochen zschau , director of the geophysics department of the gfz earth sciences institute , told german news service dpa .

" it took us just five minutes to find out the epicenter and strength , " he said .
the old tsunami warning system took 15 minutes to issue an alert and us seismologists , who use data from that system , did n't send out a warning message until half an hour after the quake occurred .
the tsunami tidal wave of december 2004 , which killed more than 220,000 people , reached the indonesian coast after 20 minutes .
while the german system is still not completed , zschau said it will be completely up and running in place by the end of next year .
the buoys record abnormal waves and other phenomena in the water to indicate if the ocean is shifting .
the german government financed the system after the great indian ocean tsunami of 2004 , which killed some 230,000 people .
wednesday 's epicenter was close to the same place as in 2004 . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

rockfield was started by brothers charles and kingsley ward in 1965 .
over four decades it has produced hits from artists such as queen , motorhead , oasis , stereophonics and the former led zeppelin front man robert plant .
" i 'm amazed no-one had written about it before , " said the book 's author , journalist jeff collins .
robert plant returned to rockfield last year on the 25th anniversary of his first solo album and was interviewed by collins for the book .
the 59-year-old told collins he was " re-born both personally and professionally " at the studios after the break-up of led zeppelin , following the death of drummer john bonham .
he said : " after all that wild stuff , and momentum , this was an absolute dream , because it was pastoral , funny , and it had a history , the place itself was a bit more passive than any kind i 'd ever been in . "

" i 'm amazed no-one had written about it before . "
the ward brothers were signed to a music label in the mid-60s and created their first studio on the family farm when they became fed up with the travelling to london for recording sessions in the days before the m4 motorway opened .

collins tracked down a number of the stars who used the studios during their career , as well as some of the producers and engineers .

he said : " if it had n't sold as many millions as it eventually did ...

the album topped the charts in britain and reached number four in america .
freddie mercury wrote his piano part for bohemian rhapsody in a former feed store at the farm while the rest of the band played frisbee in a nearby field .
mercury 's six-minute epic may have gone into rock legend , but the record executives who were paying the bills needed to see a return on the investment , according to hince .
he said : " overall it was a pretty hectic time .
there was a lot of pressure , so you got a feeling it was a real " make or break " time for the band .
" at the time , a night at the opera was one of the most expensive albums ever made .

rockfield was started by brothers charles and kingsley ward in 1965 .
over four decades it has produced hits from artists such as queen , motorhead , oasis , stereophonics and the former led zeppelin front man robert plant .
" i 'm amazed no-one had written about it before , " said the book 's author , journalist jeff collins .
robert plant returned to rockfield last year on the 25th anniversary of his first solo album and was interviewed by collins for the book .
the 59-year-old told collins he was " re-born both personally and professionally " at the studios after the break-up of led zeppelin , following the death of drummer john bonham .
he said : " after all that wild stuff , and momentum , this was an absolute dream , because it was pastoral , funny , and it had a history , the place itself was a bit more passive than any kind i 'd ever been in . "
motorhead front man , lemmy , left , is interviewed by jeff collins this week it was announced led zeppelin are to reform - with bonham 's son playing drums - for a one-night-only charity gig at london 's o2 arena .
collins , 40 , said : " when i was growing up , i could n't believe all this fantastic music was being recorded just a few miles up the road , and in wales .
" i 'm amazed no-one had written about it before . "
the ward brothers were signed to a music label in the mid-60s and created their first studio on the family farm when they became fed up with the travelling to london for recording sessions in the days before the m4 motorway opened .
one of the first artists to raise the studios profile among aspiring musicians was cardiff-born dave edmunds with his 1971 hit , i hear you knocking ' .
collins tracked down a number of the stars who used the studios during their career , as well as some of the producers and engineers .
among stories told in rock legends at rockfield is the recording of queen 's masterpiece a night at the opera , part of which was recorded at rockfield in 1975 and is reputed to be one of the most expensive albums of all time .
queen 's operatic bohemian rhapsody became a rock classic roadie peter hince , known as ratty , claims in the book that record label executives were sweating as the costs of classic tracks , including operatic bohemian rhapsody , mounted .
he said : " if it had n't sold as many millions as it eventually did ...
emi might have had second thoughts . "
the album topped the charts in britain and reached number four in america .
freddie mercury wrote his piano part for bohemian rhapsody in a former feed store at the farm while the rest of the band played frisbee in a nearby field .
mercury 's six-minute epic may have gone into rock legend , but the record executives who were paying the bills needed to see a return on the investment , according to hince .
he said : " overall it was a pretty hectic time .
there was a lot of pressure , so you got a feeling it was a real " make or break " time for the band .
" at the time , a night at the opera was one of the most expensive albums ever made .
the cost in terms of studio time was phenomenal .

the special school in bobigny was set up after secularisation laws in 2004 prevented sikh boys from wearing their traditional turbans in class .
several boys dropped out of mainstream education in protest .
the sikh school was built by a local entrepreneur whose son was excluded from a public school three years ago .
the boy had refused to remove his turban in class .
the french laws ban the wearing of prominent religious symbols such as muslim headscarves or sikh turbans in public places like offices or schools .
the sikh school will start with fewer than 15 pupils but it is hoped that a sikh college will open later in the year to allow older boys to take business qualifications .
although the school will celebrate its inauguration over the weekend , it is unlikely to begin classes on monday because it is still waiting for a final approval from the local education authority .

the special school in bobigny was set up after secularisation laws in 2004 prevented sikh boys from wearing their traditional turbans in class .
several boys dropped out of mainstream education in protest .
the sikh school was built by a local entrepreneur whose son was excluded from a public school three years ago .
the boy had refused to remove his turban in class .
the french laws ban the wearing of prominent religious symbols such as muslim headscarves or sikh turbans in public places like offices or schools .
the sikh school will start with fewer than 15 pupils but it is hoped that a sikh college will open later in the year to allow older boys to take business qualifications .
although the school will celebrate its inauguration over the weekend , it is unlikely to begin classes on monday because it is still waiting for a final approval from the local education authority .
