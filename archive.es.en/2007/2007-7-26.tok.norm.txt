andreas schleicher , a coordinator of pisa , the oecd 's program for international student assessment which compares educational achievement in different countries , said the training of teachers in particular needed to be radically revamped .
in germany , there 's an attempt by " teachers who have been trained in the 20th century to teach children of the 21st century in a school system that was conceived in the 19th century , " schleicher said .
he added that school teachers sorely needed a more hands-on training approach .
germany still reeling under pisa shock the criticism is not new .
in recent years , germany 's education system has taken a severe battering after a string of pisa study results showed the country 's exalted schools to be trailing internationally .
in 2001 , germany ranked only 21st in reading skills and 20th in math and science among 31 countries assessed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munoz , right , with german education minister annette schavan in march this year , the country was dealt another blow when un special education envoy vernor munoz - amid protests by germany 's federal education ministers - published a damning report saying the class-based three-tier school system was selective , discriminatory and undemocratic by shutting out children from immigrant and poorer backgrounds .
in no other industrialized nation was school success so strongly linked to the social origin of its students , munoz said in the report .
he urged germany to rethink its school structure .
whereas most other european countries have moved on to more inclusive school systems , germany has essentially stuck to a three-tier structure which means that children are only 10 -lrb- or 12 in berlin -rrb- when their high school is chosen .
for nearly half of foreign students , it 's the hauptschule which prepares them for low-skilled jobs .
only 14 percent go to a pre-university gymnasium , compared with a national average of a third .
the drop-out rate for children of immigrant backgrounds is three times the national average .
only at the grundschule , or elementary school , are pupils from all ability groups taught together .
experts urge government to wake up to reality though the shock caused by the international studies has triggered some reform activity in german schools , critics say it 's all taking place within the existing system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say germany 's three-tier school structure is discriminatory at the conference in berlin , experts , including munoz , said the german government has yet to react to the un special envoy 's drastic recommendations .
marianne demmer , head of the teachers ' union , gew , said the german government and the federal states - which are responsible for education - needed to finally stop reacting to munoz 's criticism " with a mixture of hurt , aggression and arrogance . "
demmer urged german president horst köhler to step in and ignite a national debate on munoz 's reform proposals .
she also demanded that the human right to education be anchored both in germany 's basic law and in state constitutions .
critics have also slammed german federal education ministers for their refusal to participate in an international pisa study for teachers .
currently , 25 countries including denmark , italy , spain , austria and spain are participating in the survey . article based on news reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not everybody , it seems , enjoyed seeing richard wagner dancing in his underwear . germany 's annual bayreuth festival of wagner operas began on wednesday with a highly anticipated , make-or-break production by the 29-year-old great-granddaughter of the composer richard wagner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an opera buff who also happens to be close to the people : angela merkel and while the applause after the first two acts of wagner 's only " comic " opera was friendly , the audience - which included a smorgasbord of german political and social elite - was less amused by the third and final act , which featured a few minutes of full frontal nudity , a bizarre sight of richard wagner dancing in his underwear and a bunch of master singers horsing around the stage with oversized penises .
when , at the end of the marathon seven-hour performance , which included 2 one-hour breaks , visibly nervous katharina wagner took to the stage , she was greeted with boos , hisses , jeers and whistles as well as bravos and cries of approval .
the bayreuth audience proved itself to be worthy of the music genre : dramatic , passionate and self-involved to the point of absurdity .
a red-carpet affair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a family business : katharina wagner with father wolfgang and mother gudrun camera teams and hundreds of onlookers were outside the 19th century festival theater to see katharina in a backless frock arrive to the opening with her father wolfgang wagner , the famous composer 's 87-year-old grandson .
other prominent guests included german chancellor angela merkel , eu commission president jose manuel barroso and a host of german and european glitterati such as bavarian aristocrat gloria von thurn und taxis , germany 's most famous tv showmaster thomas gottschalk and old-time crooner roberto blanco , who has demonstrated a remarkable talent at being frequently resurrected from oblivion .
katharina wagner , who hopes to be appointed festival director in succession to her father wolfgang , who 's been in charge of the festival since 1951 , told reporters that last-minute rehearsals were needed because of " technical problems . "
new ideas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : princess gloria von thurn und taxis with her daughters in an interview published on wednesday , wagner said new ideas were vital to keep the festival young at heart .
she told the german daily süddeutsche zeitung that the festival had to claw back from the opera houses its avant-garde role in wagner interpretation .
" my concern is not to just preserve but to develop something new as well , " she said .
" bayreuth can dare to experiment , " she said , pointing to past engagements of two of the shock directors of german theater , the late heiner müller in 1993 for " tristan and isolde " and christoph schlingensief in 2004 for " parsifal . "
a family saga katharina wagner - the youngest-ever director and the first woman ever to have been entrusted with staging an opera at the festival established by her great-grandfather 131 years ago - is , whether she likes to admit it or not , in the midst of an ongoing family feud .
bildunterschrift : a scene from the opera in what seems like a cross-over between a soap-opera and a royal-family intrigue , the wagners have been fighting over who will take over the festival management business for years .
the bayreuth board can hire anyone to run the public-funded festival , but the job is unique among german public appointments in always having been held by the wagner family .
after failing to establish his second wife gudrun as his successor , wolfgang wagner has put all his weight behind daughter katharina .
but katharina 's rival cousins eva wagner-pasquier and nike wagner , both 62 , also lay claim to the bayreuth throne .
eva is wolfgang 's daughter by his first marriage , while nike is the daughter of wolfgang 's brother wieland , who died in 1966 .
in the absence of a real royal family , the wagners are a god-given gift to those germans who like to combine their interests in high culture with society gossip .
a modern interpretation in a production that - perhaps to the shock of the hard-core , ultra-conservative wagnerites - did not feature a medieval town square and a cast that could be easily convinced to perform a dark , dogma-style , version of snow white and the seven dwarfs - katharina wagner decided to put her foot down in bayreuth as a modernizer par excellence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayreuth is the place to be seen : tv showman thomas gottschalk with his wife thea so she had sneakers raining from the sky .
even more importantly , however , while treating the opera as a kind of discourse on tradition and progress in art , she showed no particular respect for the actual plot .
in wagner 's original , walther von stolzing , a young knight , falls in love with the daughter of a rich nuremberg burgher and tries to win her heart by entering a singing contest - a medieval precursor to american idol and german superstar .
at first he is rejected by the master singers - the simon cowels and paula abduls of his time - for breaking all of their traditional rules .
eventually , however , his natural talent wins them over .
in essence , it 's a boy-gets-girl-by-showing-he-can-sing kind of story .
in katharina wagner 's staging , the hero is actually a wimp : a rebel who - in order to win the contest - becomes a conformist and emulator of his masters .
in modern speak : a hard-rocker , who in the american idol final , decides to sing a whitney houston ballad .
mixed reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reviews are yet to come in audience reactions to the unconventional production and critical response it receives could be decisive for wagner , either spoiling or boosting her ambitions .
achim barth , from frankfurt , dismissed the production as unnecessarily gimmicky .
" it 's runs completely contrary to the text , " barth said .
" it 's just nonsense .
modern for the sake of being modern . "
leading german daily newspapers were not due to publish reviews till friday but other media were quicker .
a reviewer for the web site of the weekly magazine der spiegel , for instance , compared the " overly intellectual " staging to a pizza : too many ingredients on a very thin base . no pressure wagner said she did not feel under any time pressure , since the post of festival director replacing her father , 87 , had not yet been advertised .
this year , the festival , which runs until aug .
28 , will also feature " the ring of the nibelung , " " tannhäuser " and re-runs of schlingensief 's " parsifal . "
all 54,000 available tickets to the 30 performances have been sold out .
organizers received 460,500 applications and preferred applicants , who had been applying for eight years or more . article based on news reports -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

andreas schleicher , a coordinator of pisa , the oecd 's program for international student assessment which compares educational achievement in different countries , said the training of teachers in particular needed to be radically revamped .
in germany , there 's an attempt by " teachers who have been trained in the 20th century to teach children of the 21st century in a school system that was conceived in the 19th century , " schleicher said .
he added that school teachers sorely needed a more hands-on training approach .
germany still reeling under pisa shock the criticism is not new .
in recent years , germany 's education system has taken a severe battering after a string of pisa study results showed the country 's exalted schools to be trailing internationally .
in 2001 , germany ranked only 21st in reading skills and 20th in math and science among 31 countries assessed .

in no other industrialized nation was school success so strongly linked to the social origin of its students , munoz said in the report .
he urged germany to rethink its school structure .
whereas most other european countries have moved on to more inclusive school systems , germany has essentially stuck to a three-tier structure which means that children are only 10 -lrb- or 12 in berlin -rrb- when their high school is chosen .
for nearly half of foreign students , it 's the hauptschule which prepares them for low-skilled jobs .
only 14 percent go to a pre-university gymnasium , compared with a national average of a third .

a german media report said the government no longer questioned the project .
now , just the financial details need to be clarified . the german government reportedly no longer wants to block a high-speed train connection between munich 's city center and its airport .
according to thursday 's edition of the daily die welt , german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee and bavaria 's economics minister erwin huber will meet at the end of august to clarify the financing of the project . " as soon as we 've reached agreement on the financing , we want to wind up the project quickly , " the paper quoted sources at the federal transport ministry . it is expected to cost at least 1.85 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.54 billion -rrb- . the high-speed magnetic levitation -lrb- " maglev " -rrb- train project had been called into question after a crash on a test track last year killed 23 people and injured 10 . eu funding could support transrapid the project 's financing is , however , a major hurdle .
the federal government has already earmarked 550 million euros in its budget for it .
bavaria would provide some 300 million euros and german railway deutsche bahn 185 million euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the transrapid crash in 2006 caused the first fatalities on a maglev train tiefensee has said that the federal government was only prepared to foot half of the bill .
according to transport experts , this left a financing gap of 350 million euros . bavaria 's premier edmund stoiber has therefore appealed to the european union for subsidies .
european commission president jose manuel barroso , who is currently on a three-day-visist to bavaria , has agreed to examine the request .
bavaria hopes the eu could provide at least 100 million euros out of its fund for high-tech and transport projects . construction could be postponed the transrapid line would connect the bavarian capital with its airport , just under 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- away .
it would reduce the travel time from 40 to 10 minutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china operates the only commercial transrapid connection in the world once agreement has been reached on financing , the railway authorities could authorize construction at the end of 2007 at the earliest , die welt said .
but opponents have already announced they will seek to block the project at the federal administrative court in leipzig . there has been much debate in germany about a suitable location to build a line since the 1990s .
the world 's only commercial transrapid line operates in china between shanghai and its airport .
a connection in germany would be operated by deutsche bahn , the paper said . the transrapid , which floats on a magnetic cushion instead of riding on tracks , was developed by a joint venture between german industrial giants siemens and thyssenkrupp .
it can reach top speeds of 450 kilometers per hour . article based on news reports -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not everybody , it seems , enjoyed seeing richard wagner dancing in his underwear . germany 's annual bayreuth festival of wagner operas began on wednesday with a highly anticipated , make-or-break production by the 29-year-old great-granddaughter of the composer richard wagner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an opera buff who also happens to be close to the people : angela merkel and while the applause after the first two acts of wagner 's only " comic " opera was friendly , the audience - which included a smorgasbord of german political and social elite - was less amused by the third and final act , which featured a few minutes of full frontal nudity , a bizarre sight of richard wagner dancing in his underwear and a bunch of master singers horsing around the stage with oversized penises .
when , at the end of the marathon seven-hour performance , which included 2 one-hour breaks , visibly nervous katharina wagner took to the stage , she was greeted with boos , hisses , jeers and whistles as well as bravos and cries of approval .
the bayreuth audience proved itself to be worthy of the music genre : dramatic , passionate and self-involved to the point of absurdity .
a red-carpet affair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a family business : katharina wagner with father wolfgang and mother gudrun camera teams and hundreds of onlookers were outside the 19th century festival theater to see katharina in a backless frock arrive to the opening with her father wolfgang wagner , the famous composer 's 87-year-old grandson .
other prominent guests included german chancellor angela merkel , eu commission president jose manuel barroso and a host of german and european glitterati such as bavarian aristocrat gloria von thurn und taxis , germany 's most famous tv showmaster thomas gottschalk and old-time crooner roberto blanco , who has demonstrated a remarkable talent at being frequently resurrected from oblivion .
katharina wagner , who hopes to be appointed festival director in succession to her father wolfgang , who 's been in charge of the festival since 1951 , told reporters that last-minute rehearsals were needed because of " technical problems . "
new ideas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : princess gloria von thurn und taxis with her daughters in an interview published on wednesday , wagner said new ideas were vital to keep the festival young at heart .
she told the german daily süddeutsche zeitung that the festival had to claw back from the opera houses its avant-garde role in wagner interpretation .
" my concern is not to just preserve but to develop something new as well , " she said .
" bayreuth can dare to experiment , " she said , pointing to past engagements of two of the shock directors of german theater , the late heiner müller in 1993 for " tristan and isolde " and christoph schlingensief in 2004 for " parsifal . "
a family saga katharina wagner - the youngest-ever director and the first woman ever to have been entrusted with staging an opera at the festival established by her great-grandfather 131 years ago - is , whether she likes to admit it or not , in the midst of an ongoing family feud .
bildunterschrift : a scene from the opera in what seems like a cross-over between a soap-opera and a royal-family intrigue , the wagners have been fighting over who will take over the festival management business for years .
the bayreuth board can hire anyone to run the public-funded festival , but the job is unique among german public appointments in always having been held by the wagner family .
after failing to establish his second wife gudrun as his successor , wolfgang wagner has put all his weight behind daughter katharina .
but katharina 's rival cousins eva wagner-pasquier and nike wagner , both 62 , also lay claim to the bayreuth throne .
eva is wolfgang 's daughter by his first marriage , while nike is the daughter of wolfgang 's brother wieland , who died in 1966 .
in the absence of a real royal family , the wagners are a god-given gift to those germans who like to combine their interests in high culture with society gossip .
a modern interpretation in a production that - perhaps to the shock of the hard-core , ultra-conservative wagnerites - did not feature a medieval town square and a cast that could be easily convinced to perform a dark , dogma-style , version of snow white and the seven dwarfs - katharina wagner decided to put her foot down in bayreuth as a modernizer par excellence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayreuth is the place to be seen : tv showman thomas gottschalk with his wife thea so she had sneakers raining from the sky .
even more importantly , however , while treating the opera as a kind of discourse on tradition and progress in art , she showed no particular respect for the actual plot .
in wagner 's original , walther von stolzing , a young knight , falls in love with the daughter of a rich nuremberg burgher and tries to win her heart by entering a singing contest - a medieval precursor to american idol and german superstar .
at first he is rejected by the master singers - the simon cowels and paula abduls of his time - for breaking all of their traditional rules .
eventually , however , his natural talent wins them over .
in essence , it 's a boy-gets-girl-by-showing-he-can-sing kind of story .
in katharina wagner 's staging , the hero is actually a wimp : a rebel who - in order to win the contest - becomes a conformist and emulator of his masters .
in modern speak : a hard-rocker , who in the american idol final , decides to sing a whitney houston ballad .
mixed reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reviews are yet to come in audience reactions to the unconventional production and critical response it receives could be decisive for wagner , either spoiling or boosting her ambitions .
achim barth , from frankfurt , dismissed the production as unnecessarily gimmicky .
" it 's runs completely contrary to the text , " barth said .
" it 's just nonsense .
modern for the sake of being modern . "
leading german daily newspapers were not due to publish reviews till friday but other media were quicker .
a reviewer for the web site of the weekly magazine der spiegel , for instance , compared the " overly intellectual " staging to a pizza : too many ingredients on a very thin base . no pressure wagner said she did not feel under any time pressure , since the post of festival director replacing her father , 87 , had not yet been advertised .
this year , the festival , which runs until aug .
28 , will also feature " the ring of the nibelung , " " tannhäuser " and re-runs of schlingensief 's " parsifal . "

new ideas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : princess gloria von thurn und taxis with her daughters in an interview published on wednesday , wagner said new ideas were vital to keep the festival young at heart .
she told the german daily süddeutsche zeitung that the festival had to claw back from the opera houses its avant-garde role in wagner interpretation .
" my concern is not to just preserve but to develop something new as well , " she said .
" bayreuth can dare to experiment , " she said , pointing to past engagements of two of the shock directors of german theater , the late heiner müller in 1993 for " tristan and isolde " and christoph schlingensief in 2004 for " parsifal . "
a family saga katharina wagner - the youngest-ever director and the first woman ever to have been entrusted with staging an opera at the festival established by her great-grandfather 131 years ago - is , whether she likes to admit it or not , in the midst of an ongoing family feud .
bildunterschrift : a scene from the opera in what seems like a cross-over between a soap-opera and a royal-family intrigue , the wagners have been fighting over who will take over the festival management business for years .
the bayreuth board can hire anyone to run the public-funded festival , but the job is unique among german public appointments in always having been held by the wagner family .
after failing to establish his second wife gudrun as his successor , wolfgang wagner has put all his weight behind daughter katharina .
but katharina 's rival cousins eva wagner-pasquier and nike wagner , both 62 , also lay claim to the bayreuth throne .
eva is wolfgang 's daughter by his first marriage , while nike is the daughter of wolfgang 's brother wieland , who died in 1966 .
in the absence of a real royal family , the wagners are a god-given gift to those germans who like to combine their interests in high culture with society gossip .
a modern interpretation in a production that - perhaps to the shock of the hard-core , ultra-conservative wagnerites - did not feature a medieval town square and a cast that could be easily convinced to perform a dark , dogma-style , version of snow white and the seven dwarfs - katharina wagner decided to put her foot down in bayreuth as a modernizer par excellence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayreuth is the place to be seen : tv showman thomas gottschalk with his wife thea so she had sneakers raining from the sky .
even more importantly , however , while treating the opera as a kind of discourse on tradition and progress in art , she showed no particular respect for the actual plot .
in wagner 's original , walther von stolzing , a young knight , falls in love with the daughter of a rich nuremberg burgher and tries to win her heart by entering a singing contest - a medieval precursor to american idol and german superstar .
at first he is rejected by the master singers - the simon cowels and paula abduls of his time - for breaking all of their traditional rules .
eventually , however , his natural talent wins them over .
in essence , it 's a boy-gets-girl-by-showing-he-can-sing kind of story .
in katharina wagner 's staging , the hero is actually a wimp : a rebel who - in order to win the contest - becomes a conformist and emulator of his masters .
in modern speak : a hard-rocker , who in the american idol final , decides to sing a whitney houston ballad .
mixed reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reviews are yet to come in audience reactions to the unconventional production and critical response it receives could be decisive for wagner , either spoiling or boosting her ambitions .
achim barth , from frankfurt , dismissed the production as unnecessarily gimmicky .
" it 's runs completely contrary to the text , " barth said .
" it 's just nonsense .
modern for the sake of being modern . "
leading german daily newspapers were not due to publish reviews till friday but other media were quicker .
a reviewer for the web site of the weekly magazine der spiegel , for instance , compared the " overly intellectual " staging to a pizza : too many ingredients on a very thin base . no pressure wagner said she did not feel under any time pressure , since the post of festival director replacing her father , 87 , had not yet been advertised .

a german media report said the government no longer questioned the project .
now , just the financial details need to be clarified . the german government reportedly no longer wants to block a high-speed train connection between munich 's city center and its airport .
according to thursday 's edition of the daily die welt , german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee and bavaria 's economics minister erwin huber will meet at the end of august to clarify the financing of the project . " as soon as we 've reached agreement on the financing , we want to wind up the project quickly , " the paper quoted sources at the federal transport ministry . it is expected to cost at least 1.85 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.54 billion -rrb- . the high-speed magnetic levitation -lrb- " maglev " -rrb- train project had been called into question after a crash on a test track last year killed 23 people and injured 10 . eu funding could support transrapid the project 's financing is , however , a major hurdle .
the federal government has already earmarked 550 million euros in its budget for it .
bavaria would provide some 300 million euros and german railway deutsche bahn 185 million euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the transrapid crash in 2006 caused the first fatalities on a maglev train tiefensee has said that the federal government was only prepared to foot half of the bill .
according to transport experts , this left a financing gap of 350 million euros . bavaria 's premier edmund stoiber has therefore appealed to the european union for subsidies .
european commission president jose manuel barroso , who is currently on a three-day-visist to bavaria , has agreed to examine the request .
bavaria hopes the eu could provide at least 100 million euros out of its fund for high-tech and transport projects . construction could be postponed the transrapid line would connect the bavarian capital with its airport , just under 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- away .
it would reduce the travel time from 40 to 10 minutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china operates the only commercial transrapid connection in the world once agreement has been reached on financing , the railway authorities could authorize construction at the end of 2007 at the earliest , die welt said .
but opponents have already announced they will seek to block the project at the federal administrative court in leipzig . there has been much debate in germany about a suitable location to build a line since the 1990s .

the rabobank team has kicked michael rasmussen out , as more doping-related scandals tarnished the famous race 's reputation . the rabobank team will continue the tour de france on thursday , one day after suspending leader michael rasmussen .
the 33-year-old dane allegedly lied about his whereabouts , apparently to avoid out-of-competition doping tests . " on several occasions , he claimed he was training , and that was a lie , " said rabobank team director theo de rooy .
" team management was warned several times and had received new information on wednesday . " rasmussen was a controversial figure on the tour after he was kicked off the danish national cycling team for having missed two out-of-competition doping tests earlier in the year .

" if the organizers really want to save cycling , they should stop the competition and declare a pause of a few years , enough time to treat these athletes-turned-druggies . " cofidis team quits rasmussen 's departure is the latest blow to the tour 's credibility , and the third doping bombshell to shake the race in two days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pre-race favorite alexander vinokourov also tested positive for doping on wednesday , just hours before the rasmussen announcement , france 's number one team cofidis pulled out of the race .

" people here in germany and in the european union have some reservations about the us and climate protection because the country refused to endorse the kyoto protocol and therefore limit co2 emissions , " said mojib latif of the leibniz institute of marine sciences at kiel university in germany . germany on track bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could fuel for the future come from a us-eu partnership ?
" germany , on the other hand , has cut its emissions since 1990 by about 20 percent and is basically on kyoto track , " said latif , a scientist who has written on the influence of human activity on climate change and has worked extensively in the us . but it 's not just in germany and the rest of the eu that america 's environmental reputation has taken a beating .
a 37-nation survey published in june as part of the " global attitudes project " of the washington-based pew center showed that there is a " general increase in the percentage of people citing pollution and environmental problems as a top global threat . " rich morin , one of the authors of the study , said that : " in 34 of the 37 countries we surveyed , the united states was named by a majority or large plurality as the country that has done the most to damage the world 's air , water and natural spaces . " morin added that : " it is telling that fully a third of americans agree that we do the most damage - a degree of candor not usually found in americans . " but when looking for ways to minimize the damage done , it may not be washington , however , to which people turn , but the golden state of california , which could brighten the us 's blemished appearance .

andreas schleicher , a coordinator of pisa , the oecd 's program for international student assessment which compares educational achievement in different countries , said the training of teachers in particular needed to be radically revamped .
in germany , there 's an attempt by " teachers who have been trained in the 20th century to teach children of the 21st century in a school system that was conceived in the 19th century , " schleicher said .
he added that school teachers sorely needed a more hands-on training approach .
germany still reeling under pisa shock the criticism is not new .
in recent years , germany 's education system has taken a severe battering after a string of pisa study results showed the country 's exalted schools to be trailing internationally .
in 2001 , germany ranked only 21st in reading skills and 20th in math and science among 31 countries assessed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munoz , right , with german education minister annette schavan in march this year , the country was dealt another blow when un special education envoy vernor munoz - amid protests by germany 's federal education ministers - published a damning report saying the class-based three-tier school system was selective , discriminatory and undemocratic by shutting out children from immigrant and poorer backgrounds .
in no other industrialized nation was school success so strongly linked to the social origin of its students , munoz said in the report .
he urged germany to rethink its school structure .
whereas most other european countries have moved on to more inclusive school systems , germany has essentially stuck to a three-tier structure which means that children are only 10 -lrb- or 12 in berlin -rrb- when their high school is chosen .
for nearly half of foreign students , it 's the hauptschule which prepares them for low-skilled jobs .
only 14 percent go to a pre-university gymnasium , compared with a national average of a third .
the drop-out rate for children of immigrant backgrounds is three times the national average .
only at the grundschule , or elementary school , are pupils from all ability groups taught together .
experts urge government to wake up to reality though the shock caused by the international studies has triggered some reform activity in german schools , critics say it 's all taking place within the existing system .

demmer urged german president horst köhler to step in and ignite a national debate on munoz 's reform proposals .
she also demanded that the human right to education be anchored both in germany 's basic law and in state constitutions .

the channel said it wanted to make itself more attractive for younger viewers .
yodeling singers in dirndls and lederhosen apparently just were n't doing the trick . a recent poll showed that in the first six months of 2007 , zdf only held a market share of 6.6 percent in the 14-to-49 year-old range - one of the worst results in the station 's history . according to media reports , the lobby group for the german-speaking popular music industry " arbeitsgemeinschaft deutscher schlager und volksmusik " -lrb- ads -rrb- is now contemplating legal action against zdf . exclusion violates anti-discrimination laws manfred knöpke , head of ads , said the group criticized zdf 's justification of wanting to make the channel younger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is n't hip enough for young viewers " this means older people are being excluded , " knöpke said in interviews with various german papers .
" in our opinion , this violates the anti-discrimination law . "
ads has now ordered a legal expert analysis whether a lawsuit against zdf would be viable . " if the stations take volksmusik shows out of their programs because the viewers are too old , then several parts of the population are being shut out , " he said . ads has gotten support from trude unruh , head of the senior citizens ' activist group gray panthers . " this is an insult to everyone who rebuilt germany after the war , " unruh told the mass circulation paper bild am sonntag . senior citizens should n't be underestimated as consumers according to knöpke , zdf 's program policies were not forward-looking .
he said many sectors had recognized that it was n't the 14-to-49 year-olds that were the most interesting target group , but rather those over 50 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heino is one of germany 's most popular volksmusik singers " the industry is just beginning to discover the growing group of senior citizens as consumers , " he said . whether zdf 's new policies will attract younger viewers remained to be seen .
according to knöpke , when it came to music , young people would stick to mtv and viva anyway . zdf is reportedly unperturbed by the uproar .
it said no one had a right to a specific type of music on television . some media have also questioned ads ' motivations .

"
public broadcaster zdf is cancelling the folk music program and older fans are up in arms . " lustige musikanten " or " the merry musicians " is one of many folk music programs on german television .
hosted by marianne and michael - the dream couple of volksmusik - the show , however , takes its final curtain call on thursday night . public broadcaster zdf said it was not renewing the respective contracts due to planned program reforms for 2008 .
the channel said it wanted to make itself more attractive for younger viewers .

andreas schleicher , a coordinator of pisa , the oecd 's program for international student assessment which compares educational achievement in different countries , said the training of teachers in particular needed to be radically revamped .
in germany , there 's an attempt by " teachers who have been trained in the 20th century to teach children of the 21st century in a school system that was conceived in the 19th century , " schleicher said .
he added that school teachers sorely needed a more hands-on training approach .
germany still reeling under pisa shock the criticism is not new .
in recent years , germany 's education system has taken a severe battering after a string of pisa study results showed the country 's exalted schools to be trailing internationally .
in 2001 , germany ranked only 21st in reading skills and 20th in math and science among 31 countries assessed .

in no other industrialized nation was school success so strongly linked to the social origin of its students , munoz said in the report .
he urged germany to rethink its school structure .
whereas most other european countries have moved on to more inclusive school systems , germany has essentially stuck to a three-tier structure which means that children are only 10 -lrb- or 12 in berlin -rrb- when their high school is chosen .
for nearly half of foreign students , it 's the hauptschule which prepares them for low-skilled jobs .
only 14 percent go to a pre-university gymnasium , compared with a national average of a third .
the drop-out rate for children of immigrant backgrounds is three times the national average .
only at the grundschule , or elementary school , are pupils from all ability groups taught together .
experts urge government to wake up to reality though the shock caused by the international studies has triggered some reform activity in german schools , critics say it 's all taking place within the existing system .

andreas schleicher , a coordinator of pisa , the oecd 's program for international student assessment which compares educational achievement in different countries , said the training of teachers in particular needed to be radically revamped .
in germany , there 's an attempt by " teachers who have been trained in the 20th century to teach children of the 21st century in a school system that was conceived in the 19th century , " schleicher said .
he added that school teachers sorely needed a more hands-on training approach .
germany still reeling under pisa shock the criticism is not new .
in recent years , germany 's education system has taken a severe battering after a string of pisa study results showed the country 's exalted schools to be trailing internationally .
in 2001 , germany ranked only 21st in reading skills and 20th in math and science among 31 countries assessed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munoz , right , with german education minister annette schavan in march this year , the country was dealt another blow when un special education envoy vernor munoz - amid protests by germany 's federal education ministers - published a damning report saying the class-based three-tier school system was selective , discriminatory and undemocratic by shutting out children from immigrant and poorer backgrounds .
in no other industrialized nation was school success so strongly linked to the social origin of its students , munoz said in the report .
he urged germany to rethink its school structure .
whereas most other european countries have moved on to more inclusive school systems , germany has essentially stuck to a three-tier structure which means that children are only 10 -lrb- or 12 in berlin -rrb- when their high school is chosen .
for nearly half of foreign students , it 's the hauptschule which prepares them for low-skilled jobs .
only 14 percent go to a pre-university gymnasium , compared with a national average of a third .
the drop-out rate for children of immigrant backgrounds is three times the national average .
only at the grundschule , or elementary school , are pupils from all ability groups taught together .
experts urge government to wake up to reality though the shock caused by the international studies has triggered some reform activity in german schools , critics say it 's all taking place within the existing system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say germany 's three-tier school structure is discriminatory at the conference in berlin , experts , including munoz , said the german government has yet to react to the un special envoy 's drastic recommendations .
marianne demmer , head of the teachers ' union , gew , said the german government and the federal states - which are responsible for education - needed to finally stop reacting to munoz 's criticism " with a mixture of hurt , aggression and arrogance . "
demmer urged german president horst köhler to step in and ignite a national debate on munoz 's reform proposals .
she also demanded that the human right to education be anchored both in germany 's basic law and in state constitutions .
critics have also slammed german federal education ministers for their refusal to participate in an international pisa study for teachers .
currently , 25 countries including denmark , italy , spain , austria and spain are participating in the survey . article based on news reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de un envoy critical of german school system un special envoy vernor munoz has concluded a 10-day visit to germany to review the country 's school system .
he said the structure of the german education system fosters inequalities .
-lrb- 22.02.2006 -rrb- controversial school language ban appears to be working two years ago , a berlin school with a large immigrant intake banned the speaking of foreign languages in the schoolyard .
the controversial idea now appears to be paying off and it 's being copied in germany and elsewhere .
-lrb- 16.06.2007 -rrb- teaching of islam in german schools gains ground german politicians often raise the issue of islam in the educational system when they discuss the integration of migrant youths .
now , there may be progress in making islam a regular course in german schools .

not everybody , it seems , enjoyed seeing richard wagner dancing in his underwear . germany 's annual bayreuth festival of wagner operas began on wednesday with a highly anticipated , make-or-break production by the 29-year-old great-granddaughter of the composer richard wagner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an opera buff who also happens to be close to the people : angela merkel and while the applause after the first two acts of wagner 's only " comic " opera was friendly , the audience - which included a smorgasbord of german political and social elite - was less amused by the third and final act , which featured a few minutes of full frontal nudity , a bizarre sight of richard wagner dancing in his underwear and a bunch of master singers horsing around the stage with oversized penises .
when , at the end of the marathon seven-hour performance , which included 2 one-hour breaks , visibly nervous katharina wagner took to the stage , she was greeted with boos , hisses , jeers and whistles as well as bravos and cries of approval .
the bayreuth audience proved itself to be worthy of the music genre : dramatic , passionate and self-involved to the point of absurdity .
a red-carpet affair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a family business : katharina wagner with father wolfgang and mother gudrun camera teams and hundreds of onlookers were outside the 19th century festival theater to see katharina in a backless frock arrive to the opening with her father wolfgang wagner , the famous composer 's 87-year-old grandson .
other prominent guests included german chancellor angela merkel , eu commission president jose manuel barroso and a host of german and european glitterati such as bavarian aristocrat gloria von thurn und taxis , germany 's most famous tv showmaster thomas gottschalk and old-time crooner roberto blanco , who has demonstrated a remarkable talent at being frequently resurrected from oblivion .
katharina wagner , who hopes to be appointed festival director in succession to her father wolfgang , who 's been in charge of the festival since 1951 , told reporters that last-minute rehearsals were needed because of " technical problems . "
new ideas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : princess gloria von thurn und taxis with her daughters in an interview published on wednesday , wagner said new ideas were vital to keep the festival young at heart .
she told the german daily süddeutsche zeitung that the festival had to claw back from the opera houses its avant-garde role in wagner interpretation .
" my concern is not to just preserve but to develop something new as well , " she said .
" bayreuth can dare to experiment , " she said , pointing to past engagements of two of the shock directors of german theater , the late heiner müller in 1993 for " tristan and isolde " and christoph schlingensief in 2004 for " parsifal . "
a family saga katharina wagner - the youngest-ever director and the first woman ever to have been entrusted with staging an opera at the festival established by her great-grandfather 131 years ago - is , whether she likes to admit it or not , in the midst of an ongoing family feud .
bildunterschrift : a scene from the opera in what seems like a cross-over between a soap-opera and a royal-family intrigue , the wagners have been fighting over who will take over the festival management business for years .
the bayreuth board can hire anyone to run the public-funded festival , but the job is unique among german public appointments in always having been held by the wagner family .
after failing to establish his second wife gudrun as his successor , wolfgang wagner has put all his weight behind daughter katharina .
but katharina 's rival cousins eva wagner-pasquier and nike wagner , both 62 , also lay claim to the bayreuth throne .
eva is wolfgang 's daughter by his first marriage , while nike is the daughter of wolfgang 's brother wieland , who died in 1966 .
in the absence of a real royal family , the wagners are a god-given gift to those germans who like to combine their interests in high culture with society gossip .
a modern interpretation in a production that - perhaps to the shock of the hard-core , ultra-conservative wagnerites - did not feature a medieval town square and a cast that could be easily convinced to perform a dark , dogma-style , version of snow white and the seven dwarfs - katharina wagner decided to put her foot down in bayreuth as a modernizer par excellence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayreuth is the place to be seen : tv showman thomas gottschalk with his wife thea so she had sneakers raining from the sky .
even more importantly , however , while treating the opera as a kind of discourse on tradition and progress in art , she showed no particular respect for the actual plot .
in wagner 's original , walther von stolzing , a young knight , falls in love with the daughter of a rich nuremberg burgher and tries to win her heart by entering a singing contest - a medieval precursor to american idol and german superstar .
at first he is rejected by the master singers - the simon cowels and paula abduls of his time - for breaking all of their traditional rules .
eventually , however , his natural talent wins them over .
in essence , it 's a boy-gets-girl-by-showing-he-can-sing kind of story .
in katharina wagner 's staging , the hero is actually a wimp : a rebel who - in order to win the contest - becomes a conformist and emulator of his masters .
in modern speak : a hard-rocker , who in the american idol final , decides to sing a whitney houston ballad .
mixed reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reviews are yet to come in audience reactions to the unconventional production and critical response it receives could be decisive for wagner , either spoiling or boosting her ambitions .
achim barth , from frankfurt , dismissed the production as unnecessarily gimmicky .
" it 's runs completely contrary to the text , " barth said .
" it 's just nonsense .
modern for the sake of being modern . "
leading german daily newspapers were not due to publish reviews till friday but other media were quicker .
a reviewer for the web site of the weekly magazine der spiegel , for instance , compared the " overly intellectual " staging to a pizza : too many ingredients on a very thin base . no pressure wagner said she did not feel under any time pressure , since the post of festival director replacing her father , 87 , had not yet been advertised .
this year , the festival , which runs until aug .
28 , will also feature " the ring of the nibelung , " " tannhäuser " and re-runs of schlingensief 's " parsifal . "

" my concern is not to just preserve but to develop something new as well , " she said .
" bayreuth can dare to experiment , " she said , pointing to past engagements of two of the shock directors of german theater , the late heiner müller in 1993 for " tristan and isolde " and christoph schlingensief in 2004 for " parsifal . "
a family saga katharina wagner - the youngest-ever director and the first woman ever to have been entrusted with staging an opera at the festival established by her great-grandfather 131 years ago - is , whether she likes to admit it or not , in the midst of an ongoing family feud .
bildunterschrift : a scene from the opera in what seems like a cross-over between a soap-opera and a royal-family intrigue , the wagners have been fighting over who will take over the festival management business for years .
the bayreuth board can hire anyone to run the public-funded festival , but the job is unique among german public appointments in always having been held by the wagner family .
after failing to establish his second wife gudrun as his successor , wolfgang wagner has put all his weight behind daughter katharina .
but katharina 's rival cousins eva wagner-pasquier and nike wagner , both 62 , also lay claim to the bayreuth throne .
eva is wolfgang 's daughter by his first marriage , while nike is the daughter of wolfgang 's brother wieland , who died in 1966 .
in the absence of a real royal family , the wagners are a god-given gift to those germans who like to combine their interests in high culture with society gossip .
a modern interpretation in a production that - perhaps to the shock of the hard-core , ultra-conservative wagnerites - did not feature a medieval town square and a cast that could be easily convinced to perform a dark , dogma-style , version of snow white and the seven dwarfs - katharina wagner decided to put her foot down in bayreuth as a modernizer par excellence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayreuth is the place to be seen : tv showman thomas gottschalk with his wife thea so she had sneakers raining from the sky .
even more importantly , however , while treating the opera as a kind of discourse on tradition and progress in art , she showed no particular respect for the actual plot .
in wagner 's original , walther von stolzing , a young knight , falls in love with the daughter of a rich nuremberg burgher and tries to win her heart by entering a singing contest - a medieval precursor to american idol and german superstar .
at first he is rejected by the master singers - the simon cowels and paula abduls of his time - for breaking all of their traditional rules .
eventually , however , his natural talent wins them over .
in essence , it 's a boy-gets-girl-by-showing-he-can-sing kind of story .
in katharina wagner 's staging , the hero is actually a wimp : a rebel who - in order to win the contest - becomes a conformist and emulator of his masters .
in modern speak : a hard-rocker , who in the american idol final , decides to sing a whitney houston ballad .
mixed reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reviews are yet to come in audience reactions to the unconventional production and critical response it receives could be decisive for wagner , either spoiling or boosting her ambitions .
achim barth , from frankfurt , dismissed the production as unnecessarily gimmicky .
" it 's runs completely contrary to the text , " barth said .
" it 's just nonsense .
modern for the sake of being modern . "
leading german daily newspapers were not due to publish reviews till friday but other media were quicker .
a reviewer for the web site of the weekly magazine der spiegel , for instance , compared the " overly intellectual " staging to a pizza : too many ingredients on a very thin base . no pressure wagner said she did not feel under any time pressure , since the post of festival director replacing her father , 87 , had not yet been advertised .
this year , the festival , which runs until aug .

not everybody , it seems , enjoyed seeing richard wagner dancing in his underwear . germany 's annual bayreuth festival of wagner operas began on wednesday with a highly anticipated , make-or-break production by the 29-year-old great-granddaughter of the composer richard wagner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an opera buff who also happens to be close to the people : angela merkel and while the applause after the first two acts of wagner 's only " comic " opera was friendly , the audience - which included a smorgasbord of german political and social elite - was less amused by the third and final act , which featured a few minutes of full frontal nudity , a bizarre sight of richard wagner dancing in his underwear and a bunch of master singers horsing around the stage with oversized penises .
when , at the end of the marathon seven-hour performance , which included 2 one-hour breaks , visibly nervous katharina wagner took to the stage , she was greeted with boos , hisses , jeers and whistles as well as bravos and cries of approval .
the bayreuth audience proved itself to be worthy of the music genre : dramatic , passionate and self-involved to the point of absurdity .
a red-carpet affair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a family business : katharina wagner with father wolfgang and mother gudrun camera teams and hundreds of onlookers were outside the 19th century festival theater to see katharina in a backless frock arrive to the opening with her father wolfgang wagner , the famous composer 's 87-year-old grandson .
other prominent guests included german chancellor angela merkel , eu commission president jose manuel barroso and a host of german and european glitterati such as bavarian aristocrat gloria von thurn und taxis , germany 's most famous tv showmaster thomas gottschalk and old-time crooner roberto blanco , who has demonstrated a remarkable talent at being frequently resurrected from oblivion .
katharina wagner , who hopes to be appointed festival director in succession to her father wolfgang , who 's been in charge of the festival since 1951 , told reporters that last-minute rehearsals were needed because of " technical problems . "

a german media report said the government no longer questioned the project .
now , just the financial details need to be clarified . the german government reportedly no longer wants to block a high-speed train connection between munich 's city center and its airport .
according to thursday 's edition of the daily die welt , german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee and bavaria 's economics minister erwin huber will meet at the end of august to clarify the financing of the project . " as soon as we 've reached agreement on the financing , we want to wind up the project quickly , " the paper quoted sources at the federal transport ministry . it is expected to cost at least 1.85 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.54 billion -rrb- . the high-speed magnetic levitation -lrb- " maglev " -rrb- train project had been called into question after a crash on a test track last year killed 23 people and injured 10 . eu funding could support transrapid the project 's financing is , however , a major hurdle .
the federal government has already earmarked 550 million euros in its budget for it .
bavaria would provide some 300 million euros and german railway deutsche bahn 185 million euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the transrapid crash in 2006 caused the first fatalities on a maglev train tiefensee has said that the federal government was only prepared to foot half of the bill .
according to transport experts , this left a financing gap of 350 million euros . bavaria 's premier edmund stoiber has therefore appealed to the european union for subsidies .

but the euro-zone 's biggest economy is expected to continue its upswing in the second half of the year . a survey of 7,000 german firms showed companies viewed their business operations and prospects with less optimism for the next six months than they had earlier in 2007 , according to figures released thursday by ifo , a munich-based economic research institute .
the widely-watched business climate index fell to 106.4 points in july from 107 points in june , ifo said in a statement .
that 's the lowest level since october 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer confidence has helped the german economy " the companies polled judged their current business situation as positively as last month but their business outlook for the next half year does not look quite as favorable , " ifo president hans-werner sinn said in a statement .
" -lsb- nevertheless -rsb- these results indicate the economic recovery will continue in the second half . "
it 's the third consecutive month that companies have downgraded their view of the business climate .
high oil prices , rising interest rates and a strong euro have fuelled fears that the german economy might slow after booking a 2.8 percent growth rate in 2006 . economy expected to stay strong in 2007 " we 've crossed the high point in growth and we 'll now see a slight slowdown , but nothing dramatic , " matthias rubisch , an economist at commerzbank ag in frankfurt told bloomberg news .
" the strong euro , energy prices and rising interest rates were negative influences . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tanking up is expensive the german economy will continue to grow in the upcoming months amid signs of a continuing fall in unemployment , sinn said .
german economists have projected a 2007 growth rate at or above last year 's level , but feel it might slip towards 2 percent in 2008 .
strong exports and consumer spending have helped fuel recent growth rates .
interest hike likely delayed business confidence has also recently fallen in other european countries such as italy , belgium and the netherlands .
the drop in business confidence combined with a rise in the money supply means the european central bank will likely delay an interest rate hike until late this year , analysts said .
matthias rubisch of commerzbank said the ifo backed up the bank 's forecast that the german economy will lose steam over the coming months .
" although the index remains at a very high level historically , it would be unwise to ignore the recent downward trend , " he told afp news agency .
" we still envisage strong second-half growth above the long-term average , but not at the pace of last year .
no more than average growth now seems likely in 2008 . " article based on news reports -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
public broadcaster zdf is cancelling the folk music program and older fans are up in arms . " lustige musikanten " or " the merry musicians " is one of many folk music programs on german television .
hosted by marianne and michael - the dream couple of volksmusik - the show , however , takes its final curtain call on thursday night . public broadcaster zdf said it was not renewing the respective contracts due to planned program reforms for 2008 .
the channel said it wanted to make itself more attractive for younger viewers .
yodeling singers in dirndls and lederhosen apparently just were n't doing the trick . a recent poll showed that in the first six months of 2007 , zdf only held a market share of 6.6 percent in the 14-to-49 year-old range - one of the worst results in the station 's history . according to media reports , the lobby group for the german-speaking popular music industry " arbeitsgemeinschaft deutscher schlager und volksmusik " -lrb- ads -rrb- is now contemplating legal action against zdf . exclusion violates anti-discrimination laws manfred knöpke , head of ads , said the group criticized zdf 's justification of wanting to make the channel younger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is n't hip enough for young viewers " this means older people are being excluded , " knöpke said in interviews with various german papers .
" in our opinion , this violates the anti-discrimination law . "
ads has now ordered a legal expert analysis whether a lawsuit against zdf would be viable . " if the stations take volksmusik shows out of their programs because the viewers are too old , then several parts of the population are being shut out , " he said . ads has gotten support from trude unruh , head of the senior citizens ' activist group gray panthers . " this is an insult to everyone who rebuilt germany after the war , " unruh told the mass circulation paper bild am sonntag . senior citizens should n't be underestimated as consumers according to knöpke , zdf 's program policies were not forward-looking .
he said many sectors had recognized that it was n't the 14-to-49 year-olds that were the most interesting target group , but rather those over 50 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heino is one of germany 's most popular volksmusik singers " the industry is just beginning to discover the growing group of senior citizens as consumers , " he said . whether zdf 's new policies will attract younger viewers remained to be seen .
according to knöpke , when it came to music , young people would stick to mtv and viva anyway . zdf is reportedly unperturbed by the uproar .
it said no one had a right to a specific type of music on television . some media have also questioned ads ' motivations .
the group , with some 12,000 members , represents the interests of musicians , management , record companies and other institutions which live off of volksmusik .
public television is a major source of publicity for their work . article based on news reports -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the euro-zone 's biggest economy is expected to continue its upswing in the second half of the year . a survey of 7,000 german firms showed companies viewed their business operations and prospects with less optimism for the next six months than they had earlier in 2007 , according to figures released thursday by ifo , a munich-based economic research institute .
the widely-watched business climate index fell to 106.4 points in july from 107 points in june , ifo said in a statement .
that 's the lowest level since october 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer confidence has helped the german economy " the companies polled judged their current business situation as positively as last month but their business outlook for the next half year does not look quite as favorable , " ifo president hans-werner sinn said in a statement .
" -lsb- nevertheless -rsb- these results indicate the economic recovery will continue in the second half . "
it 's the third consecutive month that companies have downgraded their view of the business climate .
high oil prices , rising interest rates and a strong euro have fuelled fears that the german economy might slow after booking a 2.8 percent growth rate in 2006 . economy expected to stay strong in 2007 " we 've crossed the high point in growth and we 'll now see a slight slowdown , but nothing dramatic , " matthias rubisch , an economist at commerzbank ag in frankfurt told bloomberg news .
" the strong euro , energy prices and rising interest rates were negative influences . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tanking up is expensive the german economy will continue to grow in the upcoming months amid signs of a continuing fall in unemployment , sinn said .
german economists have projected a 2007 growth rate at or above last year 's level , but feel it might slip towards 2 percent in 2008 .
strong exports and consumer spending have helped fuel recent growth rates .
interest hike likely delayed business confidence has also recently fallen in other european countries such as italy , belgium and the netherlands .
the drop in business confidence combined with a rise in the money supply means the european central bank will likely delay an interest rate hike until late this year , analysts said .
matthias rubisch of commerzbank said the ifo backed up the bank 's forecast that the german economy will lose steam over the coming months .
" although the index remains at a very high level historically , it would be unwise to ignore the recent downward trend , " he told afp news agency .
" we still envisage strong second-half growth above the long-term average , but not at the pace of last year .

andreas schleicher , a coordinator of pisa , the oecd 's program for international student assessment which compares educational achievement in different countries , said the training of teachers in particular needed to be radically revamped .
in germany , there 's an attempt by " teachers who have been trained in the 20th century to teach children of the 21st century in a school system that was conceived in the 19th century , " schleicher said .
he added that school teachers sorely needed a more hands-on training approach .
germany still reeling under pisa shock the criticism is not new .
in recent years , germany 's education system has taken a severe battering after a string of pisa study results showed the country 's exalted schools to be trailing internationally .
in 2001 , germany ranked only 21st in reading skills and 20th in math and science among 31 countries assessed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munoz , right , with german education minister annette schavan in march this year , the country was dealt another blow when un special education envoy vernor munoz - amid protests by germany 's federal education ministers - published a damning report saying the class-based three-tier school system was selective , discriminatory and undemocratic by shutting out children from immigrant and poorer backgrounds .
in no other industrialized nation was school success so strongly linked to the social origin of its students , munoz said in the report .
he urged germany to rethink its school structure .
whereas most other european countries have moved on to more inclusive school systems , germany has essentially stuck to a three-tier structure which means that children are only 10 -lrb- or 12 in berlin -rrb- when their high school is chosen .
for nearly half of foreign students , it 's the hauptschule which prepares them for low-skilled jobs .
only 14 percent go to a pre-university gymnasium , compared with a national average of a third .
the drop-out rate for children of immigrant backgrounds is three times the national average .
only at the grundschule , or elementary school , are pupils from all ability groups taught together .
experts urge government to wake up to reality though the shock caused by the international studies has triggered some reform activity in german schools , critics say it 's all taking place within the existing system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say germany 's three-tier school structure is discriminatory at the conference in berlin , experts , including munoz , said the german government has yet to react to the un special envoy 's drastic recommendations .
marianne demmer , head of the teachers ' union , gew , said the german government and the federal states - which are responsible for education - needed to finally stop reacting to munoz 's criticism " with a mixture of hurt , aggression and arrogance . "
demmer urged german president horst köhler to step in and ignite a national debate on munoz 's reform proposals .
she also demanded that the human right to education be anchored both in germany 's basic law and in state constitutions .
critics have also slammed german federal education ministers for their refusal to participate in an international pisa study for teachers .
currently , 25 countries including denmark , italy , spain , austria and spain are participating in the survey . article based on news reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" people here in germany and in the european union have some reservations about the us and climate protection because the country refused to endorse the kyoto protocol and therefore limit co2 emissions , " said mojib latif of the leibniz institute of marine sciences at kiel university in germany . germany on track bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could fuel for the future come from a us-eu partnership ?
" germany , on the other hand , has cut its emissions since 1990 by about 20 percent and is basically on kyoto track , " said latif , a scientist who has written on the influence of human activity on climate change and has worked extensively in the us . but it 's not just in germany and the rest of the eu that america 's environmental reputation has taken a beating .
a 37-nation survey published in june as part of the " global attitudes project " of the washington-based pew center showed that there is a " general increase in the percentage of people citing pollution and environmental problems as a top global threat . " rich morin , one of the authors of the study , said that : " in 34 of the 37 countries we surveyed , the united states was named by a majority or large plurality as the country that has done the most to damage the world 's air , water and natural spaces . " morin added that : " it is telling that fully a third of americans agree that we do the most damage - a degree of candor not usually found in americans . " but when looking for ways to minimize the damage done , it may not be washington , however , to which people turn , but the golden state of california , which could brighten the us 's blemished appearance .
light at the end of the tunnel ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar energy is gaining up adherents in the usa california governor arnold schwarzenegger made headlines around the world when he signed a bill to commit california to cutting its co2 emissions , which are blamed for global warming , by 25 percent by 2020 . as the california-based website green-technology.org wrote , " governor schwarzenegger has asked the state to ' lead by example , ' demonstrating that sustainability is achievable , desirable and economically sensible . " " green " businesses and web sites are cropping up in the state as a result .
while " merely " a us state -lrb- though the country 's most populated -rrb- , it ranks among the world 's 10 largest economies . according to the center for the continuing study of the california economy , the golden state 's gross domestic product in 2006 reached slightly more than $ 1.7 trillion -lrb- 1.2 trillion euros -rrb- . while california is often viewed as " way out there " - geographically and psychologically - by americans in many other parts of the us , the hope is that " green " ideas will trickle into the plans instituted in other us states . environmental alarms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flooding in great britain is one of the latest environmental disasters experts said a number of factors have come together to focus americans ' attention on the climate .
in addition to an earnest wish to save the planet , climate change has been a central topic in the media and extreme weather has prompted a feeling among many that change is necessary . then again , it could just be the power of the buck as " going green " could make good business sense . " green " business practices are becoming so popular , that us colleges and universities are beginning to offer sustainability or " green " masters of business administration -lrb- mba -rrb- programs , and companies , including even wal-mart stores inc . , are analyzing ways to increase profits by cutting down on waste and lowering energy costs . " it 's important that you make money when trying to help the environment , " said latif .
" once people , not just in the us , but everywhere , realize that this is really a big market , things will change and the climate will benefit . " all that wind and sunshine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german solar cells are particularly adept at absorbing the sun 's rays the scientist added that he sees money is to be made in renewable energies such as solar , geo-thermal , wind and water , all of which are abundantly available in california .
germans respect the us 's ability to forge territory when it comes to research and development .
" the first step has been that the us has recognized the climate problem , " he said .
" now , the task is finding ways for europe and the us to work together in developing better technology , which the us is so good at anyway . " furthermore , morin said that the pew study showed that environmental problems were one of the few threats in which people said their own country should take the lead dealing with the issue . " this signals great impatience on the part of people everywhere to do something on this issue , " he said .

" germany , on the other hand , has cut its emissions since 1990 by about 20 percent and is basically on kyoto track , " said latif , a scientist who has written on the influence of human activity on climate change and has worked extensively in the us . but it 's not just in germany and the rest of the eu that america 's environmental reputation has taken a beating .
a 37-nation survey published in june as part of the " global attitudes project " of the washington-based pew center showed that there is a " general increase in the percentage of people citing pollution and environmental problems as a top global threat . " rich morin , one of the authors of the study , said that : " in 34 of the 37 countries we surveyed , the united states was named by a majority or large plurality as the country that has done the most to damage the world 's air , water and natural spaces . " morin added that : " it is telling that fully a third of americans agree that we do the most damage - a degree of candor not usually found in americans . " but when looking for ways to minimize the damage done , it may not be washington , however , to which people turn , but the golden state of california , which could brighten the us 's blemished appearance .
light at the end of the tunnel ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar energy is gaining up adherents in the usa california governor arnold schwarzenegger made headlines around the world when he signed a bill to commit california to cutting its co2 emissions , which are blamed for global warming , by 25 percent by 2020 . as the california-based website green-technology.org wrote , " governor schwarzenegger has asked the state to ' lead by example , ' demonstrating that sustainability is achievable , desirable and economically sensible . " " green " businesses and web sites are cropping up in the state as a result .
while " merely " a us state -lrb- though the country 's most populated -rrb- , it ranks among the world 's 10 largest economies . according to the center for the continuing study of the california economy , the golden state 's gross domestic product in 2006 reached slightly more than $ 1.7 trillion -lrb- 1.2 trillion euros -rrb- . while california is often viewed as " way out there " - geographically and psychologically - by americans in many other parts of the us , the hope is that " green " ideas will trickle into the plans instituted in other us states . environmental alarms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flooding in great britain is one of the latest environmental disasters experts said a number of factors have come together to focus americans ' attention on the climate .
in addition to an earnest wish to save the planet , climate change has been a central topic in the media and extreme weather has prompted a feeling among many that change is necessary . then again , it could just be the power of the buck as " going green " could make good business sense . " green " business practices are becoming so popular , that us colleges and universities are beginning to offer sustainability or " green " masters of business administration -lrb- mba -rrb- programs , and companies , including even wal-mart stores inc . , are analyzing ways to increase profits by cutting down on waste and lowering energy costs . " it 's important that you make money when trying to help the environment , " said latif .
" once people , not just in the us , but everywhere , realize that this is really a big market , things will change and the climate will benefit . " all that wind and sunshine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german solar cells are particularly adept at absorbing the sun 's rays the scientist added that he sees money is to be made in renewable energies such as solar , geo-thermal , wind and water , all of which are abundantly available in california .
germans respect the us 's ability to forge territory when it comes to research and development .
" the first step has been that the us has recognized the climate problem , " he said .
" now , the task is finding ways for europe and the us to work together in developing better technology , which the us is so good at anyway . " furthermore , morin said that the pew study showed that environmental problems were one of the few threats in which people said their own country should take the lead dealing with the issue . " this signals great impatience on the part of people everywhere to do something on this issue , " he said .

not everybody , it seems , enjoyed seeing richard wagner dancing in his underwear . germany 's annual bayreuth festival of wagner operas began on wednesday with a highly anticipated , make-or-break production by the 29-year-old great-granddaughter of the composer richard wagner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an opera buff who also happens to be close to the people : angela merkel and while the applause after the first two acts of wagner 's only " comic " opera was friendly , the audience - which included a smorgasbord of german political and social elite - was less amused by the third and final act , which featured a few minutes of full frontal nudity , a bizarre sight of richard wagner dancing in his underwear and a bunch of master singers horsing around the stage with oversized penises .
when , at the end of the marathon seven-hour performance , which included 2 one-hour breaks , visibly nervous katharina wagner took to the stage , she was greeted with boos , hisses , jeers and whistles as well as bravos and cries of approval .
the bayreuth audience proved itself to be worthy of the music genre : dramatic , passionate and self-involved to the point of absurdity .
a red-carpet affair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a family business : katharina wagner with father wolfgang and mother gudrun camera teams and hundreds of onlookers were outside the 19th century festival theater to see katharina in a backless frock arrive to the opening with her father wolfgang wagner , the famous composer 's 87-year-old grandson .
other prominent guests included german chancellor angela merkel , eu commission president jose manuel barroso and a host of german and european glitterati such as bavarian aristocrat gloria von thurn und taxis , germany 's most famous tv showmaster thomas gottschalk and old-time crooner roberto blanco , who has demonstrated a remarkable talent at being frequently resurrected from oblivion .
katharina wagner , who hopes to be appointed festival director in succession to her father wolfgang , who 's been in charge of the festival since 1951 , told reporters that last-minute rehearsals were needed because of " technical problems . "
new ideas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : princess gloria von thurn und taxis with her daughters in an interview published on wednesday , wagner said new ideas were vital to keep the festival young at heart .
she told the german daily süddeutsche zeitung that the festival had to claw back from the opera houses its avant-garde role in wagner interpretation .
" my concern is not to just preserve but to develop something new as well , " she said .
" bayreuth can dare to experiment , " she said , pointing to past engagements of two of the shock directors of german theater , the late heiner müller in 1993 for " tristan and isolde " and christoph schlingensief in 2004 for " parsifal . "
a family saga katharina wagner - the youngest-ever director and the first woman ever to have been entrusted with staging an opera at the festival established by her great-grandfather 131 years ago - is , whether she likes to admit it or not , in the midst of an ongoing family feud .
bildunterschrift : a scene from the opera in what seems like a cross-over between a soap-opera and a royal-family intrigue , the wagners have been fighting over who will take over the festival management business for years .
the bayreuth board can hire anyone to run the public-funded festival , but the job is unique among german public appointments in always having been held by the wagner family .
after failing to establish his second wife gudrun as his successor , wolfgang wagner has put all his weight behind daughter katharina .
but katharina 's rival cousins eva wagner-pasquier and nike wagner , both 62 , also lay claim to the bayreuth throne .
eva is wolfgang 's daughter by his first marriage , while nike is the daughter of wolfgang 's brother wieland , who died in 1966 .
in the absence of a real royal family , the wagners are a god-given gift to those germans who like to combine their interests in high culture with society gossip .
a modern interpretation in a production that - perhaps to the shock of the hard-core , ultra-conservative wagnerites - did not feature a medieval town square and a cast that could be easily convinced to perform a dark , dogma-style , version of snow white and the seven dwarfs - katharina wagner decided to put her foot down in bayreuth as a modernizer par excellence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayreuth is the place to be seen : tv showman thomas gottschalk with his wife thea so she had sneakers raining from the sky .
even more importantly , however , while treating the opera as a kind of discourse on tradition and progress in art , she showed no particular respect for the actual plot .
in wagner 's original , walther von stolzing , a young knight , falls in love with the daughter of a rich nuremberg burgher and tries to win her heart by entering a singing contest - a medieval precursor to american idol and german superstar .
at first he is rejected by the master singers - the simon cowels and paula abduls of his time - for breaking all of their traditional rules .
eventually , however , his natural talent wins them over .
in essence , it 's a boy-gets-girl-by-showing-he-can-sing kind of story .
in katharina wagner 's staging , the hero is actually a wimp : a rebel who - in order to win the contest - becomes a conformist and emulator of his masters .
in modern speak : a hard-rocker , who in the american idol final , decides to sing a whitney houston ballad .
mixed reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reviews are yet to come in audience reactions to the unconventional production and critical response it receives could be decisive for wagner , either spoiling or boosting her ambitions .
achim barth , from frankfurt , dismissed the production as unnecessarily gimmicky .
" it 's runs completely contrary to the text , " barth said .
" it 's just nonsense .
modern for the sake of being modern . "
leading german daily newspapers were not due to publish reviews till friday but other media were quicker .
a reviewer for the web site of the weekly magazine der spiegel , for instance , compared the " overly intellectual " staging to a pizza : too many ingredients on a very thin base . no pressure wagner said she did not feel under any time pressure , since the post of festival director replacing her father , 87 , had not yet been advertised .
this year , the festival , which runs until aug .
28 , will also feature " the ring of the nibelung , " " tannhäuser " and re-runs of schlingensief 's " parsifal . "
all 54,000 available tickets to the 30 performances have been sold out .
organizers received 460,500 applications and preferred applicants , who had been applying for eight years or more . article based on news reports -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

andreas schleicher , a coordinator of pisa , the oecd 's program for international student assessment which compares educational achievement in different countries , said the training of teachers in particular needed to be radically revamped .
in germany , there 's an attempt by " teachers who have been trained in the 20th century to teach children of the 21st century in a school system that was conceived in the 19th century , " schleicher said .
he added that school teachers sorely needed a more hands-on training approach .
germany still reeling under pisa shock the criticism is not new .
in recent years , germany 's education system has taken a severe battering after a string of pisa study results showed the country 's exalted schools to be trailing internationally .
in 2001 , germany ranked only 21st in reading skills and 20th in math and science among 31 countries assessed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munoz , right , with german education minister annette schavan in march this year , the country was dealt another blow when un special education envoy vernor munoz - amid protests by germany 's federal education ministers - published a damning report saying the class-based three-tier school system was selective , discriminatory and undemocratic by shutting out children from immigrant and poorer backgrounds .
in no other industrialized nation was school success so strongly linked to the social origin of its students , munoz said in the report .
he urged germany to rethink its school structure .
whereas most other european countries have moved on to more inclusive school systems , germany has essentially stuck to a three-tier structure which means that children are only 10 -lrb- or 12 in berlin -rrb- when their high school is chosen .
for nearly half of foreign students , it 's the hauptschule which prepares them for low-skilled jobs .
only 14 percent go to a pre-university gymnasium , compared with a national average of a third .
the drop-out rate for children of immigrant backgrounds is three times the national average .
only at the grundschule , or elementary school , are pupils from all ability groups taught together .
experts urge government to wake up to reality though the shock caused by the international studies has triggered some reform activity in german schools , critics say it 's all taking place within the existing system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say germany 's three-tier school structure is discriminatory at the conference in berlin , experts , including munoz , said the german government has yet to react to the un special envoy 's drastic recommendations .
marianne demmer , head of the teachers ' union , gew , said the german government and the federal states - which are responsible for education - needed to finally stop reacting to munoz 's criticism " with a mixture of hurt , aggression and arrogance . "
demmer urged german president horst köhler to step in and ignite a national debate on munoz 's reform proposals .
she also demanded that the human right to education be anchored both in germany 's basic law and in state constitutions .
critics have also slammed german federal education ministers for their refusal to participate in an international pisa study for teachers .

a german media report said the government no longer questioned the project .
now , just the financial details need to be clarified . the german government reportedly no longer wants to block a high-speed train connection between munich 's city center and its airport .
according to thursday 's edition of the daily die welt , german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee and bavaria 's economics minister erwin huber will meet at the end of august to clarify the financing of the project . " as soon as we 've reached agreement on the financing , we want to wind up the project quickly , " the paper quoted sources at the federal transport ministry . it is expected to cost at least 1.85 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.54 billion -rrb- . the high-speed magnetic levitation -lrb- " maglev " -rrb- train project had been called into question after a crash on a test track last year killed 23 people and injured 10 . eu funding could support transrapid the project 's financing is , however , a major hurdle .
the federal government has already earmarked 550 million euros in its budget for it .
bavaria would provide some 300 million euros and german railway deutsche bahn 185 million euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the transrapid crash in 2006 caused the first fatalities on a maglev train tiefensee has said that the federal government was only prepared to foot half of the bill .
according to transport experts , this left a financing gap of 350 million euros . bavaria 's premier edmund stoiber has therefore appealed to the european union for subsidies .
european commission president jose manuel barroso , who is currently on a three-day-visist to bavaria , has agreed to examine the request .
bavaria hopes the eu could provide at least 100 million euros out of its fund for high-tech and transport projects . construction could be postponed the transrapid line would connect the bavarian capital with its airport , just under 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- away .
it would reduce the travel time from 40 to 10 minutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china operates the only commercial transrapid connection in the world once agreement has been reached on financing , the railway authorities could authorize construction at the end of 2007 at the earliest , die welt said .
but opponents have already announced they will seek to block the project at the federal administrative court in leipzig . there has been much debate in germany about a suitable location to build a line since the 1990s .
the world 's only commercial transrapid line operates in china between shanghai and its airport .
a connection in germany would be operated by deutsche bahn , the paper said . the transrapid , which floats on a magnetic cushion instead of riding on tracks , was developed by a joint venture between german industrial giants siemens and thyssenkrupp .
it can reach top speeds of 450 kilometers per hour . article based on news reports -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

andreas schleicher , a coordinator of pisa , the oecd 's program for international student assessment which compares educational achievement in different countries , said the training of teachers in particular needed to be radically revamped .
in germany , there 's an attempt by " teachers who have been trained in the 20th century to teach children of the 21st century in a school system that was conceived in the 19th century , " schleicher said .
he added that school teachers sorely needed a more hands-on training approach .
germany still reeling under pisa shock the criticism is not new .
in recent years , germany 's education system has taken a severe battering after a string of pisa study results showed the country 's exalted schools to be trailing internationally .
in 2001 , germany ranked only 21st in reading skills and 20th in math and science among 31 countries assessed .

in no other industrialized nation was school success so strongly linked to the social origin of its students , munoz said in the report .
he urged germany to rethink its school structure .
whereas most other european countries have moved on to more inclusive school systems , germany has essentially stuck to a three-tier structure which means that children are only 10 -lrb- or 12 in berlin -rrb- when their high school is chosen .
for nearly half of foreign students , it 's the hauptschule which prepares them for low-skilled jobs .
only 14 percent go to a pre-university gymnasium , compared with a national average of a third .
the drop-out rate for children of immigrant backgrounds is three times the national average .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 26.07.2007 folk music fans accuse german tv of discrimination großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dream couple of volksmusik marianne and michael will soon be hosting one less show volksmusik fans in germany were glued to their televisions on thursday night for the last episode of " lustige musikanten . "
public broadcaster zdf is cancelling the folk music program and older fans are up in arms . " lustige musikanten " or " the merry musicians " is one of many folk music programs on german television .
hosted by marianne and michael - the dream couple of volksmusik - the show , however , takes its final curtain call on thursday night . public broadcaster zdf said it was not renewing the respective contracts due to planned program reforms for 2008 .
the channel said it wanted to make itself more attractive for younger viewers .
yodeling singers in dirndls and lederhosen apparently just were n't doing the trick . a recent poll showed that in the first six months of 2007 , zdf only held a market share of 6.6 percent in the 14-to-49 year-old range - one of the worst results in the station 's history . according to media reports , the lobby group for the german-speaking popular music industry " arbeitsgemeinschaft deutscher schlager und volksmusik " -lrb- ads -rrb- is now contemplating legal action against zdf . exclusion violates anti-discrimination laws manfred knöpke , head of ads , said the group criticized zdf 's justification of wanting to make the channel younger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is n't hip enough for young viewers " this means older people are being excluded , " knöpke said in interviews with various german papers .
" in our opinion , this violates the anti-discrimination law . "
ads has now ordered a legal expert analysis whether a lawsuit against zdf would be viable . " if the stations take volksmusik shows out of their programs because the viewers are too old , then several parts of the population are being shut out , " he said . ads has gotten support from trude unruh , head of the senior citizens ' activist group gray panthers . " this is an insult to everyone who rebuilt germany after the war , " unruh told the mass circulation paper bild am sonntag . senior citizens should n't be underestimated as consumers according to knöpke , zdf 's program policies were not forward-looking .
he said many sectors had recognized that it was n't the 14-to-49 year-olds that were the most interesting target group , but rather those over 50 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heino is one of germany 's most popular volksmusik singers " the industry is just beginning to discover the growing group of senior citizens as consumers , " he said . whether zdf 's new policies will attract younger viewers remained to be seen .
according to knöpke , when it came to music , young people would stick to mtv and viva anyway . zdf is reportedly unperturbed by the uproar .
it said no one had a right to a specific type of music on television . some media have also questioned ads ' motivations .
the group , with some 12,000 members , represents the interests of musicians , management , record companies and other institutions which live off of volksmusik .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : behind the scenes at the bayreuth festival going backstage with bayreuth festival singers wagners want to keep bayreuth festival in the family " i stay out of all the wagner family disputes " classical music -pipe- 26.07.2007 katarina wagner 's bayreuth debut elicits boos and bravos alike großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katharina wagner sees herself as a modernizer that the festival desperately needs amid a family feud over the running of the famous opera festival , katharina wagner 's directorial debut at bayreuth split the audience .
not everybody , it seems , enjoyed seeing richard wagner dancing in his underwear . germany 's annual bayreuth festival of wagner operas began on wednesday with a highly anticipated , make-or-break production by the 29-year-old great-granddaughter of the composer richard wagner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an opera buff who also happens to be close to the people : angela merkel and while the applause after the first two acts of wagner 's only " comic " opera was friendly , the audience - which included a smorgasbord of german political and social elite - was less amused by the third and final act , which featured a few minutes of full frontal nudity , a bizarre sight of richard wagner dancing in his underwear and a bunch of master singers horsing around the stage with oversized penises .
when , at the end of the marathon seven-hour performance , which included 2 one-hour breaks , visibly nervous katharina wagner took to the stage , she was greeted with boos , hisses , jeers and whistles as well as bravos and cries of approval .
the bayreuth audience proved itself to be worthy of the music genre : dramatic , passionate and self-involved to the point of absurdity .
a red-carpet affair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a family business : katharina wagner with father wolfgang and mother gudrun camera teams and hundreds of onlookers were outside the 19th century festival theater to see katharina in a backless frock arrive to the opening with her father wolfgang wagner , the famous composer 's 87-year-old grandson .
other prominent guests included german chancellor angela merkel , eu commission president jose manuel barroso and a host of german and european glitterati such as bavarian aristocrat gloria von thurn und taxis , germany 's most famous tv showmaster thomas gottschalk and old-time crooner roberto blanco , who has demonstrated a remarkable talent at being frequently resurrected from oblivion .
katharina wagner , who hopes to be appointed festival director in succession to her father wolfgang , who 's been in charge of the festival since 1951 , told reporters that last-minute rehearsals were needed because of " technical problems . "
new ideas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : princess gloria von thurn und taxis with her daughters in an interview published on wednesday , wagner said new ideas were vital to keep the festival young at heart .
she told the german daily süddeutsche zeitung that the festival had to claw back from the opera houses its avant-garde role in wagner interpretation .
" my concern is not to just preserve but to develop something new as well , " she said .
" bayreuth can dare to experiment , " she said , pointing to past engagements of two of the shock directors of german theater , the late heiner müller in 1993 for " tristan and isolde " and christoph schlingensief in 2004 for " parsifal . "
a family saga katharina wagner - the youngest-ever director and the first woman ever to have been entrusted with staging an opera at the festival established by her great-grandfather 131 years ago - is , whether she likes to admit it or not , in the midst of an ongoing family feud .
bildunterschrift : a scene from the opera in what seems like a cross-over between a soap-opera and a royal-family intrigue , the wagners have been fighting over who will take over the festival management business for years .
the bayreuth board can hire anyone to run the public-funded festival , but the job is unique among german public appointments in always having been held by the wagner family .
after failing to establish his second wife gudrun as his successor , wolfgang wagner has put all his weight behind daughter katharina .
but katharina 's rival cousins eva wagner-pasquier and nike wagner , both 62 , also lay claim to the bayreuth throne .
eva is wolfgang 's daughter by his first marriage , while nike is the daughter of wolfgang 's brother wieland , who died in 1966 .
in the absence of a real royal family , the wagners are a god-given gift to those germans who like to combine their interests in high culture with society gossip .
a modern interpretation in a production that - perhaps to the shock of the hard-core , ultra-conservative wagnerites - did not feature a medieval town square and a cast that could be easily convinced to perform a dark , dogma-style , version of snow white and the seven dwarfs - katharina wagner decided to put her foot down in bayreuth as a modernizer par excellence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayreuth is the place to be seen : tv showman thomas gottschalk with his wife thea so she had sneakers raining from the sky .
even more importantly , however , while treating the opera as a kind of discourse on tradition and progress in art , she showed no particular respect for the actual plot .
in wagner 's original , walther von stolzing , a young knight , falls in love with the daughter of a rich nuremberg burgher and tries to win her heart by entering a singing contest - a medieval precursor to american idol and german superstar .
at first he is rejected by the master singers - the simon cowels and paula abduls of his time - for breaking all of their traditional rules .
eventually , however , his natural talent wins them over .
in essence , it 's a boy-gets-girl-by-showing-he-can-sing kind of story .
in katharina wagner 's staging , the hero is actually a wimp : a rebel who - in order to win the contest - becomes a conformist and emulator of his masters .
in modern speak : a hard-rocker , who in the american idol final , decides to sing a whitney houston ballad .
mixed reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reviews are yet to come in audience reactions to the unconventional production and critical response it receives could be decisive for wagner , either spoiling or boosting her ambitions .
achim barth , from frankfurt , dismissed the production as unnecessarily gimmicky .
" it 's runs completely contrary to the text , " barth said .
" it 's just nonsense .
modern for the sake of being modern . "
leading german daily newspapers were not due to publish reviews till friday but other media were quicker .
a reviewer for the web site of the weekly magazine der spiegel , for instance , compared the " overly intellectual " staging to a pizza : too many ingredients on a very thin base . no pressure wagner said she did not feel under any time pressure , since the post of festival director replacing her father , 87 , had not yet been advertised .
this year , the festival , which runs until aug .
28 , will also feature " the ring of the nibelung , " " tannhäuser " and re-runs of schlingensief 's " parsifal . "
all 54,000 available tickets to the 30 performances have been sold out .
organizers received 460,500 applications and preferred applicants , who had been applying for eight years or more . article based on news reports -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the rabobank team has kicked michael rasmussen out , as more doping-related scandals tarnished the famous race 's reputation . the rabobank team will continue the tour de france on thursday , one day after suspending leader michael rasmussen .
the 33-year-old dane allegedly lied about his whereabouts , apparently to avoid out-of-competition doping tests . " on several occasions , he claimed he was training , and that was a lie , " said rabobank team director theo de rooy .
" team management was warned several times and had received new information on wednesday . " rasmussen was a controversial figure on the tour after he was kicked off the danish national cycling team for having missed two out-of-competition doping tests earlier in the year .
he is only the second tour de france leader to be booted in the 104-year history of the event .
in 1978 , michel pollentier of belgium had to leave after seemingly trying to cheat with urine that was not his . tour would have barred rasmussen rasmussen had told his team he was in mexico .
but a former cyclist , davide cassani , then said on wednesday he had seen him in italy .
confronted with the statement , rasmussen admitted to having lied and that he had in fact been in italy . " what has happened leaves me speechless , " said piet van schijndel from the rabobank board .
" i am lost for words .
it 's a nightmare . " van schijndel said that rabobank will decide after the tour whether it will continue sponsoring the cycling team . bildunterschrift : the tour de france takes riders over 3,547 kilometers tour organizers said that if they had been informed in time , they would not have allowed rasmussen to race . " michael rasmussen never should have started the tour , " said patrice clerc , head of the amaury sport organization , which runs the tour .
" the champion must be unimpeachable , an example . " on thursday , french newspaper france soir ran a mock obituary for the scandal-tainted race on its cover .
it said the tour died thursday " at age 104 , after a long illness . " the liberation daily wrote that the race had become a joke and should be canceled . " this procession of cyclists has been transformed into a caravan of ridicule , " the paper 's editorial said .
" if the organizers really want to save cycling , they should stop the competition and declare a pause of a few years , enough time to treat these athletes-turned-druggies . " cofidis team quits rasmussen 's departure is the latest blow to the tour 's credibility , and the third doping bombshell to shake the race in two days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pre-race favorite alexander vinokourov also tested positive for doping on wednesday , just hours before the rasmussen announcement , france 's number one team cofidis pulled out of the race .
it had been revealed that its italian rider cristian moreni tested positive for synthetic testosterone after the 11th stage on july 19 . on tuesday , the astana team of pre-race favorite alexander vinokourov of kazakhstan quit the race after the announcement that vinokourov tested positive for an illegal blood transfusion . rasmussen was jeered and whistled at by spectators before the start of the 16th stage in the pyrenees on wednesday .
he received the same treatment at the awards ceremony at the conclusion of the stage , which he won . rasmussen , a former cross-country cycling world champion , led the tour standings ahead of second-place alberto contador of spain by three minutes and 10 seconds in the overall standings after wednesday 's stage .
he had seemed certain to win the championship . contador - who has been linked to the spanish doping probe centering on eufemiano fuentes and for that reason was not allowed to compete in the 2006 tour - now leads the tour . the tour de france ends on sunday in paris . article based on news reports -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not everybody , it seems , enjoyed seeing richard wagner dancing in his underwear . germany 's annual bayreuth festival of wagner operas began on wednesday with a highly anticipated , make-or-break production by the 29-year-old great-granddaughter of the composer richard wagner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an opera buff who also happens to be close to the people : angela merkel and while the applause after the first two acts of wagner 's only " comic " opera was friendly , the audience - which included a smorgasbord of german political and social elite - was less amused by the third and final act , which featured a few minutes of full frontal nudity , a bizarre sight of richard wagner dancing in his underwear and a bunch of master singers horsing around the stage with oversized penises .
when , at the end of the marathon seven-hour performance , which included 2 one-hour breaks , visibly nervous katharina wagner took to the stage , she was greeted with boos , hisses , jeers and whistles as well as bravos and cries of approval .
the bayreuth audience proved itself to be worthy of the music genre : dramatic , passionate and self-involved to the point of absurdity .
a red-carpet affair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a family business : katharina wagner with father wolfgang and mother gudrun camera teams and hundreds of onlookers were outside the 19th century festival theater to see katharina in a backless frock arrive to the opening with her father wolfgang wagner , the famous composer 's 87-year-old grandson .
other prominent guests included german chancellor angela merkel , eu commission president jose manuel barroso and a host of german and european glitterati such as bavarian aristocrat gloria von thurn und taxis , germany 's most famous tv showmaster thomas gottschalk and old-time crooner roberto blanco , who has demonstrated a remarkable talent at being frequently resurrected from oblivion .
katharina wagner , who hopes to be appointed festival director in succession to her father wolfgang , who 's been in charge of the festival since 1951 , told reporters that last-minute rehearsals were needed because of " technical problems . "
new ideas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : princess gloria von thurn und taxis with her daughters in an interview published on wednesday , wagner said new ideas were vital to keep the festival young at heart .
she told the german daily süddeutsche zeitung that the festival had to claw back from the opera houses its avant-garde role in wagner interpretation .
" my concern is not to just preserve but to develop something new as well , " she said .
" bayreuth can dare to experiment , " she said , pointing to past engagements of two of the shock directors of german theater , the late heiner müller in 1993 for " tristan and isolde " and christoph schlingensief in 2004 for " parsifal . "
a family saga katharina wagner - the youngest-ever director and the first woman ever to have been entrusted with staging an opera at the festival established by her great-grandfather 131 years ago - is , whether she likes to admit it or not , in the midst of an ongoing family feud .
bildunterschrift : a scene from the opera in what seems like a cross-over between a soap-opera and a royal-family intrigue , the wagners have been fighting over who will take over the festival management business for years .
the bayreuth board can hire anyone to run the public-funded festival , but the job is unique among german public appointments in always having been held by the wagner family .
after failing to establish his second wife gudrun as his successor , wolfgang wagner has put all his weight behind daughter katharina .
but katharina 's rival cousins eva wagner-pasquier and nike wagner , both 62 , also lay claim to the bayreuth throne .
eva is wolfgang 's daughter by his first marriage , while nike is the daughter of wolfgang 's brother wieland , who died in 1966 .
in the absence of a real royal family , the wagners are a god-given gift to those germans who like to combine their interests in high culture with society gossip .
a modern interpretation in a production that - perhaps to the shock of the hard-core , ultra-conservative wagnerites - did not feature a medieval town square and a cast that could be easily convinced to perform a dark , dogma-style , version of snow white and the seven dwarfs - katharina wagner decided to put her foot down in bayreuth as a modernizer par excellence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayreuth is the place to be seen : tv showman thomas gottschalk with his wife thea so she had sneakers raining from the sky .
even more importantly , however , while treating the opera as a kind of discourse on tradition and progress in art , she showed no particular respect for the actual plot .
in wagner 's original , walther von stolzing , a young knight , falls in love with the daughter of a rich nuremberg burgher and tries to win her heart by entering a singing contest - a medieval precursor to american idol and german superstar .
at first he is rejected by the master singers - the simon cowels and paula abduls of his time - for breaking all of their traditional rules .
eventually , however , his natural talent wins them over .
in essence , it 's a boy-gets-girl-by-showing-he-can-sing kind of story .
in katharina wagner 's staging , the hero is actually a wimp : a rebel who - in order to win the contest - becomes a conformist and emulator of his masters .
in modern speak : a hard-rocker , who in the american idol final , decides to sing a whitney houston ballad .
mixed reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reviews are yet to come in audience reactions to the unconventional production and critical response it receives could be decisive for wagner , either spoiling or boosting her ambitions .
achim barth , from frankfurt , dismissed the production as unnecessarily gimmicky .

a german media report said the government no longer questioned the project .
now , just the financial details need to be clarified . the german government reportedly no longer wants to block a high-speed train connection between munich 's city center and its airport .
according to thursday 's edition of the daily die welt , german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee and bavaria 's economics minister erwin huber will meet at the end of august to clarify the financing of the project . " as soon as we 've reached agreement on the financing , we want to wind up the project quickly , " the paper quoted sources at the federal transport ministry . it is expected to cost at least 1.85 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.54 billion -rrb- . the high-speed magnetic levitation -lrb- " maglev " -rrb- train project had been called into question after a crash on a test track last year killed 23 people and injured 10 . eu funding could support transrapid the project 's financing is , however , a major hurdle .
the federal government has already earmarked 550 million euros in its budget for it .
bavaria would provide some 300 million euros and german railway deutsche bahn 185 million euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the transrapid crash in 2006 caused the first fatalities on a maglev train tiefensee has said that the federal government was only prepared to foot half of the bill .
according to transport experts , this left a financing gap of 350 million euros . bavaria 's premier edmund stoiber has therefore appealed to the european union for subsidies .
european commission president jose manuel barroso , who is currently on a three-day-visist to bavaria , has agreed to examine the request .
bavaria hopes the eu could provide at least 100 million euros out of its fund for high-tech and transport projects . construction could be postponed the transrapid line would connect the bavarian capital with its airport , just under 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- away .
it would reduce the travel time from 40 to 10 minutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china operates the only commercial transrapid connection in the world once agreement has been reached on financing , the railway authorities could authorize construction at the end of 2007 at the earliest , die welt said .
but opponents have already announced they will seek to block the project at the federal administrative court in leipzig . there has been much debate in germany about a suitable location to build a line since the 1990s .
the world 's only commercial transrapid line operates in china between shanghai and its airport .
a connection in germany would be operated by deutsche bahn , the paper said . the transrapid , which floats on a magnetic cushion instead of riding on tracks , was developed by a joint venture between german industrial giants siemens and thyssenkrupp .
it can reach top speeds of 450 kilometers per hour . article based on news reports -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the rulings will likely expand the number of holocaust survivors eligible for benefits from germany . two jewish men appealed the rejection of their pension claims to the federal social security tribunal in kassel .
on thursday , the tribunal overruled lower court decisions and said the men were entitled to claims .
the ruling comes 62 years after the end of world war ii .
germany pays monthly stipends to tens of thousands of victims of the nazis , most of them people who spent at least six months in one of nazi germany 's concentration camps . the stipends are calculated based on the length of the person 's persecution . thousands could benefit from rulings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jews were forced to wear a yellow star by the nazi regime the first case involved a man who contested when his persecution started .
he said it began when nazis forced him to wear a yellow star of david on his sleeve .
that occurred after german forces invaded his hometown in poland in september 1939 .
the tribunal ruled the man should obtain a credit for this part of his ordeal .
the man 's lawyer said thousands of people would benefit from the ruling .
the second case involved an 82-year-old israeli who was confined to the jewish ghetto in trans-dniester , part of the soviet union .
the area was controlled by pro-nazi romanian forces .

a german media report said the government no longer questioned the project .
now , just the financial details need to be clarified . the german government reportedly no longer wants to block a high-speed train connection between munich 's city center and its airport .
according to thursday 's edition of the daily die welt , german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee and bavaria 's economics minister erwin huber will meet at the end of august to clarify the financing of the project . " as soon as we 've reached agreement on the financing , we want to wind up the project quickly , " the paper quoted sources at the federal transport ministry . it is expected to cost at least 1.85 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.54 billion -rrb- . the high-speed magnetic levitation -lrb- " maglev " -rrb- train project had been called into question after a crash on a test track last year killed 23 people and injured 10 . eu funding could support transrapid the project 's financing is , however , a major hurdle .
the federal government has already earmarked 550 million euros in its budget for it .
bavaria would provide some 300 million euros and german railway deutsche bahn 185 million euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the transrapid crash in 2006 caused the first fatalities on a maglev train tiefensee has said that the federal government was only prepared to foot half of the bill .
according to transport experts , this left a financing gap of 350 million euros . bavaria 's premier edmund stoiber has therefore appealed to the european union for subsidies .
european commission president jose manuel barroso , who is currently on a three-day-visist to bavaria , has agreed to examine the request .
bavaria hopes the eu could provide at least 100 million euros out of its fund for high-tech and transport projects . construction could be postponed the transrapid line would connect the bavarian capital with its airport , just under 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- away .
it would reduce the travel time from 40 to 10 minutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china operates the only commercial transrapid connection in the world once agreement has been reached on financing , the railway authorities could authorize construction at the end of 2007 at the earliest , die welt said .
but opponents have already announced they will seek to block the project at the federal administrative court in leipzig . there has been much debate in germany about a suitable location to build a line since the 1990s .
the world 's only commercial transrapid line operates in china between shanghai and its airport .
a connection in germany would be operated by deutsche bahn , the paper said . the transrapid , which floats on a magnetic cushion instead of riding on tracks , was developed by a joint venture between german industrial giants siemens and thyssenkrupp .
it can reach top speeds of 450 kilometers per hour . article based on news reports -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the euro-zone 's biggest economy is expected to continue its upswing in the second half of the year . a survey of 7,000 german firms showed companies viewed their business operations and prospects with less optimism for the next six months than they had earlier in 2007 , according to figures released thursday by ifo , a munich-based economic research institute .
the widely-watched business climate index fell to 106.4 points in july from 107 points in june , ifo said in a statement .
that 's the lowest level since october 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer confidence has helped the german economy " the companies polled judged their current business situation as positively as last month but their business outlook for the next half year does not look quite as favorable , " ifo president hans-werner sinn said in a statement .
" -lsb- nevertheless -rsb- these results indicate the economic recovery will continue in the second half . "
it 's the third consecutive month that companies have downgraded their view of the business climate .
high oil prices , rising interest rates and a strong euro have fuelled fears that the german economy might slow after booking a 2.8 percent growth rate in 2006 . economy expected to stay strong in 2007 " we 've crossed the high point in growth and we 'll now see a slight slowdown , but nothing dramatic , " matthias rubisch , an economist at commerzbank ag in frankfurt told bloomberg news .
" the strong euro , energy prices and rising interest rates were negative influences . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tanking up is expensive the german economy will continue to grow in the upcoming months amid signs of a continuing fall in unemployment , sinn said .
german economists have projected a 2007 growth rate at or above last year 's level , but feel it might slip towards 2 percent in 2008 .
strong exports and consumer spending have helped fuel recent growth rates .
interest hike likely delayed business confidence has also recently fallen in other european countries such as italy , belgium and the netherlands .
the drop in business confidence combined with a rise in the money supply means the european central bank will likely delay an interest rate hike until late this year , analysts said .
matthias rubisch of commerzbank said the ifo backed up the bank 's forecast that the german economy will lose steam over the coming months .
" although the index remains at a very high level historically , it would be unwise to ignore the recent downward trend , " he told afp news agency .
" we still envisage strong second-half growth above the long-term average , but not at the pace of last year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 26.07.2007 tour de france sinking in doping mire großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael rasmussen 's team has pulled him from the race after he missed several doping tests the tour de france continues on thursday minus its leader .
the rabobank team has kicked michael rasmussen out , as more doping-related scandals tarnished the famous race 's reputation . the rabobank team will continue the tour de france on thursday , one day after suspending leader michael rasmussen .
the 33-year-old dane allegedly lied about his whereabouts , apparently to avoid out-of-competition doping tests . " on several occasions , he claimed he was training , and that was a lie , " said rabobank team director theo de rooy .
" team management was warned several times and had received new information on wednesday . " rasmussen was a controversial figure on the tour after he was kicked off the danish national cycling team for having missed two out-of-competition doping tests earlier in the year .
he is only the second tour de france leader to be booted in the 104-year history of the event .
in 1978 , michel pollentier of belgium had to leave after seemingly trying to cheat with urine that was not his . tour would have barred rasmussen rasmussen had told his team he was in mexico .
but a former cyclist , davide cassani , then said on wednesday he had seen him in italy .
confronted with the statement , rasmussen admitted to having lied and that he had in fact been in italy . " what has happened leaves me speechless , " said piet van schijndel from the rabobank board .
" i am lost for words .
it 's a nightmare . " van schijndel said that rabobank will decide after the tour whether it will continue sponsoring the cycling team . bildunterschrift : the tour de france takes riders over 3,547 kilometers tour organizers said that if they had been informed in time , they would not have allowed rasmussen to race . " michael rasmussen never should have started the tour , " said patrice clerc , head of the amaury sport organization , which runs the tour .
" the champion must be unimpeachable , an example . " on thursday , french newspaper france soir ran a mock obituary for the scandal-tainted race on its cover .
it said the tour died thursday " at age 104 , after a long illness . " the liberation daily wrote that the race had become a joke and should be canceled . " this procession of cyclists has been transformed into a caravan of ridicule , " the paper 's editorial said .
" if the organizers really want to save cycling , they should stop the competition and declare a pause of a few years , enough time to treat these athletes-turned-druggies . " cofidis team quits rasmussen 's departure is the latest blow to the tour 's credibility , and the third doping bombshell to shake the race in two days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pre-race favorite alexander vinokourov also tested positive for doping on wednesday , just hours before the rasmussen announcement , france 's number one team cofidis pulled out of the race .
it had been revealed that its italian rider cristian moreni tested positive for synthetic testosterone after the 11th stage on july 19 . on tuesday , the astana team of pre-race favorite alexander vinokourov of kazakhstan quit the race after the announcement that vinokourov tested positive for an illegal blood transfusion . rasmussen was jeered and whistled at by spectators before the start of the 16th stage in the pyrenees on wednesday .
he received the same treatment at the awards ceremony at the conclusion of the stage , which he won . rasmussen , a former cross-country cycling world champion , led the tour standings ahead of second-place alberto contador of spain by three minutes and 10 seconds in the overall standings after wednesday 's stage .
he had seemed certain to win the championship . contador - who has been linked to the spanish doping probe centering on eufemiano fuentes and for that reason was not allowed to compete in the 2006 tour - now leads the tour . the tour de france ends on sunday in paris . article based on news reports -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a german media report said the government no longer questioned the project .
now , just the financial details need to be clarified . the german government reportedly no longer wants to block a high-speed train connection between munich 's city center and its airport .
according to thursday 's edition of the daily die welt , german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee and bavaria 's economics minister erwin huber will meet at the end of august to clarify the financing of the project . " as soon as we 've reached agreement on the financing , we want to wind up the project quickly , " the paper quoted sources at the federal transport ministry . it is expected to cost at least 1.85 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.54 billion -rrb- . the high-speed magnetic levitation -lrb- " maglev " -rrb- train project had been called into question after a crash on a test track last year killed 23 people and injured 10 . eu funding could support transrapid the project 's financing is , however , a major hurdle .
the federal government has already earmarked 550 million euros in its budget for it .
bavaria would provide some 300 million euros and german railway deutsche bahn 185 million euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the transrapid crash in 2006 caused the first fatalities on a maglev train tiefensee has said that the federal government was only prepared to foot half of the bill .
according to transport experts , this left a financing gap of 350 million euros . bavaria 's premier edmund stoiber has therefore appealed to the european union for subsidies .
european commission president jose manuel barroso , who is currently on a three-day-visist to bavaria , has agreed to examine the request .
bavaria hopes the eu could provide at least 100 million euros out of its fund for high-tech and transport projects . construction could be postponed the transrapid line would connect the bavarian capital with its airport , just under 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- away .
it would reduce the travel time from 40 to 10 minutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china operates the only commercial transrapid connection in the world once agreement has been reached on financing , the railway authorities could authorize construction at the end of 2007 at the earliest , die welt said .
but opponents have already announced they will seek to block the project at the federal administrative court in leipzig . there has been much debate in germany about a suitable location to build a line since the 1990s .
the world 's only commercial transrapid line operates in china between shanghai and its airport .
a connection in germany would be operated by deutsche bahn , the paper said . the transrapid , which floats on a magnetic cushion instead of riding on tracks , was developed by a joint venture between german industrial giants siemens and thyssenkrupp .

public broadcaster zdf is cancelling the folk music program and older fans are up in arms . " lustige musikanten " or " the merry musicians " is one of many folk music programs on german television .
hosted by marianne and michael - the dream couple of volksmusik - the show , however , takes its final curtain call on thursday night . public broadcaster zdf said it was not renewing the respective contracts due to planned program reforms for 2008 .
the channel said it wanted to make itself more attractive for younger viewers .
yodeling singers in dirndls and lederhosen apparently just were n't doing the trick . a recent poll showed that in the first six months of 2007 , zdf only held a market share of 6.6 percent in the 14-to-49 year-old range - one of the worst results in the station 's history . according to media reports , the lobby group for the german-speaking popular music industry " arbeitsgemeinschaft deutscher schlager und volksmusik " -lrb- ads -rrb- is now contemplating legal action against zdf . exclusion violates anti-discrimination laws manfred knöpke , head of ads , said the group criticized zdf 's justification of wanting to make the channel younger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is n't hip enough for young viewers " this means older people are being excluded , " knöpke said in interviews with various german papers .

" if the stations take volksmusik shows out of their programs because the viewers are too old , then several parts of the population are being shut out , " he said . ads has gotten support from trude unruh , head of the senior citizens ' activist group gray panthers . " this is an insult to everyone who rebuilt germany after the war , " unruh told the mass circulation paper bild am sonntag . senior citizens should n't be underestimated as consumers according to knöpke , zdf 's program policies were not forward-looking .

according to knöpke , when it came to music , young people would stick to mtv and viva anyway . zdf is reportedly unperturbed by the uproar .
it said no one had a right to a specific type of music on television . some media have also questioned ads ' motivations .

public broadcaster zdf is cancelling the folk music program and older fans are up in arms . " lustige musikanten " or " the merry musicians " is one of many folk music programs on german television .
hosted by marianne and michael - the dream couple of volksmusik - the show , however , takes its final curtain call on thursday night . public broadcaster zdf said it was not renewing the respective contracts due to planned program reforms for 2008 .
the channel said it wanted to make itself more attractive for younger viewers .
yodeling singers in dirndls and lederhosen apparently just were n't doing the trick . a recent poll showed that in the first six months of 2007 , zdf only held a market share of 6.6 percent in the 14-to-49 year-old range - one of the worst results in the station 's history . according to media reports , the lobby group for the german-speaking popular music industry " arbeitsgemeinschaft deutscher schlager und volksmusik " -lrb- ads -rrb- is now contemplating legal action against zdf . exclusion violates anti-discrimination laws manfred knöpke , head of ads , said the group criticized zdf 's justification of wanting to make the channel younger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is n't hip enough for young viewers " this means older people are being excluded , " knöpke said in interviews with various german papers .

a german media report said the government no longer questioned the project .
now , just the financial details need to be clarified . the german government reportedly no longer wants to block a high-speed train connection between munich 's city center and its airport .
according to thursday 's edition of the daily die welt , german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee and bavaria 's economics minister erwin huber will meet at the end of august to clarify the financing of the project . " as soon as we 've reached agreement on the financing , we want to wind up the project quickly , " the paper quoted sources at the federal transport ministry . it is expected to cost at least 1.85 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.54 billion -rrb- . the high-speed magnetic levitation -lrb- " maglev " -rrb- train project had been called into question after a crash on a test track last year killed 23 people and injured 10 . eu funding could support transrapid the project 's financing is , however , a major hurdle .
the federal government has already earmarked 550 million euros in its budget for it .
bavaria would provide some 300 million euros and german railway deutsche bahn 185 million euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the transrapid crash in 2006 caused the first fatalities on a maglev train tiefensee has said that the federal government was only prepared to foot half of the bill .
according to transport experts , this left a financing gap of 350 million euros . bavaria 's premier edmund stoiber has therefore appealed to the european union for subsidies .
european commission president jose manuel barroso , who is currently on a three-day-visist to bavaria , has agreed to examine the request .
bavaria hopes the eu could provide at least 100 million euros out of its fund for high-tech and transport projects . construction could be postponed the transrapid line would connect the bavarian capital with its airport , just under 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- away .
it would reduce the travel time from 40 to 10 minutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china operates the only commercial transrapid connection in the world once agreement has been reached on financing , the railway authorities could authorize construction at the end of 2007 at the earliest , die welt said .
but opponents have already announced they will seek to block the project at the federal administrative court in leipzig . there has been much debate in germany about a suitable location to build a line since the 1990s .
the world 's only commercial transrapid line operates in china between shanghai and its airport .
a connection in germany would be operated by deutsche bahn , the paper said . the transrapid , which floats on a magnetic cushion instead of riding on tracks , was developed by a joint venture between german industrial giants siemens and thyssenkrupp .
it can reach top speeds of 450 kilometers per hour . article based on news reports -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not everybody , it seems , enjoyed seeing richard wagner dancing in his underwear . germany 's annual bayreuth festival of wagner operas began on wednesday with a highly anticipated , make-or-break production by the 29-year-old great-granddaughter of the composer richard wagner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an opera buff who also happens to be close to the people : angela merkel and while the applause after the first two acts of wagner 's only " comic " opera was friendly , the audience - which included a smorgasbord of german political and social elite - was less amused by the third and final act , which featured a few minutes of full frontal nudity , a bizarre sight of richard wagner dancing in his underwear and a bunch of master singers horsing around the stage with oversized penises .
when , at the end of the marathon seven-hour performance , which included 2 one-hour breaks , visibly nervous katharina wagner took to the stage , she was greeted with boos , hisses , jeers and whistles as well as bravos and cries of approval .
the bayreuth audience proved itself to be worthy of the music genre : dramatic , passionate and self-involved to the point of absurdity .
a red-carpet affair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a family business : katharina wagner with father wolfgang and mother gudrun camera teams and hundreds of onlookers were outside the 19th century festival theater to see katharina in a backless frock arrive to the opening with her father wolfgang wagner , the famous composer 's 87-year-old grandson .
other prominent guests included german chancellor angela merkel , eu commission president jose manuel barroso and a host of german and european glitterati such as bavarian aristocrat gloria von thurn und taxis , germany 's most famous tv showmaster thomas gottschalk and old-time crooner roberto blanco , who has demonstrated a remarkable talent at being frequently resurrected from oblivion .
katharina wagner , who hopes to be appointed festival director in succession to her father wolfgang , who 's been in charge of the festival since 1951 , told reporters that last-minute rehearsals were needed because of " technical problems . "
new ideas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : princess gloria von thurn und taxis with her daughters in an interview published on wednesday , wagner said new ideas were vital to keep the festival young at heart .
she told the german daily süddeutsche zeitung that the festival had to claw back from the opera houses its avant-garde role in wagner interpretation .
" my concern is not to just preserve but to develop something new as well , " she said .
" bayreuth can dare to experiment , " she said , pointing to past engagements of two of the shock directors of german theater , the late heiner müller in 1993 for " tristan and isolde " and christoph schlingensief in 2004 for " parsifal . "
a family saga katharina wagner - the youngest-ever director and the first woman ever to have been entrusted with staging an opera at the festival established by her great-grandfather 131 years ago - is , whether she likes to admit it or not , in the midst of an ongoing family feud .
bildunterschrift : a scene from the opera in what seems like a cross-over between a soap-opera and a royal-family intrigue , the wagners have been fighting over who will take over the festival management business for years .
the bayreuth board can hire anyone to run the public-funded festival , but the job is unique among german public appointments in always having been held by the wagner family .
after failing to establish his second wife gudrun as his successor , wolfgang wagner has put all his weight behind daughter katharina .
but katharina 's rival cousins eva wagner-pasquier and nike wagner , both 62 , also lay claim to the bayreuth throne .
eva is wolfgang 's daughter by his first marriage , while nike is the daughter of wolfgang 's brother wieland , who died in 1966 .
in the absence of a real royal family , the wagners are a god-given gift to those germans who like to combine their interests in high culture with society gossip .
a modern interpretation in a production that - perhaps to the shock of the hard-core , ultra-conservative wagnerites - did not feature a medieval town square and a cast that could be easily convinced to perform a dark , dogma-style , version of snow white and the seven dwarfs - katharina wagner decided to put her foot down in bayreuth as a modernizer par excellence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayreuth is the place to be seen : tv showman thomas gottschalk with his wife thea so she had sneakers raining from the sky .
even more importantly , however , while treating the opera as a kind of discourse on tradition and progress in art , she showed no particular respect for the actual plot .
in wagner 's original , walther von stolzing , a young knight , falls in love with the daughter of a rich nuremberg burgher and tries to win her heart by entering a singing contest - a medieval precursor to american idol and german superstar .
at first he is rejected by the master singers - the simon cowels and paula abduls of his time - for breaking all of their traditional rules .
eventually , however , his natural talent wins them over .
in essence , it 's a boy-gets-girl-by-showing-he-can-sing kind of story .
in katharina wagner 's staging , the hero is actually a wimp : a rebel who - in order to win the contest - becomes a conformist and emulator of his masters .
in modern speak : a hard-rocker , who in the american idol final , decides to sing a whitney houston ballad .
mixed reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reviews are yet to come in audience reactions to the unconventional production and critical response it receives could be decisive for wagner , either spoiling or boosting her ambitions .
achim barth , from frankfurt , dismissed the production as unnecessarily gimmicky .

not everybody , it seems , enjoyed seeing richard wagner dancing in his underwear . germany 's annual bayreuth festival of wagner operas began on wednesday with a highly anticipated , make-or-break production by the 29-year-old great-granddaughter of the composer richard wagner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an opera buff who also happens to be close to the people : angela merkel and while the applause after the first two acts of wagner 's only " comic " opera was friendly , the audience - which included a smorgasbord of german political and social elite - was less amused by the third and final act , which featured a few minutes of full frontal nudity , a bizarre sight of richard wagner dancing in his underwear and a bunch of master singers horsing around the stage with oversized penises .
when , at the end of the marathon seven-hour performance , which included 2 one-hour breaks , visibly nervous katharina wagner took to the stage , she was greeted with boos , hisses , jeers and whistles as well as bravos and cries of approval .
the bayreuth audience proved itself to be worthy of the music genre : dramatic , passionate and self-involved to the point of absurdity .
a red-carpet affair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a family business : katharina wagner with father wolfgang and mother gudrun camera teams and hundreds of onlookers were outside the 19th century festival theater to see katharina in a backless frock arrive to the opening with her father wolfgang wagner , the famous composer 's 87-year-old grandson .
other prominent guests included german chancellor angela merkel , eu commission president jose manuel barroso and a host of german and european glitterati such as bavarian aristocrat gloria von thurn und taxis , germany 's most famous tv showmaster thomas gottschalk and old-time crooner roberto blanco , who has demonstrated a remarkable talent at being frequently resurrected from oblivion .
katharina wagner , who hopes to be appointed festival director in succession to her father wolfgang , who 's been in charge of the festival since 1951 , told reporters that last-minute rehearsals were needed because of " technical problems . "
new ideas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : princess gloria von thurn und taxis with her daughters in an interview published on wednesday , wagner said new ideas were vital to keep the festival young at heart .
she told the german daily süddeutsche zeitung that the festival had to claw back from the opera houses its avant-garde role in wagner interpretation .
" my concern is not to just preserve but to develop something new as well , " she said .
" bayreuth can dare to experiment , " she said , pointing to past engagements of two of the shock directors of german theater , the late heiner müller in 1993 for " tristan and isolde " and christoph schlingensief in 2004 for " parsifal . "
a family saga katharina wagner - the youngest-ever director and the first woman ever to have been entrusted with staging an opera at the festival established by her great-grandfather 131 years ago - is , whether she likes to admit it or not , in the midst of an ongoing family feud .
bildunterschrift : a scene from the opera in what seems like a cross-over between a soap-opera and a royal-family intrigue , the wagners have been fighting over who will take over the festival management business for years .
the bayreuth board can hire anyone to run the public-funded festival , but the job is unique among german public appointments in always having been held by the wagner family .
after failing to establish his second wife gudrun as his successor , wolfgang wagner has put all his weight behind daughter katharina .
but katharina 's rival cousins eva wagner-pasquier and nike wagner , both 62 , also lay claim to the bayreuth throne .
eva is wolfgang 's daughter by his first marriage , while nike is the daughter of wolfgang 's brother wieland , who died in 1966 .
in the absence of a real royal family , the wagners are a god-given gift to those germans who like to combine their interests in high culture with society gossip .
a modern interpretation in a production that - perhaps to the shock of the hard-core , ultra-conservative wagnerites - did not feature a medieval town square and a cast that could be easily convinced to perform a dark , dogma-style , version of snow white and the seven dwarfs - katharina wagner decided to put her foot down in bayreuth as a modernizer par excellence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayreuth is the place to be seen : tv showman thomas gottschalk with his wife thea so she had sneakers raining from the sky .
even more importantly , however , while treating the opera as a kind of discourse on tradition and progress in art , she showed no particular respect for the actual plot .
in wagner 's original , walther von stolzing , a young knight , falls in love with the daughter of a rich nuremberg burgher and tries to win her heart by entering a singing contest - a medieval precursor to american idol and german superstar .
at first he is rejected by the master singers - the simon cowels and paula abduls of his time - for breaking all of their traditional rules .
eventually , however , his natural talent wins them over .
in essence , it 's a boy-gets-girl-by-showing-he-can-sing kind of story .
in katharina wagner 's staging , the hero is actually a wimp : a rebel who - in order to win the contest - becomes a conformist and emulator of his masters .
in modern speak : a hard-rocker , who in the american idol final , decides to sing a whitney houston ballad .
mixed reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reviews are yet to come in audience reactions to the unconventional production and critical response it receives could be decisive for wagner , either spoiling or boosting her ambitions .
achim barth , from frankfurt , dismissed the production as unnecessarily gimmicky .

" it 's just nonsense .

not everybody , it seems , enjoyed seeing richard wagner dancing in his underwear . germany 's annual bayreuth festival of wagner operas began on wednesday with a highly anticipated , make-or-break production by the 29-year-old great-granddaughter of the composer richard wagner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an opera buff who also happens to be close to the people : angela merkel and while the applause after the first two acts of wagner 's only " comic " opera was friendly , the audience - which included a smorgasbord of german political and social elite - was less amused by the third and final act , which featured a few minutes of full frontal nudity , a bizarre sight of richard wagner dancing in his underwear and a bunch of master singers horsing around the stage with oversized penises .
when , at the end of the marathon seven-hour performance , which included 2 one-hour breaks , visibly nervous katharina wagner took to the stage , she was greeted with boos , hisses , jeers and whistles as well as bravos and cries of approval .
the bayreuth audience proved itself to be worthy of the music genre : dramatic , passionate and self-involved to the point of absurdity .
a red-carpet affair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a family business : katharina wagner with father wolfgang and mother gudrun camera teams and hundreds of onlookers were outside the 19th century festival theater to see katharina in a backless frock arrive to the opening with her father wolfgang wagner , the famous composer 's 87-year-old grandson .
other prominent guests included german chancellor angela merkel , eu commission president jose manuel barroso and a host of german and european glitterati such as bavarian aristocrat gloria von thurn und taxis , germany 's most famous tv showmaster thomas gottschalk and old-time crooner roberto blanco , who has demonstrated a remarkable talent at being frequently resurrected from oblivion .
katharina wagner , who hopes to be appointed festival director in succession to her father wolfgang , who 's been in charge of the festival since 1951 , told reporters that last-minute rehearsals were needed because of " technical problems . "
new ideas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : princess gloria von thurn und taxis with her daughters in an interview published on wednesday , wagner said new ideas were vital to keep the festival young at heart .
she told the german daily süddeutsche zeitung that the festival had to claw back from the opera houses its avant-garde role in wagner interpretation .
" my concern is not to just preserve but to develop something new as well , " she said .
" bayreuth can dare to experiment , " she said , pointing to past engagements of two of the shock directors of german theater , the late heiner müller in 1993 for " tristan and isolde " and christoph schlingensief in 2004 for " parsifal . "
a family saga katharina wagner - the youngest-ever director and the first woman ever to have been entrusted with staging an opera at the festival established by her great-grandfather 131 years ago - is , whether she likes to admit it or not , in the midst of an ongoing family feud .
bildunterschrift : a scene from the opera in what seems like a cross-over between a soap-opera and a royal-family intrigue , the wagners have been fighting over who will take over the festival management business for years .
the bayreuth board can hire anyone to run the public-funded festival , but the job is unique among german public appointments in always having been held by the wagner family .
after failing to establish his second wife gudrun as his successor , wolfgang wagner has put all his weight behind daughter katharina .
but katharina 's rival cousins eva wagner-pasquier and nike wagner , both 62 , also lay claim to the bayreuth throne .
eva is wolfgang 's daughter by his first marriage , while nike is the daughter of wolfgang 's brother wieland , who died in 1966 .
in the absence of a real royal family , the wagners are a god-given gift to those germans who like to combine their interests in high culture with society gossip .
a modern interpretation in a production that - perhaps to the shock of the hard-core , ultra-conservative wagnerites - did not feature a medieval town square and a cast that could be easily convinced to perform a dark , dogma-style , version of snow white and the seven dwarfs - katharina wagner decided to put her foot down in bayreuth as a modernizer par excellence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayreuth is the place to be seen : tv showman thomas gottschalk with his wife thea so she had sneakers raining from the sky .
even more importantly , however , while treating the opera as a kind of discourse on tradition and progress in art , she showed no particular respect for the actual plot .
in wagner 's original , walther von stolzing , a young knight , falls in love with the daughter of a rich nuremberg burgher and tries to win her heart by entering a singing contest - a medieval precursor to american idol and german superstar .
at first he is rejected by the master singers - the simon cowels and paula abduls of his time - for breaking all of their traditional rules .
eventually , however , his natural talent wins them over .
in essence , it 's a boy-gets-girl-by-showing-he-can-sing kind of story .
in katharina wagner 's staging , the hero is actually a wimp : a rebel who - in order to win the contest - becomes a conformist and emulator of his masters .
in modern speak : a hard-rocker , who in the american idol final , decides to sing a whitney houston ballad .
mixed reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reviews are yet to come in audience reactions to the unconventional production and critical response it receives could be decisive for wagner , either spoiling or boosting her ambitions .
achim barth , from frankfurt , dismissed the production as unnecessarily gimmicky .

the rabobank team has kicked michael rasmussen out , as more doping-related scandals tarnished the famous race 's reputation . the rabobank team will continue the tour de france on thursday , one day after suspending leader michael rasmussen .
the 33-year-old dane allegedly lied about his whereabouts , apparently to avoid out-of-competition doping tests . " on several occasions , he claimed he was training , and that was a lie , " said rabobank team director theo de rooy .
" team management was warned several times and had received new information on wednesday . " rasmussen was a controversial figure on the tour after he was kicked off the danish national cycling team for having missed two out-of-competition doping tests earlier in the year .
he is only the second tour de france leader to be booted in the 104-year history of the event .
in 1978 , michel pollentier of belgium had to leave after seemingly trying to cheat with urine that was not his . tour would have barred rasmussen rasmussen had told his team he was in mexico .
but a former cyclist , davide cassani , then said on wednesday he had seen him in italy .
confronted with the statement , rasmussen admitted to having lied and that he had in fact been in italy . " what has happened leaves me speechless , " said piet van schijndel from the rabobank board .
" i am lost for words .
it 's a nightmare . " van schijndel said that rabobank will decide after the tour whether it will continue sponsoring the cycling team . bildunterschrift : the tour de france takes riders over 3,547 kilometers tour organizers said that if they had been informed in time , they would not have allowed rasmussen to race . " michael rasmussen never should have started the tour , " said patrice clerc , head of the amaury sport organization , which runs the tour .
" the champion must be unimpeachable , an example . " on thursday , french newspaper france soir ran a mock obituary for the scandal-tainted race on its cover .
it said the tour died thursday " at age 104 , after a long illness . " the liberation daily wrote that the race had become a joke and should be canceled . " this procession of cyclists has been transformed into a caravan of ridicule , " the paper 's editorial said .
" if the organizers really want to save cycling , they should stop the competition and declare a pause of a few years , enough time to treat these athletes-turned-druggies . " cofidis team quits rasmussen 's departure is the latest blow to the tour 's credibility , and the third doping bombshell to shake the race in two days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pre-race favorite alexander vinokourov also tested positive for doping on wednesday , just hours before the rasmussen announcement , france 's number one team cofidis pulled out of the race .
it had been revealed that its italian rider cristian moreni tested positive for synthetic testosterone after the 11th stage on july 19 . on tuesday , the astana team of pre-race favorite alexander vinokourov of kazakhstan quit the race after the announcement that vinokourov tested positive for an illegal blood transfusion . rasmussen was jeered and whistled at by spectators before the start of the 16th stage in the pyrenees on wednesday .
he received the same treatment at the awards ceremony at the conclusion of the stage , which he won . rasmussen , a former cross-country cycling world champion , led the tour standings ahead of second-place alberto contador of spain by three minutes and 10 seconds in the overall standings after wednesday 's stage .
he had seemed certain to win the championship . contador - who has been linked to the spanish doping probe centering on eufemiano fuentes and for that reason was not allowed to compete in the 2006 tour - now leads the tour . the tour de france ends on sunday in paris . article based on news reports -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" germany , on the other hand , has cut its emissions since 1990 by about 20 percent and is basically on kyoto track , " said latif , a scientist who has written on the influence of human activity on climate change and has worked extensively in the us . but it 's not just in germany and the rest of the eu that america 's environmental reputation has taken a beating .
a 37-nation survey published in june as part of the " global attitudes project " of the washington-based pew center showed that there is a " general increase in the percentage of people citing pollution and environmental problems as a top global threat .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar energy is gaining up adherents in the usa california governor arnold schwarzenegger made headlines around the world when he signed a bill to commit california to cutting its co2 emissions , which are blamed for global warming , by 25 percent by 2020 . as the california-based website green-technology.org wrote , " governor schwarzenegger has asked the state to ' lead by example , ' demonstrating that sustainability is achievable , desirable and economically sensible . " " green " businesses and web sites are cropping up in the state as a result .
while " merely " a us state -lrb- though the country 's most populated -rrb- , it ranks among the world 's 10 largest economies . according to the center for the continuing study of the california economy , the golden state 's gross domestic product in 2006 reached slightly more than $ 1.7 trillion -lrb- 1.2 trillion euros -rrb- . while california is often viewed as " way out there " - geographically and psychologically - by americans in many other parts of the us , the hope is that " green " ideas will trickle into the plans instituted in other us states . environmental alarms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flooding in great britain is one of the latest environmental disasters experts said a number of factors have come together to focus americans ' attention on the climate .
in addition to an earnest wish to save the planet , climate change has been a central topic in the media and extreme weather has prompted a feeling among many that change is necessary . then again , it could just be the power of the buck as " going green " could make good business sense . " green " business practices are becoming so popular , that us colleges and universities are beginning to offer sustainability or " green " masters of business administration -lrb- mba -rrb- programs , and companies , including even wal-mart stores inc . , are analyzing ways to increase profits by cutting down on waste and lowering energy costs . " it 's important that you make money when trying to help the environment , " said latif .
" once people , not just in the us , but everywhere , realize that this is really a big market , things will change and the climate will benefit . " all that wind and sunshine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german solar cells are particularly adept at absorbing the sun 's rays the scientist added that he sees money is to be made in renewable energies such as solar , geo-thermal , wind and water , all of which are abundantly available in california .
germans respect the us 's ability to forge territory when it comes to research and development .
" the first step has been that the us has recognized the climate problem , " he said .
" now , the task is finding ways for europe and the us to work together in developing better technology , which the us is so good at anyway . " furthermore , morin said that the pew study showed that environmental problems were one of the few threats in which people said their own country should take the lead dealing with the issue . " this signals great impatience on the part of people everywhere to do something on this issue , " he said .

" people here in germany and in the european union have some reservations about the us and climate protection because the country refused to endorse the kyoto protocol and therefore limit co2 emissions , " said mojib latif of the leibniz institute of marine sciences at kiel university in germany . germany on track bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could fuel for the future come from a us-eu partnership ?
" germany , on the other hand , has cut its emissions since 1990 by about 20 percent and is basically on kyoto track , " said latif , a scientist who has written on the influence of human activity on climate change and has worked extensively in the us . but it 's not just in germany and the rest of the eu that america 's environmental reputation has taken a beating .
a 37-nation survey published in june as part of the " global attitudes project " of the washington-based pew center showed that there is a " general increase in the percentage of people citing pollution and environmental problems as a top global threat . " rich morin , one of the authors of the study , said that : " in 34 of the 37 countries we surveyed , the united states was named by a majority or large plurality as the country that has done the most to damage the world 's air , water and natural spaces . " morin added that : " it is telling that fully a third of americans agree that we do the most damage - a degree of candor not usually found in americans . " but when looking for ways to minimize the damage done , it may not be washington , however , to which people turn , but the golden state of california , which could brighten the us 's blemished appearance .
light at the end of the tunnel ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar energy is gaining up adherents in the usa california governor arnold schwarzenegger made headlines around the world when he signed a bill to commit california to cutting its co2 emissions , which are blamed for global warming , by 25 percent by 2020 . as the california-based website green-technology.org wrote , " governor schwarzenegger has asked the state to ' lead by example , ' demonstrating that sustainability is achievable , desirable and economically sensible . " " green " businesses and web sites are cropping up in the state as a result .
while " merely " a us state -lrb- though the country 's most populated -rrb- , it ranks among the world 's 10 largest economies . according to the center for the continuing study of the california economy , the golden state 's gross domestic product in 2006 reached slightly more than $ 1.7 trillion -lrb- 1.2 trillion euros -rrb- . while california is often viewed as " way out there " - geographically and psychologically - by americans in many other parts of the us , the hope is that " green " ideas will trickle into the plans instituted in other us states . environmental alarms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flooding in great britain is one of the latest environmental disasters experts said a number of factors have come together to focus americans ' attention on the climate .
in addition to an earnest wish to save the planet , climate change has been a central topic in the media and extreme weather has prompted a feeling among many that change is necessary . then again , it could just be the power of the buck as " going green " could make good business sense . " green " business practices are becoming so popular , that us colleges and universities are beginning to offer sustainability or " green " masters of business administration -lrb- mba -rrb- programs , and companies , including even wal-mart stores inc . , are analyzing ways to increase profits by cutting down on waste and lowering energy costs . " it 's important that you make money when trying to help the environment , " said latif .
" once people , not just in the us , but everywhere , realize that this is really a big market , things will change and the climate will benefit . " all that wind and sunshine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german solar cells are particularly adept at absorbing the sun 's rays the scientist added that he sees money is to be made in renewable energies such as solar , geo-thermal , wind and water , all of which are abundantly available in california .
germans respect the us 's ability to forge territory when it comes to research and development .
" the first step has been that the us has recognized the climate problem , " he said .
" now , the task is finding ways for europe and the us to work together in developing better technology , which the us is so good at anyway . " furthermore , morin said that the pew study showed that environmental problems were one of the few threats in which people said their own country should take the lead dealing with the issue . " this signals great impatience on the part of people everywhere to do something on this issue , " he said .

a german media report said the government no longer questioned the project .
now , just the financial details need to be clarified . the german government reportedly no longer wants to block a high-speed train connection between munich 's city center and its airport .
according to thursday 's edition of the daily die welt , german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee and bavaria 's economics minister erwin huber will meet at the end of august to clarify the financing of the project . " as soon as we 've reached agreement on the financing , we want to wind up the project quickly , " the paper quoted sources at the federal transport ministry . it is expected to cost at least 1.85 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.54 billion -rrb- . the high-speed magnetic levitation -lrb- " maglev " -rrb- train project had been called into question after a crash on a test track last year killed 23 people and injured 10 . eu funding could support transrapid the project 's financing is , however , a major hurdle .
the federal government has already earmarked 550 million euros in its budget for it .
bavaria would provide some 300 million euros and german railway deutsche bahn 185 million euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the transrapid crash in 2006 caused the first fatalities on a maglev train tiefensee has said that the federal government was only prepared to foot half of the bill .
according to transport experts , this left a financing gap of 350 million euros . bavaria 's premier edmund stoiber has therefore appealed to the european union for subsidies .
european commission president jose manuel barroso , who is currently on a three-day-visist to bavaria , has agreed to examine the request .
bavaria hopes the eu could provide at least 100 million euros out of its fund for high-tech and transport projects . construction could be postponed the transrapid line would connect the bavarian capital with its airport , just under 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- away .
it would reduce the travel time from 40 to 10 minutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china operates the only commercial transrapid connection in the world once agreement has been reached on financing , the railway authorities could authorize construction at the end of 2007 at the earliest , die welt said .
but opponents have already announced they will seek to block the project at the federal administrative court in leipzig . there has been much debate in germany about a suitable location to build a line since the 1990s .
the world 's only commercial transrapid line operates in china between shanghai and its airport .
a connection in germany would be operated by deutsche bahn , the paper said . the transrapid , which floats on a magnetic cushion instead of riding on tracks , was developed by a joint venture between german industrial giants siemens and thyssenkrupp .
it can reach top speeds of 450 kilometers per hour . article based on news reports -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

andreas schleicher , a coordinator of pisa , the oecd 's program for international student assessment which compares educational achievement in different countries , said the training of teachers in particular needed to be radically revamped .
in germany , there 's an attempt by " teachers who have been trained in the 20th century to teach children of the 21st century in a school system that was conceived in the 19th century , " schleicher said .
he added that school teachers sorely needed a more hands-on training approach .
germany still reeling under pisa shock the criticism is not new .
in recent years , germany 's education system has taken a severe battering after a string of pisa study results showed the country 's exalted schools to be trailing internationally .
in 2001 , germany ranked only 21st in reading skills and 20th in math and science among 31 countries assessed .

in no other industrialized nation was school success so strongly linked to the social origin of its students , munoz said in the report .
he urged germany to rethink its school structure .
whereas most other european countries have moved on to more inclusive school systems , germany has essentially stuck to a three-tier structure which means that children are only 10 -lrb- or 12 in berlin -rrb- when their high school is chosen .
for nearly half of foreign students , it 's the hauptschule which prepares them for low-skilled jobs .
only 14 percent go to a pre-university gymnasium , compared with a national average of a third .
the drop-out rate for children of immigrant backgrounds is three times the national average .
only at the grundschule , or elementary school , are pupils from all ability groups taught together .
experts urge government to wake up to reality though the shock caused by the international studies has triggered some reform activity in german schools , critics say it 's all taking place within the existing system .

andreas schleicher , a coordinator of pisa , the oecd 's program for international student assessment which compares educational achievement in different countries , said the training of teachers in particular needed to be radically revamped .
in germany , there 's an attempt by " teachers who have been trained in the 20th century to teach children of the 21st century in a school system that was conceived in the 19th century , " schleicher said .
he added that school teachers sorely needed a more hands-on training approach .
germany still reeling under pisa shock the criticism is not new .
in recent years , germany 's education system has taken a severe battering after a string of pisa study results showed the country 's exalted schools to be trailing internationally .
in 2001 , germany ranked only 21st in reading skills and 20th in math and science among 31 countries assessed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munoz , right , with german education minister annette schavan in march this year , the country was dealt another blow when un special education envoy vernor munoz - amid protests by germany 's federal education ministers - published a damning report saying the class-based three-tier school system was selective , discriminatory and undemocratic by shutting out children from immigrant and poorer backgrounds .
in no other industrialized nation was school success so strongly linked to the social origin of its students , munoz said in the report .
he urged germany to rethink its school structure .
whereas most other european countries have moved on to more inclusive school systems , germany has essentially stuck to a three-tier structure which means that children are only 10 -lrb- or 12 in berlin -rrb- when their high school is chosen .
for nearly half of foreign students , it 's the hauptschule which prepares them for low-skilled jobs .
only 14 percent go to a pre-university gymnasium , compared with a national average of a third .
the drop-out rate for children of immigrant backgrounds is three times the national average .
only at the grundschule , or elementary school , are pupils from all ability groups taught together .
experts urge government to wake up to reality though the shock caused by the international studies has triggered some reform activity in german schools , critics say it 's all taking place within the existing system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say germany 's three-tier school structure is discriminatory at the conference in berlin , experts , including munoz , said the german government has yet to react to the un special envoy 's drastic recommendations .
marianne demmer , head of the teachers ' union , gew , said the german government and the federal states - which are responsible for education - needed to finally stop reacting to munoz 's criticism " with a mixture of hurt , aggression and arrogance . "
demmer urged german president horst köhler to step in and ignite a national debate on munoz 's reform proposals .
she also demanded that the human right to education be anchored both in germany 's basic law and in state constitutions .
critics have also slammed german federal education ministers for their refusal to participate in an international pisa study for teachers .

" van schijndel said that rabobank will decide after the tour whether it will continue sponsoring the cycling team . bildunterschrift : the tour de france takes riders over 3,547 kilometers tour organizers said that if they had been informed in time , they would not have allowed rasmussen to race . " michael rasmussen never should have started the tour , " said patrice clerc , head of the amaury sport organization , which runs the tour .
" the champion must be unimpeachable , an example . " on thursday , french newspaper france soir ran a mock obituary for the scandal-tainted race on its cover .
it said the tour died thursday " at age 104 , after a long illness . " the liberation daily wrote that the race had become a joke and should be canceled . " this procession of cyclists has been transformed into a caravan of ridicule , " the paper 's editorial said .
" if the organizers really want to save cycling , they should stop the competition and declare a pause of a few years , enough time to treat these athletes-turned-druggies . " cofidis team quits rasmussen 's departure is the latest blow to the tour 's credibility , and the third doping bombshell to shake the race in two days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pre-race favorite alexander vinokourov also tested positive for doping on wednesday , just hours before the rasmussen announcement , france 's number one team cofidis pulled out of the race .

he received the same treatment at the awards ceremony at the conclusion of the stage , which he won . rasmussen , a former cross-country cycling world champion , led the tour standings ahead of second-place alberto contador of spain by three minutes and 10 seconds in the overall standings after wednesday 's stage .
he had seemed certain to win the championship . contador - who has been linked to the spanish doping probe centering on eufemiano fuentes and for that reason was not allowed to compete in the 2006 tour - now leads the tour . the tour de france ends on sunday in paris . article based on news reports -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 26.07.2007 folk music fans accuse german tv of discrimination großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dream couple of volksmusik marianne and michael will soon be hosting one less show volksmusik fans in germany were glued to their televisions on thursday night for the last episode of " lustige musikanten . "
public broadcaster zdf is cancelling the folk music program and older fans are up in arms . " lustige musikanten " or " the merry musicians " is one of many folk music programs on german television .
hosted by marianne and michael - the dream couple of volksmusik - the show , however , takes its final curtain call on thursday night . public broadcaster zdf said it was not renewing the respective contracts due to planned program reforms for 2008 .
the channel said it wanted to make itself more attractive for younger viewers .
yodeling singers in dirndls and lederhosen apparently just were n't doing the trick . a recent poll showed that in the first six months of 2007 , zdf only held a market share of 6.6 percent in the 14-to-49 year-old range - one of the worst results in the station 's history . according to media reports , the lobby group for the german-speaking popular music industry " arbeitsgemeinschaft deutscher schlager und volksmusik " -lrb- ads -rrb- is now contemplating legal action against zdf . exclusion violates anti-discrimination laws manfred knöpke , head of ads , said the group criticized zdf 's justification of wanting to make the channel younger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is n't hip enough for young viewers " this means older people are being excluded , " knöpke said in interviews with various german papers .
" in our opinion , this violates the anti-discrimination law . "
ads has now ordered a legal expert analysis whether a lawsuit against zdf would be viable . " if the stations take volksmusik shows out of their programs because the viewers are too old , then several parts of the population are being shut out , " he said . ads has gotten support from trude unruh , head of the senior citizens ' activist group gray panthers . " this is an insult to everyone who rebuilt germany after the war , " unruh told the mass circulation paper bild am sonntag . senior citizens should n't be underestimated as consumers according to knöpke , zdf 's program policies were not forward-looking .
he said many sectors had recognized that it was n't the 14-to-49 year-olds that were the most interesting target group , but rather those over 50 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heino is one of germany 's most popular volksmusik singers " the industry is just beginning to discover the growing group of senior citizens as consumers , " he said . whether zdf 's new policies will attract younger viewers remained to be seen .
according to knöpke , when it came to music , young people would stick to mtv and viva anyway . zdf is reportedly unperturbed by the uproar .
it said no one had a right to a specific type of music on television . some media have also questioned ads ' motivations .
the group , with some 12,000 members , represents the interests of musicians , management , record companies and other institutions which live off of volksmusik .
public television is a major source of publicity for their work . article based on news reports -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the euro-zone 's biggest economy is expected to continue its upswing in the second half of the year . a survey of 7,000 german firms showed companies viewed their business operations and prospects with less optimism for the next six months than they had earlier in 2007 , according to figures released thursday by ifo , a munich-based economic research institute .
the widely-watched business climate index fell to 106.4 points in july from 107 points in june , ifo said in a statement .
that 's the lowest level since october 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer confidence has helped the german economy " the companies polled judged their current business situation as positively as last month but their business outlook for the next half year does not look quite as favorable , " ifo president hans-werner sinn said in a statement .
" -lsb- nevertheless -rsb- these results indicate the economic recovery will continue in the second half . "
it 's the third consecutive month that companies have downgraded their view of the business climate .
high oil prices , rising interest rates and a strong euro have fuelled fears that the german economy might slow after booking a 2.8 percent growth rate in 2006 . economy expected to stay strong in 2007 " we 've crossed the high point in growth and we 'll now see a slight slowdown , but nothing dramatic , " matthias rubisch , an economist at commerzbank ag in frankfurt told bloomberg news .
" the strong euro , energy prices and rising interest rates were negative influences . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tanking up is expensive the german economy will continue to grow in the upcoming months amid signs of a continuing fall in unemployment , sinn said .
german economists have projected a 2007 growth rate at or above last year 's level , but feel it might slip towards 2 percent in 2008 .
strong exports and consumer spending have helped fuel recent growth rates .
interest hike likely delayed business confidence has also recently fallen in other european countries such as italy , belgium and the netherlands .
the drop in business confidence combined with a rise in the money supply means the european central bank will likely delay an interest rate hike until late this year , analysts said .
matthias rubisch of commerzbank said the ifo backed up the bank 's forecast that the german economy will lose steam over the coming months .
" although the index remains at a very high level historically , it would be unwise to ignore the recent downward trend , " he told afp news agency .
" we still envisage strong second-half growth above the long-term average , but not at the pace of last year .

"
public broadcaster zdf is cancelling the folk music program and older fans are up in arms . " lustige musikanten " or " the merry musicians " is one of many folk music programs on german television .
hosted by marianne and michael - the dream couple of volksmusik - the show , however , takes its final curtain call on thursday night . public broadcaster zdf said it was not renewing the respective contracts due to planned program reforms for 2008 .
the channel said it wanted to make itself more attractive for younger viewers .
yodeling singers in dirndls and lederhosen apparently just were n't doing the trick . a recent poll showed that in the first six months of 2007 , zdf only held a market share of 6.6 percent in the 14-to-49 year-old range - one of the worst results in the station 's history . according to media reports , the lobby group for the german-speaking popular music industry " arbeitsgemeinschaft deutscher schlager und volksmusik " -lrb- ads -rrb- is now contemplating legal action against zdf . exclusion violates anti-discrimination laws manfred knöpke , head of ads , said the group criticized zdf 's justification of wanting to make the channel younger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is n't hip enough for young viewers " this means older people are being excluded , " knöpke said in interviews with various german papers .
" in our opinion , this violates the anti-discrimination law . "
ads has now ordered a legal expert analysis whether a lawsuit against zdf would be viable . " if the stations take volksmusik shows out of their programs because the viewers are too old , then several parts of the population are being shut out , " he said . ads has gotten support from trude unruh , head of the senior citizens ' activist group gray panthers . " this is an insult to everyone who rebuilt germany after the war , " unruh told the mass circulation paper bild am sonntag . senior citizens should n't be underestimated as consumers according to knöpke , zdf 's program policies were not forward-looking .
he said many sectors had recognized that it was n't the 14-to-49 year-olds that were the most interesting target group , but rather those over 50 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heino is one of germany 's most popular volksmusik singers " the industry is just beginning to discover the growing group of senior citizens as consumers , " he said . whether zdf 's new policies will attract younger viewers remained to be seen .
according to knöpke , when it came to music , young people would stick to mtv and viva anyway . zdf is reportedly unperturbed by the uproar .
it said no one had a right to a specific type of music on television . some media have also questioned ads ' motivations .
the group , with some 12,000 members , represents the interests of musicians , management , record companies and other institutions which live off of volksmusik .

but the euro-zone 's biggest economy is expected to continue its upswing in the second half of the year . a survey of 7,000 german firms showed companies viewed their business operations and prospects with less optimism for the next six months than they had earlier in 2007 , according to figures released thursday by ifo , a munich-based economic research institute .
the widely-watched business climate index fell to 106.4 points in july from 107 points in june , ifo said in a statement .
that 's the lowest level since october 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer confidence has helped the german economy " the companies polled judged their current business situation as positively as last month but their business outlook for the next half year does not look quite as favorable , " ifo president hans-werner sinn said in a statement .
" -lsb- nevertheless -rsb- these results indicate the economic recovery will continue in the second half . "
it 's the third consecutive month that companies have downgraded their view of the business climate .
high oil prices , rising interest rates and a strong euro have fuelled fears that the german economy might slow after booking a 2.8 percent growth rate in 2006 . economy expected to stay strong in 2007 " we 've crossed the high point in growth and we 'll now see a slight slowdown , but nothing dramatic , " matthias rubisch , an economist at commerzbank ag in frankfurt told bloomberg news .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tanking up is expensive the german economy will continue to grow in the upcoming months amid signs of a continuing fall in unemployment , sinn said .
german economists have projected a 2007 growth rate at or above last year 's level , but feel it might slip towards 2 percent in 2008 .
strong exports and consumer spending have helped fuel recent growth rates .
interest hike likely delayed business confidence has also recently fallen in other european countries such as italy , belgium and the netherlands .
the drop in business confidence combined with a rise in the money supply means the european central bank will likely delay an interest rate hike until late this year , analysts said .
matthias rubisch of commerzbank said the ifo backed up the bank 's forecast that the german economy will lose steam over the coming months .
" although the index remains at a very high level historically , it would be unwise to ignore the recent downward trend , " he told afp news agency .

andreas schleicher , a coordinator of pisa , the oecd 's program for international student assessment which compares educational achievement in different countries , said the training of teachers in particular needed to be radically revamped .
in germany , there 's an attempt by " teachers who have been trained in the 20th century to teach children of the 21st century in a school system that was conceived in the 19th century , " schleicher said .
he added that school teachers sorely needed a more hands-on training approach .
germany still reeling under pisa shock the criticism is not new .
in recent years , germany 's education system has taken a severe battering after a string of pisa study results showed the country 's exalted schools to be trailing internationally .
in 2001 , germany ranked only 21st in reading skills and 20th in math and science among 31 countries assessed .

in no other industrialized nation was school success so strongly linked to the social origin of its students , munoz said in the report .
he urged germany to rethink its school structure .
whereas most other european countries have moved on to more inclusive school systems , germany has essentially stuck to a three-tier structure which means that children are only 10 -lrb- or 12 in berlin -rrb- when their high school is chosen .
for nearly half of foreign students , it 's the hauptschule which prepares them for low-skilled jobs .
only 14 percent go to a pre-university gymnasium , compared with a national average of a third .
the drop-out rate for children of immigrant backgrounds is three times the national average .
only at the grundschule , or elementary school , are pupils from all ability groups taught together .
experts urge government to wake up to reality though the shock caused by the international studies has triggered some reform activity in german schools , critics say it 's all taking place within the existing system .

andreas schleicher , a coordinator of pisa , the oecd 's program for international student assessment which compares educational achievement in different countries , said the training of teachers in particular needed to be radically revamped .
in germany , there 's an attempt by " teachers who have been trained in the 20th century to teach children of the 21st century in a school system that was conceived in the 19th century , " schleicher said .
he added that school teachers sorely needed a more hands-on training approach .
germany still reeling under pisa shock the criticism is not new .
in recent years , germany 's education system has taken a severe battering after a string of pisa study results showed the country 's exalted schools to be trailing internationally .
in 2001 , germany ranked only 21st in reading skills and 20th in math and science among 31 countries assessed .

in no other industrialized nation was school success so strongly linked to the social origin of its students , munoz said in the report .
he urged germany to rethink its school structure .
whereas most other european countries have moved on to more inclusive school systems , germany has essentially stuck to a three-tier structure which means that children are only 10 -lrb- or 12 in berlin -rrb- when their high school is chosen .
for nearly half of foreign students , it 's the hauptschule which prepares them for low-skilled jobs .
only 14 percent go to a pre-university gymnasium , compared with a national average of a third .
the drop-out rate for children of immigrant backgrounds is three times the national average .
only at the grundschule , or elementary school , are pupils from all ability groups taught together .
experts urge government to wake up to reality though the shock caused by the international studies has triggered some reform activity in german schools , critics say it 's all taking place within the existing system .

in addition to an earnest wish to save the planet , climate change has been a central topic in the media and extreme weather has prompted a feeling among many that change is necessary . then again , it could just be the power of the buck as " going green " could make good business sense . " green " business practices are becoming so popular , that us colleges and universities are beginning to offer sustainability or " green " masters of business administration -lrb- mba -rrb- programs , and companies , including even wal-mart stores inc . , are analyzing ways to increase profits by cutting down on waste and lowering energy costs . " it 's important that you make money when trying to help the environment , " said latif .

germans respect the us 's ability to forge territory when it comes to research and development .
" the first step has been that the us has recognized the climate problem , " he said .
" now , the task is finding ways for europe and the us to work together in developing better technology , which the us is so good at anyway . " furthermore , morin said that the pew study showed that environmental problems were one of the few threats in which people said their own country should take the lead dealing with the issue .

" people here in germany and in the european union have some reservations about the us and climate protection because the country refused to endorse the kyoto protocol and therefore limit co2 emissions , " said mojib latif of the leibniz institute of marine sciences at kiel university in germany . germany on track bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could fuel for the future come from a us-eu partnership ?
" germany , on the other hand , has cut its emissions since 1990 by about 20 percent and is basically on kyoto track , " said latif , a scientist who has written on the influence of human activity on climate change and has worked extensively in the us . but it 's not just in germany and the rest of the eu that america 's environmental reputation has taken a beating .
a 37-nation survey published in june as part of the " global attitudes project " of the washington-based pew center showed that there is a " general increase in the percentage of people citing pollution and environmental problems as a top global threat . " rich morin , one of the authors of the study , said that : " in 34 of the 37 countries we surveyed , the united states was named by a majority or large plurality as the country that has done the most to damage the world 's air , water and natural spaces . " morin added that : " it is telling that fully a third of americans agree that we do the most damage - a degree of candor not usually found in americans . " but when looking for ways to minimize the damage done , it may not be washington , however , to which people turn , but the golden state of california , which could brighten the us 's blemished appearance .
light at the end of the tunnel ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar energy is gaining up adherents in the usa california governor arnold schwarzenegger made headlines around the world when he signed a bill to commit california to cutting its co2 emissions , which are blamed for global warming , by 25 percent by 2020 . as the california-based website green-technology.org wrote , " governor schwarzenegger has asked the state to ' lead by example , ' demonstrating that sustainability is achievable , desirable and economically sensible . " " green " businesses and web sites are cropping up in the state as a result .
while " merely " a us state -lrb- though the country 's most populated -rrb- , it ranks among the world 's 10 largest economies . according to the center for the continuing study of the california economy , the golden state 's gross domestic product in 2006 reached slightly more than $ 1.7 trillion -lrb- 1.2 trillion euros -rrb- . while california is often viewed as " way out there " - geographically and psychologically - by americans in many other parts of the us , the hope is that " green " ideas will trickle into the plans instituted in other us states . environmental alarms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flooding in great britain is one of the latest environmental disasters experts said a number of factors have come together to focus americans ' attention on the climate .
in addition to an earnest wish to save the planet , climate change has been a central topic in the media and extreme weather has prompted a feeling among many that change is necessary . then again , it could just be the power of the buck as " going green " could make good business sense . " green " business practices are becoming so popular , that us colleges and universities are beginning to offer sustainability or " green " masters of business administration -lrb- mba -rrb- programs , and companies , including even wal-mart stores inc . , are analyzing ways to increase profits by cutting down on waste and lowering energy costs . " it 's important that you make money when trying to help the environment , " said latif .
" once people , not just in the us , but everywhere , realize that this is really a big market , things will change and the climate will benefit . " all that wind and sunshine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german solar cells are particularly adept at absorbing the sun 's rays the scientist added that he sees money is to be made in renewable energies such as solar , geo-thermal , wind and water , all of which are abundantly available in california .
germans respect the us 's ability to forge territory when it comes to research and development .
" the first step has been that the us has recognized the climate problem , " he said .
" now , the task is finding ways for europe and the us to work together in developing better technology , which the us is so good at anyway . " furthermore , morin said that the pew study showed that environmental problems were one of the few threats in which people said their own country should take the lead dealing with the issue . " this signals great impatience on the part of people everywhere to do something on this issue , " he said .
" i would not wait for the us ; it 's easy to find excuses for action rather than find solutions . " louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not everybody , it seems , enjoyed seeing richard wagner dancing in his underwear . germany 's annual bayreuth festival of wagner operas began on wednesday with a highly anticipated , make-or-break production by the 29-year-old great-granddaughter of the composer richard wagner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an opera buff who also happens to be close to the people : angela merkel and while the applause after the first two acts of wagner 's only " comic " opera was friendly , the audience - which included a smorgasbord of german political and social elite - was less amused by the third and final act , which featured a few minutes of full frontal nudity , a bizarre sight of richard wagner dancing in his underwear and a bunch of master singers horsing around the stage with oversized penises .
when , at the end of the marathon seven-hour performance , which included 2 one-hour breaks , visibly nervous katharina wagner took to the stage , she was greeted with boos , hisses , jeers and whistles as well as bravos and cries of approval .
the bayreuth audience proved itself to be worthy of the music genre : dramatic , passionate and self-involved to the point of absurdity .
a red-carpet affair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a family business : katharina wagner with father wolfgang and mother gudrun camera teams and hundreds of onlookers were outside the 19th century festival theater to see katharina in a backless frock arrive to the opening with her father wolfgang wagner , the famous composer 's 87-year-old grandson .
other prominent guests included german chancellor angela merkel , eu commission president jose manuel barroso and a host of german and european glitterati such as bavarian aristocrat gloria von thurn und taxis , germany 's most famous tv showmaster thomas gottschalk and old-time crooner roberto blanco , who has demonstrated a remarkable talent at being frequently resurrected from oblivion .
katharina wagner , who hopes to be appointed festival director in succession to her father wolfgang , who 's been in charge of the festival since 1951 , told reporters that last-minute rehearsals were needed because of " technical problems . "
new ideas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : princess gloria von thurn und taxis with her daughters in an interview published on wednesday , wagner said new ideas were vital to keep the festival young at heart .
she told the german daily süddeutsche zeitung that the festival had to claw back from the opera houses its avant-garde role in wagner interpretation .
" my concern is not to just preserve but to develop something new as well , " she said .
" bayreuth can dare to experiment , " she said , pointing to past engagements of two of the shock directors of german theater , the late heiner müller in 1993 for " tristan and isolde " and christoph schlingensief in 2004 for " parsifal . "
a family saga katharina wagner - the youngest-ever director and the first woman ever to have been entrusted with staging an opera at the festival established by her great-grandfather 131 years ago - is , whether she likes to admit it or not , in the midst of an ongoing family feud .
bildunterschrift : a scene from the opera in what seems like a cross-over between a soap-opera and a royal-family intrigue , the wagners have been fighting over who will take over the festival management business for years .
the bayreuth board can hire anyone to run the public-funded festival , but the job is unique among german public appointments in always having been held by the wagner family .
after failing to establish his second wife gudrun as his successor , wolfgang wagner has put all his weight behind daughter katharina .
but katharina 's rival cousins eva wagner-pasquier and nike wagner , both 62 , also lay claim to the bayreuth throne .
eva is wolfgang 's daughter by his first marriage , while nike is the daughter of wolfgang 's brother wieland , who died in 1966 .
in the absence of a real royal family , the wagners are a god-given gift to those germans who like to combine their interests in high culture with society gossip .
a modern interpretation in a production that - perhaps to the shock of the hard-core , ultra-conservative wagnerites - did not feature a medieval town square and a cast that could be easily convinced to perform a dark , dogma-style , version of snow white and the seven dwarfs - katharina wagner decided to put her foot down in bayreuth as a modernizer par excellence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayreuth is the place to be seen : tv showman thomas gottschalk with his wife thea so she had sneakers raining from the sky .
even more importantly , however , while treating the opera as a kind of discourse on tradition and progress in art , she showed no particular respect for the actual plot .
in wagner 's original , walther von stolzing , a young knight , falls in love with the daughter of a rich nuremberg burgher and tries to win her heart by entering a singing contest - a medieval precursor to american idol and german superstar .
at first he is rejected by the master singers - the simon cowels and paula abduls of his time - for breaking all of their traditional rules .
eventually , however , his natural talent wins them over .
in essence , it 's a boy-gets-girl-by-showing-he-can-sing kind of story .
in katharina wagner 's staging , the hero is actually a wimp : a rebel who - in order to win the contest - becomes a conformist and emulator of his masters .
in modern speak : a hard-rocker , who in the american idol final , decides to sing a whitney houston ballad .
mixed reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reviews are yet to come in audience reactions to the unconventional production and critical response it receives could be decisive for wagner , either spoiling or boosting her ambitions .
achim barth , from frankfurt , dismissed the production as unnecessarily gimmicky .
" it 's runs completely contrary to the text , " barth said .
" it 's just nonsense .
modern for the sake of being modern . "
leading german daily newspapers were not due to publish reviews till friday but other media were quicker .
a reviewer for the web site of the weekly magazine der spiegel , for instance , compared the " overly intellectual " staging to a pizza : too many ingredients on a very thin base . no pressure wagner said she did not feel under any time pressure , since the post of festival director replacing her father , 87 , had not yet been advertised .
this year , the festival , which runs until aug .

not everybody , it seems , enjoyed seeing richard wagner dancing in his underwear . germany 's annual bayreuth festival of wagner operas began on wednesday with a highly anticipated , make-or-break production by the 29-year-old great-granddaughter of the composer richard wagner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an opera buff who also happens to be close to the people : angela merkel and while the applause after the first two acts of wagner 's only " comic " opera was friendly , the audience - which included a smorgasbord of german political and social elite - was less amused by the third and final act , which featured a few minutes of full frontal nudity , a bizarre sight of richard wagner dancing in his underwear and a bunch of master singers horsing around the stage with oversized penises .
when , at the end of the marathon seven-hour performance , which included 2 one-hour breaks , visibly nervous katharina wagner took to the stage , she was greeted with boos , hisses , jeers and whistles as well as bravos and cries of approval .
the bayreuth audience proved itself to be worthy of the music genre : dramatic , passionate and self-involved to the point of absurdity .
a red-carpet affair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a family business : katharina wagner with father wolfgang and mother gudrun camera teams and hundreds of onlookers were outside the 19th century festival theater to see katharina in a backless frock arrive to the opening with her father wolfgang wagner , the famous composer 's 87-year-old grandson .
other prominent guests included german chancellor angela merkel , eu commission president jose manuel barroso and a host of german and european glitterati such as bavarian aristocrat gloria von thurn und taxis , germany 's most famous tv showmaster thomas gottschalk and old-time crooner roberto blanco , who has demonstrated a remarkable talent at being frequently resurrected from oblivion .
katharina wagner , who hopes to be appointed festival director in succession to her father wolfgang , who 's been in charge of the festival since 1951 , told reporters that last-minute rehearsals were needed because of " technical problems . "
new ideas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : princess gloria von thurn und taxis with her daughters in an interview published on wednesday , wagner said new ideas were vital to keep the festival young at heart .
she told the german daily süddeutsche zeitung that the festival had to claw back from the opera houses its avant-garde role in wagner interpretation .
" my concern is not to just preserve but to develop something new as well , " she said .
" bayreuth can dare to experiment , " she said , pointing to past engagements of two of the shock directors of german theater , the late heiner müller in 1993 for " tristan and isolde " and christoph schlingensief in 2004 for " parsifal . "
a family saga katharina wagner - the youngest-ever director and the first woman ever to have been entrusted with staging an opera at the festival established by her great-grandfather 131 years ago - is , whether she likes to admit it or not , in the midst of an ongoing family feud .
bildunterschrift : a scene from the opera in what seems like a cross-over between a soap-opera and a royal-family intrigue , the wagners have been fighting over who will take over the festival management business for years .
the bayreuth board can hire anyone to run the public-funded festival , but the job is unique among german public appointments in always having been held by the wagner family .
after failing to establish his second wife gudrun as his successor , wolfgang wagner has put all his weight behind daughter katharina .
but katharina 's rival cousins eva wagner-pasquier and nike wagner , both 62 , also lay claim to the bayreuth throne .
eva is wolfgang 's daughter by his first marriage , while nike is the daughter of wolfgang 's brother wieland , who died in 1966 .
in the absence of a real royal family , the wagners are a god-given gift to those germans who like to combine their interests in high culture with society gossip .
a modern interpretation in a production that - perhaps to the shock of the hard-core , ultra-conservative wagnerites - did not feature a medieval town square and a cast that could be easily convinced to perform a dark , dogma-style , version of snow white and the seven dwarfs - katharina wagner decided to put her foot down in bayreuth as a modernizer par excellence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayreuth is the place to be seen : tv showman thomas gottschalk with his wife thea so she had sneakers raining from the sky .
even more importantly , however , while treating the opera as a kind of discourse on tradition and progress in art , she showed no particular respect for the actual plot .
in wagner 's original , walther von stolzing , a young knight , falls in love with the daughter of a rich nuremberg burgher and tries to win her heart by entering a singing contest - a medieval precursor to american idol and german superstar .
at first he is rejected by the master singers - the simon cowels and paula abduls of his time - for breaking all of their traditional rules .
eventually , however , his natural talent wins them over .
in essence , it 's a boy-gets-girl-by-showing-he-can-sing kind of story .
in katharina wagner 's staging , the hero is actually a wimp : a rebel who - in order to win the contest - becomes a conformist and emulator of his masters .
in modern speak : a hard-rocker , who in the american idol final , decides to sing a whitney houston ballad .
mixed reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reviews are yet to come in audience reactions to the unconventional production and critical response it receives could be decisive for wagner , either spoiling or boosting her ambitions .
achim barth , from frankfurt , dismissed the production as unnecessarily gimmicky .
" it 's runs completely contrary to the text , " barth said .
" it 's just nonsense .
modern for the sake of being modern . "
leading german daily newspapers were not due to publish reviews till friday but other media were quicker .
a reviewer for the web site of the weekly magazine der spiegel , for instance , compared the " overly intellectual " staging to a pizza : too many ingredients on a very thin base . no pressure wagner said she did not feel under any time pressure , since the post of festival director replacing her father , 87 , had not yet been advertised .
this year , the festival , which runs until aug .
28 , will also feature " the ring of the nibelung , " " tannhäuser " and re-runs of schlingensief 's " parsifal . "

the rabobank team has kicked michael rasmussen out , as more doping-related scandals tarnished the famous race 's reputation . the rabobank team will continue the tour de france on thursday , one day after suspending leader michael rasmussen .
the 33-year-old dane allegedly lied about his whereabouts , apparently to avoid out-of-competition doping tests . " on several occasions , he claimed he was training , and that was a lie , " said rabobank team director theo de rooy .
" team management was warned several times and had received new information on wednesday . " rasmussen was a controversial figure on the tour after he was kicked off the danish national cycling team for having missed two out-of-competition doping tests earlier in the year .
he is only the second tour de france leader to be booted in the 104-year history of the event .
in 1978 , michel pollentier of belgium had to leave after seemingly trying to cheat with urine that was not his . tour would have barred rasmussen rasmussen had told his team he was in mexico .
but a former cyclist , davide cassani , then said on wednesday he had seen him in italy .
confronted with the statement , rasmussen admitted to having lied and that he had in fact been in italy . " what has happened leaves me speechless , " said piet van schijndel from the rabobank board .
" i am lost for words .
it 's a nightmare . " van schijndel said that rabobank will decide after the tour whether it will continue sponsoring the cycling team . bildunterschrift : the tour de france takes riders over 3,547 kilometers tour organizers said that if they had been informed in time , they would not have allowed rasmussen to race .

a german media report said the government no longer questioned the project .
now , just the financial details need to be clarified . the german government reportedly no longer wants to block a high-speed train connection between munich 's city center and its airport .
according to thursday 's edition of the daily die welt , german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee and bavaria 's economics minister erwin huber will meet at the end of august to clarify the financing of the project . " as soon as we 've reached agreement on the financing , we want to wind up the project quickly , " the paper quoted sources at the federal transport ministry . it is expected to cost at least 1.85 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.54 billion -rrb- . the high-speed magnetic levitation -lrb- " maglev " -rrb- train project had been called into question after a crash on a test track last year killed 23 people and injured 10 . eu funding could support transrapid the project 's financing is , however , a major hurdle .
the federal government has already earmarked 550 million euros in its budget for it .
bavaria would provide some 300 million euros and german railway deutsche bahn 185 million euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the transrapid crash in 2006 caused the first fatalities on a maglev train tiefensee has said that the federal government was only prepared to foot half of the bill .
according to transport experts , this left a financing gap of 350 million euros . bavaria 's premier edmund stoiber has therefore appealed to the european union for subsidies .
european commission president jose manuel barroso , who is currently on a three-day-visist to bavaria , has agreed to examine the request .
bavaria hopes the eu could provide at least 100 million euros out of its fund for high-tech and transport projects . construction could be postponed the transrapid line would connect the bavarian capital with its airport , just under 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- away .
it would reduce the travel time from 40 to 10 minutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china operates the only commercial transrapid connection in the world once agreement has been reached on financing , the railway authorities could authorize construction at the end of 2007 at the earliest , die welt said .
but opponents have already announced they will seek to block the project at the federal administrative court in leipzig . there has been much debate in germany about a suitable location to build a line since the 1990s .
the world 's only commercial transrapid line operates in china between shanghai and its airport .
a connection in germany would be operated by deutsche bahn , the paper said . the transrapid , which floats on a magnetic cushion instead of riding on tracks , was developed by a joint venture between german industrial giants siemens and thyssenkrupp .
it can reach top speeds of 450 kilometers per hour . article based on news reports -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the euro-zone 's biggest economy is expected to continue its upswing in the second half of the year . a survey of 7,000 german firms showed companies viewed their business operations and prospects with less optimism for the next six months than they had earlier in 2007 , according to figures released thursday by ifo , a munich-based economic research institute .
the widely-watched business climate index fell to 106.4 points in july from 107 points in june , ifo said in a statement .
that 's the lowest level since october 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer confidence has helped the german economy " the companies polled judged their current business situation as positively as last month but their business outlook for the next half year does not look quite as favorable , " ifo president hans-werner sinn said in a statement .
" -lsb- nevertheless -rsb- these results indicate the economic recovery will continue in the second half . "
it 's the third consecutive month that companies have downgraded their view of the business climate .
high oil prices , rising interest rates and a strong euro have fuelled fears that the german economy might slow after booking a 2.8 percent growth rate in 2006 . economy expected to stay strong in 2007 " we 've crossed the high point in growth and we 'll now see a slight slowdown , but nothing dramatic , " matthias rubisch , an economist at commerzbank ag in frankfurt told bloomberg news .
" the strong euro , energy prices and rising interest rates were negative influences . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tanking up is expensive the german economy will continue to grow in the upcoming months amid signs of a continuing fall in unemployment , sinn said .
german economists have projected a 2007 growth rate at or above last year 's level , but feel it might slip towards 2 percent in 2008 .
strong exports and consumer spending have helped fuel recent growth rates .
interest hike likely delayed business confidence has also recently fallen in other european countries such as italy , belgium and the netherlands .
the drop in business confidence combined with a rise in the money supply means the european central bank will likely delay an interest rate hike until late this year , analysts said .
matthias rubisch of commerzbank said the ifo backed up the bank 's forecast that the german economy will lose steam over the coming months .
" although the index remains at a very high level historically , it would be unwise to ignore the recent downward trend , " he told afp news agency .
" we still envisage strong second-half growth above the long-term average , but not at the pace of last year .
no more than average growth now seems likely in 2008 . " article based on news reports -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the euro-zone 's biggest economy is expected to continue its upswing in the second half of the year . a survey of 7,000 german firms showed companies viewed their business operations and prospects with less optimism for the next six months than they had earlier in 2007 , according to figures released thursday by ifo , a munich-based economic research institute .
the widely-watched business climate index fell to 106.4 points in july from 107 points in june , ifo said in a statement .
that 's the lowest level since october 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer confidence has helped the german economy " the companies polled judged their current business situation as positively as last month but their business outlook for the next half year does not look quite as favorable , " ifo president hans-werner sinn said in a statement .
" -lsb- nevertheless -rsb- these results indicate the economic recovery will continue in the second half . "
it 's the third consecutive month that companies have downgraded their view of the business climate .
high oil prices , rising interest rates and a strong euro have fuelled fears that the german economy might slow after booking a 2.8 percent growth rate in 2006 . economy expected to stay strong in 2007 " we 've crossed the high point in growth and we 'll now see a slight slowdown , but nothing dramatic , " matthias rubisch , an economist at commerzbank ag in frankfurt told bloomberg news .
" the strong euro , energy prices and rising interest rates were negative influences . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tanking up is expensive the german economy will continue to grow in the upcoming months amid signs of a continuing fall in unemployment , sinn said .
german economists have projected a 2007 growth rate at or above last year 's level , but feel it might slip towards 2 percent in 2008 .
strong exports and consumer spending have helped fuel recent growth rates .
interest hike likely delayed business confidence has also recently fallen in other european countries such as italy , belgium and the netherlands .
the drop in business confidence combined with a rise in the money supply means the european central bank will likely delay an interest rate hike until late this year , analysts said .
matthias rubisch of commerzbank said the ifo backed up the bank 's forecast that the german economy will lose steam over the coming months .
" although the index remains at a very high level historically , it would be unwise to ignore the recent downward trend , " he told afp news agency .

not everybody , it seems , enjoyed seeing richard wagner dancing in his underwear . germany 's annual bayreuth festival of wagner operas began on wednesday with a highly anticipated , make-or-break production by the 29-year-old great-granddaughter of the composer richard wagner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an opera buff who also happens to be close to the people : angela merkel and while the applause after the first two acts of wagner 's only " comic " opera was friendly , the audience - which included a smorgasbord of german political and social elite - was less amused by the third and final act , which featured a few minutes of full frontal nudity , a bizarre sight of richard wagner dancing in his underwear and a bunch of master singers horsing around the stage with oversized penises .
when , at the end of the marathon seven-hour performance , which included 2 one-hour breaks , visibly nervous katharina wagner took to the stage , she was greeted with boos , hisses , jeers and whistles as well as bravos and cries of approval .
the bayreuth audience proved itself to be worthy of the music genre : dramatic , passionate and self-involved to the point of absurdity .
a red-carpet affair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a family business : katharina wagner with father wolfgang and mother gudrun camera teams and hundreds of onlookers were outside the 19th century festival theater to see katharina in a backless frock arrive to the opening with her father wolfgang wagner , the famous composer 's 87-year-old grandson .
other prominent guests included german chancellor angela merkel , eu commission president jose manuel barroso and a host of german and european glitterati such as bavarian aristocrat gloria von thurn und taxis , germany 's most famous tv showmaster thomas gottschalk and old-time crooner roberto blanco , who has demonstrated a remarkable talent at being frequently resurrected from oblivion .
katharina wagner , who hopes to be appointed festival director in succession to her father wolfgang , who 's been in charge of the festival since 1951 , told reporters that last-minute rehearsals were needed because of " technical problems . "
new ideas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : princess gloria von thurn und taxis with her daughters in an interview published on wednesday , wagner said new ideas were vital to keep the festival young at heart .
she told the german daily süddeutsche zeitung that the festival had to claw back from the opera houses its avant-garde role in wagner interpretation .
" my concern is not to just preserve but to develop something new as well , " she said .
" bayreuth can dare to experiment , " she said , pointing to past engagements of two of the shock directors of german theater , the late heiner müller in 1993 for " tristan and isolde " and christoph schlingensief in 2004 for " parsifal . "
a family saga katharina wagner - the youngest-ever director and the first woman ever to have been entrusted with staging an opera at the festival established by her great-grandfather 131 years ago - is , whether she likes to admit it or not , in the midst of an ongoing family feud .
bildunterschrift : a scene from the opera in what seems like a cross-over between a soap-opera and a royal-family intrigue , the wagners have been fighting over who will take over the festival management business for years .
the bayreuth board can hire anyone to run the public-funded festival , but the job is unique among german public appointments in always having been held by the wagner family .
after failing to establish his second wife gudrun as his successor , wolfgang wagner has put all his weight behind daughter katharina .
but katharina 's rival cousins eva wagner-pasquier and nike wagner , both 62 , also lay claim to the bayreuth throne .
eva is wolfgang 's daughter by his first marriage , while nike is the daughter of wolfgang 's brother wieland , who died in 1966 .
in the absence of a real royal family , the wagners are a god-given gift to those germans who like to combine their interests in high culture with society gossip .
a modern interpretation in a production that - perhaps to the shock of the hard-core , ultra-conservative wagnerites - did not feature a medieval town square and a cast that could be easily convinced to perform a dark , dogma-style , version of snow white and the seven dwarfs - katharina wagner decided to put her foot down in bayreuth as a modernizer par excellence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayreuth is the place to be seen : tv showman thomas gottschalk with his wife thea so she had sneakers raining from the sky .
even more importantly , however , while treating the opera as a kind of discourse on tradition and progress in art , she showed no particular respect for the actual plot .
in wagner 's original , walther von stolzing , a young knight , falls in love with the daughter of a rich nuremberg burgher and tries to win her heart by entering a singing contest - a medieval precursor to american idol and german superstar .
at first he is rejected by the master singers - the simon cowels and paula abduls of his time - for breaking all of their traditional rules .
eventually , however , his natural talent wins them over .
in essence , it 's a boy-gets-girl-by-showing-he-can-sing kind of story .
in katharina wagner 's staging , the hero is actually a wimp : a rebel who - in order to win the contest - becomes a conformist and emulator of his masters .
in modern speak : a hard-rocker , who in the american idol final , decides to sing a whitney houston ballad .
mixed reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reviews are yet to come in audience reactions to the unconventional production and critical response it receives could be decisive for wagner , either spoiling or boosting her ambitions .
achim barth , from frankfurt , dismissed the production as unnecessarily gimmicky .
" it 's runs completely contrary to the text , " barth said .
" it 's just nonsense .
modern for the sake of being modern . "
leading german daily newspapers were not due to publish reviews till friday but other media were quicker .
a reviewer for the web site of the weekly magazine der spiegel , for instance , compared the " overly intellectual " staging to a pizza : too many ingredients on a very thin base . no pressure wagner said she did not feel under any time pressure , since the post of festival director replacing her father , 87 , had not yet been advertised .
this year , the festival , which runs until aug .
28 , will also feature " the ring of the nibelung , " " tannhäuser " and re-runs of schlingensief 's " parsifal . "
all 54,000 available tickets to the 30 performances have been sold out .
organizers received 460,500 applications and preferred applicants , who had been applying for eight years or more . article based on news reports -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the rabobank team has kicked michael rasmussen out , as more doping-related scandals tarnished the famous race 's reputation . the rabobank team will continue the tour de france on thursday , one day after suspending leader michael rasmussen .
the 33-year-old dane allegedly lied about his whereabouts , apparently to avoid out-of-competition doping tests . " on several occasions , he claimed he was training , and that was a lie , " said rabobank team director theo de rooy .
" team management was warned several times and had received new information on wednesday . " rasmussen was a controversial figure on the tour after he was kicked off the danish national cycling team for having missed two out-of-competition doping tests earlier in the year .
he is only the second tour de france leader to be booted in the 104-year history of the event .
in 1978 , michel pollentier of belgium had to leave after seemingly trying to cheat with urine that was not his . tour would have barred rasmussen rasmussen had told his team he was in mexico .
but a former cyclist , davide cassani , then said on wednesday he had seen him in italy .
confronted with the statement , rasmussen admitted to having lied and that he had in fact been in italy . " what has happened leaves me speechless , " said piet van schijndel from the rabobank board .
" i am lost for words .
it 's a nightmare . " van schijndel said that rabobank will decide after the tour whether it will continue sponsoring the cycling team . bildunterschrift : the tour de france takes riders over 3,547 kilometers tour organizers said that if they had been informed in time , they would not have allowed rasmussen to race . " michael rasmussen never should have started the tour , " said patrice clerc , head of the amaury sport organization , which runs the tour .
" the champion must be unimpeachable , an example . " on thursday , french newspaper france soir ran a mock obituary for the scandal-tainted race on its cover .
it said the tour died thursday " at age 104 , after a long illness . " the liberation daily wrote that the race had become a joke and should be canceled . " this procession of cyclists has been transformed into a caravan of ridicule , " the paper 's editorial said .
" if the organizers really want to save cycling , they should stop the competition and declare a pause of a few years , enough time to treat these athletes-turned-druggies . " cofidis team quits rasmussen 's departure is the latest blow to the tour 's credibility , and the third doping bombshell to shake the race in two days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pre-race favorite alexander vinokourov also tested positive for doping on wednesday , just hours before the rasmussen announcement , france 's number one team cofidis pulled out of the race .
it had been revealed that its italian rider cristian moreni tested positive for synthetic testosterone after the 11th stage on july 19 . on tuesday , the astana team of pre-race favorite alexander vinokourov of kazakhstan quit the race after the announcement that vinokourov tested positive for an illegal blood transfusion . rasmussen was jeered and whistled at by spectators before the start of the 16th stage in the pyrenees on wednesday .
he received the same treatment at the awards ceremony at the conclusion of the stage , which he won . rasmussen , a former cross-country cycling world champion , led the tour standings ahead of second-place alberto contador of spain by three minutes and 10 seconds in the overall standings after wednesday 's stage .
he had seemed certain to win the championship . contador - who has been linked to the spanish doping probe centering on eufemiano fuentes and for that reason was not allowed to compete in the 2006 tour - now leads the tour . the tour de france ends on sunday in paris . article based on news reports -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 33-year-old dane allegedly lied about his whereabouts , apparently to avoid out-of-competition doping tests . " on several occasions , he claimed he was training , and that was a lie , " said rabobank team director theo de rooy .

andreas schleicher , a coordinator of pisa , the oecd 's program for international student assessment which compares educational achievement in different countries , said the training of teachers in particular needed to be radically revamped .
in germany , there 's an attempt by " teachers who have been trained in the 20th century to teach children of the 21st century in a school system that was conceived in the 19th century , " schleicher said .
he added that school teachers sorely needed a more hands-on training approach .
germany still reeling under pisa shock the criticism is not new .
in recent years , germany 's education system has taken a severe battering after a string of pisa study results showed the country 's exalted schools to be trailing internationally .
in 2001 , germany ranked only 21st in reading skills and 20th in math and science among 31 countries assessed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munoz , right , with german education minister annette schavan in march this year , the country was dealt another blow when un special education envoy vernor munoz - amid protests by germany 's federal education ministers - published a damning report saying the class-based three-tier school system was selective , discriminatory and undemocratic by shutting out children from immigrant and poorer backgrounds .
in no other industrialized nation was school success so strongly linked to the social origin of its students , munoz said in the report .
he urged germany to rethink its school structure .
whereas most other european countries have moved on to more inclusive school systems , germany has essentially stuck to a three-tier structure which means that children are only 10 -lrb- or 12 in berlin -rrb- when their high school is chosen .
for nearly half of foreign students , it 's the hauptschule which prepares them for low-skilled jobs .
only 14 percent go to a pre-university gymnasium , compared with a national average of a third .
the drop-out rate for children of immigrant backgrounds is three times the national average .
only at the grundschule , or elementary school , are pupils from all ability groups taught together .

not everybody , it seems , enjoyed seeing richard wagner dancing in his underwear . germany 's annual bayreuth festival of wagner operas began on wednesday with a highly anticipated , make-or-break production by the 29-year-old great-granddaughter of the composer richard wagner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an opera buff who also happens to be close to the people : angela merkel and while the applause after the first two acts of wagner 's only " comic " opera was friendly , the audience - which included a smorgasbord of german political and social elite - was less amused by the third and final act , which featured a few minutes of full frontal nudity , a bizarre sight of richard wagner dancing in his underwear and a bunch of master singers horsing around the stage with oversized penises .
when , at the end of the marathon seven-hour performance , which included 2 one-hour breaks , visibly nervous katharina wagner took to the stage , she was greeted with boos , hisses , jeers and whistles as well as bravos and cries of approval .
the bayreuth audience proved itself to be worthy of the music genre : dramatic , passionate and self-involved to the point of absurdity .
a red-carpet affair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a family business : katharina wagner with father wolfgang and mother gudrun camera teams and hundreds of onlookers were outside the 19th century festival theater to see katharina in a backless frock arrive to the opening with her father wolfgang wagner , the famous composer 's 87-year-old grandson .
other prominent guests included german chancellor angela merkel , eu commission president jose manuel barroso and a host of german and european glitterati such as bavarian aristocrat gloria von thurn und taxis , germany 's most famous tv showmaster thomas gottschalk and old-time crooner roberto blanco , who has demonstrated a remarkable talent at being frequently resurrected from oblivion .
katharina wagner , who hopes to be appointed festival director in succession to her father wolfgang , who 's been in charge of the festival since 1951 , told reporters that last-minute rehearsals were needed because of " technical problems . "
new ideas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : princess gloria von thurn und taxis with her daughters in an interview published on wednesday , wagner said new ideas were vital to keep the festival young at heart .
she told the german daily süddeutsche zeitung that the festival had to claw back from the opera houses its avant-garde role in wagner interpretation .
" my concern is not to just preserve but to develop something new as well , " she said .
" bayreuth can dare to experiment , " she said , pointing to past engagements of two of the shock directors of german theater , the late heiner müller in 1993 for " tristan and isolde " and christoph schlingensief in 2004 for " parsifal . "
a family saga katharina wagner - the youngest-ever director and the first woman ever to have been entrusted with staging an opera at the festival established by her great-grandfather 131 years ago - is , whether she likes to admit it or not , in the midst of an ongoing family feud .
bildunterschrift : a scene from the opera in what seems like a cross-over between a soap-opera and a royal-family intrigue , the wagners have been fighting over who will take over the festival management business for years .
the bayreuth board can hire anyone to run the public-funded festival , but the job is unique among german public appointments in always having been held by the wagner family .
after failing to establish his second wife gudrun as his successor , wolfgang wagner has put all his weight behind daughter katharina .
but katharina 's rival cousins eva wagner-pasquier and nike wagner , both 62 , also lay claim to the bayreuth throne .
eva is wolfgang 's daughter by his first marriage , while nike is the daughter of wolfgang 's brother wieland , who died in 1966 .
in the absence of a real royal family , the wagners are a god-given gift to those germans who like to combine their interests in high culture with society gossip .
a modern interpretation in a production that - perhaps to the shock of the hard-core , ultra-conservative wagnerites - did not feature a medieval town square and a cast that could be easily convinced to perform a dark , dogma-style , version of snow white and the seven dwarfs - katharina wagner decided to put her foot down in bayreuth as a modernizer par excellence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayreuth is the place to be seen : tv showman thomas gottschalk with his wife thea so she had sneakers raining from the sky .
even more importantly , however , while treating the opera as a kind of discourse on tradition and progress in art , she showed no particular respect for the actual plot .
in wagner 's original , walther von stolzing , a young knight , falls in love with the daughter of a rich nuremberg burgher and tries to win her heart by entering a singing contest - a medieval precursor to american idol and german superstar .
at first he is rejected by the master singers - the simon cowels and paula abduls of his time - for breaking all of their traditional rules .
eventually , however , his natural talent wins them over .
in essence , it 's a boy-gets-girl-by-showing-he-can-sing kind of story .
in katharina wagner 's staging , the hero is actually a wimp : a rebel who - in order to win the contest - becomes a conformist and emulator of his masters .
in modern speak : a hard-rocker , who in the american idol final , decides to sing a whitney houston ballad .
mixed reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reviews are yet to come in audience reactions to the unconventional production and critical response it receives could be decisive for wagner , either spoiling or boosting her ambitions .
achim barth , from frankfurt , dismissed the production as unnecessarily gimmicky .
" it 's runs completely contrary to the text , " barth said .
" it 's just nonsense .
modern for the sake of being modern . "
leading german daily newspapers were not due to publish reviews till friday but other media were quicker .
a reviewer for the web site of the weekly magazine der spiegel , for instance , compared the " overly intellectual " staging to a pizza : too many ingredients on a very thin base . no pressure wagner said she did not feel under any time pressure , since the post of festival director replacing her father , 87 , had not yet been advertised .
this year , the festival , which runs until aug .
28 , will also feature " the ring of the nibelung , " " tannhäuser " and re-runs of schlingensief 's " parsifal . "

a german media report said the government no longer questioned the project .
now , just the financial details need to be clarified . the german government reportedly no longer wants to block a high-speed train connection between munich 's city center and its airport .
according to thursday 's edition of the daily die welt , german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee and bavaria 's economics minister erwin huber will meet at the end of august to clarify the financing of the project . " as soon as we 've reached agreement on the financing , we want to wind up the project quickly , " the paper quoted sources at the federal transport ministry . it is expected to cost at least 1.85 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.54 billion -rrb- . the high-speed magnetic levitation -lrb- " maglev " -rrb- train project had been called into question after a crash on a test track last year killed 23 people and injured 10 . eu funding could support transrapid the project 's financing is , however , a major hurdle .
the federal government has already earmarked 550 million euros in its budget for it .
bavaria would provide some 300 million euros and german railway deutsche bahn 185 million euros . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the transrapid crash in 2006 caused the first fatalities on a maglev train tiefensee has said that the federal government was only prepared to foot half of the bill .
according to transport experts , this left a financing gap of 350 million euros . bavaria 's premier edmund stoiber has therefore appealed to the european union for subsidies .
european commission president jose manuel barroso , who is currently on a three-day-visist to bavaria , has agreed to examine the request .
bavaria hopes the eu could provide at least 100 million euros out of its fund for high-tech and transport projects . construction could be postponed the transrapid line would connect the bavarian capital with its airport , just under 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- away .
it would reduce the travel time from 40 to 10 minutes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china operates the only commercial transrapid connection in the world once agreement has been reached on financing , the railway authorities could authorize construction at the end of 2007 at the earliest , die welt said .
but opponents have already announced they will seek to block the project at the federal administrative court in leipzig . there has been much debate in germany about a suitable location to build a line since the 1990s .
the world 's only commercial transrapid line operates in china between shanghai and its airport .
a connection in germany would be operated by deutsche bahn , the paper said . the transrapid , which floats on a magnetic cushion instead of riding on tracks , was developed by a joint venture between german industrial giants siemens and thyssenkrupp .
it can reach top speeds of 450 kilometers per hour . article based on news reports -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the euro-zone 's biggest economy is expected to continue its upswing in the second half of the year . a survey of 7,000 german firms showed companies viewed their business operations and prospects with less optimism for the next six months than they had earlier in 2007 , according to figures released thursday by ifo , a munich-based economic research institute .
the widely-watched business climate index fell to 106.4 points in july from 107 points in june , ifo said in a statement .
that 's the lowest level since october 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumer confidence has helped the german economy " the companies polled judged their current business situation as positively as last month but their business outlook for the next half year does not look quite as favorable , " ifo president hans-werner sinn said in a statement .
" -lsb- nevertheless -rsb- these results indicate the economic recovery will continue in the second half . "
it 's the third consecutive month that companies have downgraded their view of the business climate .
high oil prices , rising interest rates and a strong euro have fuelled fears that the german economy might slow after booking a 2.8 percent growth rate in 2006 . economy expected to stay strong in 2007 " we 've crossed the high point in growth and we 'll now see a slight slowdown , but nothing dramatic , " matthias rubisch , an economist at commerzbank ag in frankfurt told bloomberg news .
" the strong euro , energy prices and rising interest rates were negative influences . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tanking up is expensive the german economy will continue to grow in the upcoming months amid signs of a continuing fall in unemployment , sinn said .
german economists have projected a 2007 growth rate at or above last year 's level , but feel it might slip towards 2 percent in 2008 .
strong exports and consumer spending have helped fuel recent growth rates .
interest hike likely delayed business confidence has also recently fallen in other european countries such as italy , belgium and the netherlands .
the drop in business confidence combined with a rise in the money supply means the european central bank will likely delay an interest rate hike until late this year , analysts said .
matthias rubisch of commerzbank said the ifo backed up the bank 's forecast that the german economy will lose steam over the coming months .
" although the index remains at a very high level historically , it would be unwise to ignore the recent downward trend , " he told afp news agency .
" we still envisage strong second-half growth above the long-term average , but not at the pace of last year .

" people here in germany and in the european union have some reservations about the us and climate protection because the country refused to endorse the kyoto protocol and therefore limit co2 emissions , " said mojib latif of the leibniz institute of marine sciences at kiel university in germany . germany on track bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could fuel for the future come from a us-eu partnership ?
" germany , on the other hand , has cut its emissions since 1990 by about 20 percent and is basically on kyoto track , " said latif , a scientist who has written on the influence of human activity on climate change and has worked extensively in the us . but it 's not just in germany and the rest of the eu that america 's environmental reputation has taken a beating .
a 37-nation survey published in june as part of the " global attitudes project " of the washington-based pew center showed that there is a " general increase in the percentage of people citing pollution and environmental problems as a top global threat . " rich morin , one of the authors of the study , said that : " in 34 of the 37 countries we surveyed , the united states was named by a majority or large plurality as the country that has done the most to damage the world 's air , water and natural spaces . " morin added that : " it is telling that fully a third of americans agree that we do the most damage - a degree of candor not usually found in americans . " but when looking for ways to minimize the damage done , it may not be washington , however , to which people turn , but the golden state of california , which could brighten the us 's blemished appearance .
light at the end of the tunnel ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar energy is gaining up adherents in the usa california governor arnold schwarzenegger made headlines around the world when he signed a bill to commit california to cutting its co2 emissions , which are blamed for global warming , by 25 percent by 2020 . as the california-based website green-technology.org wrote , " governor schwarzenegger has asked the state to ' lead by example , ' demonstrating that sustainability is achievable , desirable and economically sensible . " " green " businesses and web sites are cropping up in the state as a result .
while " merely " a us state -lrb- though the country 's most populated -rrb- , it ranks among the world 's 10 largest economies . according to the center for the continuing study of the california economy , the golden state 's gross domestic product in 2006 reached slightly more than $ 1.7 trillion -lrb- 1.2 trillion euros -rrb- . while california is often viewed as " way out there " - geographically and psychologically - by americans in many other parts of the us , the hope is that " green " ideas will trickle into the plans instituted in other us states . environmental alarms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flooding in great britain is one of the latest environmental disasters experts said a number of factors have come together to focus americans ' attention on the climate .
in addition to an earnest wish to save the planet , climate change has been a central topic in the media and extreme weather has prompted a feeling among many that change is necessary . then again , it could just be the power of the buck as " going green " could make good business sense . " green " business practices are becoming so popular , that us colleges and universities are beginning to offer sustainability or " green " masters of business administration -lrb- mba -rrb- programs , and companies , including even wal-mart stores inc . , are analyzing ways to increase profits by cutting down on waste and lowering energy costs . " it 's important that you make money when trying to help the environment , " said latif .
" once people , not just in the us , but everywhere , realize that this is really a big market , things will change and the climate will benefit . " all that wind and sunshine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german solar cells are particularly adept at absorbing the sun 's rays the scientist added that he sees money is to be made in renewable energies such as solar , geo-thermal , wind and water , all of which are abundantly available in california .
germans respect the us 's ability to forge territory when it comes to research and development .
" the first step has been that the us has recognized the climate problem , " he said .
" now , the task is finding ways for europe and the us to work together in developing better technology , which the us is so good at anyway . " furthermore , morin said that the pew study showed that environmental problems were one of the few threats in which people said their own country should take the lead dealing with the issue . " this signals great impatience on the part of people everywhere to do something on this issue , " he said .

andreas schleicher , a coordinator of pisa , the oecd 's program for international student assessment which compares educational achievement in different countries , said the training of teachers in particular needed to be radically revamped .
in germany , there 's an attempt by " teachers who have been trained in the 20th century to teach children of the 21st century in a school system that was conceived in the 19th century , " schleicher said .
he added that school teachers sorely needed a more hands-on training approach .
germany still reeling under pisa shock the criticism is not new .
in recent years , germany 's education system has taken a severe battering after a string of pisa study results showed the country 's exalted schools to be trailing internationally .
in 2001 , germany ranked only 21st in reading skills and 20th in math and science among 31 countries assessed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munoz , right , with german education minister annette schavan in march this year , the country was dealt another blow when un special education envoy vernor munoz - amid protests by germany 's federal education ministers - published a damning report saying the class-based three-tier school system was selective , discriminatory and undemocratic by shutting out children from immigrant and poorer backgrounds .
in no other industrialized nation was school success so strongly linked to the social origin of its students , munoz said in the report .
he urged germany to rethink its school structure .
whereas most other european countries have moved on to more inclusive school systems , germany has essentially stuck to a three-tier structure which means that children are only 10 -lrb- or 12 in berlin -rrb- when their high school is chosen .
for nearly half of foreign students , it 's the hauptschule which prepares them for low-skilled jobs .
only 14 percent go to a pre-university gymnasium , compared with a national average of a third .
the drop-out rate for children of immigrant backgrounds is three times the national average .
only at the grundschule , or elementary school , are pupils from all ability groups taught together .
experts urge government to wake up to reality though the shock caused by the international studies has triggered some reform activity in german schools , critics say it 's all taking place within the existing system .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say germany 's three-tier school structure is discriminatory at the conference in berlin , experts , including munoz , said the german government has yet to react to the un special envoy 's drastic recommendations .
marianne demmer , head of the teachers ' union , gew , said the german government and the federal states - which are responsible for education - needed to finally stop reacting to munoz 's criticism " with a mixture of hurt , aggression and arrogance . "
demmer urged german president horst köhler to step in and ignite a national debate on munoz 's reform proposals .
she also demanded that the human right to education be anchored both in germany 's basic law and in state constitutions .
critics have also slammed german federal education ministers for their refusal to participate in an international pisa study for teachers .
currently , 25 countries including denmark , italy , spain , austria and spain are participating in the survey . article based on news reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the rulings will likely expand the number of holocaust survivors eligible for benefits from germany . two jewish men appealed the rejection of their pension claims to the federal social security tribunal in kassel .
on thursday , the tribunal overruled lower court decisions and said the men were entitled to claims .
the ruling comes 62 years after the end of world war ii .
germany pays monthly stipends to tens of thousands of victims of the nazis , most of them people who spent at least six months in one of nazi germany 's concentration camps . the stipends are calculated based on the length of the person 's persecution . thousands could benefit from rulings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jews were forced to wear a yellow star by the nazi regime the first case involved a man who contested when his persecution started .
he said it began when nazis forced him to wear a yellow star of david on his sleeve .
that occurred after german forces invaded his hometown in poland in september 1939 .
the tribunal ruled the man should obtain a credit for this part of his ordeal .
the man 's lawyer said thousands of people would benefit from the ruling .
the second case involved an 82-year-old israeli who was confined to the jewish ghetto in trans-dniester , part of the soviet union .
the area was controlled by pro-nazi romanian forces .
the man was a soviet citizen for 70 years .
he was told holocaust pensions were not available to soviets and were only given to people in places invaded by german troops .
the tribunal overruled this decision , saying the man was entitled to a holocaust pension . article based on news reports -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not everybody , it seems , enjoyed seeing richard wagner dancing in his underwear . germany 's annual bayreuth festival of wagner operas began on wednesday with a highly anticipated , make-or-break production by the 29-year-old great-granddaughter of the composer richard wagner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an opera buff who also happens to be close to the people : angela merkel and while the applause after the first two acts of wagner 's only " comic " opera was friendly , the audience - which included a smorgasbord of german political and social elite - was less amused by the third and final act , which featured a few minutes of full frontal nudity , a bizarre sight of richard wagner dancing in his underwear and a bunch of master singers horsing around the stage with oversized penises .
when , at the end of the marathon seven-hour performance , which included 2 one-hour breaks , visibly nervous katharina wagner took to the stage , she was greeted with boos , hisses , jeers and whistles as well as bravos and cries of approval .
the bayreuth audience proved itself to be worthy of the music genre : dramatic , passionate and self-involved to the point of absurdity .
a red-carpet affair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a family business : katharina wagner with father wolfgang and mother gudrun camera teams and hundreds of onlookers were outside the 19th century festival theater to see katharina in a backless frock arrive to the opening with her father wolfgang wagner , the famous composer 's 87-year-old grandson .
other prominent guests included german chancellor angela merkel , eu commission president jose manuel barroso and a host of german and european glitterati such as bavarian aristocrat gloria von thurn und taxis , germany 's most famous tv showmaster thomas gottschalk and old-time crooner roberto blanco , who has demonstrated a remarkable talent at being frequently resurrected from oblivion .
katharina wagner , who hopes to be appointed festival director in succession to her father wolfgang , who 's been in charge of the festival since 1951 , told reporters that last-minute rehearsals were needed because of " technical problems . "
new ideas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : princess gloria von thurn und taxis with her daughters in an interview published on wednesday , wagner said new ideas were vital to keep the festival young at heart .
she told the german daily süddeutsche zeitung that the festival had to claw back from the opera houses its avant-garde role in wagner interpretation .
" my concern is not to just preserve but to develop something new as well , " she said .
" bayreuth can dare to experiment , " she said , pointing to past engagements of two of the shock directors of german theater , the late heiner müller in 1993 for " tristan and isolde " and christoph schlingensief in 2004 for " parsifal . "
a family saga katharina wagner - the youngest-ever director and the first woman ever to have been entrusted with staging an opera at the festival established by her great-grandfather 131 years ago - is , whether she likes to admit it or not , in the midst of an ongoing family feud .
bildunterschrift : a scene from the opera in what seems like a cross-over between a soap-opera and a royal-family intrigue , the wagners have been fighting over who will take over the festival management business for years .
the bayreuth board can hire anyone to run the public-funded festival , but the job is unique among german public appointments in always having been held by the wagner family .
after failing to establish his second wife gudrun as his successor , wolfgang wagner has put all his weight behind daughter katharina .
but katharina 's rival cousins eva wagner-pasquier and nike wagner , both 62 , also lay claim to the bayreuth throne .
eva is wolfgang 's daughter by his first marriage , while nike is the daughter of wolfgang 's brother wieland , who died in 1966 .
in the absence of a real royal family , the wagners are a god-given gift to those germans who like to combine their interests in high culture with society gossip .
a modern interpretation in a production that - perhaps to the shock of the hard-core , ultra-conservative wagnerites - did not feature a medieval town square and a cast that could be easily convinced to perform a dark , dogma-style , version of snow white and the seven dwarfs - katharina wagner decided to put her foot down in bayreuth as a modernizer par excellence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayreuth is the place to be seen : tv showman thomas gottschalk with his wife thea so she had sneakers raining from the sky .
even more importantly , however , while treating the opera as a kind of discourse on tradition and progress in art , she showed no particular respect for the actual plot .
in wagner 's original , walther von stolzing , a young knight , falls in love with the daughter of a rich nuremberg burgher and tries to win her heart by entering a singing contest - a medieval precursor to american idol and german superstar .
at first he is rejected by the master singers - the simon cowels and paula abduls of his time - for breaking all of their traditional rules .
eventually , however , his natural talent wins them over .
in essence , it 's a boy-gets-girl-by-showing-he-can-sing kind of story .
in katharina wagner 's staging , the hero is actually a wimp : a rebel who - in order to win the contest - becomes a conformist and emulator of his masters .
in modern speak : a hard-rocker , who in the american idol final , decides to sing a whitney houston ballad .
mixed reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reviews are yet to come in audience reactions to the unconventional production and critical response it receives could be decisive for wagner , either spoiling or boosting her ambitions .
achim barth , from frankfurt , dismissed the production as unnecessarily gimmicky .
" it 's runs completely contrary to the text , " barth said .
" it 's just nonsense .
modern for the sake of being modern . "
leading german daily newspapers were not due to publish reviews till friday but other media were quicker .
a reviewer for the web site of the weekly magazine der spiegel , for instance , compared the " overly intellectual " staging to a pizza : too many ingredients on a very thin base . no pressure wagner said she did not feel under any time pressure , since the post of festival director replacing her father , 87 , had not yet been advertised .
this year , the festival , which runs until aug .
28 , will also feature " the ring of the nibelung , " " tannhäuser " and re-runs of schlingensief 's " parsifal . "
all 54,000 available tickets to the 30 performances have been sold out .
organizers received 460,500 applications and preferred applicants , who had been applying for eight years or more . article based on news reports -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" people here in germany and in the european union have some reservations about the us and climate protection because the country refused to endorse the kyoto protocol and therefore limit co2 emissions , " said mojib latif of the leibniz institute of marine sciences at kiel university in germany . germany on track bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could fuel for the future come from a us-eu partnership ?
" germany , on the other hand , has cut its emissions since 1990 by about 20 percent and is basically on kyoto track , " said latif , a scientist who has written on the influence of human activity on climate change and has worked extensively in the us . but it 's not just in germany and the rest of the eu that america 's environmental reputation has taken a beating .
a 37-nation survey published in june as part of the " global attitudes project " of the washington-based pew center showed that there is a " general increase in the percentage of people citing pollution and environmental problems as a top global threat . " rich morin , one of the authors of the study , said that : " in 34 of the 37 countries we surveyed , the united states was named by a majority or large plurality as the country that has done the most to damage the world 's air , water and natural spaces . " morin added that : " it is telling that fully a third of americans agree that we do the most damage - a degree of candor not usually found in americans . " but when looking for ways to minimize the damage done , it may not be washington , however , to which people turn , but the golden state of california , which could brighten the us 's blemished appearance .
light at the end of the tunnel ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar energy is gaining up adherents in the usa california governor arnold schwarzenegger made headlines around the world when he signed a bill to commit california to cutting its co2 emissions , which are blamed for global warming , by 25 percent by 2020 . as the california-based website green-technology.org wrote , " governor schwarzenegger has asked the state to ' lead by example , ' demonstrating that sustainability is achievable , desirable and economically sensible . " " green " businesses and web sites are cropping up in the state as a result .
while " merely " a us state -lrb- though the country 's most populated -rrb- , it ranks among the world 's 10 largest economies . according to the center for the continuing study of the california economy , the golden state 's gross domestic product in 2006 reached slightly more than $ 1.7 trillion -lrb- 1.2 trillion euros -rrb- . while california is often viewed as " way out there " - geographically and psychologically - by americans in many other parts of the us , the hope is that " green " ideas will trickle into the plans instituted in other us states . environmental alarms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flooding in great britain is one of the latest environmental disasters experts said a number of factors have come together to focus americans ' attention on the climate .
in addition to an earnest wish to save the planet , climate change has been a central topic in the media and extreme weather has prompted a feeling among many that change is necessary . then again , it could just be the power of the buck as " going green " could make good business sense . " green " business practices are becoming so popular , that us colleges and universities are beginning to offer sustainability or " green " masters of business administration -lrb- mba -rrb- programs , and companies , including even wal-mart stores inc . , are analyzing ways to increase profits by cutting down on waste and lowering energy costs . " it 's important that you make money when trying to help the environment , " said latif .
" once people , not just in the us , but everywhere , realize that this is really a big market , things will change and the climate will benefit . " all that wind and sunshine bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german solar cells are particularly adept at absorbing the sun 's rays the scientist added that he sees money is to be made in renewable energies such as solar , geo-thermal , wind and water , all of which are abundantly available in california .
germans respect the us 's ability to forge territory when it comes to research and development .
" the first step has been that the us has recognized the climate problem , " he said .
" now , the task is finding ways for europe and the us to work together in developing better technology , which the us is so good at anyway . " furthermore , morin said that the pew study showed that environmental problems were one of the few threats in which people said their own country should take the lead dealing with the issue . " this signals great impatience on the part of people everywhere to do something on this issue , " he said .

the reality is that what happens next reflects the real business world surprisingly accurately .

the dragons ' hit-rate compares favourably - and over the previous two series more deals have come to fruition than ever before .

making money from the venture - even when you own 40 % of a business - is every bit as tough for the dragons as it is for the rest of the business community .
a venture capitalist will tell you that if they get one big money-making investment to cover nine other deals that never hit the big time , they would be happy .

it is an extraordinary tale , and the kind of story that surely inspires a thousand other hopeful entrepreneurs .
no more work of course , some deals fall by the wayside .
all five dragons pledged investment in the standby saver , a seemingly unique plug-like device for cutting the power wasted by appliances when left in standby mode .
but the original deal was based upon a patent that the inventors peter ensinger and david baker needed to protect their product .
in the end the situation could not be resolved and their deal fell through .
but that is not the end of the story .
peter and david subsequently found another investor to buy into the product , and while peter will not reveal exactly how much he made from the deal he does tell us he never needs to work again , which sounds like a pretty satisfying outcome - from his perspective at least .

there is surely no better evidence of the stamina of a genuine entrepreneur than this series of where are they now ? .

by dominic bird dragon 's den there have been some extraordinary successes in the den - and of course some crushing disasters .
levi root is running a big operation but what happens after the handshakes when a deal is struck ?

the reality is that what happens next reflects the real business world surprisingly accurately .
in business , roughly a third of proposed deals fall through before completion .
the dragons ' hit-rate compares favourably - and over the previous two series more deals have come to fruition than ever before .

making money from the venture - even when you own 40 % of a business - is every bit as tough for the dragons as it is for the rest of the business community .

they now claim to have sold more than half a million bottles and levi has gone from making sauce in his kitchen to running an impressive and profitable company .
it is an extraordinary tale , and the kind of story that surely inspires a thousand other hopeful entrepreneurs .
no more work of course , some deals fall by the wayside .
all five dragons pledged investment in the standby saver , a seemingly unique plug-like device for cutting the power wasted by appliances when left in standby mode .

each division within the firm has been allocated a different day to strike , in a move designed to cause continuous disruption throughout the period .
union members are protesting about pay and job losses that they say will come from the modernisation of the firm .
royal mail says the changes are needed for it to stay competitive and vowed to keep delivering mail during the action .
the first action is being taken by staff working in mail centres and cash handling .
their strike began at 1900 bst on wednesday , according to the communication workers union -lrb- cwu -rrb- .
we will be working through the disruption to deliver letters to our customers as quickly as we can royal mail q & a : postal strike and you royal mail called the cwu decision " hugely disappointing " , but said it could not change its position .
it also said it would have contingency arrangements in place .
" only part of royal mail 's workforce will be taking action on any particular day and we will be working through the disruption to deliver letters to our customers as quickly as we can , " a spokesman said .
the prime minister , gordon brown was asked about the strike in prime minister 's questions .
" people have got to accept settlements that make sure inflation is low in the years to come , " he said .
tough competition the strikes will see each section of the company , from the sorting and collection centres to those who make the deliveries , walking out for two separate 24-hour strikes over two weeks .
the move is designed to cause continuous disruption to the nation 's postal service throughout the period at a " minimum cost " to cwu members , union officials say .
the union says the action reflects its growing frustration with the royal mail for its failure to take worker demands for job protection and increased pay " seriously " .
the cwu fears 40,000 jobs will go as a result of increased mechanisation of the system .
it is also objecting to a 2.5 % pay offer .
union officials argue that they support modernisation and the introduction of new technology and automation , but not in the manner that the royal mail has outlined .
the cwu says that automation and modernisation can still be achieved without huge job cuts .
royal mail insists that change is essential if the business is going to survive against tough competition from a growing number of entrants in the uk mail market .
the group has recently made representations to the uk mail regulator postcomm to be allowed to lift the price of its bulk business mail deliveries .
it says this will allow it to claw back some of the 40 % of market share it has lost to rival operators since it lost its monopoly 18 months ago .
' no pension decision ' two 24-hour walkouts have been held in the last month - the first national industrial action at the royal mail for more than a decade .
earlier this week royal mail denied a report that it plans to cut the pensions of 167,000 of its staff .
staff would have to work for five more years before collecting their retirement pay , according to a company document published in the daily mirror .
royal mail said the document was " out of date " and that no decision on pension provision had yet been taken .

each division within the firm has been allocated a different day to strike , in a move designed to cause continuous disruption throughout the period .
union members are protesting about pay and job losses that they say will come from the modernisation of the firm .
royal mail says the changes are needed for it to stay competitive and vowed to keep delivering mail during the action .
the first action is being taken by staff working in mail centres and cash handling .
their strike began at 1900 bst on wednesday , according to the communication workers union -lrb- cwu -rrb- .

" only part of royal mail 's workforce will be taking action on any particular day and we will be working through the disruption to deliver letters to our customers as quickly as we can , " a spokesman said .
the prime minister , gordon brown was asked about the strike in prime minister 's questions .
" people have got to accept settlements that make sure inflation is low in the years to come , " he said .
tough competition the strikes will see each section of the company , from the sorting and collection centres to those who make the deliveries , walking out for two separate 24-hour strikes over two weeks .
the move is designed to cause continuous disruption to the nation 's postal service throughout the period at a " minimum cost " to cwu members , union officials say .
the union says the action reflects its growing frustration with the royal mail for its failure to take worker demands for job protection and increased pay " seriously " .
the cwu fears 40,000 jobs will go as a result of increased mechanisation of the system .
it is also objecting to a 2.5 % pay offer .

the cwu says that automation and modernisation can still be achieved without huge job cuts .
royal mail insists that change is essential if the business is going to survive against tough competition from a growing number of entrants in the uk mail market .
the group has recently made representations to the uk mail regulator postcomm to be allowed to lift the price of its bulk business mail deliveries .

staff would have to work for five more years before collecting their retirement pay , according to a company document published in the daily mirror .
royal mail said the document was " out of date " and that no decision on pension provision had yet been taken .

people will go to extraordinary lengths to find that elusive one bar of signal that will allow them to make a mobile phone call .
but soon the days of despair that occur when you arrive home only to find your new handset does not get any coverage in your house may be over .
there is a new home technology on the block , known as femtocells , and if the hype is to be believed , it will end signal problems forever .
" people i talk to say ' i want one now ' , " said stephen mallinson , ceo of uk femtocell producer ip.access.
technology trial the paperback sized-boxes are essentially compact , personal , mobile phone base stations that plugs straight in to your internet connection .
make a phone call on your mobile and , instead of routing the call through the network of base stations and masts that cover most of the country , it sends the call over the internet using your broadband connection .
until now , they have been the preserve of big business , but sometime in the next two years they could come bundled with your mobile phone contract .
" we always had the vision that the technology would be cheap enough to be in the home , " said mr mallinson .
the company has just launched a 3g femtocell , targeted directly at home users , which could also bring high-speed mobile broadband into the home .
it is one of several offerings from companies such as airwalk or ubiquisys , which recently rose to prominence when search giant google invested in the firm .
at the same time , large networks operators such as vodafone and softel have announced they will trial the technology .
and according to research firm abi , by 2012 there could be 70 million femtocells installed in homes around the world serving more than 150 million users .
but for the network operators at least , the technology goes beyond just mopping up those people who can not make phone calls on their network .
" in a sense it 's mobile taking on wi-fi , " said mike roberts , principal analyst at research firm informa media and telecoms .
call hassle femtocells pack high speed 3g technology or high speed downlink packet access -lrb- hsdpa -rrb- inside , which can have download speeds of up to 7mbps , similar to many home broadband offerings .
" in developed markets , their -lsb- the network operators -rsb- business has matured and they 're looking for any growth opportunities they can .
taking on fixed broadband is one of those and femtocells are a great weapon to do that , " said mr roberts . "
the customer is paying for the backhaul " stephen mallinson wi-fi change for mobiles according to the oxford internet survey , 67 % of the uk 's population are current internet users and 29 % have wi-fi access .
grabbing an increasing share of this market is attractive to mobile operators , said mr roberts , and one way of doing that would be to build hsdpa straight into laptops " that way you can connect to your femtocell and you can use it everywhere else as well - that 's compelling , " he said .
but the rise of the femtocell also has other advantages to the mobile networks .
over the last few years various technologies have converged that threaten to make a dent in mobile operator 's profits .
for example , wireless connectivity on handsets along with voip allows people to cut the cost of calls by bypassing the mobile phone network .
companies such as skype , jajah and truphone have all got in on the action .
" voip over wi-fi is starting but it 's still early days , " said mr roberts .
" it 's a real hassle to use and it 's nowhere near the quality , reliability or usability of cellular voice . "
if mobile operators can get femtocells into the home quickly , then they can prevent the rise of voip over home wi-fi .
" it 's kind of like the mobile operator empire striking back , " said mr roberts .
cheap networks the cellular networks have so far remained relatively tight-lipped about how they plan to use the technology .
vodafone have said they are " currently looking at the business case " .
" femtocells are being assessed at a group level as there may be strategic benefits such as improved 3g indoor coverage and lower costs , " the company said .
" femtocells could also allow us to develop new propositions for customers which could help to stimulate 3g usage still further . "
encouraging customers to sign up for 3g services is key for companies that spent billions on licences to secure the spectrum .
but there may be another advantage to the networks .
" the customer is paying for the backhaul , " explained mr mallinson .
in a sense , mobile customers would be subsidising the growth of the mobile network by using their own home broadband and crucially , only subsidising growth in those areas where it is needed .
and that might be the first of several difficult sells to customers , according to mr roberts .
" if i 'm a consumer i will say : ' ok , this is using my broadband line what do i get in return ? ' , " he said .
" and it could be that your mobile calls are free or at landline rates .
i think they will definitely have to address that issue with free stuff . "
femtocells could be given away free or even bundled with wi-fi routers to make them more attractive .
signal strength but the technology may face an ever bigger challenge before it gains widespread acceptance : its image .
" it 's a base station in your home effectively , " said mr roberts .
" i think mobile operators would certainly not like me calling them that ... which is why they came up with the new name : femtocell , said mr roberts .
there have been several well publicised campaigns against the building of large scale base stations in residential areas .
although companies such as ip.access are keen to stress that the technology operates at a much lower power than a standard base station - and well within government guidelines - the association with their larger cousins may be enough to put some people off .
but even so , analysts see a bright future for femtocells .
" we can see them taking off , " said mr roberts .
and when that happens , the days of people waving their phones in the air to find even a glimmer of signal could be over .
at home at least , full signal should be the norm .

people will go to extraordinary lengths to find that elusive one bar of signal that will allow them to make a mobile phone call .
but soon the days of despair that occur when you arrive home only to find your new handset does not get any coverage in your house may be over .
there is a new home technology on the block , known as femtocells , and if the hype is to be believed , it will end signal problems forever .

femtocells route mobile calls over the internet " we always had the vision that the technology would be cheap enough to be in the home , " said mr mallinson .
the company has just launched a 3g femtocell , targeted directly at home users , which could also bring high-speed mobile broadband into the home .
it is one of several offerings from companies such as airwalk or ubiquisys , which recently rose to prominence when search giant google invested in the firm .
at the same time , large networks operators such as vodafone and softel have announced they will trial the technology .
and according to research firm abi , by 2012 there could be 70 million femtocells installed in homes around the world serving more than 150 million users .
but for the network operators at least , the technology goes beyond just mopping up those people who can not make phone calls on their network .

but the rise of the femtocell also has other advantages to the mobile networks .
over the last few years various technologies have converged that threaten to make a dent in mobile operator 's profits .
for example , wireless connectivity on handsets along with voip allows people to cut the cost of calls by bypassing the mobile phone network .
companies such as skype , jajah and truphone have all got in on the action .
" voip over wi-fi is starting but it 's still early days , " said mr roberts .
" it 's a real hassle to use and it 's nowhere near the quality , reliability or usability of cellular voice . "
if mobile operators can get femtocells into the home quickly , then they can prevent the rise of voip over home wi-fi .
" it 's kind of like the mobile operator empire striking back , " said mr roberts .
cheap networks the cellular networks have so far remained relatively tight-lipped about how they plan to use the technology .
vodafone have said they are " currently looking at the business case " .
by routing calls over the net femtocells free up the main network " femtocells are being assessed at a group level as there may be strategic benefits such as improved 3g indoor coverage and lower costs , " the company said .
" femtocells could also allow us to develop new propositions for customers which could help to stimulate 3g usage still further . "
encouraging customers to sign up for 3g services is key for companies that spent billions on licences to secure the spectrum .
but there may be another advantage to the networks .
" the customer is paying for the backhaul , " explained mr mallinson .
in a sense , mobile customers would be subsidising the growth of the mobile network by using their own home broadband and crucially , only subsidising growth in those areas where it is needed .
and that might be the first of several difficult sells to customers , according to mr roberts .
" if i 'm a consumer i will say : ' ok , this is using my broadband line what do i get in return ? ' , " he said .
" and it could be that your mobile calls are free or at landline rates .
i think they will definitely have to address that issue with free stuff . "
femtocells could be given away free or even bundled with wi-fi routers to make them more attractive .

" it 's a base station in your home effectively , " said mr roberts .
" i think mobile operators would certainly not like me calling them that ... which is why they came up with the new name : femtocell , said mr roberts .
there have been several well publicised campaigns against the building of large scale base stations in residential areas .
although companies such as ip.access are keen to stress that the technology operates at a much lower power than a standard base station - and well within government guidelines - the association with their larger cousins may be enough to put some people off .

south korean media has been quick to call for future trips to be more carefully planned , and even to question the merits of such missions in the first place .
zealous korean christians go to church eight times a week in response to the hostage crisis , south korea 's foreign ministry banned its nationals from travelling to afghanistan and urged those already there - an estimated 200 civilians - to get out .
the saemmul presbyterian church , which sent the abducted missionaries , has been quick to comply with the request .
it had another 42 workers in afghanistan , doing volunteer work in kabul and kandahar , at the time of the kidnapping .
' careless approach ' the saemmul church insists the hostages were on an aid , not an evangelising , mission , providing medical services to people suffering from disease .
" we have to be careful in sending our people to dangerous countries , " pang in-sung , director of newsnjoy , a progressive christian newspaper supported by the saemmul church , said .
" but as christians we also have a duty to go and help others who are in need .
not to evangelise , but to help . "
but pang in-sung admitted there were lessons to be learnt from what has happened in afghanistan .
" we have to correct past mistakes and start being very careful about our work abroad , " he told the bbc news website .
the saemmul church has faced accusations that it embarked on a dangerous mission without adequate thought to the possible consequences .
several south korean dailies carried editorials urging christian groups to rethink their mission strategy in dangerous regions .
" volunteer work is good .
but in a multicultural and multi-religious age and especially in a place like afghanistan , where there is a sharp hatred of christianity , a deeper understanding of indigenous conditions must precede the dispatch of volunteer workers , " wrote choson ilbo .
many korean citizens also question the necessity for missionaries to travel to dangerous countries .
the prayer mountains are a popular weekend destination " i am so sorry for the captives , however i think it is quite unreasonable that they went there in the first place against the korean government 's travel advisory , " said bbc website user hee nam lim , from ulsan .
" i realise they had good intentions but they have become a great burden for our government and our people , " he said .
critics also say that missionaries can sometimes be too aggressive in their desire to spread the gospel , and show lack of understanding of local cultures .
yun young lee , who has done missionary work in nepal and is preparing to go to uganda next month , says that korean missionaries often ignore local customs .
apart from the strong religious zeal , there is also a sense of nationalism behind sending missionaries abroad chung-shin park , professor of korean church history " missionary work abroad is a great thing to do , but you have to be very careful , especially in some islamic countries , " he said .
" you should n't talk to people directly about their religion , in order to change their views , you have to respect their culture and beliefs . "
there is no evidence that the saemmul church was guilty of such behaviour , but south korea is certainly known for the zeal of its missionaries , as well as the number of people it sends overseas on mission trips .
korean evangelical groups have dispatched about 17,000 people to 173 countries , from the middle east and africa through to central and east asia , and south korea is the second largest source of christian missionaries after the us .
thousands are working in muslim countries , where local governments strictly ban christian proselytising .
last august , afghanistan deported hundreds of south koreans who were planning to hold a parade through kabul .
in 2004 , eight south korean missionaries were kidnapped in iraq .
later in the same year , a 33-year-old man , kim sun-il , who had planned to do missionary work there , was taken hostage and beheaded .
south koreans vividly remember the incident , and many even viewed the video of the execution on the internet .
exporting religion protestant missionaries from the us came to the korean peninsula in the late 19th century .
christianity initially failed to make a big impact in china and japan , where missionaries were regarded as agents of western imperialism .
seoul 's yoido full gospel church is the largest in the world but the " religion from the west " spread quickly in the hermit kingdom , and american missionaries were seen by korean nationalists as a source of support in their fight against japanese colonial rulers .
now south korea has the largest percentage of evangelical christians in asia , at about 25 % of the population .
having achieved such a following at home , korean churches have started in the last couple of decades to look at ways to expand abroad .
" pastors of big churches want to show off that they are doing something great for christianity .
korea is a small country that has achieved a strong economy , and it wants to show its success to the world , " said chung-shin park , a professor of korean church history .
" apart from the strong religious zeal , there is also a sense of nationalism behind this , " he said .
" the church 's ambition is to overtake the us and become the world 's number one exporter of missionaries within the next two decades . "

it had another 42 workers in afghanistan , doing volunteer work in kabul and kandahar , at the time of the kidnapping .
' careless approach ' the saemmul church insists the hostages were on an aid , not an evangelising , mission , providing medical services to people suffering from disease .
" we have to be careful in sending our people to dangerous countries , " pang in-sung , director of newsnjoy , a progressive christian newspaper supported by the saemmul church , said .
" but as christians we also have a duty to go and help others who are in need .
not to evangelise , but to help . "
but pang in-sung admitted there were lessons to be learnt from what has happened in afghanistan .
" we have to correct past mistakes and start being very careful about our work abroad , " he told the bbc news website .
the saemmul church has faced accusations that it embarked on a dangerous mission without adequate thought to the possible consequences .
several south korean dailies carried editorials urging christian groups to rethink their mission strategy in dangerous regions .
" volunteer work is good .
but in a multicultural and multi-religious age and especially in a place like afghanistan , where there is a sharp hatred of christianity , a deeper understanding of indigenous conditions must precede the dispatch of volunteer workers , " wrote choson ilbo .
many korean citizens also question the necessity for missionaries to travel to dangerous countries .
the prayer mountains are a popular weekend destination " i am so sorry for the captives , however i think it is quite unreasonable that they went there in the first place against the korean government 's travel advisory , " said bbc website user hee nam lim , from ulsan .
" i realise they had good intentions but they have become a great burden for our government and our people , " he said .
critics also say that missionaries can sometimes be too aggressive in their desire to spread the gospel , and show lack of understanding of local cultures .
yun young lee , who has done missionary work in nepal and is preparing to go to uganda next month , says that korean missionaries often ignore local customs .
apart from the strong religious zeal , there is also a sense of nationalism behind sending missionaries abroad chung-shin park , professor of korean church history " missionary work abroad is a great thing to do , but you have to be very careful , especially in some islamic countries , " he said .
" you should n't talk to people directly about their religion , in order to change their views , you have to respect their culture and beliefs . "
there is no evidence that the saemmul church was guilty of such behaviour , but south korea is certainly known for the zeal of its missionaries , as well as the number of people it sends overseas on mission trips .
korean evangelical groups have dispatched about 17,000 people to 173 countries , from the middle east and africa through to central and east asia , and south korea is the second largest source of christian missionaries after the us .
thousands are working in muslim countries , where local governments strictly ban christian proselytising .
last august , afghanistan deported hundreds of south koreans who were planning to hold a parade through kabul .
in 2004 , eight south korean missionaries were kidnapped in iraq .
later in the same year , a 33-year-old man , kim sun-il , who had planned to do missionary work there , was taken hostage and beheaded .
south koreans vividly remember the incident , and many even viewed the video of the execution on the internet .
exporting religion protestant missionaries from the us came to the korean peninsula in the late 19th century .
christianity initially failed to make a big impact in china and japan , where missionaries were regarded as agents of western imperialism .
seoul 's yoido full gospel church is the largest in the world but the " religion from the west " spread quickly in the hermit kingdom , and american missionaries were seen by korean nationalists as a source of support in their fight against japanese colonial rulers .
now south korea has the largest percentage of evangelical christians in asia , at about 25 % of the population .
having achieved such a following at home , korean churches have started in the last couple of decades to look at ways to expand abroad .
" pastors of big churches want to show off that they are doing something great for christianity .
korea is a small country that has achieved a strong economy , and it wants to show its success to the world , " said chung-shin park , a professor of korean church history .
" apart from the strong religious zeal , there is also a sense of nationalism behind this , " he said .
" the church 's ambition is to overtake the us and become the world 's number one exporter of missionaries within the next two decades . "

dr david alston researched the region 's links with slavery for a series of lectures in inverness .
he found the city 's old infirmary and academy , along with fortrose academy received money from the trade .
dr alston said during the 1700s and 1800s highlanders sought their fortunes in the colonies .
the highland councillor 's investigations grew from researching the historic village of cromarty on the black isle .
dr alston was intrigued when he read how hugh miller , a geologist and fossil collector who was born and brought up in cromarty in the 1800s , had sat next to a black pupil in school .
he said : " that led me to look at some of the other schools in the area and there were three black pupils at inverness royal academy around the same time .
" there were also black pupils in fortrose and i am almost certain there were black pupils in tain . "
guyana was on the edge of empire dr david alston they were the children of men who had married slaves , or women known at the time as free coloured , while working on or running sugar plantations in the west and east indies , said dr alston .
he added : " it seemed there was a hidden history and this led to an interest in the involvement of people from this part of scotland in some of the slave plantations .
" there was a period in the early 1800s where the children from mixed relationships came back for education in scotland .
" that did n't last very long .
as the century went on i think peoples ' attitudes towards race changed and became more racist . "
the abolition of the slave trade act was passed on 25 march 1807 it has been estimated that between 1700 and 1810 british merchants transported almost three million africans across the atlantic among the key abolition figures were william wilberforce , african writer olanuah equiano and former slave ignatius sancho , above guyana , a former british colony in south america , became the focus of his investigations .
highlanders were drawn to the country by the promise of getting rich quick .
dr alston said the sons of highland landowners were among those who had the capital to invest in demerara plantations .
and those who did make their fortunes in turn contributed to public institutions back home .
according to his research - which included looking at the records of landowners - dr alston found a number of landmark buildings in the highlands were constructed with funding from the slave trade .
a third of the capital for the old inverness royal academy in the city 's academy street came from the west indies .
half the cost of fortrose academy was generated in india , a quarter in the west indies while the rest was met by london merchants with interests in sugar , cotton and the slave trade .
however , it was 30 to 40 miles -lrb- 48-64km -rrb- of coastline on a far flung corner of the world that most surprised dr alston and provided what he said was a " tangible link " between the highlands and the slave trade .
guyana factfile the former british colony - the only english-speaking country in south america - became independent in 1966 a third of its population is descended from african slaves , imported by the dutch to work on sugar plantations about half are the descendants of indentured indian agricultural workers brought in by the british after slavery was abolished he said : " guyana was on the edge of empire .
" people were involved there because they thought they could make money quickly and it was worth running the risk of death from fever .
" they were bringing new land into cultivation along the coast using the dutch technology of poldering - building embankments and draining the land .
" there is a section of coast in guyana where the place names almost replicate those from inverness to golspie and helmsdale .
" it is a bit of our history that has been forgotten .
" the reality is that scots were very much involved in the british empire , many originally in the military and that experience saw them become involved in economies of the east and west indies .
" we have tended to brush that under the carpet and adopted a convenient view that this was something done by liverpool and bristol merchants . "
dr alston is to present his report on thursday as part of a series of lectures hosted by higher education institution , uhi millennium institute , which has its headquarters in the old infirmary .

dr david alston researched the region 's links with slavery for a series of lectures in inverness .
he found the city 's old infirmary and academy , along with fortrose academy received money from the trade .
dr alston said during the 1700s and 1800s highlanders sought their fortunes in the colonies .
the highland councillor 's investigations grew from researching the historic village of cromarty on the black isle .
dr alston was intrigued when he read how hugh miller , a geologist and fossil collector who was born and brought up in cromarty in the 1800s , had sat next to a black pupil in school .
he said : " that led me to look at some of the other schools in the area and there were three black pupils at inverness royal academy around the same time .
" there were also black pupils in fortrose and i am almost certain there were black pupils in tain . "
guyana was on the edge of empire dr david alston they were the children of men who had married slaves , or women known at the time as free coloured , while working on or running sugar plantations in the west and east indies , said dr alston .
he added : " it seemed there was a hidden history and this led to an interest in the involvement of people from this part of scotland in some of the slave plantations .
" there was a period in the early 1800s where the children from mixed relationships came back for education in scotland .
" that did n't last very long .
as the century went on i think peoples ' attitudes towards race changed and became more racist . "
the abolition of the slave trade act was passed on 25 march 1807 it has been estimated that between 1700 and 1810 british merchants transported almost three million africans across the atlantic among the key abolition figures were william wilberforce , african writer olanuah equiano and former slave ignatius sancho , above guyana , a former british colony in south america , became the focus of his investigations .
highlanders were drawn to the country by the promise of getting rich quick .
dr alston said the sons of highland landowners were among those who had the capital to invest in demerara plantations .
and those who did make their fortunes in turn contributed to public institutions back home .
according to his research - which included looking at the records of landowners - dr alston found a number of landmark buildings in the highlands were constructed with funding from the slave trade .
a third of the capital for the old inverness royal academy in the city 's academy street came from the west indies .
half the cost of fortrose academy was generated in india , a quarter in the west indies while the rest was met by london merchants with interests in sugar , cotton and the slave trade .
however , it was 30 to 40 miles -lrb- 48-64km -rrb- of coastline on a far flung corner of the world that most surprised dr alston and provided what he said was a " tangible link " between the highlands and the slave trade .
guyana factfile the former british colony - the only english-speaking country in south america - became independent in 1966 a third of its population is descended from african slaves , imported by the dutch to work on sugar plantations about half are the descendants of indentured indian agricultural workers brought in by the british after slavery was abolished he said : " guyana was on the edge of empire .
" people were involved there because they thought they could make money quickly and it was worth running the risk of death from fever .
" they were bringing new land into cultivation along the coast using the dutch technology of poldering - building embankments and draining the land .
" there is a section of coast in guyana where the place names almost replicate those from inverness to golspie and helmsdale .
" it is a bit of our history that has been forgotten .
" the reality is that scots were very much involved in the british empire , many originally in the military and that experience saw them become involved in economies of the east and west indies .
" we have tended to brush that under the carpet and adopted a convenient view that this was something done by liverpool and bristol merchants . "
dr alston is to present his report on thursday as part of a series of lectures hosted by higher education institution , uhi millennium institute , which has its headquarters in the old infirmary .

a report by the commons transport select committee said queues of hundreds of passengers in cramped spaces could become a security hazard .
the committee recommended that reducing queues at security and speeding up check-in times should be a priority .
the department for transport -lrb- dft -rrb- said baggage security rules introduced last august met " a very real threat " .
the regulations resulted in disruption and delays and , although the situation has improved , passengers still face longer queues and increased waiting times .
the warning comes a day after the government unveiled plans for a " unified border force " to boost the fight against terrorism .
the " highly visible " uniformed force will bring together immigration and customs officers , prime minister gordon brown told mps .
new targets the committee heard from security experts that the resulting queues presented a significant security threat .
prof alan hatcher , principal of the international school for security and explosives education , said that with bags not being searched when people entered a terminal he was concerned that queues of hundreds of people were effectively creating new targets .
have your say airport security is a silly joke .
it creates absolute chaos and does n't hinder the terrorists one bit joe bloggs send us your comments committee chairman gwyneth dunwoody said : " because of the necessary measures that are now in place , passengers are finding it more uncomfortable and time consuming to begin their journeys .
" security is the issue which currently has the most significant impact on passengers ' experiences of air travel . "
the committee heard evidence before the recent suspected attack at glasgow airport took place .
' arrive prepared ' chris goater , from the airport operators association , said the view of experts is that the primary terrorist threat is from explosives getting onto aircraft .
a dft spokesman said : " the government has already launched a £ 1.5m advertising campaign in the national press to remind passengers to ' arrive prepared ' and , where possible , is introducing changes to help make the security process quicker .
" but we have to be satisfied that any changes will not compromise the safety of passengers . "
the committee made a series of other recommendations , including : airlines should always advertise additional fees , taxes and charges up front there should be a government review of telephone charges for ticket bookings airport operator baa should cease to be run as a monopoly there should be a review of airport car parking charges more robust systems are needed to stop the loss and mishandling of baggage .
