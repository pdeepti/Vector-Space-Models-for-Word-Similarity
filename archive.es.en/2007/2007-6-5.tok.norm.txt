the speech that outlined the ambitious plan was made 60 years ago today . the speech was without fanfare and lasted only 12 minutes , but it signaled a shift in the post-war era and heralded great changes to come . on june 5 , 1947 , us secretary of state george c. marshall addressed the graduating class at harvard university in cambridge , massachusetts .
within days , his recommendations became known as the marshall plan , which has gone down in history as the most successful civil-reconstruction project of the 20th century . " the marshall plan served as the economic and political foundation for the western alliance that waged the cold war , " said diane kunz , a professor of history at yale university .
" it allowed the united states gradually to engage itself in the bipolar confrontation by first committing money , not blood . " historians , however , disagree on how large a role the marshall plan money played in europe 's economic recovery . small speech , big idea marshall 's speech offered few details , but the powerful impact of his ideas , militarily and politically , were designed to make an imprint on europe for decades after the end of the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan began two years after the potsdam conference after the war , the united states - infrastructure intact and economy prospering - had a clear sense of where it was headed .
by contrast , experts were predicting financial and social collapse in europe . marshall , a future nobel peace prize winner , said at harvard that his proposal was " directed not against any country or doctrine but against hunger , poverty , desperation and chaos . "
he laid out his plan based on the initiative of the europeans and on their faith in the economic future of their countries and of europe as a whole . " it is logical that the united states should do whatever it is able to do to assist in the return of normal economic health in the world , without which there can be no political stability and no assured peace , " marshall said . within weeks of the speech , european governments - led by france and britain - began drafting marshall 's spending plan .
essentially , the plan was about supplying german importers of life-sustaining goods with hard currency . the marshall effect by the end of the marshall plan in 1952 , five years after marshall 's speech , the united states had invested more than $ 13 billion in goods and financial services , equal to $ 100 billion today -lrb- 74.3 billion euros -rrb- .
about $ 1.4 billion of the initial total was invested in rebuilding a germany that had been reduced to a landscape of rubble . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany was the fourth biggest recipient of us aid the offer of us help was made to all european countries .
the top four recipients of aid , in descending order , were britain , france , italy and germany .
moscow set the tone for the coming cold war , with a clear " nyet " that forbade the east european countries under its heel from accepting the largess of the capitalist benefactor . no one doubts that the marshall plan contributed mightily to cementing the division of europe and the world . washington 's intensions were plain : only with prosperity could western europe become a bulwark against communism .
the marshall plan helped make europe 's hungry masses reliable partners for the us . the designers of the marshall plan can not take all of the credit for this record of success .
local resources accounted for 80 to 90 per cent of capital formation in the major european economies during the first two years of the recovery program , according to university of iowa history professor michael hogan , a prominent expert on the marshall plan . yet , the marshall plan provided the " critical margin " of support that made european self-help possible .
it fuelled essential imports , eased production bottlenecks , encouraged higher rates of capital formation and helped to suppress inflation , hogan wrote in a paper marking the 50th anniversary of marshall 's speech . all these effects led to gains in productivity , improvements in trade and the most durable era of social peace and prosperity in modern european history . marshall plan today bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have considered setting up a new marshall plan help in iraq or the balkans the ideals of the marshall plan have been invoked countless times by well-meaning people , facing the tasks of rebuilding regions torn by crisis or failed states from latin america to the balkans and , now , iraq . there have been so many references that larry bland , director of the george marshall foundation , has stopped counting . historians wave aside calls for a new marshall plan , saying the structures and historical situation after world war ii were unique .
the marshall plan , in a sense , oiled the gears of existing machinery - it did not bear the burden of bringing trade and forging modern political structures in places with no experience of them . western europe for centuries had known the rule of law , democracy and private property and initiative .
the us was dealing with people who knew what to do and who knew the importance of the middle class , bland said .
they were people who did n't need to be taught democracy and free enterprise . dw staff dpa -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

our g8 summit " we think that the g8 summit does not speak to the whole population " of the world , said hassen lorgat , a south african trade unionist .
" without us , nothing can happen for us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all protesters throw stones between now and thursday the anti-g8 campaigners will hold workshops to develop an alternative to what they call the " unbridled liberalism " of the g8 group of industrialized nations , though there will be no final statement .
the campaigners ' slogan has not changed over the years whether the topic is hunger , the wealth-sharing or international trade : " another world is possible . "
" industries are collapsing in africa because of subsidies paid to european products , " said jane nalunga , from uganda , of seatini -lrb- southern and eastern african trade information and negotiations institute -rrb- , an association which defends african economic interests .
" there is no justice " in the economic relationship between africa and the industrialized countries , she said , underlining the fact that africa can not fix the price of its own raw materials .
yet " trade is the key to development in africa , " she said .
an alternative view bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heilingendamm has been turned into a walled fortress among those attending in a private capacity is swiss sociologist jean ziegler , the united nations special rapporteur on the right to food .
according to ziegler the message is as topical as ever .
" it is the big groups that will dictate their law at heiligendamm , " he said , making it clear he was speaking as an individual and not in an official un capacity .
in his pamphlet " the empire of shame " ziegler inveighs against a new world system of " refeudalization " based on debt and hunger .
he condemns in particular " the murderous european union policy of dumping " which means that " you find in african markets french , italian and portuguese fruit and vegetables at half the price of the african products , " something he says drives local farmers into bankruptcy .

rostock was the scene of rioting over the weekend when hooded demonstrators taking part in an anti-globalization rally hurled rocks and bags of paint at police , who responded with water canons .
organizers of the alternative summit said it was being held because " the current form of globalization has produced and continues to produce many losers and very few winners . "

many blame police for recent violence .
deutsche welle visited the demonstrators ' camp as they continue their campaign , seemingly at any cost . " training starts today at 12:00 at the information center . "
the announcement was on monday made in both german and english to the globalization opponents at the encampment located 10 kilometers -lrb- about 6 miles -rrb- south of the resort hotel where world leaders are scheduled to meet on wednesday .
in this case , " training " means preparing the demonstrators for blockades that are intended to massively disrupt the group of eight summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meet here for blockade training ready to break the law " it 's about active resistance , " said activist alex kristow from press group kempinski .
" we 've always said that it 's necessary to break the law in some situations in order to make people aware of major problems like neo-liberal globalization .
" it 's not enough to march through the streets carrying a sign , " continued kristow .
" we claim the right to block a street so that delegations who want to go to this summit ca n't get through . "
after demonstrations turned into violent riots in rostock on saturday , many of the demonstrators expect police to raid the camps in order to weed out potentially violent activists before the summit begins .
preparing for police raid " we believe that the police are trying to reduce the number of participants in coming protests by storming the camp and arresting the offenders from the last demonstrations , " said marius kürten , who traveled to the event from speyer in south-western germany .
" we 're going to mobilize the entire camp against the police . "
at the entrance to the camp , a banner has been raised with a message to the police : " you 're on call - we 're having fun . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peace ?
the relaxing music in the camp belies the tense mood .

police have parked their buses and set up headquarters some distance away , at the intersection leading to the camp entrance .
peaceful protestors harbor extremists " we 've seen that they 've set up barricades so that the press and police ca n't drive through , " said gabi baumgart , a manager at a window company whose office borders the encampment .
" the people here earlier were really great , they were really nice and peaceful , " continued baumgart .
" but we just had a directors meeting upstairs and could see that five people went into the bush to practice with their slingshots .
there are also a few people there looking for a hide-out , which the other people in the camp do n't want . "
nevertheless , they do n't seem to want to distance themselves from the violent activists .
many blame the police for the skirmishes last weekend , though the violence cost the demonstrators much of the sympathy they had had from parts of the general population .
alex kristow called saturday 's demonstration " powerful , colorful and strong , " but added that " it was also setback in that it became clear that the police and state officials will use any means to de-legitimize this movement .

this time , we look at an international best-seller - a murder mystery with sheep as detectives . three bags full by leonie swann translated by anthea bell doubleday publishers 351 pages nearly any reader would admit that a book about a flock of sheep solving a murder mystery would lend itself to jokes about counting those sheep as one turns the pages . especially if the story starts off slowly and one is prone to spontaneous bouts of slumber - those z 's gently purring out of one 's mouth as the book gradually tilts forward , the reader nods off and images of fleecy sheep jumping over a fence loom ever larger in the mind 's eye . while reading the first chapters of leonie swann 's " three bags full " -lrb- " glennkill " in german -rrb- , this reader had to keep reminding herself that the book had become an international best-seller that had meanwhile been translated into at least 16 different languages . that fact , and the occasional bemusement at the soliloquies of the detective sheep pondering who had killed their shepherd , spurred me on , but not without resistance . puzzling idea somehow the compelling nature of their shepherd 's murder just did not come across in the initial pages of the book .
still , i read on , intrigued by how the debut novelist would depict the rest of the puzzle surrounding shepherd george glenn 's demise . after all , the setting was inviting - a hillside meadow near the irish village of glennkill , and the depth of the sheep 's outrage at finding george pinned to the ground with a spade did slowly emerge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hardcover version swann 's sheep , armed with their own literary accoutrements , deductive abilities and determination to avenge their shepherd 's death , begin tracking down the culprit .
with names like " othello " -lrb- the lead , black ram -rrb- and " miss maple " -lrb- a.k.a. " the smartest sheep in all glennkill " -rrb- , the animal protagonists already have an indirect link to murder and crime-solving . furthermore , they had developed their cognitive abilities by listening to their former shepherd george read aloud to them every afternoon when taking a break from grazing .
george 's literary tastes ranged from fairy tales to treatises on sheep diseases to trashy novels featuring red-headed heroines named " pamela . "
conveniently enough , george also once read a detective story to the sheep , so they feel adequately prepared to tackle the dirty business of crime-fighting . following their noses as they muse over the quirky behavior of human beings , the animals also apply their sharply honed sense of smell to aid them in solving the puzzle .
while swann 's countless descriptions of the sheep scenting the villagers to glean information do perhaps prompt a deeper understanding of just how animals tick , they also compose the sections of the novel that easily could have been whittled down .
the flowery depictions of the animals ' olfactory aptitude are initially amusing , and ultimately , annoying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in swann 's book , sheep have a mind of their own still , the sheep 's sense of smell gives them a straightforward approach that allows them to distinguish between the liars and truth-seekers in glennkill , among them : george 's estranged wife , the butcher , a rival shepherd , a pentecostal wallflower pining for the murdered man and george 's even more estranged daughter who returns to the village .
this ability to scent also eventually leads them to successfully , albeit indirectly , reveal george 's murderer . history of animal literary figures swann is not the first to employ animals as literary protagonists .
other smart animals carry the flag in well-known books such as george orwell 's " animal farm , " paul auster 's " timbuktu , " haruki murakami 's " kafka on the shore " or the children 's tale " charlotte 's web , " to name just a few . yet , as ian sansom wrote in the guardian , " with sheep as detectives swann solves one of the major problems in crime fiction , which is how to avoid the stereotypical jaded , cynical , alcoholic deadbeat gumshoe with relationship problems . " lending other animals in the book monikers such as " rameses , " " mopple the whale " and " satan " also helps to feed the reader 's imagination . mixed reviews some german literary critics have been harsh in their assessment of " three bags full , " with one writer in the weighty weekly die zeit wondering how swann 's " simple " language can generate a best-seller . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author leonie swann another critic in the influential daily süddeutsche zeitung imagined a clever talk between a literary agent and a prospective author that targeted cute sheep in narrative as harbingers of massive book sales . denis scheck , a prominent german literary critic , was kinder , calling the acquaintance with swann 's glennkill sheep a " real pleasure . " " three bags full " is a bit strange , but , as sansom wrote , it is also affecting .
if you can get over the initial slow pace of the book and a personal unwillingness to accept sheep as anything but dull , you will enjoy an occasional chuckle or smirk as you read on the train and glance up every now and then at your fellow commuters . ultimately , swann 's book offers readers perhaps less of a new take on how we perceive animals , and more of one on how they perceive us . it 's a lightly philosophical summer read , with the paperback edition due out at the beginning of july . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this time , we look at an international best-seller - a murder mystery with sheep as detectives . three bags full by leonie swann translated by anthea bell doubleday publishers 351 pages nearly any reader would admit that a book about a flock of sheep solving a murder mystery would lend itself to jokes about counting those sheep as one turns the pages . especially if the story starts off slowly and one is prone to spontaneous bouts of slumber - those z 's gently purring out of one 's mouth as the book gradually tilts forward , the reader nods off and images of fleecy sheep jumping over a fence loom ever larger in the mind 's eye . while reading the first chapters of leonie swann 's " three bags full " -lrb- " glennkill " in german -rrb- , this reader had to keep reminding herself that the book had become an international best-seller that had meanwhile been translated into at least 16 different languages . that fact , and the occasional bemusement at the soliloquies of the detective sheep pondering who had killed their shepherd , spurred me on , but not without resistance . puzzling idea somehow the compelling nature of their shepherd 's murder just did not come across in the initial pages of the book .
still , i read on , intrigued by how the debut novelist would depict the rest of the puzzle surrounding shepherd george glenn 's demise . after all , the setting was inviting - a hillside meadow near the irish village of glennkill , and the depth of the sheep 's outrage at finding george pinned to the ground with a spade did slowly emerge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hardcover version swann 's sheep , armed with their own literary accoutrements , deductive abilities and determination to avenge their shepherd 's death , begin tracking down the culprit .
with names like " othello " -lrb- the lead , black ram -rrb- and " miss maple " -lrb- a.k.a. " the smartest sheep in all glennkill " -rrb- , the animal protagonists already have an indirect link to murder and crime-solving . furthermore , they had developed their cognitive abilities by listening to their former shepherd george read aloud to them every afternoon when taking a break from grazing .
george 's literary tastes ranged from fairy tales to treatises on sheep diseases to trashy novels featuring red-headed heroines named " pamela . "
conveniently enough , george also once read a detective story to the sheep , so they feel adequately prepared to tackle the dirty business of crime-fighting . following their noses as they muse over the quirky behavior of human beings , the animals also apply their sharply honed sense of smell to aid them in solving the puzzle .
while swann 's countless descriptions of the sheep scenting the villagers to glean information do perhaps prompt a deeper understanding of just how animals tick , they also compose the sections of the novel that easily could have been whittled down .
the flowery depictions of the animals ' olfactory aptitude are initially amusing , and ultimately , annoying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in swann 's book , sheep have a mind of their own still , the sheep 's sense of smell gives them a straightforward approach that allows them to distinguish between the liars and truth-seekers in glennkill , among them : george 's estranged wife , the butcher , a rival shepherd , a pentecostal wallflower pining for the murdered man and george 's even more estranged daughter who returns to the village .

us president bush met protests when his plane touched down tuesday . protesters , who lost a last-ditch bid tuesday for court permission to march close to this week 's g8 summit , prepared in germany to mount sit-down protest to block roads when the three-day event begins wednesday . attac , a european group that believes globalization is dangerous and is leading the protests , said tuesday it was not organizing sit-downs and did not belong to block g8 , a group overseeing a planned " blockade , " but knew many attac members would be taking part . it said taking part in a sit-down was a misdemeanor , not a felony , and insisted german police only use " proportionate " force to clear sit-downs and avoid injuring anyone while doing so . road-block organizers promised tuesday they would ask peaceful demonstrators to abandon any blockade if the black block , an informal network of violence-prone militants who don black clothing and masks and congregate in the marches , took over and the incident turned into a violent confrontation . caustic clowns police had been taken by surprise by anti-g8 rioting saturday that left nearly 1,000 people injured .
officers claim they were facing a form of chemical warfare , with protesters dressed as clowns squirting them with a fluid that attacks the skin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eight offers were injured by chemical attacks eight police had needed hospital treatment , a spokesman said in rostock , a city 15 miles north-east of the heiligendamm beachside summit venue where small-scale protests were continuing and 11 persons were detained tuesday . at the first trial to deal with saturday 's rioters , a man aged 31 was sent to jail for 10 months for throwing stones at several police officers .
eight more persons , many of them non-german , were to come up for trial on wednesday . the police said a packet of white powder labeled " anthrax " found monday near the heiligendamm fence had only contained flour . protesters lose in court in the southern city of karlsruhe , germany 's constitutional court confirmed the legal restrictions junior judges had placed on the demonstrations . at the kempinski grand hotel in heiligendamm , only 15 representative protesters were allowed to hold a vigil starting tuesday , while demonstrators would also face a quota of 50 at a gate of rostock airport where the eight delegations were to land . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters complain their rights are being denied a mass demonstration at the airport must take place hundreds of meters away .
administrative tribunals had earlier modified the various restrictions put in place by the police . an appeal against a requirement that a mass protest on thursday remain on a highway which comes no closer than four miles to the summit hotel will be decided wednesday , a court spokeswoman said . more protests planned germany has deployed 16,000 police to protect the leaders of seven western nations and russia at the g8 summit as well as 10 other national leaders who are to join them on friday . the police are preparing to deal with both violent attacks by the black block and non-violent tactics from peaceful protesters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the black block is planning more protests police spokesman axel falkenberg rejected calls for german riot police to be armed with guns which shoot rubber bullets , which have never been used in germany .
officials said there were no such guns in the government 's armory . germany 's main weapon against riots is a fleet of trucks which shoot jets of cold water up to 50 meters . bush lands in rostock us president george w. bush was heckled by protesters as he arrived in rostock wednesday to attend the summit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials , and protestors , were on hand to meet bush in rostock he touched down just after 17:00 gmt from prague , where he accused russia of derailing democratic reforms , in a speech likely to further strain ties with moscow on the eve of the gathering . up to 1,000 anti-globalization activists waited for the helicopter behind a fence guarded by rows of police officers . " our democratic rights stop here , " one demonstrator scrawled in chalk next to the chain-link barrier which was used to pen in the protesters . dw staff / dpa -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

statehood for kosovo is the latest . climate change and aid to africa have long been on the agenda for the g8 summit which kicks off on wednesday in heiligendamm on the north-eastern german coast . but the gathering of rich industrial nations that includes russia threatens to be overshadowed by divisions within the club from an unexpected source : kosovo . the tiny autonomous province in serbia , which is under un administration , has n't grabbed banner headlines since 1999 , when us-led air strikes forced out slobodan milosevic 's marauding army .
but that 's mainly because nato 's huge international contingent has kept the peace . territorial and ethnic tensions in the remains of the former yugoslavia are still simmering below the surface , and now with the un road map for kosovo 's independence from serbia on the table , the western powers want to finally put the last chapter of the balkans saga to bed . the world 's political powers meeting at the group of eight summit this week in germany should decide whether the un security council should proceed with a draft resolution dealing with the future of kosovo , the council president said monday . " we 'll see how the situation will evolve , " said belgium 's un ambassador johan verbeke .
" for the time being , it 's a wait-and-see period ; it 's a question of days , not weeks . " verbeke , whose country holds the rotating council presidency for june , said once the eight world leaders give the go-ahead , he will put the kosovo issue on the council 's monthly agenda .
he said the decision also belongs to capitals of 15 countries on the council .
bildunterschrift : rice -lrb- second from right -rrb- and lavrov -lrb- second from left -rrb- exchanged barbs over missile defense and kosovo russian opposition at last week 's foreign ministers meeting in potsdam - best known as the venue for the postwar meeting of us , british and soviet leaders - the cold war lines between europe and united states on one side , and russia on the other , were clearly drawn again . us secretary of state condoleezza rice and russian foreign minister sergey lavrov not only exchanged barbs about moscow 's opposition to plans for us anti-missile shield installations in poland and the czech republic , but also over the future status of kosovo . lavrov denounced the plan drawn up by un special envoy martti ahtisaari , which seeks to transfer custody of the overwhelmingly ethnic albanian province to the eu in the transitional period to nationhood .
the plan was approved by the parliament in kosovo , but rejected by the autonomous region 's serb minority and belgrade . the kremlin 's adamant opposition took the western allies by surprise , although lavrov stopped short of saying that russia would exercise its veto power in the un 's security council . one expert says the reasons moscow is supporting a fellow slavic state are complicated and need to be understood within the broad scope of russia 's relations with the eu and us . russian resurgence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patience for independance in kosovo is wearing thin " russia has no leverage over the balkan states and knows it .
there 's no way that russia could stop the ahtisaari plan if the west stands united in favor of it .
its veto power in the security council is symbolic .

chief negotiators of the world 's leading industrial nations are meeting in berlin on tuesday in a last-ditch effort to remove obstacles threatening to derail a g8 deal on climate change . german chancellor angela merkel , whose country holds the current presidency of the g8 , wants this week 's summit participants in heiligendamm to agree to set long-term goals to cut greenhouse gas emissions . but she faces opposition from us president george w. bush , who wants to convene a global summit that includes a new generation of polluters from the developing world such as china , india and brazil . germany wants the g8 to agree to cut greenhouse gas emissions to 50 per cent below 1990 levels by the year 2050 in order to ensure that the world 's average temperature increase due to global warming does not exceed two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degree fahrenheit -rrb- . a new kyoto bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the talks are taking place far away from the g8 protests germany wants this to form the framework for a new united nations protocol on climate change to replace the kyoto agreement when it expires in 2012 . merkel won backing from british premier tony blair , although she appears to be less optimistic that a landmark deal will be reached at the summit to cover the post-kyoto period . " at the g8 we need to agree the elements of a future framework , " blair told parliamentarians in the german capital on sunday .
" this would allow the un talks to accelerate and reach earlier agreement so that we have a framework for kyoto in place by 2009 . " the bush plan last week bush called for about 15 countries that account for the bulk of greenhouse-gas emissions , including the us , to meet later this year for talks on a " long-term global goal " for cutting emissions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush supports voluntary cuts in emissions the us has acknowledged that climate change is a serious problem caused by humans that requires action - though , in the us , only through voluntary steps . the role of china , which is not a member of the g8 , is crucial , as many experts believe it could overtake the united states this year as the world 's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases . china on monday issued its own plan for responding to global climate change but urged developed nations to take the lead and allow poorer nations to focus on economic development . at the same time , japan said it would use the g8 to launch an aid program for developing countries that would encourage them to fight global warming as well as pollution and poverty . bush versus merkel ? merkel , who has made the fight against global warming a key issue of germany 's g8 presidency , is scheduled to have lunch with bush immediately before the start of the g8 summit on wednesday . there has been a mixed reaction to the president 's call for global warming talks with a select group of polluter nations .
but it was not meant to sideline broader un discussions on climate change , us national security advisor stephen hadley said last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with or without bush , merkel is pushing global climate reform " it is an effort to try and find consensus on the way ahead , " he said ahead of the g8 summit grouping the us , canada , germany , japan , france , britain , italy and russia . " this week presents an opportunity to turn mr. bush 's newfound interest in climate change into a commitment to do something about it soon , " britain 's observer newspaper said in an editorial . merkel , who was to meet with canadian prime minister stephen harper on monday evening and japanese premier shinzo abe on tuesday , said she was confident the pre-summit talks would lead to " important steps " being agreed upon . " we will fight until the very last moment for concrete wording , " government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said in reference to the final communiqué to be issued by the end of the week . dw staff / dpa -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

chief negotiators of the world 's leading industrial nations are meeting in berlin on tuesday in a last-ditch effort to remove obstacles threatening to derail a g8 deal on climate change . german chancellor angela merkel , whose country holds the current presidency of the g8 , wants this week 's summit participants in heiligendamm to agree to set long-term goals to cut greenhouse gas emissions . but she faces opposition from us president george w. bush , who wants to convene a global summit that includes a new generation of polluters from the developing world such as china , india and brazil . germany wants the g8 to agree to cut greenhouse gas emissions to 50 per cent below 1990 levels by the year 2050 in order to ensure that the world 's average temperature increase due to global warming does not exceed two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degree fahrenheit -rrb- . a new kyoto bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the talks are taking place far away from the g8 protests germany wants this to form the framework for a new united nations protocol on climate change to replace the kyoto agreement when it expires in 2012 . merkel won backing from british premier tony blair , although she appears to be less optimistic that a landmark deal will be reached at the summit to cover the post-kyoto period . " at the g8 we need to agree the elements of a future framework , " blair told parliamentarians in the german capital on sunday .
" this would allow the un talks to accelerate and reach earlier agreement so that we have a framework for kyoto in place by 2009 . " the bush plan last week bush called for about 15 countries that account for the bulk of greenhouse-gas emissions , including the us , to meet later this year for talks on a " long-term global goal " for cutting emissions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush supports voluntary cuts in emissions the us has acknowledged that climate change is a serious problem caused by humans that requires action - though , in the us , only through voluntary steps . the role of china , which is not a member of the g8 , is crucial , as many experts believe it could overtake the united states this year as the world 's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases . china on monday issued its own plan for responding to global climate change but urged developed nations to take the lead and allow poorer nations to focus on economic development . at the same time , japan said it would use the g8 to launch an aid program for developing countries that would encourage them to fight global warming as well as pollution and poverty . bush versus merkel ? merkel , who has made the fight against global warming a key issue of germany 's g8 presidency , is scheduled to have lunch with bush immediately before the start of the g8 summit on wednesday . there has been a mixed reaction to the president 's call for global warming talks with a select group of polluter nations .
but it was not meant to sideline broader un discussions on climate change , us national security advisor stephen hadley said last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with or without bush , merkel is pushing global climate reform " it is an effort to try and find consensus on the way ahead , " he said ahead of the g8 summit grouping the us , canada , germany , japan , france , britain , italy and russia . " this week presents an opportunity to turn mr. bush 's newfound interest in climate change into a commitment to do something about it soon , " britain 's observer newspaper said in an editorial . merkel , who was to meet with canadian prime minister stephen harper on monday evening and japanese premier shinzo abe on tuesday , said she was confident the pre-summit talks would lead to " important steps " being agreed upon . " we will fight until the very last moment for concrete wording , " government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said in reference to the final communiqué to be issued by the end of the week . dw staff / dpa -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the motto of the meeting : melting ice – a hot topic ? the united nations environmental program used the occasion to release a new report entitled " the global outlook for ice and snow . "
according to the report ’ s findings , the lives of hundreds of millions of people across the world will be affected by declines in snow cover , sea ice , glaciers , permafrost and lake ice .
a collaboration of 70 researchers , the report found that the melting of snow and ice caps contributes greatly to climate change and global warming because less sunlight is being reflected back into the atmosphere .

the report is a part of the ongoing international polar year , an initiative spearheaded by the international council for science and the world meteorological organization .
norway ’ s environment minister helen bjoernoey praised the report .
" this report gives us an overall picture of the changes in snow and ice cover and the consequences for human beings and nature , not only in the polar and mountainous areas , but all over the world .

according to watt , the impact of melting ice can be seen most clearly in these arctic regions , but the effects will reach far wider , with rising sea levels and changing ocean currents .
" we are very negatively and disproportionately affected by climate change , " said cloutier .
" the melting of -lrb- the ice -rrb- is creating not only inconvenience but real issues of livelihoods that are at stake where safety and security have become a remarkable challenge for us . "

"
" melting ice and snow are also likely to increase hazards including avalanches and floods from the build-up of potentially unstable glacial lakes .
these can burst their ice and soil dams , sending walls of water down valleys , " said steiner in his remarks in tromso .

they struck deals on air security and air traffic . just two days before the g8 meetings are set to begin , merkel represented the eu at talks with canadian prime minister stephen harper in berlin .
harper is one of the eight leaders who will attend the summit , which starts on wednesday at the german beach resort of heiligendamm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " cool " canada agrees climate should be a un issue ...

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : security and protests at the g8 summit us demonstrators join the g8 protests police prevent protests as g8 summit gets going in germany the demonized face of g8 protests locals live with g8 protests in own backyard opposition -pipe- 05.06.2007 globalization opponents gear up in the 11th hour großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of demonstrators have camped out around heiligendamm the mood is tense in the camps set up by anti-g8 activists near heiligendamm .
many blame police for recent violence .
deutsche welle visited the demonstrators ' camp as they continue their campaign , seemingly at any cost . " training starts today at 12:00 at the information center . "
the announcement was on monday made in both german and english to the globalization opponents at the encampment located 10 kilometers -lrb- about 6 miles -rrb- south of the resort hotel where world leaders are scheduled to meet on wednesday .
in this case , " training " means preparing the demonstrators for blockades that are intended to massively disrupt the group of eight summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meet here for blockade training ready to break the law " it 's about active resistance , " said activist alex kristow from press group kempinski .
" we 've always said that it 's necessary to break the law in some situations in order to make people aware of major problems like neo-liberal globalization .
" it 's not enough to march through the streets carrying a sign , " continued kristow .
" we claim the right to block a street so that delegations who want to go to this summit ca n't get through . "
after demonstrations turned into violent riots in rostock on saturday , many of the demonstrators expect police to raid the camps in order to weed out potentially violent activists before the summit begins .
preparing for police raid " we believe that the police are trying to reduce the number of participants in coming protests by storming the camp and arresting the offenders from the last demonstrations , " said marius kürten , who traveled to the event from speyer in south-western germany .
" we 're going to mobilize the entire camp against the police . "
at the entrance to the camp , a banner has been raised with a message to the police : " you 're on call - we 're having fun . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peace ?
the relaxing music in the camp belies the tense mood .
the stretch of tents - roughly the size of three soccer fields - is seen as occupied territory off-limits to security forces .
police have parked their buses and set up headquarters some distance away , at the intersection leading to the camp entrance .
peaceful protestors harbor extremists " we 've seen that they 've set up barricades so that the press and police ca n't drive through , " said gabi baumgart , a manager at a window company whose office borders the encampment .
" the people here earlier were really great , they were really nice and peaceful , " continued baumgart .
" but we just had a directors meeting upstairs and could see that five people went into the bush to practice with their slingshots .
there are also a few people there looking for a hide-out , which the other people in the camp do n't want . "
nevertheless , they do n't seem to want to distance themselves from the violent activists .
many blame the police for the skirmishes last weekend , though the violence cost the demonstrators much of the sympathy they had had from parts of the general population .
alex kristow called saturday 's demonstration " powerful , colorful and strong , " but added that " it was also setback in that it became clear that the police and state officials will use any means to de-legitimize this movement .

by contrast , experts were predicting financial and social collapse in europe . marshall , a future nobel peace prize winner , said at harvard that his proposal was " directed not against any country or doctrine but against hunger , poverty , desperation and chaos . "
he laid out his plan based on the initiative of the europeans and on their faith in the economic future of their countries and of europe as a whole . " it is logical that the united states should do whatever it is able to do to assist in the return of normal economic health in the world , without which there can be no political stability and no assured peace , " marshall said . within weeks of the speech , european governments - led by france and britain - began drafting marshall 's spending plan .
essentially , the plan was about supplying german importers of life-sustaining goods with hard currency . the marshall effect by the end of the marshall plan in 1952 , five years after marshall 's speech , the united states had invested more than $ 13 billion in goods and financial services , equal to $ 100 billion today -lrb- 74.3 billion euros -rrb- .
about $ 1.4 billion of the initial total was invested in rebuilding a germany that had been reduced to a landscape of rubble . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany was the fourth biggest recipient of us aid the offer of us help was made to all european countries .
the top four recipients of aid , in descending order , were britain , france , italy and germany .
moscow set the tone for the coming cold war , with a clear " nyet " that forbade the east european countries under its heel from accepting the largess of the capitalist benefactor . no one doubts that the marshall plan contributed mightily to cementing the division of europe and the world . washington 's intensions were plain : only with prosperity could western europe become a bulwark against communism .
the marshall plan helped make europe 's hungry masses reliable partners for the us . the designers of the marshall plan can not take all of the credit for this record of success .
local resources accounted for 80 to 90 per cent of capital formation in the major european economies during the first two years of the recovery program , according to university of iowa history professor michael hogan , a prominent expert on the marshall plan . yet , the marshall plan provided the " critical margin " of support that made european self-help possible .
it fuelled essential imports , eased production bottlenecks , encouraged higher rates of capital formation and helped to suppress inflation , hogan wrote in a paper marking the 50th anniversary of marshall 's speech . all these effects led to gains in productivity , improvements in trade and the most durable era of social peace and prosperity in modern european history . marshall plan today bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have considered setting up a new marshall plan help in iraq or the balkans the ideals of the marshall plan have been invoked countless times by well-meaning people , facing the tasks of rebuilding regions torn by crisis or failed states from latin america to the balkans and , now , iraq . there have been so many references that larry bland , director of the george marshall foundation , has stopped counting . historians wave aside calls for a new marshall plan , saying the structures and historical situation after world war ii were unique .
the marshall plan , in a sense , oiled the gears of existing machinery - it did not bear the burden of bringing trade and forging modern political structures in places with no experience of them . western europe for centuries had known the rule of law , democracy and private property and initiative .
the us was dealing with people who knew what to do and who knew the importance of the middle class , bland said .
they were people who did n't need to be taught democracy and free enterprise . dw staff dpa -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many blame police for recent violence .
deutsche welle visited the demonstrators ' camp as they continue their campaign , seemingly at any cost . " training starts today at 12:00 at the information center . "
the announcement was on monday made in both german and english to the globalization opponents at the encampment located 10 kilometers -lrb- about 6 miles -rrb- south of the resort hotel where world leaders are scheduled to meet on wednesday .
in this case , " training " means preparing the demonstrators for blockades that are intended to massively disrupt the group of eight summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meet here for blockade training ready to break the law " it 's about active resistance , " said activist alex kristow from press group kempinski .
" we 've always said that it 's necessary to break the law in some situations in order to make people aware of major problems like neo-liberal globalization .
" it 's not enough to march through the streets carrying a sign , " continued kristow .
" we claim the right to block a street so that delegations who want to go to this summit ca n't get through . "
after demonstrations turned into violent riots in rostock on saturday , many of the demonstrators expect police to raid the camps in order to weed out potentially violent activists before the summit begins .
preparing for police raid " we believe that the police are trying to reduce the number of participants in coming protests by storming the camp and arresting the offenders from the last demonstrations , " said marius kürten , who traveled to the event from speyer in south-western germany .
" we 're going to mobilize the entire camp against the police . "
at the entrance to the camp , a banner has been raised with a message to the police : " you 're on call - we 're having fun . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peace ?
the relaxing music in the camp belies the tense mood .
the stretch of tents - roughly the size of three soccer fields - is seen as occupied territory off-limits to security forces .
police have parked their buses and set up headquarters some distance away , at the intersection leading to the camp entrance .
peaceful protestors harbor extremists " we 've seen that they 've set up barricades so that the press and police ca n't drive through , " said gabi baumgart , a manager at a window company whose office borders the encampment .
" the people here earlier were really great , they were really nice and peaceful , " continued baumgart .
" but we just had a directors meeting upstairs and could see that five people went into the bush to practice with their slingshots .
there are also a few people there looking for a hide-out , which the other people in the camp do n't want . "
nevertheless , they do n't seem to want to distance themselves from the violent activists .
many blame the police for the skirmishes last weekend , though the violence cost the demonstrators much of the sympathy they had had from parts of the general population .
alex kristow called saturday 's demonstration " powerful , colorful and strong , " but added that " it was also setback in that it became clear that the police and state officials will use any means to de-legitimize this movement .

chief negotiators of the world 's leading industrial nations are meeting in berlin on tuesday in a last-ditch effort to remove obstacles threatening to derail a g8 deal on climate change . german chancellor angela merkel , whose country holds the current presidency of the g8 , wants this week 's summit participants in heiligendamm to agree to set long-term goals to cut greenhouse gas emissions . but she faces opposition from us president george w. bush , who wants to convene a global summit that includes a new generation of polluters from the developing world such as china , india and brazil . germany wants the g8 to agree to cut greenhouse gas emissions to 50 per cent below 1990 levels by the year 2050 in order to ensure that the world 's average temperature increase due to global warming does not exceed two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degree fahrenheit -rrb- . a new kyoto bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the talks are taking place far away from the g8 protests germany wants this to form the framework for a new united nations protocol on climate change to replace the kyoto agreement when it expires in 2012 . merkel won backing from british premier tony blair , although she appears to be less optimistic that a landmark deal will be reached at the summit to cover the post-kyoto period . " at the g8 we need to agree the elements of a future framework , " blair told parliamentarians in the german capital on sunday .
" this would allow the un talks to accelerate and reach earlier agreement so that we have a framework for kyoto in place by 2009 . " the bush plan last week bush called for about 15 countries that account for the bulk of greenhouse-gas emissions , including the us , to meet later this year for talks on a " long-term global goal " for cutting emissions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush supports voluntary cuts in emissions the us has acknowledged that climate change is a serious problem caused by humans that requires action - though , in the us , only through voluntary steps . the role of china , which is not a member of the g8 , is crucial , as many experts believe it could overtake the united states this year as the world 's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases . china on monday issued its own plan for responding to global climate change but urged developed nations to take the lead and allow poorer nations to focus on economic development . at the same time , japan said it would use the g8 to launch an aid program for developing countries that would encourage them to fight global warming as well as pollution and poverty . bush versus merkel ? merkel , who has made the fight against global warming a key issue of germany 's g8 presidency , is scheduled to have lunch with bush immediately before the start of the g8 summit on wednesday . there has been a mixed reaction to the president 's call for global warming talks with a select group of polluter nations .
but it was not meant to sideline broader un discussions on climate change , us national security advisor stephen hadley said last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with or without bush , merkel is pushing global climate reform " it is an effort to try and find consensus on the way ahead , " he said ahead of the g8 summit grouping the us , canada , germany , japan , france , britain , italy and russia . " this week presents an opportunity to turn mr. bush 's newfound interest in climate change into a commitment to do something about it soon , " britain 's observer newspaper said in an editorial . merkel , who was to meet with canadian prime minister stephen harper on monday evening and japanese premier shinzo abe on tuesday , said she was confident the pre-summit talks would lead to " important steps " being agreed upon . " we will fight until the very last moment for concrete wording , " government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said in reference to the final communiqué to be issued by the end of the week . dw staff / dpa -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this time , we look at an international best-seller - a murder mystery with sheep as detectives . three bags full by leonie swann translated by anthea bell doubleday publishers 351 pages nearly any reader would admit that a book about a flock of sheep solving a murder mystery would lend itself to jokes about counting those sheep as one turns the pages . especially if the story starts off slowly and one is prone to spontaneous bouts of slumber - those z 's gently purring out of one 's mouth as the book gradually tilts forward , the reader nods off and images of fleecy sheep jumping over a fence loom ever larger in the mind 's eye . while reading the first chapters of leonie swann 's " three bags full " -lrb- " glennkill " in german -rrb- , this reader had to keep reminding herself that the book had become an international best-seller that had meanwhile been translated into at least 16 different languages . that fact , and the occasional bemusement at the soliloquies of the detective sheep pondering who had killed their shepherd , spurred me on , but not without resistance . puzzling idea somehow the compelling nature of their shepherd 's murder just did not come across in the initial pages of the book .
still , i read on , intrigued by how the debut novelist would depict the rest of the puzzle surrounding shepherd george glenn 's demise . after all , the setting was inviting - a hillside meadow near the irish village of glennkill , and the depth of the sheep 's outrage at finding george pinned to the ground with a spade did slowly emerge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hardcover version swann 's sheep , armed with their own literary accoutrements , deductive abilities and determination to avenge their shepherd 's death , begin tracking down the culprit .
with names like " othello " -lrb- the lead , black ram -rrb- and " miss maple " -lrb- a.k.a. " the smartest sheep in all glennkill " -rrb- , the animal protagonists already have an indirect link to murder and crime-solving . furthermore , they had developed their cognitive abilities by listening to their former shepherd george read aloud to them every afternoon when taking a break from grazing .
george 's literary tastes ranged from fairy tales to treatises on sheep diseases to trashy novels featuring red-headed heroines named " pamela . "
conveniently enough , george also once read a detective story to the sheep , so they feel adequately prepared to tackle the dirty business of crime-fighting . following their noses as they muse over the quirky behavior of human beings , the animals also apply their sharply honed sense of smell to aid them in solving the puzzle .
while swann 's countless descriptions of the sheep scenting the villagers to glean information do perhaps prompt a deeper understanding of just how animals tick , they also compose the sections of the novel that easily could have been whittled down .
the flowery depictions of the animals ' olfactory aptitude are initially amusing , and ultimately , annoying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in swann 's book , sheep have a mind of their own still , the sheep 's sense of smell gives them a straightforward approach that allows them to distinguish between the liars and truth-seekers in glennkill , among them : george 's estranged wife , the butcher , a rival shepherd , a pentecostal wallflower pining for the murdered man and george 's even more estranged daughter who returns to the village .
this ability to scent also eventually leads them to successfully , albeit indirectly , reveal george 's murderer . history of animal literary figures swann is not the first to employ animals as literary protagonists .
other smart animals carry the flag in well-known books such as george orwell 's " animal farm , " paul auster 's " timbuktu , " haruki murakami 's " kafka on the shore " or the children 's tale " charlotte 's web , " to name just a few . yet , as ian sansom wrote in the guardian , " with sheep as detectives swann solves one of the major problems in crime fiction , which is how to avoid the stereotypical jaded , cynical , alcoholic deadbeat gumshoe with relationship problems . " lending other animals in the book monikers such as " rameses , " " mopple the whale " and " satan " also helps to feed the reader 's imagination . mixed reviews some german literary critics have been harsh in their assessment of " three bags full , " with one writer in the weighty weekly die zeit wondering how swann 's " simple " language can generate a best-seller . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author leonie swann another critic in the influential daily süddeutsche zeitung imagined a clever talk between a literary agent and a prospective author that targeted cute sheep in narrative as harbingers of massive book sales . denis scheck , a prominent german literary critic , was kinder , calling the acquaintance with swann 's glennkill sheep a " real pleasure . " " three bags full " is a bit strange , but , as sansom wrote , it is also affecting .
if you can get over the initial slow pace of the book and a personal unwillingness to accept sheep as anything but dull , you will enjoy an occasional chuckle or smirk as you read on the train and glance up every now and then at your fellow commuters . ultimately , swann 's book offers readers perhaps less of a new take on how we perceive animals , and more of one on how they perceive us . it 's a lightly philosophical summer read , with the paperback edition due out at the beginning of july . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this time , we look at an international best-seller - a murder mystery with sheep as detectives . three bags full by leonie swann translated by anthea bell doubleday publishers 351 pages nearly any reader would admit that a book about a flock of sheep solving a murder mystery would lend itself to jokes about counting those sheep as one turns the pages . especially if the story starts off slowly and one is prone to spontaneous bouts of slumber - those z 's gently purring out of one 's mouth as the book gradually tilts forward , the reader nods off and images of fleecy sheep jumping over a fence loom ever larger in the mind 's eye . while reading the first chapters of leonie swann 's " three bags full " -lrb- " glennkill " in german -rrb- , this reader had to keep reminding herself that the book had become an international best-seller that had meanwhile been translated into at least 16 different languages . that fact , and the occasional bemusement at the soliloquies of the detective sheep pondering who had killed their shepherd , spurred me on , but not without resistance . puzzling idea somehow the compelling nature of their shepherd 's murder just did not come across in the initial pages of the book .
still , i read on , intrigued by how the debut novelist would depict the rest of the puzzle surrounding shepherd george glenn 's demise . after all , the setting was inviting - a hillside meadow near the irish village of glennkill , and the depth of the sheep 's outrage at finding george pinned to the ground with a spade did slowly emerge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hardcover version swann 's sheep , armed with their own literary accoutrements , deductive abilities and determination to avenge their shepherd 's death , begin tracking down the culprit .
with names like " othello " -lrb- the lead , black ram -rrb- and " miss maple " -lrb- a.k.a. " the smartest sheep in all glennkill " -rrb- , the animal protagonists already have an indirect link to murder and crime-solving . furthermore , they had developed their cognitive abilities by listening to their former shepherd george read aloud to them every afternoon when taking a break from grazing .
george 's literary tastes ranged from fairy tales to treatises on sheep diseases to trashy novels featuring red-headed heroines named " pamela . "
conveniently enough , george also once read a detective story to the sheep , so they feel adequately prepared to tackle the dirty business of crime-fighting . following their noses as they muse over the quirky behavior of human beings , the animals also apply their sharply honed sense of smell to aid them in solving the puzzle .
while swann 's countless descriptions of the sheep scenting the villagers to glean information do perhaps prompt a deeper understanding of just how animals tick , they also compose the sections of the novel that easily could have been whittled down .
the flowery depictions of the animals ' olfactory aptitude are initially amusing , and ultimately , annoying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in swann 's book , sheep have a mind of their own still , the sheep 's sense of smell gives them a straightforward approach that allows them to distinguish between the liars and truth-seekers in glennkill , among them : george 's estranged wife , the butcher , a rival shepherd , a pentecostal wallflower pining for the murdered man and george 's even more estranged daughter who returns to the village .
this ability to scent also eventually leads them to successfully , albeit indirectly , reveal george 's murderer . history of animal literary figures swann is not the first to employ animals as literary protagonists .
other smart animals carry the flag in well-known books such as george orwell 's " animal farm , " paul auster 's " timbuktu , " haruki murakami 's " kafka on the shore " or the children 's tale " charlotte 's web , " to name just a few . yet , as ian sansom wrote in the guardian , " with sheep as detectives swann solves one of the major problems in crime fiction , which is how to avoid the stereotypical jaded , cynical , alcoholic deadbeat gumshoe with relationship problems . " lending other animals in the book monikers such as " rameses , " " mopple the whale " and " satan " also helps to feed the reader 's imagination . mixed reviews some german literary critics have been harsh in their assessment of " three bags full , " with one writer in the weighty weekly die zeit wondering how swann 's " simple " language can generate a best-seller . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author leonie swann another critic in the influential daily süddeutsche zeitung imagined a clever talk between a literary agent and a prospective author that targeted cute sheep in narrative as harbingers of massive book sales . denis scheck , a prominent german literary critic , was kinder , calling the acquaintance with swann 's glennkill sheep a " real pleasure . " " three bags full " is a bit strange , but , as sansom wrote , it is also affecting .
if you can get over the initial slow pace of the book and a personal unwillingness to accept sheep as anything but dull , you will enjoy an occasional chuckle or smirk as you read on the train and glance up every now and then at your fellow commuters . ultimately , swann 's book offers readers perhaps less of a new take on how we perceive animals , and more of one on how they perceive us . it 's a lightly philosophical summer read , with the paperback edition due out at the beginning of july . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

statehood for kosovo is the latest . climate change and aid to africa have long been on the agenda for the g8 summit which kicks off on wednesday in heiligendamm on the north-eastern german coast . but the gathering of rich industrial nations that includes russia threatens to be overshadowed by divisions within the club from an unexpected source : kosovo . the tiny autonomous province in serbia , which is under un administration , has n't grabbed banner headlines since 1999 , when us-led air strikes forced out slobodan milosevic 's marauding army .
but that 's mainly because nato 's huge international contingent has kept the peace . territorial and ethnic tensions in the remains of the former yugoslavia are still simmering below the surface , and now with the un road map for kosovo 's independence from serbia on the table , the western powers want to finally put the last chapter of the balkans saga to bed . the world 's political powers meeting at the group of eight summit this week in germany should decide whether the un security council should proceed with a draft resolution dealing with the future of kosovo , the council president said monday . " we 'll see how the situation will evolve , " said belgium 's un ambassador johan verbeke .
" for the time being , it 's a wait-and-see period ; it 's a question of days , not weeks . " verbeke , whose country holds the rotating council presidency for june , said once the eight world leaders give the go-ahead , he will put the kosovo issue on the council 's monthly agenda .
he said the decision also belongs to capitals of 15 countries on the council .
bildunterschrift : rice -lrb- second from right -rrb- and lavrov -lrb- second from left -rrb- exchanged barbs over missile defense and kosovo russian opposition at last week 's foreign ministers meeting in potsdam - best known as the venue for the postwar meeting of us , british and soviet leaders - the cold war lines between europe and united states on one side , and russia on the other , were clearly drawn again . us secretary of state condoleezza rice and russian foreign minister sergey lavrov not only exchanged barbs about moscow 's opposition to plans for us anti-missile shield installations in poland and the czech republic , but also over the future status of kosovo . lavrov denounced the plan drawn up by un special envoy martti ahtisaari , which seeks to transfer custody of the overwhelmingly ethnic albanian province to the eu in the transitional period to nationhood .
the plan was approved by the parliament in kosovo , but rejected by the autonomous region 's serb minority and belgrade . the kremlin 's adamant opposition took the western allies by surprise , although lavrov stopped short of saying that russia would exercise its veto power in the un 's security council . one expert says the reasons moscow is supporting a fellow slavic state are complicated and need to be understood within the broad scope of russia 's relations with the eu and us . russian resurgence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patience for independance in kosovo is wearing thin " russia has no leverage over the balkan states and knows it .
there 's no way that russia could stop the ahtisaari plan if the west stands united in favor of it .
its veto power in the security council is symbolic .
after all the us invaded iraq without a un mandate , " said alexander rahr , program director for russia at the german council on foreign relations . " the russians are putting up a front .
they have their national pride , and do n't want to be seen as a junior partner of the west .
remember they were humiliated back in the 1990s , " said rahr , referring to a time when an economically weak and chaotic russia that had emerged from communism was unable to protect its serb ally in the war that nato waged without un authorization . " now the russians have got oil money , " added rahr , who explained that the windfall from its energy exports and increasing strategic importance because of it has led to a new assertiveness in president vladimir putin 's dealings with the west . besides russia has a point in pushing the conflicting parties - ethnic albanians and christian serbs - to work out their own lasting compromise , which could be preferable to the great powers imposing a nation-state from above , according to rahr . need to win over the serbs " the serbs wo n't agree to kosovo 's independence today , but who says they ca n't be won over in say , two years time ?
young serbs are not all nationalistic .
you need to win them over , make them european .
we in the eu made the mistake of not inviting serbia to join us , " he said . another concern shared by moscow and other countries is the precedent a un resolution would set , giving impetus to independence movements elsewhere , such as the basques in spain , kurds in turkey and the chechens in russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un plan named after martti ahtisaari has eu and us support other specialists say , however , that vladimir putin 's motivation for isolating russia against the eu and us on the kosovo issue is a puzzle , since he is not running for reelection when his term expires in 2008 and , with high domestic approval ratings anyway , he does not need to pander to an electorate at home . ever a tinderbox ? " kosovo is part of a host of issues - energy security , missile defense , human rights - that putin has used to wreak havoc , to divide the eu from within and split the eu and us , " said julianne smith , director of the europe program at the center for strategic and international studies in washington . " if the ahtisaari plan falls off the table , we could see instability and violence again in the balkans , which is not in russia 's interest either , " said smith , who explained that keeping the issue of kosovo 's independence on the back burner risks creating a backlash among the albanian kosovars , whose patience is wearing thin after seven years as a ward of the united nations . " kosovo is a tinderbox , and it wo n't take much to reignite it .
there is no other possible solution -lrb- to the ahtisaari plan -rrb- .

statehood for kosovo is the latest . climate change and aid to africa have long been on the agenda for the g8 summit which kicks off on wednesday in heiligendamm on the north-eastern german coast . but the gathering of rich industrial nations that includes russia threatens to be overshadowed by divisions within the club from an unexpected source : kosovo . the tiny autonomous province in serbia , which is under un administration , has n't grabbed banner headlines since 1999 , when us-led air strikes forced out slobodan milosevic 's marauding army .
but that 's mainly because nato 's huge international contingent has kept the peace . territorial and ethnic tensions in the remains of the former yugoslavia are still simmering below the surface , and now with the un road map for kosovo 's independence from serbia on the table , the western powers want to finally put the last chapter of the balkans saga to bed . the world 's political powers meeting at the group of eight summit this week in germany should decide whether the un security council should proceed with a draft resolution dealing with the future of kosovo , the council president said monday . " we 'll see how the situation will evolve , " said belgium 's un ambassador johan verbeke .
" for the time being , it 's a wait-and-see period ; it 's a question of days , not weeks . " verbeke , whose country holds the rotating council presidency for june , said once the eight world leaders give the go-ahead , he will put the kosovo issue on the council 's monthly agenda .
he said the decision also belongs to capitals of 15 countries on the council .
bildunterschrift : rice -lrb- second from right -rrb- and lavrov -lrb- second from left -rrb- exchanged barbs over missile defense and kosovo russian opposition at last week 's foreign ministers meeting in potsdam - best known as the venue for the postwar meeting of us , british and soviet leaders - the cold war lines between europe and united states on one side , and russia on the other , were clearly drawn again . us secretary of state condoleezza rice and russian foreign minister sergey lavrov not only exchanged barbs about moscow 's opposition to plans for us anti-missile shield installations in poland and the czech republic , but also over the future status of kosovo . lavrov denounced the plan drawn up by un special envoy martti ahtisaari , which seeks to transfer custody of the overwhelmingly ethnic albanian province to the eu in the transitional period to nationhood .
the plan was approved by the parliament in kosovo , but rejected by the autonomous region 's serb minority and belgrade . the kremlin 's adamant opposition took the western allies by surprise , although lavrov stopped short of saying that russia would exercise its veto power in the un 's security council . one expert says the reasons moscow is supporting a fellow slavic state are complicated and need to be understood within the broad scope of russia 's relations with the eu and us . russian resurgence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patience for independance in kosovo is wearing thin " russia has no leverage over the balkan states and knows it .
there 's no way that russia could stop the ahtisaari plan if the west stands united in favor of it .
its veto power in the security council is symbolic .

they have their national pride , and do n't want to be seen as a junior partner of the west .
remember they were humiliated back in the 1990s , " said rahr , referring to a time when an economically weak and chaotic russia that had emerged from communism was unable to protect its serb ally in the war that nato waged without un authorization . " now the russians have got oil money , " added rahr , who explained that the windfall from its energy exports and increasing strategic importance because of it has led to a new assertiveness in president vladimir putin 's dealings with the west . besides russia has a point in pushing the conflicting parties - ethnic albanians and christian serbs - to work out their own lasting compromise , which could be preferable to the great powers imposing a nation-state from above , according to rahr . need to win over the serbs " the serbs wo n't agree to kosovo 's independence today , but who says they ca n't be won over in say , two years time ?
young serbs are not all nationalistic .
you need to win them over , make them european .

statehood for kosovo is the latest . climate change and aid to africa have long been on the agenda for the g8 summit which kicks off on wednesday in heiligendamm on the north-eastern german coast . but the gathering of rich industrial nations that includes russia threatens to be overshadowed by divisions within the club from an unexpected source : kosovo . the tiny autonomous province in serbia , which is under un administration , has n't grabbed banner headlines since 1999 , when us-led air strikes forced out slobodan milosevic 's marauding army .
but that 's mainly because nato 's huge international contingent has kept the peace . territorial and ethnic tensions in the remains of the former yugoslavia are still simmering below the surface , and now with the un road map for kosovo 's independence from serbia on the table , the western powers want to finally put the last chapter of the balkans saga to bed . the world 's political powers meeting at the group of eight summit this week in germany should decide whether the un security council should proceed with a draft resolution dealing with the future of kosovo , the council president said monday . " we 'll see how the situation will evolve , " said belgium 's un ambassador johan verbeke .
" for the time being , it 's a wait-and-see period ; it 's a question of days , not weeks . " verbeke , whose country holds the rotating council presidency for june , said once the eight world leaders give the go-ahead , he will put the kosovo issue on the council 's monthly agenda .
he said the decision also belongs to capitals of 15 countries on the council .
bildunterschrift : rice -lrb- second from right -rrb- and lavrov -lrb- second from left -rrb- exchanged barbs over missile defense and kosovo russian opposition at last week 's foreign ministers meeting in potsdam - best known as the venue for the postwar meeting of us , british and soviet leaders - the cold war lines between europe and united states on one side , and russia on the other , were clearly drawn again . us secretary of state condoleezza rice and russian foreign minister sergey lavrov not only exchanged barbs about moscow 's opposition to plans for us anti-missile shield installations in poland and the czech republic , but also over the future status of kosovo . lavrov denounced the plan drawn up by un special envoy martti ahtisaari , which seeks to transfer custody of the overwhelmingly ethnic albanian province to the eu in the transitional period to nationhood .
the plan was approved by the parliament in kosovo , but rejected by the autonomous region 's serb minority and belgrade . the kremlin 's adamant opposition took the western allies by surprise , although lavrov stopped short of saying that russia would exercise its veto power in the un 's security council . one expert says the reasons moscow is supporting a fellow slavic state are complicated and need to be understood within the broad scope of russia 's relations with the eu and us . russian resurgence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patience for independance in kosovo is wearing thin " russia has no leverage over the balkan states and knows it .
there 's no way that russia could stop the ahtisaari plan if the west stands united in favor of it .
its veto power in the security council is symbolic .
after all the us invaded iraq without a un mandate , " said alexander rahr , program director for russia at the german council on foreign relations . " the russians are putting up a front .
they have their national pride , and do n't want to be seen as a junior partner of the west .
remember they were humiliated back in the 1990s , " said rahr , referring to a time when an economically weak and chaotic russia that had emerged from communism was unable to protect its serb ally in the war that nato waged without un authorization . " now the russians have got oil money , " added rahr , who explained that the windfall from its energy exports and increasing strategic importance because of it has led to a new assertiveness in president vladimir putin 's dealings with the west . besides russia has a point in pushing the conflicting parties - ethnic albanians and christian serbs - to work out their own lasting compromise , which could be preferable to the great powers imposing a nation-state from above , according to rahr . need to win over the serbs " the serbs wo n't agree to kosovo 's independence today , but who says they ca n't be won over in say , two years time ?
young serbs are not all nationalistic .
you need to win them over , make them european .
we in the eu made the mistake of not inviting serbia to join us , " he said . another concern shared by moscow and other countries is the precedent a un resolution would set , giving impetus to independence movements elsewhere , such as the basques in spain , kurds in turkey and the chechens in russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un plan named after martti ahtisaari has eu and us support other specialists say , however , that vladimir putin 's motivation for isolating russia against the eu and us on the kosovo issue is a puzzle , since he is not running for reelection when his term expires in 2008 and , with high domestic approval ratings anyway , he does not need to pander to an electorate at home . ever a tinderbox ? " kosovo is part of a host of issues - energy security , missile defense , human rights - that putin has used to wreak havoc , to divide the eu from within and split the eu and us , " said julianne smith , director of the europe program at the center for strategic and international studies in washington . " if the ahtisaari plan falls off the table , we could see instability and violence again in the balkans , which is not in russia 's interest either , " said smith , who explained that keeping the issue of kosovo 's independence on the back burner risks creating a backlash among the albanian kosovars , whose patience is wearing thin after seven years as a ward of the united nations . " kosovo is a tinderbox , and it wo n't take much to reignite it .
there is no other possible solution -lrb- to the ahtisaari plan -rrb- .

chief negotiators of the world 's leading industrial nations are meeting in berlin on tuesday in a last-ditch effort to remove obstacles threatening to derail a g8 deal on climate change . german chancellor angela merkel , whose country holds the current presidency of the g8 , wants this week 's summit participants in heiligendamm to agree to set long-term goals to cut greenhouse gas emissions . but she faces opposition from us president george w. bush , who wants to convene a global summit that includes a new generation of polluters from the developing world such as china , india and brazil . germany wants the g8 to agree to cut greenhouse gas emissions to 50 per cent below 1990 levels by the year 2050 in order to ensure that the world 's average temperature increase due to global warming does not exceed two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degree fahrenheit -rrb- . a new kyoto bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the talks are taking place far away from the g8 protests germany wants this to form the framework for a new united nations protocol on climate change to replace the kyoto agreement when it expires in 2012 . merkel won backing from british premier tony blair , although she appears to be less optimistic that a landmark deal will be reached at the summit to cover the post-kyoto period .

" this would allow the un talks to accelerate and reach earlier agreement so that we have a framework for kyoto in place by 2009 .

chief negotiators of the world 's leading industrial nations are meeting in berlin on tuesday in a last-ditch effort to remove obstacles threatening to derail a g8 deal on climate change . german chancellor angela merkel , whose country holds the current presidency of the g8 , wants this week 's summit participants in heiligendamm to agree to set long-term goals to cut greenhouse gas emissions . but she faces opposition from us president george w. bush , who wants to convene a global summit that includes a new generation of polluters from the developing world such as china , india and brazil . germany wants the g8 to agree to cut greenhouse gas emissions to 50 per cent below 1990 levels by the year 2050 in order to ensure that the world 's average temperature increase due to global warming does not exceed two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degree fahrenheit -rrb- . a new kyoto bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the talks are taking place far away from the g8 protests germany wants this to form the framework for a new united nations protocol on climate change to replace the kyoto agreement when it expires in 2012 . merkel won backing from british premier tony blair , although she appears to be less optimistic that a landmark deal will be reached at the summit to cover the post-kyoto period . " at the g8 we need to agree the elements of a future framework , " blair told parliamentarians in the german capital on sunday .
" this would allow the un talks to accelerate and reach earlier agreement so that we have a framework for kyoto in place by 2009 . " the bush plan last week bush called for about 15 countries that account for the bulk of greenhouse-gas emissions , including the us , to meet later this year for talks on a " long-term global goal " for cutting emissions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush supports voluntary cuts in emissions the us has acknowledged that climate change is a serious problem caused by humans that requires action - though , in the us , only through voluntary steps . the role of china , which is not a member of the g8 , is crucial , as many experts believe it could overtake the united states this year as the world 's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases . china on monday issued its own plan for responding to global climate change but urged developed nations to take the lead and allow poorer nations to focus on economic development . at the same time , japan said it would use the g8 to launch an aid program for developing countries that would encourage them to fight global warming as well as pollution and poverty . bush versus merkel ? merkel , who has made the fight against global warming a key issue of germany 's g8 presidency , is scheduled to have lunch with bush immediately before the start of the g8 summit on wednesday . there has been a mixed reaction to the president 's call for global warming talks with a select group of polluter nations .
but it was not meant to sideline broader un discussions on climate change , us national security advisor stephen hadley said last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with or without bush , merkel is pushing global climate reform " it is an effort to try and find consensus on the way ahead , " he said ahead of the g8 summit grouping the us , canada , germany , japan , france , britain , italy and russia . " this week presents an opportunity to turn mr. bush 's newfound interest in climate change into a commitment to do something about it soon , " britain 's observer newspaper said in an editorial . merkel , who was to meet with canadian prime minister stephen harper on monday evening and japanese premier shinzo abe on tuesday , said she was confident the pre-summit talks would lead to " important steps " being agreed upon .

the announcement was on monday made in both german and english to the globalization opponents at the encampment located 10 kilometers -lrb- about 6 miles -rrb- south of the resort hotel where world leaders are scheduled to meet on wednesday .
in this case , " training " means preparing the demonstrators for blockades that are intended to massively disrupt the group of eight summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meet here for blockade training ready to break the law " it 's about active resistance , " said activist alex kristow from press group kempinski .
" we 've always said that it 's necessary to break the law in some situations in order to make people aware of major problems like neo-liberal globalization .
" it 's not enough to march through the streets carrying a sign , " continued kristow .
" we claim the right to block a street so that delegations who want to go to this summit ca n't get through . "
after demonstrations turned into violent riots in rostock on saturday , many of the demonstrators expect police to raid the camps in order to weed out potentially violent activists before the summit begins .
preparing for police raid " we believe that the police are trying to reduce the number of participants in coming protests by storming the camp and arresting the offenders from the last demonstrations , " said marius kürten , who traveled to the event from speyer in south-western germany .
" we 're going to mobilize the entire camp against the police . "
at the entrance to the camp , a banner has been raised with a message to the police : " you 're on call - we 're having fun . "

the relaxing music in the camp belies the tense mood .
the stretch of tents - roughly the size of three soccer fields - is seen as occupied territory off-limits to security forces .
police have parked their buses and set up headquarters some distance away , at the intersection leading to the camp entrance .
peaceful protestors harbor extremists " we 've seen that they 've set up barricades so that the press and police ca n't drive through , " said gabi baumgart , a manager at a window company whose office borders the encampment .
" the people here earlier were really great , they were really nice and peaceful , " continued baumgart .
" but we just had a directors meeting upstairs and could see that five people went into the bush to practice with their slingshots .
there are also a few people there looking for a hide-out , which the other people in the camp do n't want . "
nevertheless , they do n't seem to want to distance themselves from the violent activists .
many blame the police for the skirmishes last weekend , though the violence cost the demonstrators much of the sympathy they had had from parts of the general population .
alex kristow called saturday 's demonstration " powerful , colorful and strong , " but added that " it was also setback in that it became clear that the police and state officials will use any means to de-legitimize this movement .

many blame police for recent violence .
deutsche welle visited the demonstrators ' camp as they continue their campaign , seemingly at any cost . " training starts today at 12:00 at the information center . "
the announcement was on monday made in both german and english to the globalization opponents at the encampment located 10 kilometers -lrb- about 6 miles -rrb- south of the resort hotel where world leaders are scheduled to meet on wednesday .
in this case , " training " means preparing the demonstrators for blockades that are intended to massively disrupt the group of eight summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meet here for blockade training ready to break the law " it 's about active resistance , " said activist alex kristow from press group kempinski .
" we 've always said that it 's necessary to break the law in some situations in order to make people aware of major problems like neo-liberal globalization .
" it 's not enough to march through the streets carrying a sign , " continued kristow .
" we claim the right to block a street so that delegations who want to go to this summit ca n't get through . "
after demonstrations turned into violent riots in rostock on saturday , many of the demonstrators expect police to raid the camps in order to weed out potentially violent activists before the summit begins .
preparing for police raid " we believe that the police are trying to reduce the number of participants in coming protests by storming the camp and arresting the offenders from the last demonstrations , " said marius kürten , who traveled to the event from speyer in south-western germany .
" we 're going to mobilize the entire camp against the police . "
at the entrance to the camp , a banner has been raised with a message to the police : " you 're on call - we 're having fun . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peace ?
the relaxing music in the camp belies the tense mood .
the stretch of tents - roughly the size of three soccer fields - is seen as occupied territory off-limits to security forces .
police have parked their buses and set up headquarters some distance away , at the intersection leading to the camp entrance .
peaceful protestors harbor extremists " we 've seen that they 've set up barricades so that the press and police ca n't drive through , " said gabi baumgart , a manager at a window company whose office borders the encampment .
" the people here earlier were really great , they were really nice and peaceful , " continued baumgart .
" but we just had a directors meeting upstairs and could see that five people went into the bush to practice with their slingshots .
there are also a few people there looking for a hide-out , which the other people in the camp do n't want . "
nevertheless , they do n't seem to want to distance themselves from the violent activists .
many blame the police for the skirmishes last weekend , though the violence cost the demonstrators much of the sympathy they had had from parts of the general population .
alex kristow called saturday 's demonstration " powerful , colorful and strong , " but added that " it was also setback in that it became clear that the police and state officials will use any means to de-legitimize this movement .

the speech that outlined the ambitious plan was made 60 years ago today . the speech was without fanfare and lasted only 12 minutes , but it signaled a shift in the post-war era and heralded great changes to come . on june 5 , 1947 , us secretary of state george c. marshall addressed the graduating class at harvard university in cambridge , massachusetts .
within days , his recommendations became known as the marshall plan , which has gone down in history as the most successful civil-reconstruction project of the 20th century . " the marshall plan served as the economic and political foundation for the western alliance that waged the cold war , " said diane kunz , a professor of history at yale university .
" it allowed the united states gradually to engage itself in the bipolar confrontation by first committing money , not blood . " historians , however , disagree on how large a role the marshall plan money played in europe 's economic recovery . small speech , big idea marshall 's speech offered few details , but the powerful impact of his ideas , militarily and politically , were designed to make an imprint on europe for decades after the end of the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan began two years after the potsdam conference after the war , the united states - infrastructure intact and economy prospering - had a clear sense of where it was headed .
by contrast , experts were predicting financial and social collapse in europe . marshall , a future nobel peace prize winner , said at harvard that his proposal was " directed not against any country or doctrine but against hunger , poverty , desperation and chaos . "
he laid out his plan based on the initiative of the europeans and on their faith in the economic future of their countries and of europe as a whole . " it is logical that the united states should do whatever it is able to do to assist in the return of normal economic health in the world , without which there can be no political stability and no assured peace , " marshall said . within weeks of the speech , european governments - led by france and britain - began drafting marshall 's spending plan .
essentially , the plan was about supplying german importers of life-sustaining goods with hard currency . the marshall effect by the end of the marshall plan in 1952 , five years after marshall 's speech , the united states had invested more than $ 13 billion in goods and financial services , equal to $ 100 billion today -lrb- 74.3 billion euros -rrb- .
about $ 1.4 billion of the initial total was invested in rebuilding a germany that had been reduced to a landscape of rubble . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany was the fourth biggest recipient of us aid the offer of us help was made to all european countries .
the top four recipients of aid , in descending order , were britain , france , italy and germany .
moscow set the tone for the coming cold war , with a clear " nyet " that forbade the east european countries under its heel from accepting the largess of the capitalist benefactor . no one doubts that the marshall plan contributed mightily to cementing the division of europe and the world . washington 's intensions were plain : only with prosperity could western europe become a bulwark against communism .
the marshall plan helped make europe 's hungry masses reliable partners for the us . the designers of the marshall plan can not take all of the credit for this record of success .
local resources accounted for 80 to 90 per cent of capital formation in the major european economies during the first two years of the recovery program , according to university of iowa history professor michael hogan , a prominent expert on the marshall plan . yet , the marshall plan provided the " critical margin " of support that made european self-help possible .
it fuelled essential imports , eased production bottlenecks , encouraged higher rates of capital formation and helped to suppress inflation , hogan wrote in a paper marking the 50th anniversary of marshall 's speech . all these effects led to gains in productivity , improvements in trade and the most durable era of social peace and prosperity in modern european history . marshall plan today bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have considered setting up a new marshall plan help in iraq or the balkans the ideals of the marshall plan have been invoked countless times by well-meaning people , facing the tasks of rebuilding regions torn by crisis or failed states from latin america to the balkans and , now , iraq . there have been so many references that larry bland , director of the george marshall foundation , has stopped counting . historians wave aside calls for a new marshall plan , saying the structures and historical situation after world war ii were unique .
the marshall plan , in a sense , oiled the gears of existing machinery - it did not bear the burden of bringing trade and forging modern political structures in places with no experience of them . western europe for centuries had known the rule of law , democracy and private property and initiative .
the us was dealing with people who knew what to do and who knew the importance of the middle class , bland said .
they were people who did n't need to be taught democracy and free enterprise . dw staff dpa -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the motto of the meeting : melting ice – a hot topic ? the united nations environmental program used the occasion to release a new report entitled " the global outlook for ice and snow . "
according to the report ’ s findings , the lives of hundreds of millions of people across the world will be affected by declines in snow cover , sea ice , glaciers , permafrost and lake ice .
a collaboration of 70 researchers , the report found that the melting of snow and ice caps contributes greatly to climate change and global warming because less sunlight is being reflected back into the atmosphere .
less ice , more heat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glaciers are receding at an alarming rate " this report is about ice and snow and may to some people seem to address issues from remote and far-away places , " said achim steiner , un under-secretary general and unep executive director .
" but the report underlines that fate of the world 's snowy and icy places in a climatically challenged world should be cause for concern in every ministry , boardroom and living room across the world , " he said .
the report is a part of the ongoing international polar year , an initiative spearheaded by the international council for science and the world meteorological organization .
norway ’ s environment minister helen bjoernoey praised the report .
" this report gives us an overall picture of the changes in snow and ice cover and the consequences for human beings and nature , not only in the polar and mountainous areas , but all over the world .

sheila watt cloutier , a former president of the inuit circumpolar conference , is campaigning to raise awareness of climate change and is developing a network involving indigenous people all over the globe .
according to watt , the impact of melting ice can be seen most clearly in these arctic regions , but the effects will reach far wider , with rising sea levels and changing ocean currents .
" we are very negatively and disproportionately affected by climate change , " said cloutier .
" the melting of -lrb- the ice -rrb- is creating not only inconvenience but real issues of livelihoods that are at stake where safety and security have become a remarkable challenge for us . "

"
" melting ice and snow are also likely to increase hazards including avalanches and floods from the build-up of potentially unstable glacial lakes .
these can burst their ice and soil dams , sending walls of water down valleys , " said steiner in his remarks in tromso .

the campaigners ' slogan has not changed over the years whether the topic is hunger , the wealth-sharing or international trade : " another world is possible . "

statehood for kosovo is the latest . climate change and aid to africa have long been on the agenda for the g8 summit which kicks off on wednesday in heiligendamm on the north-eastern german coast . but the gathering of rich industrial nations that includes russia threatens to be overshadowed by divisions within the club from an unexpected source : kosovo . the tiny autonomous province in serbia , which is under un administration , has n't grabbed banner headlines since 1999 , when us-led air strikes forced out slobodan milosevic 's marauding army .
but that 's mainly because nato 's huge international contingent has kept the peace . territorial and ethnic tensions in the remains of the former yugoslavia are still simmering below the surface , and now with the un road map for kosovo 's independence from serbia on the table , the western powers want to finally put the last chapter of the balkans saga to bed . the world 's political powers meeting at the group of eight summit this week in germany should decide whether the un security council should proceed with a draft resolution dealing with the future of kosovo , the council president said monday . " we 'll see how the situation will evolve , " said belgium 's un ambassador johan verbeke .
" for the time being , it 's a wait-and-see period ; it 's a question of days , not weeks . " verbeke , whose country holds the rotating council presidency for june , said once the eight world leaders give the go-ahead , he will put the kosovo issue on the council 's monthly agenda .
he said the decision also belongs to capitals of 15 countries on the council .
bildunterschrift : rice -lrb- second from right -rrb- and lavrov -lrb- second from left -rrb- exchanged barbs over missile defense and kosovo russian opposition at last week 's foreign ministers meeting in potsdam - best known as the venue for the postwar meeting of us , british and soviet leaders - the cold war lines between europe and united states on one side , and russia on the other , were clearly drawn again . us secretary of state condoleezza rice and russian foreign minister sergey lavrov not only exchanged barbs about moscow 's opposition to plans for us anti-missile shield installations in poland and the czech republic , but also over the future status of kosovo . lavrov denounced the plan drawn up by un special envoy martti ahtisaari , which seeks to transfer custody of the overwhelmingly ethnic albanian province to the eu in the transitional period to nationhood .
the plan was approved by the parliament in kosovo , but rejected by the autonomous region 's serb minority and belgrade . the kremlin 's adamant opposition took the western allies by surprise , although lavrov stopped short of saying that russia would exercise its veto power in the un 's security council . one expert says the reasons moscow is supporting a fellow slavic state are complicated and need to be understood within the broad scope of russia 's relations with the eu and us . russian resurgence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patience for independance in kosovo is wearing thin " russia has no leverage over the balkan states and knows it .
there 's no way that russia could stop the ahtisaari plan if the west stands united in favor of it .
its veto power in the security council is symbolic .
after all the us invaded iraq without a un mandate , " said alexander rahr , program director for russia at the german council on foreign relations . " the russians are putting up a front .
they have their national pride , and do n't want to be seen as a junior partner of the west .
remember they were humiliated back in the 1990s , " said rahr , referring to a time when an economically weak and chaotic russia that had emerged from communism was unable to protect its serb ally in the war that nato waged without un authorization . " now the russians have got oil money , " added rahr , who explained that the windfall from its energy exports and increasing strategic importance because of it has led to a new assertiveness in president vladimir putin 's dealings with the west . besides russia has a point in pushing the conflicting parties - ethnic albanians and christian serbs - to work out their own lasting compromise , which could be preferable to the great powers imposing a nation-state from above , according to rahr . need to win over the serbs " the serbs wo n't agree to kosovo 's independence today , but who says they ca n't be won over in say , two years time ?
young serbs are not all nationalistic .
you need to win them over , make them european .
we in the eu made the mistake of not inviting serbia to join us , " he said . another concern shared by moscow and other countries is the precedent a un resolution would set , giving impetus to independence movements elsewhere , such as the basques in spain , kurds in turkey and the chechens in russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un plan named after martti ahtisaari has eu and us support other specialists say , however , that vladimir putin 's motivation for isolating russia against the eu and us on the kosovo issue is a puzzle , since he is not running for reelection when his term expires in 2008 and , with high domestic approval ratings anyway , he does not need to pander to an electorate at home . ever a tinderbox ? " kosovo is part of a host of issues - energy security , missile defense , human rights - that putin has used to wreak havoc , to divide the eu from within and split the eu and us , " said julianne smith , director of the europe program at the center for strategic and international studies in washington . " if the ahtisaari plan falls off the table , we could see instability and violence again in the balkans , which is not in russia 's interest either , " said smith , who explained that keeping the issue of kosovo 's independence on the back burner risks creating a backlash among the albanian kosovars , whose patience is wearing thin after seven years as a ward of the united nations . " kosovo is a tinderbox , and it wo n't take much to reignite it .

statehood for kosovo is the latest . climate change and aid to africa have long been on the agenda for the g8 summit which kicks off on wednesday in heiligendamm on the north-eastern german coast . but the gathering of rich industrial nations that includes russia threatens to be overshadowed by divisions within the club from an unexpected source : kosovo . the tiny autonomous province in serbia , which is under un administration , has n't grabbed banner headlines since 1999 , when us-led air strikes forced out slobodan milosevic 's marauding army .
but that 's mainly because nato 's huge international contingent has kept the peace . territorial and ethnic tensions in the remains of the former yugoslavia are still simmering below the surface , and now with the un road map for kosovo 's independence from serbia on the table , the western powers want to finally put the last chapter of the balkans saga to bed . the world 's political powers meeting at the group of eight summit this week in germany should decide whether the un security council should proceed with a draft resolution dealing with the future of kosovo , the council president said monday . " we 'll see how the situation will evolve , " said belgium 's un ambassador johan verbeke .
" for the time being , it 's a wait-and-see period ; it 's a question of days , not weeks . " verbeke , whose country holds the rotating council presidency for june , said once the eight world leaders give the go-ahead , he will put the kosovo issue on the council 's monthly agenda .
he said the decision also belongs to capitals of 15 countries on the council .
bildunterschrift : rice -lrb- second from right -rrb- and lavrov -lrb- second from left -rrb- exchanged barbs over missile defense and kosovo russian opposition at last week 's foreign ministers meeting in potsdam - best known as the venue for the postwar meeting of us , british and soviet leaders - the cold war lines between europe and united states on one side , and russia on the other , were clearly drawn again . us secretary of state condoleezza rice and russian foreign minister sergey lavrov not only exchanged barbs about moscow 's opposition to plans for us anti-missile shield installations in poland and the czech republic , but also over the future status of kosovo . lavrov denounced the plan drawn up by un special envoy martti ahtisaari , which seeks to transfer custody of the overwhelmingly ethnic albanian province to the eu in the transitional period to nationhood .
the plan was approved by the parliament in kosovo , but rejected by the autonomous region 's serb minority and belgrade . the kremlin 's adamant opposition took the western allies by surprise , although lavrov stopped short of saying that russia would exercise its veto power in the un 's security council . one expert says the reasons moscow is supporting a fellow slavic state are complicated and need to be understood within the broad scope of russia 's relations with the eu and us . russian resurgence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patience for independance in kosovo is wearing thin " russia has no leverage over the balkan states and knows it .
there 's no way that russia could stop the ahtisaari plan if the west stands united in favor of it .
its veto power in the security council is symbolic .
after all the us invaded iraq without a un mandate , " said alexander rahr , program director for russia at the german council on foreign relations . " the russians are putting up a front .
they have their national pride , and do n't want to be seen as a junior partner of the west .
remember they were humiliated back in the 1990s , " said rahr , referring to a time when an economically weak and chaotic russia that had emerged from communism was unable to protect its serb ally in the war that nato waged without un authorization . " now the russians have got oil money , " added rahr , who explained that the windfall from its energy exports and increasing strategic importance because of it has led to a new assertiveness in president vladimir putin 's dealings with the west . besides russia has a point in pushing the conflicting parties - ethnic albanians and christian serbs - to work out their own lasting compromise , which could be preferable to the great powers imposing a nation-state from above , according to rahr . need to win over the serbs " the serbs wo n't agree to kosovo 's independence today , but who says they ca n't be won over in say , two years time ?
young serbs are not all nationalistic .
you need to win them over , make them european .
we in the eu made the mistake of not inviting serbia to join us , " he said . another concern shared by moscow and other countries is the precedent a un resolution would set , giving impetus to independence movements elsewhere , such as the basques in spain , kurds in turkey and the chechens in russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un plan named after martti ahtisaari has eu and us support other specialists say , however , that vladimir putin 's motivation for isolating russia against the eu and us on the kosovo issue is a puzzle , since he is not running for reelection when his term expires in 2008 and , with high domestic approval ratings anyway , he does not need to pander to an electorate at home . ever a tinderbox ? " kosovo is part of a host of issues - energy security , missile defense , human rights - that putin has used to wreak havoc , to divide the eu from within and split the eu and us , " said julianne smith , director of the europe program at the center for strategic and international studies in washington . " if the ahtisaari plan falls off the table , we could see instability and violence again in the balkans , which is not in russia 's interest either , " said smith , who explained that keeping the issue of kosovo 's independence on the back burner risks creating a backlash among the albanian kosovars , whose patience is wearing thin after seven years as a ward of the united nations . " kosovo is a tinderbox , and it wo n't take much to reignite it .

the motto of the meeting : melting ice – a hot topic ? the united nations environmental program used the occasion to release a new report entitled " the global outlook for ice and snow . "
according to the report ’ s findings , the lives of hundreds of millions of people across the world will be affected by declines in snow cover , sea ice , glaciers , permafrost and lake ice .
a collaboration of 70 researchers , the report found that the melting of snow and ice caps contributes greatly to climate change and global warming because less sunlight is being reflected back into the atmosphere .
less ice , more heat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glaciers are receding at an alarming rate " this report is about ice and snow and may to some people seem to address issues from remote and far-away places , " said achim steiner , un under-secretary general and unep executive director .
" but the report underlines that fate of the world 's snowy and icy places in a climatically challenged world should be cause for concern in every ministry , boardroom and living room across the world , " he said .
the report is a part of the ongoing international polar year , an initiative spearheaded by the international council for science and the world meteorological organization .
norway ’ s environment minister helen bjoernoey praised the report .
" this report gives us an overall picture of the changes in snow and ice cover and the consequences for human beings and nature , not only in the polar and mountainous areas , but all over the world .

sheila watt cloutier , a former president of the inuit circumpolar conference , is campaigning to raise awareness of climate change and is developing a network involving indigenous people all over the globe .
according to watt , the impact of melting ice can be seen most clearly in these arctic regions , but the effects will reach far wider , with rising sea levels and changing ocean currents .
" we are very negatively and disproportionately affected by climate change , " said cloutier .
" the melting of -lrb- the ice -rrb- is creating not only inconvenience but real issues of livelihoods that are at stake where safety and security have become a remarkable challenge for us . "
from north to south bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unep 's steiner does not see any good news the report also highlighted threats to people in non-arctic areas of the world stating that " impacts are likely to include significant changes in the availability of water supplies for drinking and agriculture , rising sea levels affecting low-lying coasts and islands . "
" melting ice and snow are also likely to increase hazards including avalanches and floods from the build-up of potentially unstable glacial lakes .
these can burst their ice and soil dams , sending walls of water down valleys , " said steiner in his remarks in tromso .

the motto of the meeting : melting ice – a hot topic ? the united nations environmental program used the occasion to release a new report entitled " the global outlook for ice and snow . "
according to the report ’ s findings , the lives of hundreds of millions of people across the world will be affected by declines in snow cover , sea ice , glaciers , permafrost and lake ice .
a collaboration of 70 researchers , the report found that the melting of snow and ice caps contributes greatly to climate change and global warming because less sunlight is being reflected back into the atmosphere .
less ice , more heat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glaciers are receding at an alarming rate " this report is about ice and snow and may to some people seem to address issues from remote and far-away places , " said achim steiner , un under-secretary general and unep executive director .
" but the report underlines that fate of the world 's snowy and icy places in a climatically challenged world should be cause for concern in every ministry , boardroom and living room across the world , " he said .
the report is a part of the ongoing international polar year , an initiative spearheaded by the international council for science and the world meteorological organization .
norway ’ s environment minister helen bjoernoey praised the report .
" this report gives us an overall picture of the changes in snow and ice cover and the consequences for human beings and nature , not only in the polar and mountainous areas , but all over the world .
to me it is particularly alarming to realize that climate change can be a reinforcing process - global warming results in further global warming " .
a hot topic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inuit hunters fear for their livelihood , and their lives for inuit and other indigenous people living in arctic regions , the rapid ice melt is a reality and a threat to their way of life .
sheila watt cloutier , a former president of the inuit circumpolar conference , is campaigning to raise awareness of climate change and is developing a network involving indigenous people all over the globe .
according to watt , the impact of melting ice can be seen most clearly in these arctic regions , but the effects will reach far wider , with rising sea levels and changing ocean currents .
" we are very negatively and disproportionately affected by climate change , " said cloutier .
" the melting of -lrb- the ice -rrb- is creating not only inconvenience but real issues of livelihoods that are at stake where safety and security have become a remarkable challenge for us . "
from north to south bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unep 's steiner does not see any good news the report also highlighted threats to people in non-arctic areas of the world stating that " impacts are likely to include significant changes in the availability of water supplies for drinking and agriculture , rising sea levels affecting low-lying coasts and islands . "
" melting ice and snow are also likely to increase hazards including avalanches and floods from the build-up of potentially unstable glacial lakes .
these can burst their ice and soil dams , sending walls of water down valleys , " said steiner in his remarks in tromso .

" invitation for cooperation addressing the joint press conference in prague , bush even invited skeptical russian military brass to inspect the system for themselves . " my message will be , vladimir - i call him vladimir - you should n't fear a missile defense system .
as a matter of fact , why do n't you cooperate with us on a missile defense system ? "
bush said . " why not send your generals over to see how such a system would work .
send your scientists ; let us have the ability to discuss this issue in an open forum , " he said . the increasingly tense rift between washington and moscow over the missile shield risks souring this year 's g8 talks .
putin has threatened to aim missiles at europe if the plans go ahead . escalation in rhetoric " there has been some escalation in the rhetoric .
we think that that is not helpful , " stephen hadley , us national security adviser , told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech opposition leader paroubek wants a referendum bush is due to visit poland on friday after the gathering of leaders from the world 's leading economies - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the us . his schedule in prague included talks with klaus , topolanek and opposition leader jiri paroubek that are expected to focus on the missile-shield proposal . opponents demand referendum russia has refused to accept repeated us assurances that the shield is aimed at defending against an attack from the likes of iran , which denies suspicions by the west that it is striving to create a nuclear arsenal . while klaus and topolanek have backed the plan as an opportunity for the czech republic , a former soviet satellite state , to demonstrate its nato credentials , paroubek has opposed it and demanded a referendum . hundreds of czechs had gathered in prague on monday night to protest against the u.s. plans for a missile defence shield , carrying banners that read , " shame on bush , no to base , " and , " the radar stinks of death . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shield is meant to defend against missiles from outside of europe at nato headquarters in brussels , a spokesman for the trans-atlantic alliance , james appathurai , said monday : " as far as i am aware , russia is the only country now speculating about targeting europe with missiles . " technology boost for prague ? meanwhile , topolanek said his country should benefit from us technology if part of an american anti-missile defense system is set up on czech soil . " the united states is the world 's innovation leader .
it is dominant in science .
i exaggerate perhaps , but this cooperation in technology , in science , in innovation , is in some way our condition for the construction of the anti-missile defense system on our territory , " topolanek said during the joint news conference with bush .

this time , we look at an international best-seller - a murder mystery with sheep as detectives . three bags full by leonie swann translated by anthea bell doubleday publishers 351 pages nearly any reader would admit that a book about a flock of sheep solving a murder mystery would lend itself to jokes about counting those sheep as one turns the pages . especially if the story starts off slowly and one is prone to spontaneous bouts of slumber - those z 's gently purring out of one 's mouth as the book gradually tilts forward , the reader nods off and images of fleecy sheep jumping over a fence loom ever larger in the mind 's eye . while reading the first chapters of leonie swann 's " three bags full " -lrb- " glennkill " in german -rrb- , this reader had to keep reminding herself that the book had become an international best-seller that had meanwhile been translated into at least 16 different languages . that fact , and the occasional bemusement at the soliloquies of the detective sheep pondering who had killed their shepherd , spurred me on , but not without resistance . puzzling idea somehow the compelling nature of their shepherd 's murder just did not come across in the initial pages of the book .
still , i read on , intrigued by how the debut novelist would depict the rest of the puzzle surrounding shepherd george glenn 's demise . after all , the setting was inviting - a hillside meadow near the irish village of glennkill , and the depth of the sheep 's outrage at finding george pinned to the ground with a spade did slowly emerge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hardcover version swann 's sheep , armed with their own literary accoutrements , deductive abilities and determination to avenge their shepherd 's death , begin tracking down the culprit .
with names like " othello " -lrb- the lead , black ram -rrb- and " miss maple " -lrb- a.k.a. " the smartest sheep in all glennkill " -rrb- , the animal protagonists already have an indirect link to murder and crime-solving . furthermore , they had developed their cognitive abilities by listening to their former shepherd george read aloud to them every afternoon when taking a break from grazing .
george 's literary tastes ranged from fairy tales to treatises on sheep diseases to trashy novels featuring red-headed heroines named " pamela . "
conveniently enough , george also once read a detective story to the sheep , so they feel adequately prepared to tackle the dirty business of crime-fighting . following their noses as they muse over the quirky behavior of human beings , the animals also apply their sharply honed sense of smell to aid them in solving the puzzle .
while swann 's countless descriptions of the sheep scenting the villagers to glean information do perhaps prompt a deeper understanding of just how animals tick , they also compose the sections of the novel that easily could have been whittled down .
the flowery depictions of the animals ' olfactory aptitude are initially amusing , and ultimately , annoying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in swann 's book , sheep have a mind of their own still , the sheep 's sense of smell gives them a straightforward approach that allows them to distinguish between the liars and truth-seekers in glennkill , among them : george 's estranged wife , the butcher , a rival shepherd , a pentecostal wallflower pining for the murdered man and george 's even more estranged daughter who returns to the village .
this ability to scent also eventually leads them to successfully , albeit indirectly , reveal george 's murderer . history of animal literary figures swann is not the first to employ animals as literary protagonists .
other smart animals carry the flag in well-known books such as george orwell 's " animal farm , " paul auster 's " timbuktu , " haruki murakami 's " kafka on the shore " or the children 's tale " charlotte 's web , " to name just a few . yet , as ian sansom wrote in the guardian , " with sheep as detectives swann solves one of the major problems in crime fiction , which is how to avoid the stereotypical jaded , cynical , alcoholic deadbeat gumshoe with relationship problems . " lending other animals in the book monikers such as " rameses , " " mopple the whale " and " satan " also helps to feed the reader 's imagination . mixed reviews some german literary critics have been harsh in their assessment of " three bags full , " with one writer in the weighty weekly die zeit wondering how swann 's " simple " language can generate a best-seller . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author leonie swann another critic in the influential daily süddeutsche zeitung imagined a clever talk between a literary agent and a prospective author that targeted cute sheep in narrative as harbingers of massive book sales . denis scheck , a prominent german literary critic , was kinder , calling the acquaintance with swann 's glennkill sheep a " real pleasure . " " three bags full " is a bit strange , but , as sansom wrote , it is also affecting .
if you can get over the initial slow pace of the book and a personal unwillingness to accept sheep as anything but dull , you will enjoy an occasional chuckle or smirk as you read on the train and glance up every now and then at your fellow commuters . ultimately , swann 's book offers readers perhaps less of a new take on how we perceive animals , and more of one on how they perceive us . it 's a lightly philosophical summer read , with the paperback edition due out at the beginning of july . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this time , we look at an international best-seller - a murder mystery with sheep as detectives . three bags full by leonie swann translated by anthea bell doubleday publishers 351 pages nearly any reader would admit that a book about a flock of sheep solving a murder mystery would lend itself to jokes about counting those sheep as one turns the pages . especially if the story starts off slowly and one is prone to spontaneous bouts of slumber - those z 's gently purring out of one 's mouth as the book gradually tilts forward , the reader nods off and images of fleecy sheep jumping over a fence loom ever larger in the mind 's eye . while reading the first chapters of leonie swann 's " three bags full " -lrb- " glennkill " in german -rrb- , this reader had to keep reminding herself that the book had become an international best-seller that had meanwhile been translated into at least 16 different languages . that fact , and the occasional bemusement at the soliloquies of the detective sheep pondering who had killed their shepherd , spurred me on , but not without resistance . puzzling idea somehow the compelling nature of their shepherd 's murder just did not come across in the initial pages of the book .
still , i read on , intrigued by how the debut novelist would depict the rest of the puzzle surrounding shepherd george glenn 's demise . after all , the setting was inviting - a hillside meadow near the irish village of glennkill , and the depth of the sheep 's outrage at finding george pinned to the ground with a spade did slowly emerge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hardcover version swann 's sheep , armed with their own literary accoutrements , deductive abilities and determination to avenge their shepherd 's death , begin tracking down the culprit .
with names like " othello " -lrb- the lead , black ram -rrb- and " miss maple " -lrb- a.k.a. " the smartest sheep in all glennkill " -rrb- , the animal protagonists already have an indirect link to murder and crime-solving . furthermore , they had developed their cognitive abilities by listening to their former shepherd george read aloud to them every afternoon when taking a break from grazing .
george 's literary tastes ranged from fairy tales to treatises on sheep diseases to trashy novels featuring red-headed heroines named " pamela . "
conveniently enough , george also once read a detective story to the sheep , so they feel adequately prepared to tackle the dirty business of crime-fighting . following their noses as they muse over the quirky behavior of human beings , the animals also apply their sharply honed sense of smell to aid them in solving the puzzle .
while swann 's countless descriptions of the sheep scenting the villagers to glean information do perhaps prompt a deeper understanding of just how animals tick , they also compose the sections of the novel that easily could have been whittled down .
the flowery depictions of the animals ' olfactory aptitude are initially amusing , and ultimately , annoying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in swann 's book , sheep have a mind of their own still , the sheep 's sense of smell gives them a straightforward approach that allows them to distinguish between the liars and truth-seekers in glennkill , among them : george 's estranged wife , the butcher , a rival shepherd , a pentecostal wallflower pining for the murdered man and george 's even more estranged daughter who returns to the village .
this ability to scent also eventually leads them to successfully , albeit indirectly , reveal george 's murderer . history of animal literary figures swann is not the first to employ animals as literary protagonists .
other smart animals carry the flag in well-known books such as george orwell 's " animal farm , " paul auster 's " timbuktu , " haruki murakami 's " kafka on the shore " or the children 's tale " charlotte 's web , " to name just a few . yet , as ian sansom wrote in the guardian , " with sheep as detectives swann solves one of the major problems in crime fiction , which is how to avoid the stereotypical jaded , cynical , alcoholic deadbeat gumshoe with relationship problems . " lending other animals in the book monikers such as " rameses , " " mopple the whale " and " satan " also helps to feed the reader 's imagination . mixed reviews some german literary critics have been harsh in their assessment of " three bags full , " with one writer in the weighty weekly die zeit wondering how swann 's " simple " language can generate a best-seller . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author leonie swann another critic in the influential daily süddeutsche zeitung imagined a clever talk between a literary agent and a prospective author that targeted cute sheep in narrative as harbingers of massive book sales . denis scheck , a prominent german literary critic , was kinder , calling the acquaintance with swann 's glennkill sheep a " real pleasure . " " three bags full " is a bit strange , but , as sansom wrote , it is also affecting .
if you can get over the initial slow pace of the book and a personal unwillingness to accept sheep as anything but dull , you will enjoy an occasional chuckle or smirk as you read on the train and glance up every now and then at your fellow commuters . ultimately , swann 's book offers readers perhaps less of a new take on how we perceive animals , and more of one on how they perceive us . it 's a lightly philosophical summer read , with the paperback edition due out at the beginning of july . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many blame police for recent violence .
deutsche welle visited the demonstrators ' camp as they continue their campaign , seemingly at any cost . " training starts today at 12:00 at the information center . "
the announcement was on monday made in both german and english to the globalization opponents at the encampment located 10 kilometers -lrb- about 6 miles -rrb- south of the resort hotel where world leaders are scheduled to meet on wednesday .
in this case , " training " means preparing the demonstrators for blockades that are intended to massively disrupt the group of eight summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meet here for blockade training ready to break the law " it 's about active resistance , " said activist alex kristow from press group kempinski .
" we 've always said that it 's necessary to break the law in some situations in order to make people aware of major problems like neo-liberal globalization .
" it 's not enough to march through the streets carrying a sign , " continued kristow .
" we claim the right to block a street so that delegations who want to go to this summit ca n't get through . "
after demonstrations turned into violent riots in rostock on saturday , many of the demonstrators expect police to raid the camps in order to weed out potentially violent activists before the summit begins .
preparing for police raid " we believe that the police are trying to reduce the number of participants in coming protests by storming the camp and arresting the offenders from the last demonstrations , " said marius kürten , who traveled to the event from speyer in south-western germany .
" we 're going to mobilize the entire camp against the police . "
at the entrance to the camp , a banner has been raised with a message to the police : " you 're on call - we 're having fun . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peace ?
the relaxing music in the camp belies the tense mood .
the stretch of tents - roughly the size of three soccer fields - is seen as occupied territory off-limits to security forces .
police have parked their buses and set up headquarters some distance away , at the intersection leading to the camp entrance .
peaceful protestors harbor extremists " we 've seen that they 've set up barricades so that the press and police ca n't drive through , " said gabi baumgart , a manager at a window company whose office borders the encampment .
" the people here earlier were really great , they were really nice and peaceful , " continued baumgart .
" but we just had a directors meeting upstairs and could see that five people went into the bush to practice with their slingshots .
there are also a few people there looking for a hide-out , which the other people in the camp do n't want . "
nevertheless , they do n't seem to want to distance themselves from the violent activists .
many blame the police for the skirmishes last weekend , though the violence cost the demonstrators much of the sympathy they had had from parts of the general population .
alex kristow called saturday 's demonstration " powerful , colorful and strong , " but added that " it was also setback in that it became clear that the police and state officials will use any means to de-legitimize this movement .

many blame police for recent violence .
deutsche welle visited the demonstrators ' camp as they continue their campaign , seemingly at any cost . " training starts today at 12:00 at the information center . "
the announcement was on monday made in both german and english to the globalization opponents at the encampment located 10 kilometers -lrb- about 6 miles -rrb- south of the resort hotel where world leaders are scheduled to meet on wednesday .
in this case , " training " means preparing the demonstrators for blockades that are intended to massively disrupt the group of eight summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meet here for blockade training ready to break the law " it 's about active resistance , " said activist alex kristow from press group kempinski .
" we 've always said that it 's necessary to break the law in some situations in order to make people aware of major problems like neo-liberal globalization .
" it 's not enough to march through the streets carrying a sign , " continued kristow .
" we claim the right to block a street so that delegations who want to go to this summit ca n't get through . "
after demonstrations turned into violent riots in rostock on saturday , many of the demonstrators expect police to raid the camps in order to weed out potentially violent activists before the summit begins .
preparing for police raid " we believe that the police are trying to reduce the number of participants in coming protests by storming the camp and arresting the offenders from the last demonstrations , " said marius kürten , who traveled to the event from speyer in south-western germany .
" we 're going to mobilize the entire camp against the police . "
at the entrance to the camp , a banner has been raised with a message to the police : " you 're on call - we 're having fun . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peace ?
the relaxing music in the camp belies the tense mood .
the stretch of tents - roughly the size of three soccer fields - is seen as occupied territory off-limits to security forces .
police have parked their buses and set up headquarters some distance away , at the intersection leading to the camp entrance .
peaceful protestors harbor extremists " we 've seen that they 've set up barricades so that the press and police ca n't drive through , " said gabi baumgart , a manager at a window company whose office borders the encampment .
" the people here earlier were really great , they were really nice and peaceful , " continued baumgart .
" but we just had a directors meeting upstairs and could see that five people went into the bush to practice with their slingshots .
there are also a few people there looking for a hide-out , which the other people in the camp do n't want . "
nevertheless , they do n't seem to want to distance themselves from the violent activists .
many blame the police for the skirmishes last weekend , though the violence cost the demonstrators much of the sympathy they had had from parts of the general population .
alex kristow called saturday 's demonstration " powerful , colorful and strong , " but added that " it was also setback in that it became clear that the police and state officials will use any means to de-legitimize this movement .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 05.06.2007 book review : clever sheep solve a murder mystery großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a good summer read occasionally , dw-world.de brings you reviews of some of the latest german books being published in english .
this time , we look at an international best-seller - a murder mystery with sheep as detectives . three bags full by leonie swann translated by anthea bell doubleday publishers 351 pages nearly any reader would admit that a book about a flock of sheep solving a murder mystery would lend itself to jokes about counting those sheep as one turns the pages . especially if the story starts off slowly and one is prone to spontaneous bouts of slumber - those z 's gently purring out of one 's mouth as the book gradually tilts forward , the reader nods off and images of fleecy sheep jumping over a fence loom ever larger in the mind 's eye . while reading the first chapters of leonie swann 's " three bags full " -lrb- " glennkill " in german -rrb- , this reader had to keep reminding herself that the book had become an international best-seller that had meanwhile been translated into at least 16 different languages . that fact , and the occasional bemusement at the soliloquies of the detective sheep pondering who had killed their shepherd , spurred me on , but not without resistance . puzzling idea somehow the compelling nature of their shepherd 's murder just did not come across in the initial pages of the book .
still , i read on , intrigued by how the debut novelist would depict the rest of the puzzle surrounding shepherd george glenn 's demise . after all , the setting was inviting - a hillside meadow near the irish village of glennkill , and the depth of the sheep 's outrage at finding george pinned to the ground with a spade did slowly emerge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hardcover version swann 's sheep , armed with their own literary accoutrements , deductive abilities and determination to avenge their shepherd 's death , begin tracking down the culprit .
with names like " othello " -lrb- the lead , black ram -rrb- and " miss maple " -lrb- a.k.a. " the smartest sheep in all glennkill " -rrb- , the animal protagonists already have an indirect link to murder and crime-solving . furthermore , they had developed their cognitive abilities by listening to their former shepherd george read aloud to them every afternoon when taking a break from grazing .
george 's literary tastes ranged from fairy tales to treatises on sheep diseases to trashy novels featuring red-headed heroines named " pamela . "
conveniently enough , george also once read a detective story to the sheep , so they feel adequately prepared to tackle the dirty business of crime-fighting . following their noses as they muse over the quirky behavior of human beings , the animals also apply their sharply honed sense of smell to aid them in solving the puzzle .
while swann 's countless descriptions of the sheep scenting the villagers to glean information do perhaps prompt a deeper understanding of just how animals tick , they also compose the sections of the novel that easily could have been whittled down .
the flowery depictions of the animals ' olfactory aptitude are initially amusing , and ultimately , annoying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in swann 's book , sheep have a mind of their own still , the sheep 's sense of smell gives them a straightforward approach that allows them to distinguish between the liars and truth-seekers in glennkill , among them : george 's estranged wife , the butcher , a rival shepherd , a pentecostal wallflower pining for the murdered man and george 's even more estranged daughter who returns to the village .
this ability to scent also eventually leads them to successfully , albeit indirectly , reveal george 's murderer . history of animal literary figures swann is not the first to employ animals as literary protagonists .
other smart animals carry the flag in well-known books such as george orwell 's " animal farm , " paul auster 's " timbuktu , " haruki murakami 's " kafka on the shore " or the children 's tale " charlotte 's web , " to name just a few . yet , as ian sansom wrote in the guardian , " with sheep as detectives swann solves one of the major problems in crime fiction , which is how to avoid the stereotypical jaded , cynical , alcoholic deadbeat gumshoe with relationship problems . " lending other animals in the book monikers such as " rameses , " " mopple the whale " and " satan " also helps to feed the reader 's imagination . mixed reviews some german literary critics have been harsh in their assessment of " three bags full , " with one writer in the weighty weekly die zeit wondering how swann 's " simple " language can generate a best-seller . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author leonie swann another critic in the influential daily süddeutsche zeitung imagined a clever talk between a literary agent and a prospective author that targeted cute sheep in narrative as harbingers of massive book sales . denis scheck , a prominent german literary critic , was kinder , calling the acquaintance with swann 's glennkill sheep a " real pleasure . " " three bags full " is a bit strange , but , as sansom wrote , it is also affecting .
if you can get over the initial slow pace of the book and a personal unwillingness to accept sheep as anything but dull , you will enjoy an occasional chuckle or smirk as you read on the train and glance up every now and then at your fellow commuters . ultimately , swann 's book offers readers perhaps less of a new take on how we perceive animals , and more of one on how they perceive us . it 's a lightly philosophical summer read , with the paperback edition due out at the beginning of july . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this time , we look at an international best-seller - a murder mystery with sheep as detectives . three bags full by leonie swann translated by anthea bell doubleday publishers 351 pages nearly any reader would admit that a book about a flock of sheep solving a murder mystery would lend itself to jokes about counting those sheep as one turns the pages . especially if the story starts off slowly and one is prone to spontaneous bouts of slumber - those z 's gently purring out of one 's mouth as the book gradually tilts forward , the reader nods off and images of fleecy sheep jumping over a fence loom ever larger in the mind 's eye . while reading the first chapters of leonie swann 's " three bags full " -lrb- " glennkill " in german -rrb- , this reader had to keep reminding herself that the book had become an international best-seller that had meanwhile been translated into at least 16 different languages . that fact , and the occasional bemusement at the soliloquies of the detective sheep pondering who had killed their shepherd , spurred me on , but not without resistance . puzzling idea somehow the compelling nature of their shepherd 's murder just did not come across in the initial pages of the book .
still , i read on , intrigued by how the debut novelist would depict the rest of the puzzle surrounding shepherd george glenn 's demise . after all , the setting was inviting - a hillside meadow near the irish village of glennkill , and the depth of the sheep 's outrage at finding george pinned to the ground with a spade did slowly emerge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hardcover version swann 's sheep , armed with their own literary accoutrements , deductive abilities and determination to avenge their shepherd 's death , begin tracking down the culprit .
with names like " othello " -lrb- the lead , black ram -rrb- and " miss maple " -lrb- a.k.a. " the smartest sheep in all glennkill " -rrb- , the animal protagonists already have an indirect link to murder and crime-solving . furthermore , they had developed their cognitive abilities by listening to their former shepherd george read aloud to them every afternoon when taking a break from grazing .
george 's literary tastes ranged from fairy tales to treatises on sheep diseases to trashy novels featuring red-headed heroines named " pamela . "
conveniently enough , george also once read a detective story to the sheep , so they feel adequately prepared to tackle the dirty business of crime-fighting . following their noses as they muse over the quirky behavior of human beings , the animals also apply their sharply honed sense of smell to aid them in solving the puzzle .
while swann 's countless descriptions of the sheep scenting the villagers to glean information do perhaps prompt a deeper understanding of just how animals tick , they also compose the sections of the novel that easily could have been whittled down .
the flowery depictions of the animals ' olfactory aptitude are initially amusing , and ultimately , annoying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in swann 's book , sheep have a mind of their own still , the sheep 's sense of smell gives them a straightforward approach that allows them to distinguish between the liars and truth-seekers in glennkill , among them : george 's estranged wife , the butcher , a rival shepherd , a pentecostal wallflower pining for the murdered man and george 's even more estranged daughter who returns to the village .
this ability to scent also eventually leads them to successfully , albeit indirectly , reveal george 's murderer . history of animal literary figures swann is not the first to employ animals as literary protagonists .
other smart animals carry the flag in well-known books such as george orwell 's " animal farm , " paul auster 's " timbuktu , " haruki murakami 's " kafka on the shore " or the children 's tale " charlotte 's web , " to name just a few . yet , as ian sansom wrote in the guardian , " with sheep as detectives swann solves one of the major problems in crime fiction , which is how to avoid the stereotypical jaded , cynical , alcoholic deadbeat gumshoe with relationship problems . " lending other animals in the book monikers such as " rameses , " " mopple the whale " and " satan " also helps to feed the reader 's imagination . mixed reviews some german literary critics have been harsh in their assessment of " three bags full , " with one writer in the weighty weekly die zeit wondering how swann 's " simple " language can generate a best-seller . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author leonie swann another critic in the influential daily süddeutsche zeitung imagined a clever talk between a literary agent and a prospective author that targeted cute sheep in narrative as harbingers of massive book sales . denis scheck , a prominent german literary critic , was kinder , calling the acquaintance with swann 's glennkill sheep a " real pleasure . " " three bags full " is a bit strange , but , as sansom wrote , it is also affecting .
if you can get over the initial slow pace of the book and a personal unwillingness to accept sheep as anything but dull , you will enjoy an occasional chuckle or smirk as you read on the train and glance up every now and then at your fellow commuters . ultimately , swann 's book offers readers perhaps less of a new take on how we perceive animals , and more of one on how they perceive us . it 's a lightly philosophical summer read , with the paperback edition due out at the beginning of july . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

us president bush met protests when his plane touched down tuesday . protesters , who lost a last-ditch bid tuesday for court permission to march close to this week 's g8 summit , prepared in germany to mount sit-down protest to block roads when the three-day event begins wednesday . attac , a european group that believes globalization is dangerous and is leading the protests , said tuesday it was not organizing sit-downs and did not belong to block g8 , a group overseeing a planned " blockade , " but knew many attac members would be taking part . it said taking part in a sit-down was a misdemeanor , not a felony , and insisted german police only use " proportionate " force to clear sit-downs and avoid injuring anyone while doing so . road-block organizers promised tuesday they would ask peaceful demonstrators to abandon any blockade if the black block , an informal network of violence-prone militants who don black clothing and masks and congregate in the marches , took over and the incident turned into a violent confrontation . caustic clowns police had been taken by surprise by anti-g8 rioting saturday that left nearly 1,000 people injured .
officers claim they were facing a form of chemical warfare , with protesters dressed as clowns squirting them with a fluid that attacks the skin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eight offers were injured by chemical attacks eight police had needed hospital treatment , a spokesman said in rostock , a city 15 miles north-east of the heiligendamm beachside summit venue where small-scale protests were continuing and 11 persons were detained tuesday . at the first trial to deal with saturday 's rioters , a man aged 31 was sent to jail for 10 months for throwing stones at several police officers .
eight more persons , many of them non-german , were to come up for trial on wednesday . the police said a packet of white powder labeled " anthrax " found monday near the heiligendamm fence had only contained flour . protesters lose in court in the southern city of karlsruhe , germany 's constitutional court confirmed the legal restrictions junior judges had placed on the demonstrations . at the kempinski grand hotel in heiligendamm , only 15 representative protesters were allowed to hold a vigil starting tuesday , while demonstrators would also face a quota of 50 at a gate of rostock airport where the eight delegations were to land . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters complain their rights are being denied a mass demonstration at the airport must take place hundreds of meters away .
administrative tribunals had earlier modified the various restrictions put in place by the police . an appeal against a requirement that a mass protest on thursday remain on a highway which comes no closer than four miles to the summit hotel will be decided wednesday , a court spokeswoman said . more protests planned germany has deployed 16,000 police to protect the leaders of seven western nations and russia at the g8 summit as well as 10 other national leaders who are to join them on friday . the police are preparing to deal with both violent attacks by the black block and non-violent tactics from peaceful protesters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the black block is planning more protests police spokesman axel falkenberg rejected calls for german riot police to be armed with guns which shoot rubber bullets , which have never been used in germany .
officials said there were no such guns in the government 's armory . germany 's main weapon against riots is a fleet of trucks which shoot jets of cold water up to 50 meters . bush lands in rostock us president george w. bush was heckled by protesters as he arrived in rostock wednesday to attend the summit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials , and protestors , were on hand to meet bush in rostock he touched down just after 17:00 gmt from prague , where he accused russia of derailing democratic reforms , in a speech likely to further strain ties with moscow on the eve of the gathering . up to 1,000 anti-globalization activists waited for the helicopter behind a fence guarded by rows of police officers .

chief negotiators of the world 's leading industrial nations are meeting in berlin on tuesday in a last-ditch effort to remove obstacles threatening to derail a g8 deal on climate change . german chancellor angela merkel , whose country holds the current presidency of the g8 , wants this week 's summit participants in heiligendamm to agree to set long-term goals to cut greenhouse gas emissions . but she faces opposition from us president george w. bush , who wants to convene a global summit that includes a new generation of polluters from the developing world such as china , india and brazil . germany wants the g8 to agree to cut greenhouse gas emissions to 50 per cent below 1990 levels by the year 2050 in order to ensure that the world 's average temperature increase due to global warming does not exceed two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degree fahrenheit -rrb- . a new kyoto bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the talks are taking place far away from the g8 protests germany wants this to form the framework for a new united nations protocol on climate change to replace the kyoto agreement when it expires in 2012 . merkel won backing from british premier tony blair , although she appears to be less optimistic that a landmark deal will be reached at the summit to cover the post-kyoto period . " at the g8 we need to agree the elements of a future framework , " blair told parliamentarians in the german capital on sunday .
" this would allow the un talks to accelerate and reach earlier agreement so that we have a framework for kyoto in place by 2009 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 05.06.2007 kosovo question contributes to eu-russia troubles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un and nato have kept the peace in kosovo a us anti-missile defense system , pipeline politics , polish meat , press freedom and iran policy have all been issues in the disputes between the west and russia ahead of the g8 summit .
statehood for kosovo is the latest . climate change and aid to africa have long been on the agenda for the g8 summit which kicks off on wednesday in heiligendamm on the north-eastern german coast . but the gathering of rich industrial nations that includes russia threatens to be overshadowed by divisions within the club from an unexpected source : kosovo . the tiny autonomous province in serbia , which is under un administration , has n't grabbed banner headlines since 1999 , when us-led air strikes forced out slobodan milosevic 's marauding army .
but that 's mainly because nato 's huge international contingent has kept the peace . territorial and ethnic tensions in the remains of the former yugoslavia are still simmering below the surface , and now with the un road map for kosovo 's independence from serbia on the table , the western powers want to finally put the last chapter of the balkans saga to bed . the world 's political powers meeting at the group of eight summit this week in germany should decide whether the un security council should proceed with a draft resolution dealing with the future of kosovo , the council president said monday . " we 'll see how the situation will evolve , " said belgium 's un ambassador johan verbeke .
" for the time being , it 's a wait-and-see period ; it 's a question of days , not weeks . " verbeke , whose country holds the rotating council presidency for june , said once the eight world leaders give the go-ahead , he will put the kosovo issue on the council 's monthly agenda .
he said the decision also belongs to capitals of 15 countries on the council .
bildunterschrift : rice -lrb- second from right -rrb- and lavrov -lrb- second from left -rrb- exchanged barbs over missile defense and kosovo russian opposition at last week 's foreign ministers meeting in potsdam - best known as the venue for the postwar meeting of us , british and soviet leaders - the cold war lines between europe and united states on one side , and russia on the other , were clearly drawn again . us secretary of state condoleezza rice and russian foreign minister sergey lavrov not only exchanged barbs about moscow 's opposition to plans for us anti-missile shield installations in poland and the czech republic , but also over the future status of kosovo . lavrov denounced the plan drawn up by un special envoy martti ahtisaari , which seeks to transfer custody of the overwhelmingly ethnic albanian province to the eu in the transitional period to nationhood .
the plan was approved by the parliament in kosovo , but rejected by the autonomous region 's serb minority and belgrade . the kremlin 's adamant opposition took the western allies by surprise , although lavrov stopped short of saying that russia would exercise its veto power in the un 's security council . one expert says the reasons moscow is supporting a fellow slavic state are complicated and need to be understood within the broad scope of russia 's relations with the eu and us . russian resurgence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patience for independance in kosovo is wearing thin " russia has no leverage over the balkan states and knows it .
there 's no way that russia could stop the ahtisaari plan if the west stands united in favor of it .
its veto power in the security council is symbolic .
after all the us invaded iraq without a un mandate , " said alexander rahr , program director for russia at the german council on foreign relations . " the russians are putting up a front .
they have their national pride , and do n't want to be seen as a junior partner of the west .
remember they were humiliated back in the 1990s , " said rahr , referring to a time when an economically weak and chaotic russia that had emerged from communism was unable to protect its serb ally in the war that nato waged without un authorization . " now the russians have got oil money , " added rahr , who explained that the windfall from its energy exports and increasing strategic importance because of it has led to a new assertiveness in president vladimir putin 's dealings with the west . besides russia has a point in pushing the conflicting parties - ethnic albanians and christian serbs - to work out their own lasting compromise , which could be preferable to the great powers imposing a nation-state from above , according to rahr . need to win over the serbs " the serbs wo n't agree to kosovo 's independence today , but who says they ca n't be won over in say , two years time ?
young serbs are not all nationalistic .
you need to win them over , make them european .
we in the eu made the mistake of not inviting serbia to join us , " he said . another concern shared by moscow and other countries is the precedent a un resolution would set , giving impetus to independence movements elsewhere , such as the basques in spain , kurds in turkey and the chechens in russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un plan named after martti ahtisaari has eu and us support other specialists say , however , that vladimir putin 's motivation for isolating russia against the eu and us on the kosovo issue is a puzzle , since he is not running for reelection when his term expires in 2008 and , with high domestic approval ratings anyway , he does not need to pander to an electorate at home . ever a tinderbox ? " kosovo is part of a host of issues - energy security , missile defense , human rights - that putin has used to wreak havoc , to divide the eu from within and split the eu and us , " said julianne smith , director of the europe program at the center for strategic and international studies in washington . " if the ahtisaari plan falls off the table , we could see instability and violence again in the balkans , which is not in russia 's interest either , " said smith , who explained that keeping the issue of kosovo 's independence on the back burner risks creating a backlash among the albanian kosovars , whose patience is wearing thin after seven years as a ward of the united nations . " kosovo is a tinderbox , and it wo n't take much to reignite it .
there is no other possible solution -lrb- to the ahtisaari plan -rrb- .

the plan was approved by the parliament in kosovo , but rejected by the autonomous region 's serb minority and belgrade . the kremlin 's adamant opposition took the western allies by surprise , although lavrov stopped short of saying that russia would exercise its veto power in the un 's security council . one expert says the reasons moscow is supporting a fellow slavic state are complicated and need to be understood within the broad scope of russia 's relations with the eu and us . russian resurgence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patience for independance in kosovo is wearing thin " russia has no leverage over the balkan states and knows it .

" now the russians have got oil money , " added rahr , who explained that the windfall from its energy exports and increasing strategic importance because of it has led to a new assertiveness in president vladimir putin 's dealings with the west . besides russia has a point in pushing the conflicting parties - ethnic albanians and christian serbs - to work out their own lasting compromise , which could be preferable to the great powers imposing a nation-state from above , according to rahr . need to win over the serbs " the serbs wo n't agree to kosovo 's independence today , but who says they ca n't be won over in say , two years time ?
young serbs are not all nationalistic .
you need to win them over , make them european .

statehood for kosovo is the latest . climate change and aid to africa have long been on the agenda for the g8 summit which kicks off on wednesday in heiligendamm on the north-eastern german coast . but the gathering of rich industrial nations that includes russia threatens to be overshadowed by divisions within the club from an unexpected source : kosovo . the tiny autonomous province in serbia , which is under un administration , has n't grabbed banner headlines since 1999 , when us-led air strikes forced out slobodan milosevic 's marauding army .
but that 's mainly because nato 's huge international contingent has kept the peace . territorial and ethnic tensions in the remains of the former yugoslavia are still simmering below the surface , and now with the un road map for kosovo 's independence from serbia on the table , the western powers want to finally put the last chapter of the balkans saga to bed . the world 's political powers meeting at the group of eight summit this week in germany should decide whether the un security council should proceed with a draft resolution dealing with the future of kosovo , the council president said monday . " we 'll see how the situation will evolve , " said belgium 's un ambassador johan verbeke .
" for the time being , it 's a wait-and-see period ; it 's a question of days , not weeks . " verbeke , whose country holds the rotating council presidency for june , said once the eight world leaders give the go-ahead , he will put the kosovo issue on the council 's monthly agenda .

the motto of the meeting : melting ice – a hot topic ? the united nations environmental program used the occasion to release a new report entitled " the global outlook for ice and snow . "
according to the report ’ s findings , the lives of hundreds of millions of people across the world will be affected by declines in snow cover , sea ice , glaciers , permafrost and lake ice .
a collaboration of 70 researchers , the report found that the melting of snow and ice caps contributes greatly to climate change and global warming because less sunlight is being reflected back into the atmosphere .
less ice , more heat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glaciers are receding at an alarming rate " this report is about ice and snow and may to some people seem to address issues from remote and far-away places , " said achim steiner , un under-secretary general and unep executive director .
" but the report underlines that fate of the world 's snowy and icy places in a climatically challenged world should be cause for concern in every ministry , boardroom and living room across the world , " he said .
the report is a part of the ongoing international polar year , an initiative spearheaded by the international council for science and the world meteorological organization .
norway ’ s environment minister helen bjoernoey praised the report .
" this report gives us an overall picture of the changes in snow and ice cover and the consequences for human beings and nature , not only in the polar and mountainous areas , but all over the world .

according to watt , the impact of melting ice can be seen most clearly in these arctic regions , but the effects will reach far wider , with rising sea levels and changing ocean currents .
" we are very negatively and disproportionately affected by climate change , " said cloutier .
" the melting of -lrb- the ice -rrb- is creating not only inconvenience but real issues of livelihoods that are at stake where safety and security have become a remarkable challenge for us . "

"
" melting ice and snow are also likely to increase hazards including avalanches and floods from the build-up of potentially unstable glacial lakes .
these can burst their ice and soil dams , sending walls of water down valleys , " said steiner in his remarks in tromso .

" this report gives us an overall picture of the changes in snow and ice cover and the consequences for human beings and nature , not only in the polar and mountainous areas , but all over the world .

" we are very negatively and disproportionately affected by climate change , " said cloutier .
" the melting of -lrb- the ice -rrb- is creating not only inconvenience but real issues of livelihoods that are at stake where safety and security have become a remarkable challenge for us . "

"
" melting ice and snow are also likely to increase hazards including avalanches and floods from the build-up of potentially unstable glacial lakes .
these can burst their ice and soil dams , sending walls of water down valleys , " said steiner in his remarks in tromso .

this time , we look at an international best-seller - a murder mystery with sheep as detectives . three bags full by leonie swann translated by anthea bell doubleday publishers 351 pages nearly any reader would admit that a book about a flock of sheep solving a murder mystery would lend itself to jokes about counting those sheep as one turns the pages . especially if the story starts off slowly and one is prone to spontaneous bouts of slumber - those z 's gently purring out of one 's mouth as the book gradually tilts forward , the reader nods off and images of fleecy sheep jumping over a fence loom ever larger in the mind 's eye . while reading the first chapters of leonie swann 's " three bags full " -lrb- " glennkill " in german -rrb- , this reader had to keep reminding herself that the book had become an international best-seller that had meanwhile been translated into at least 16 different languages . that fact , and the occasional bemusement at the soliloquies of the detective sheep pondering who had killed their shepherd , spurred me on , but not without resistance . puzzling idea somehow the compelling nature of their shepherd 's murder just did not come across in the initial pages of the book .
still , i read on , intrigued by how the debut novelist would depict the rest of the puzzle surrounding shepherd george glenn 's demise . after all , the setting was inviting - a hillside meadow near the irish village of glennkill , and the depth of the sheep 's outrage at finding george pinned to the ground with a spade did slowly emerge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hardcover version swann 's sheep , armed with their own literary accoutrements , deductive abilities and determination to avenge their shepherd 's death , begin tracking down the culprit .
with names like " othello " -lrb- the lead , black ram -rrb- and " miss maple " -lrb- a.k.a. " the smartest sheep in all glennkill " -rrb- , the animal protagonists already have an indirect link to murder and crime-solving . furthermore , they had developed their cognitive abilities by listening to their former shepherd george read aloud to them every afternoon when taking a break from grazing .
george 's literary tastes ranged from fairy tales to treatises on sheep diseases to trashy novels featuring red-headed heroines named " pamela . "
conveniently enough , george also once read a detective story to the sheep , so they feel adequately prepared to tackle the dirty business of crime-fighting . following their noses as they muse over the quirky behavior of human beings , the animals also apply their sharply honed sense of smell to aid them in solving the puzzle .
while swann 's countless descriptions of the sheep scenting the villagers to glean information do perhaps prompt a deeper understanding of just how animals tick , they also compose the sections of the novel that easily could have been whittled down .
the flowery depictions of the animals ' olfactory aptitude are initially amusing , and ultimately , annoying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in swann 's book , sheep have a mind of their own still , the sheep 's sense of smell gives them a straightforward approach that allows them to distinguish between the liars and truth-seekers in glennkill , among them : george 's estranged wife , the butcher , a rival shepherd , a pentecostal wallflower pining for the murdered man and george 's even more estranged daughter who returns to the village .
this ability to scent also eventually leads them to successfully , albeit indirectly , reveal george 's murderer . history of animal literary figures swann is not the first to employ animals as literary protagonists .
other smart animals carry the flag in well-known books such as george orwell 's " animal farm , " paul auster 's " timbuktu , " haruki murakami 's " kafka on the shore " or the children 's tale " charlotte 's web , " to name just a few . yet , as ian sansom wrote in the guardian , " with sheep as detectives swann solves one of the major problems in crime fiction , which is how to avoid the stereotypical jaded , cynical , alcoholic deadbeat gumshoe with relationship problems . " lending other animals in the book monikers such as " rameses , " " mopple the whale " and " satan " also helps to feed the reader 's imagination . mixed reviews some german literary critics have been harsh in their assessment of " three bags full , " with one writer in the weighty weekly die zeit wondering how swann 's " simple " language can generate a best-seller . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author leonie swann another critic in the influential daily süddeutsche zeitung imagined a clever talk between a literary agent and a prospective author that targeted cute sheep in narrative as harbingers of massive book sales . denis scheck , a prominent german literary critic , was kinder , calling the acquaintance with swann 's glennkill sheep a " real pleasure .

chief negotiators of the world 's leading industrial nations are meeting in berlin on tuesday in a last-ditch effort to remove obstacles threatening to derail a g8 deal on climate change . german chancellor angela merkel , whose country holds the current presidency of the g8 , wants this week 's summit participants in heiligendamm to agree to set long-term goals to cut greenhouse gas emissions . but she faces opposition from us president george w. bush , who wants to convene a global summit that includes a new generation of polluters from the developing world such as china , india and brazil . germany wants the g8 to agree to cut greenhouse gas emissions to 50 per cent below 1990 levels by the year 2050 in order to ensure that the world 's average temperature increase due to global warming does not exceed two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degree fahrenheit -rrb- . a new kyoto bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the talks are taking place far away from the g8 protests germany wants this to form the framework for a new united nations protocol on climate change to replace the kyoto agreement when it expires in 2012 . merkel won backing from british premier tony blair , although she appears to be less optimistic that a landmark deal will be reached at the summit to cover the post-kyoto period . " at the g8 we need to agree the elements of a future framework , " blair told parliamentarians in the german capital on sunday .
" this would allow the un talks to accelerate and reach earlier agreement so that we have a framework for kyoto in place by 2009 . " the bush plan last week bush called for about 15 countries that account for the bulk of greenhouse-gas emissions , including the us , to meet later this year for talks on a " long-term global goal " for cutting emissions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush supports voluntary cuts in emissions the us has acknowledged that climate change is a serious problem caused by humans that requires action - though , in the us , only through voluntary steps . the role of china , which is not a member of the g8 , is crucial , as many experts believe it could overtake the united states this year as the world 's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases . china on monday issued its own plan for responding to global climate change but urged developed nations to take the lead and allow poorer nations to focus on economic development . at the same time , japan said it would use the g8 to launch an aid program for developing countries that would encourage them to fight global warming as well as pollution and poverty . bush versus merkel ? merkel , who has made the fight against global warming a key issue of germany 's g8 presidency , is scheduled to have lunch with bush immediately before the start of the g8 summit on wednesday . there has been a mixed reaction to the president 's call for global warming talks with a select group of polluter nations .
but it was not meant to sideline broader un discussions on climate change , us national security advisor stephen hadley said last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with or without bush , merkel is pushing global climate reform " it is an effort to try and find consensus on the way ahead , " he said ahead of the g8 summit grouping the us , canada , germany , japan , france , britain , italy and russia . " this week presents an opportunity to turn mr. bush 's newfound interest in climate change into a commitment to do something about it soon , " britain 's observer newspaper said in an editorial . merkel , who was to meet with canadian prime minister stephen harper on monday evening and japanese premier shinzo abe on tuesday , said she was confident the pre-summit talks would lead to " important steps " being agreed upon .

chief negotiators of the world 's leading industrial nations are meeting in berlin on tuesday in a last-ditch effort to remove obstacles threatening to derail a g8 deal on climate change . german chancellor angela merkel , whose country holds the current presidency of the g8 , wants this week 's summit participants in heiligendamm to agree to set long-term goals to cut greenhouse gas emissions . but she faces opposition from us president george w. bush , who wants to convene a global summit that includes a new generation of polluters from the developing world such as china , india and brazil . germany wants the g8 to agree to cut greenhouse gas emissions to 50 per cent below 1990 levels by the year 2050 in order to ensure that the world 's average temperature increase due to global warming does not exceed two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degree fahrenheit -rrb- . a new kyoto bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the talks are taking place far away from the g8 protests germany wants this to form the framework for a new united nations protocol on climate change to replace the kyoto agreement when it expires in 2012 . merkel won backing from british premier tony blair , although she appears to be less optimistic that a landmark deal will be reached at the summit to cover the post-kyoto period . " at the g8 we need to agree the elements of a future framework , " blair told parliamentarians in the german capital on sunday .
" this would allow the un talks to accelerate and reach earlier agreement so that we have a framework for kyoto in place by 2009 . " the bush plan last week bush called for about 15 countries that account for the bulk of greenhouse-gas emissions , including the us , to meet later this year for talks on a " long-term global goal " for cutting emissions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush supports voluntary cuts in emissions the us has acknowledged that climate change is a serious problem caused by humans that requires action - though , in the us , only through voluntary steps . the role of china , which is not a member of the g8 , is crucial , as many experts believe it could overtake the united states this year as the world 's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases . china on monday issued its own plan for responding to global climate change but urged developed nations to take the lead and allow poorer nations to focus on economic development . at the same time , japan said it would use the g8 to launch an aid program for developing countries that would encourage them to fight global warming as well as pollution and poverty . bush versus merkel ? merkel , who has made the fight against global warming a key issue of germany 's g8 presidency , is scheduled to have lunch with bush immediately before the start of the g8 summit on wednesday . there has been a mixed reaction to the president 's call for global warming talks with a select group of polluter nations .

this time , we look at an international best-seller - a murder mystery with sheep as detectives . three bags full by leonie swann translated by anthea bell doubleday publishers 351 pages nearly any reader would admit that a book about a flock of sheep solving a murder mystery would lend itself to jokes about counting those sheep as one turns the pages . especially if the story starts off slowly and one is prone to spontaneous bouts of slumber - those z 's gently purring out of one 's mouth as the book gradually tilts forward , the reader nods off and images of fleecy sheep jumping over a fence loom ever larger in the mind 's eye . while reading the first chapters of leonie swann 's " three bags full " -lrb- " glennkill " in german -rrb- , this reader had to keep reminding herself that the book had become an international best-seller that had meanwhile been translated into at least 16 different languages . that fact , and the occasional bemusement at the soliloquies of the detective sheep pondering who had killed their shepherd , spurred me on , but not without resistance . puzzling idea somehow the compelling nature of their shepherd 's murder just did not come across in the initial pages of the book .
still , i read on , intrigued by how the debut novelist would depict the rest of the puzzle surrounding shepherd george glenn 's demise . after all , the setting was inviting - a hillside meadow near the irish village of glennkill , and the depth of the sheep 's outrage at finding george pinned to the ground with a spade did slowly emerge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hardcover version swann 's sheep , armed with their own literary accoutrements , deductive abilities and determination to avenge their shepherd 's death , begin tracking down the culprit .
with names like " othello " -lrb- the lead , black ram -rrb- and " miss maple " -lrb- a.k.a. " the smartest sheep in all glennkill " -rrb- , the animal protagonists already have an indirect link to murder and crime-solving . furthermore , they had developed their cognitive abilities by listening to their former shepherd george read aloud to them every afternoon when taking a break from grazing .
george 's literary tastes ranged from fairy tales to treatises on sheep diseases to trashy novels featuring red-headed heroines named " pamela . "
conveniently enough , george also once read a detective story to the sheep , so they feel adequately prepared to tackle the dirty business of crime-fighting . following their noses as they muse over the quirky behavior of human beings , the animals also apply their sharply honed sense of smell to aid them in solving the puzzle .
while swann 's countless descriptions of the sheep scenting the villagers to glean information do perhaps prompt a deeper understanding of just how animals tick , they also compose the sections of the novel that easily could have been whittled down .
the flowery depictions of the animals ' olfactory aptitude are initially amusing , and ultimately , annoying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in swann 's book , sheep have a mind of their own still , the sheep 's sense of smell gives them a straightforward approach that allows them to distinguish between the liars and truth-seekers in glennkill , among them : george 's estranged wife , the butcher , a rival shepherd , a pentecostal wallflower pining for the murdered man and george 's even more estranged daughter who returns to the village .
this ability to scent also eventually leads them to successfully , albeit indirectly , reveal george 's murderer . history of animal literary figures swann is not the first to employ animals as literary protagonists .
other smart animals carry the flag in well-known books such as george orwell 's " animal farm , " paul auster 's " timbuktu , " haruki murakami 's " kafka on the shore " or the children 's tale " charlotte 's web , " to name just a few . yet , as ian sansom wrote in the guardian , " with sheep as detectives swann solves one of the major problems in crime fiction , which is how to avoid the stereotypical jaded , cynical , alcoholic deadbeat gumshoe with relationship problems . " lending other animals in the book monikers such as " rameses , " " mopple the whale " and " satan " also helps to feed the reader 's imagination . mixed reviews some german literary critics have been harsh in their assessment of " three bags full , " with one writer in the weighty weekly die zeit wondering how swann 's " simple " language can generate a best-seller . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author leonie swann another critic in the influential daily süddeutsche zeitung imagined a clever talk between a literary agent and a prospective author that targeted cute sheep in narrative as harbingers of massive book sales . denis scheck , a prominent german literary critic , was kinder , calling the acquaintance with swann 's glennkill sheep a " real pleasure . " " three bags full " is a bit strange , but , as sansom wrote , it is also affecting .
if you can get over the initial slow pace of the book and a personal unwillingness to accept sheep as anything but dull , you will enjoy an occasional chuckle or smirk as you read on the train and glance up every now and then at your fellow commuters . ultimately , swann 's book offers readers perhaps less of a new take on how we perceive animals , and more of one on how they perceive us . it 's a lightly philosophical summer read , with the paperback edition due out at the beginning of july . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this time , we look at an international best-seller - a murder mystery with sheep as detectives . three bags full by leonie swann translated by anthea bell doubleday publishers 351 pages nearly any reader would admit that a book about a flock of sheep solving a murder mystery would lend itself to jokes about counting those sheep as one turns the pages . especially if the story starts off slowly and one is prone to spontaneous bouts of slumber - those z 's gently purring out of one 's mouth as the book gradually tilts forward , the reader nods off and images of fleecy sheep jumping over a fence loom ever larger in the mind 's eye . while reading the first chapters of leonie swann 's " three bags full " -lrb- " glennkill " in german -rrb- , this reader had to keep reminding herself that the book had become an international best-seller that had meanwhile been translated into at least 16 different languages . that fact , and the occasional bemusement at the soliloquies of the detective sheep pondering who had killed their shepherd , spurred me on , but not without resistance . puzzling idea somehow the compelling nature of their shepherd 's murder just did not come across in the initial pages of the book .
still , i read on , intrigued by how the debut novelist would depict the rest of the puzzle surrounding shepherd george glenn 's demise . after all , the setting was inviting - a hillside meadow near the irish village of glennkill , and the depth of the sheep 's outrage at finding george pinned to the ground with a spade did slowly emerge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hardcover version swann 's sheep , armed with their own literary accoutrements , deductive abilities and determination to avenge their shepherd 's death , begin tracking down the culprit .
with names like " othello " -lrb- the lead , black ram -rrb- and " miss maple " -lrb- a.k.a. " the smartest sheep in all glennkill " -rrb- , the animal protagonists already have an indirect link to murder and crime-solving . furthermore , they had developed their cognitive abilities by listening to their former shepherd george read aloud to them every afternoon when taking a break from grazing .
george 's literary tastes ranged from fairy tales to treatises on sheep diseases to trashy novels featuring red-headed heroines named " pamela . "
conveniently enough , george also once read a detective story to the sheep , so they feel adequately prepared to tackle the dirty business of crime-fighting . following their noses as they muse over the quirky behavior of human beings , the animals also apply their sharply honed sense of smell to aid them in solving the puzzle .
while swann 's countless descriptions of the sheep scenting the villagers to glean information do perhaps prompt a deeper understanding of just how animals tick , they also compose the sections of the novel that easily could have been whittled down .
the flowery depictions of the animals ' olfactory aptitude are initially amusing , and ultimately , annoying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in swann 's book , sheep have a mind of their own still , the sheep 's sense of smell gives them a straightforward approach that allows them to distinguish between the liars and truth-seekers in glennkill , among them : george 's estranged wife , the butcher , a rival shepherd , a pentecostal wallflower pining for the murdered man and george 's even more estranged daughter who returns to the village .
this ability to scent also eventually leads them to successfully , albeit indirectly , reveal george 's murderer . history of animal literary figures swann is not the first to employ animals as literary protagonists .
other smart animals carry the flag in well-known books such as george orwell 's " animal farm , " paul auster 's " timbuktu , " haruki murakami 's " kafka on the shore " or the children 's tale " charlotte 's web , " to name just a few . yet , as ian sansom wrote in the guardian , " with sheep as detectives swann solves one of the major problems in crime fiction , which is how to avoid the stereotypical jaded , cynical , alcoholic deadbeat gumshoe with relationship problems . " lending other animals in the book monikers such as " rameses , " " mopple the whale " and " satan " also helps to feed the reader 's imagination . mixed reviews some german literary critics have been harsh in their assessment of " three bags full , " with one writer in the weighty weekly die zeit wondering how swann 's " simple " language can generate a best-seller . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author leonie swann another critic in the influential daily süddeutsche zeitung imagined a clever talk between a literary agent and a prospective author that targeted cute sheep in narrative as harbingers of massive book sales . denis scheck , a prominent german literary critic , was kinder , calling the acquaintance with swann 's glennkill sheep a " real pleasure . " " three bags full " is a bit strange , but , as sansom wrote , it is also affecting .
if you can get over the initial slow pace of the book and a personal unwillingness to accept sheep as anything but dull , you will enjoy an occasional chuckle or smirk as you read on the train and glance up every now and then at your fellow commuters . ultimately , swann 's book offers readers perhaps less of a new take on how we perceive animals , and more of one on how they perceive us . it 's a lightly philosophical summer read , with the paperback edition due out at the beginning of july . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the announcement was on monday made in both german and english to the globalization opponents at the encampment located 10 kilometers -lrb- about 6 miles -rrb- south of the resort hotel where world leaders are scheduled to meet on wednesday .

" it 's not enough to march through the streets carrying a sign , " continued kristow .
" we claim the right to block a street so that delegations who want to go to this summit ca n't get through . "
after demonstrations turned into violent riots in rostock on saturday , many of the demonstrators expect police to raid the camps in order to weed out potentially violent activists before the summit begins .
preparing for police raid " we believe that the police are trying to reduce the number of participants in coming protests by storming the camp and arresting the offenders from the last demonstrations , " said marius kürten , who traveled to the event from speyer in south-western germany .

the relaxing music in the camp belies the tense mood .
the stretch of tents - roughly the size of three soccer fields - is seen as occupied territory off-limits to security forces .
police have parked their buses and set up headquarters some distance away , at the intersection leading to the camp entrance .
peaceful protestors harbor extremists " we 've seen that they 've set up barricades so that the press and police ca n't drive through , " said gabi baumgart , a manager at a window company whose office borders the encampment .
" the people here earlier were really great , they were really nice and peaceful , " continued baumgart .

nevertheless , they do n't seem to want to distance themselves from the violent activists .
many blame the police for the skirmishes last weekend , though the violence cost the demonstrators much of the sympathy they had had from parts of the general population .

the motto of the meeting : melting ice – a hot topic ? the united nations environmental program used the occasion to release a new report entitled " the global outlook for ice and snow . "
according to the report ’ s findings , the lives of hundreds of millions of people across the world will be affected by declines in snow cover , sea ice , glaciers , permafrost and lake ice .

the report is a part of the ongoing international polar year , an initiative spearheaded by the international council for science and the world meteorological organization .
norway ’ s environment minister helen bjoernoey praised the report .
" this report gives us an overall picture of the changes in snow and ice cover and the consequences for human beings and nature , not only in the polar and mountainous areas , but all over the world .

sheila watt cloutier , a former president of the inuit circumpolar conference , is campaigning to raise awareness of climate change and is developing a network involving indigenous people all over the globe .
according to watt , the impact of melting ice can be seen most clearly in these arctic regions , but the effects will reach far wider , with rising sea levels and changing ocean currents .
" we are very negatively and disproportionately affected by climate change , " said cloutier .
" the melting of -lrb- the ice -rrb- is creating not only inconvenience but real issues of livelihoods that are at stake where safety and security have become a remarkable challenge for us . "
from north to south bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unep 's steiner does not see any good news the report also highlighted threats to people in non-arctic areas of the world stating that " impacts are likely to include significant changes in the availability of water supplies for drinking and agriculture , rising sea levels affecting low-lying coasts and islands . "
" melting ice and snow are also likely to increase hazards including avalanches and floods from the build-up of potentially unstable glacial lakes .
these can burst their ice and soil dams , sending walls of water down valleys , " said steiner in his remarks in tromso .

" this report gives us an overall picture of the changes in snow and ice cover and the consequences for human beings and nature , not only in the polar and mountainous areas , but all over the world .

sheila watt cloutier , a former president of the inuit circumpolar conference , is campaigning to raise awareness of climate change and is developing a network involving indigenous people all over the globe .
according to watt , the impact of melting ice can be seen most clearly in these arctic regions , but the effects will reach far wider , with rising sea levels and changing ocean currents .
" we are very negatively and disproportionately affected by climate change , " said cloutier .
" the melting of -lrb- the ice -rrb- is creating not only inconvenience but real issues of livelihoods that are at stake where safety and security have become a remarkable challenge for us . "

"
" melting ice and snow are also likely to increase hazards including avalanches and floods from the build-up of potentially unstable glacial lakes .
these can burst their ice and soil dams , sending walls of water down valleys , " said steiner in his remarks in tromso .

" the united states is the world 's innovation leader .
it is dominant in science .
i exaggerate perhaps , but this cooperation in technology , in science , in innovation , is in some way our condition for the construction of the anti-missile defense system on our territory , " topolanek said during the joint news conference with bush .

local resources accounted for 80 to 90 per cent of capital formation in the major european economies during the first two years of the recovery program , according to university of iowa history professor michael hogan , a prominent expert on the marshall plan . yet , the marshall plan provided the " critical margin " of support that made european self-help possible .
it fuelled essential imports , eased production bottlenecks , encouraged higher rates of capital formation and helped to suppress inflation , hogan wrote in a paper marking the 50th anniversary of marshall 's speech . all these effects led to gains in productivity , improvements in trade and the most durable era of social peace and prosperity in modern european history . marshall plan today bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have considered setting up a new marshall plan help in iraq or the balkans the ideals of the marshall plan have been invoked countless times by well-meaning people , facing the tasks of rebuilding regions torn by crisis or failed states from latin america to the balkans and , now , iraq . there have been so many references that larry bland , director of the george marshall foundation , has stopped counting . historians wave aside calls for a new marshall plan , saying the structures and historical situation after world war ii were unique .
the marshall plan , in a sense , oiled the gears of existing machinery - it did not bear the burden of bringing trade and forging modern political structures in places with no experience of them . western europe for centuries had known the rule of law , democracy and private property and initiative .
the us was dealing with people who knew what to do and who knew the importance of the middle class , bland said .
they were people who did n't need to be taught democracy and free enterprise . dw staff dpa -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the motto of the meeting : melting ice – a hot topic ? the united nations environmental program used the occasion to release a new report entitled " the global outlook for ice and snow . "
according to the report ’ s findings , the lives of hundreds of millions of people across the world will be affected by declines in snow cover , sea ice , glaciers , permafrost and lake ice .
a collaboration of 70 researchers , the report found that the melting of snow and ice caps contributes greatly to climate change and global warming because less sunlight is being reflected back into the atmosphere .

" but the report underlines that fate of the world 's snowy and icy places in a climatically challenged world should be cause for concern in every ministry , boardroom and living room across the world , " he said .
the report is a part of the ongoing international polar year , an initiative spearheaded by the international council for science and the world meteorological organization .
norway ’ s environment minister helen bjoernoey praised the report .
" this report gives us an overall picture of the changes in snow and ice cover and the consequences for human beings and nature , not only in the polar and mountainous areas , but all over the world .

sheila watt cloutier , a former president of the inuit circumpolar conference , is campaigning to raise awareness of climate change and is developing a network involving indigenous people all over the globe .
according to watt , the impact of melting ice can be seen most clearly in these arctic regions , but the effects will reach far wider , with rising sea levels and changing ocean currents .
" we are very negatively and disproportionately affected by climate change , " said cloutier .
" the melting of -lrb- the ice -rrb- is creating not only inconvenience but real issues of livelihoods that are at stake where safety and security have become a remarkable challenge for us . "

"
" melting ice and snow are also likely to increase hazards including avalanches and floods from the build-up of potentially unstable glacial lakes .
these can burst their ice and soil dams , sending walls of water down valleys , " said steiner in his remarks in tromso .

faster economic growth helped berlin bring the budget deficit below the eu limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product .
it dropped from 3.2 percent of gdp in 2005 to 1.7 percent in 2006 .

eu finance chiefs are set to discuss easier rules on how value-added tax in the bloc is charged in the course of their meeting .
the talks are likely to be arduous , as any decisions must be given the thumbs-up by all 27 governments .

1 , 2008 .
eu leaders are expected to vote on the requests at a summit later this month .
the meeting of eu finance chiefs takes place ahead of the g8 summit of the world 's leading industrialized nations in germany on june 6 to 8 , which is likely to underscore the growing global power of emerging economies as well as a diminishing us dollar .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 05.06.2007 book review : clever sheep solve a murder mystery großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a good summer read occasionally , dw-world.de brings you reviews of some of the latest german books being published in english .
this time , we look at an international best-seller - a murder mystery with sheep as detectives . three bags full by leonie swann translated by anthea bell doubleday publishers 351 pages nearly any reader would admit that a book about a flock of sheep solving a murder mystery would lend itself to jokes about counting those sheep as one turns the pages . especially if the story starts off slowly and one is prone to spontaneous bouts of slumber - those z 's gently purring out of one 's mouth as the book gradually tilts forward , the reader nods off and images of fleecy sheep jumping over a fence loom ever larger in the mind 's eye . while reading the first chapters of leonie swann 's " three bags full " -lrb- " glennkill " in german -rrb- , this reader had to keep reminding herself that the book had become an international best-seller that had meanwhile been translated into at least 16 different languages . that fact , and the occasional bemusement at the soliloquies of the detective sheep pondering who had killed their shepherd , spurred me on , but not without resistance . puzzling idea somehow the compelling nature of their shepherd 's murder just did not come across in the initial pages of the book .
still , i read on , intrigued by how the debut novelist would depict the rest of the puzzle surrounding shepherd george glenn 's demise . after all , the setting was inviting - a hillside meadow near the irish village of glennkill , and the depth of the sheep 's outrage at finding george pinned to the ground with a spade did slowly emerge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hardcover version swann 's sheep , armed with their own literary accoutrements , deductive abilities and determination to avenge their shepherd 's death , begin tracking down the culprit .
with names like " othello " -lrb- the lead , black ram -rrb- and " miss maple " -lrb- a.k.a. " the smartest sheep in all glennkill " -rrb- , the animal protagonists already have an indirect link to murder and crime-solving . furthermore , they had developed their cognitive abilities by listening to their former shepherd george read aloud to them every afternoon when taking a break from grazing .
george 's literary tastes ranged from fairy tales to treatises on sheep diseases to trashy novels featuring red-headed heroines named " pamela . "
conveniently enough , george also once read a detective story to the sheep , so they feel adequately prepared to tackle the dirty business of crime-fighting . following their noses as they muse over the quirky behavior of human beings , the animals also apply their sharply honed sense of smell to aid them in solving the puzzle .
while swann 's countless descriptions of the sheep scenting the villagers to glean information do perhaps prompt a deeper understanding of just how animals tick , they also compose the sections of the novel that easily could have been whittled down .
the flowery depictions of the animals ' olfactory aptitude are initially amusing , and ultimately , annoying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in swann 's book , sheep have a mind of their own still , the sheep 's sense of smell gives them a straightforward approach that allows them to distinguish between the liars and truth-seekers in glennkill , among them : george 's estranged wife , the butcher , a rival shepherd , a pentecostal wallflower pining for the murdered man and george 's even more estranged daughter who returns to the village .
this ability to scent also eventually leads them to successfully , albeit indirectly , reveal george 's murderer . history of animal literary figures swann is not the first to employ animals as literary protagonists .

this time , we look at an international best-seller - a murder mystery with sheep as detectives . three bags full by leonie swann translated by anthea bell doubleday publishers 351 pages nearly any reader would admit that a book about a flock of sheep solving a murder mystery would lend itself to jokes about counting those sheep as one turns the pages . especially if the story starts off slowly and one is prone to spontaneous bouts of slumber - those z 's gently purring out of one 's mouth as the book gradually tilts forward , the reader nods off and images of fleecy sheep jumping over a fence loom ever larger in the mind 's eye . while reading the first chapters of leonie swann 's " three bags full " -lrb- " glennkill " in german -rrb- , this reader had to keep reminding herself that the book had become an international best-seller that had meanwhile been translated into at least 16 different languages . that fact , and the occasional bemusement at the soliloquies of the detective sheep pondering who had killed their shepherd , spurred me on , but not without resistance . puzzling idea somehow the compelling nature of their shepherd 's murder just did not come across in the initial pages of the book .
still , i read on , intrigued by how the debut novelist would depict the rest of the puzzle surrounding shepherd george glenn 's demise . after all , the setting was inviting - a hillside meadow near the irish village of glennkill , and the depth of the sheep 's outrage at finding george pinned to the ground with a spade did slowly emerge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hardcover version swann 's sheep , armed with their own literary accoutrements , deductive abilities and determination to avenge their shepherd 's death , begin tracking down the culprit .
with names like " othello " -lrb- the lead , black ram -rrb- and " miss maple " -lrb- a.k.a. " the smartest sheep in all glennkill " -rrb- , the animal protagonists already have an indirect link to murder and crime-solving . furthermore , they had developed their cognitive abilities by listening to their former shepherd george read aloud to them every afternoon when taking a break from grazing .
george 's literary tastes ranged from fairy tales to treatises on sheep diseases to trashy novels featuring red-headed heroines named " pamela . "
conveniently enough , george also once read a detective story to the sheep , so they feel adequately prepared to tackle the dirty business of crime-fighting . following their noses as they muse over the quirky behavior of human beings , the animals also apply their sharply honed sense of smell to aid them in solving the puzzle .
while swann 's countless descriptions of the sheep scenting the villagers to glean information do perhaps prompt a deeper understanding of just how animals tick , they also compose the sections of the novel that easily could have been whittled down .
the flowery depictions of the animals ' olfactory aptitude are initially amusing , and ultimately , annoying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in swann 's book , sheep have a mind of their own still , the sheep 's sense of smell gives them a straightforward approach that allows them to distinguish between the liars and truth-seekers in glennkill , among them : george 's estranged wife , the butcher , a rival shepherd , a pentecostal wallflower pining for the murdered man and george 's even more estranged daughter who returns to the village .
this ability to scent also eventually leads them to successfully , albeit indirectly , reveal george 's murderer . history of animal literary figures swann is not the first to employ animals as literary protagonists .
other smart animals carry the flag in well-known books such as george orwell 's " animal farm , " paul auster 's " timbuktu , " haruki murakami 's " kafka on the shore " or the children 's tale " charlotte 's web , " to name just a few . yet , as ian sansom wrote in the guardian , " with sheep as detectives swann solves one of the major problems in crime fiction , which is how to avoid the stereotypical jaded , cynical , alcoholic deadbeat gumshoe with relationship problems .

the speech that outlined the ambitious plan was made 60 years ago today . the speech was without fanfare and lasted only 12 minutes , but it signaled a shift in the post-war era and heralded great changes to come . on june 5 , 1947 , us secretary of state george c. marshall addressed the graduating class at harvard university in cambridge , massachusetts .
within days , his recommendations became known as the marshall plan , which has gone down in history as the most successful civil-reconstruction project of the 20th century . " the marshall plan served as the economic and political foundation for the western alliance that waged the cold war , " said diane kunz , a professor of history at yale university .
" it allowed the united states gradually to engage itself in the bipolar confrontation by first committing money , not blood . " historians , however , disagree on how large a role the marshall plan money played in europe 's economic recovery . small speech , big idea marshall 's speech offered few details , but the powerful impact of his ideas , militarily and politically , were designed to make an imprint on europe for decades after the end of the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan began two years after the potsdam conference after the war , the united states - infrastructure intact and economy prospering - had a clear sense of where it was headed .
by contrast , experts were predicting financial and social collapse in europe . marshall , a future nobel peace prize winner , said at harvard that his proposal was " directed not against any country or doctrine but against hunger , poverty , desperation and chaos . "
he laid out his plan based on the initiative of the europeans and on their faith in the economic future of their countries and of europe as a whole . " it is logical that the united states should do whatever it is able to do to assist in the return of normal economic health in the world , without which there can be no political stability and no assured peace , " marshall said . within weeks of the speech , european governments - led by france and britain - began drafting marshall 's spending plan .
essentially , the plan was about supplying german importers of life-sustaining goods with hard currency . the marshall effect by the end of the marshall plan in 1952 , five years after marshall 's speech , the united states had invested more than $ 13 billion in goods and financial services , equal to $ 100 billion today -lrb- 74.3 billion euros -rrb- .
about $ 1.4 billion of the initial total was invested in rebuilding a germany that had been reduced to a landscape of rubble . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany was the fourth biggest recipient of us aid the offer of us help was made to all european countries .
the top four recipients of aid , in descending order , were britain , france , italy and germany .
moscow set the tone for the coming cold war , with a clear " nyet " that forbade the east european countries under its heel from accepting the largess of the capitalist benefactor . no one doubts that the marshall plan contributed mightily to cementing the division of europe and the world . washington 's intensions were plain : only with prosperity could western europe become a bulwark against communism .
the marshall plan helped make europe 's hungry masses reliable partners for the us . the designers of the marshall plan can not take all of the credit for this record of success .
local resources accounted for 80 to 90 per cent of capital formation in the major european economies during the first two years of the recovery program , according to university of iowa history professor michael hogan , a prominent expert on the marshall plan . yet , the marshall plan provided the " critical margin " of support that made european self-help possible .
it fuelled essential imports , eased production bottlenecks , encouraged higher rates of capital formation and helped to suppress inflation , hogan wrote in a paper marking the 50th anniversary of marshall 's speech . all these effects led to gains in productivity , improvements in trade and the most durable era of social peace and prosperity in modern european history . marshall plan today bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have considered setting up a new marshall plan help in iraq or the balkans the ideals of the marshall plan have been invoked countless times by well-meaning people , facing the tasks of rebuilding regions torn by crisis or failed states from latin america to the balkans and , now , iraq . there have been so many references that larry bland , director of the george marshall foundation , has stopped counting . historians wave aside calls for a new marshall plan , saying the structures and historical situation after world war ii were unique .
the marshall plan , in a sense , oiled the gears of existing machinery - it did not bear the burden of bringing trade and forging modern political structures in places with no experience of them . western europe for centuries had known the rule of law , democracy and private property and initiative .
the us was dealing with people who knew what to do and who knew the importance of the middle class , bland said .
they were people who did n't need to be taught democracy and free enterprise . dw staff dpa -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

our g8 summit " we think that the g8 summit does not speak to the whole population " of the world , said hassen lorgat , a south african trade unionist .
" without us , nothing can happen for us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all protesters throw stones between now and thursday the anti-g8 campaigners will hold workshops to develop an alternative to what they call the " unbridled liberalism " of the g8 group of industrialized nations , though there will be no final statement .
the campaigners ' slogan has not changed over the years whether the topic is hunger , the wealth-sharing or international trade : " another world is possible . "
" industries are collapsing in africa because of subsidies paid to european products , " said jane nalunga , from uganda , of seatini -lrb- southern and eastern african trade information and negotiations institute -rrb- , an association which defends african economic interests .
" there is no justice " in the economic relationship between africa and the industrialized countries , she said , underlining the fact that africa can not fix the price of its own raw materials .
yet " trade is the key to development in africa , " she said .
an alternative view bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heilingendamm has been turned into a walled fortress among those attending in a private capacity is swiss sociologist jean ziegler , the united nations special rapporteur on the right to food .
according to ziegler the message is as topical as ever .
" it is the big groups that will dictate their law at heiligendamm , " he said , making it clear he was speaking as an individual and not in an official un capacity .
in his pamphlet " the empire of shame " ziegler inveighs against a new world system of " refeudalization " based on debt and hunger .
he condemns in particular " the murderous european union policy of dumping " which means that " you find in african markets french , italian and portuguese fruit and vegetables at half the price of the african products , " something he says drives local farmers into bankruptcy .
words not stones bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violence has become a nearly normal feature of g8 summits the alternative summit is being held in the northern port of rostock , 15 kilometers from heiligendamm , where chancellor angela merkel is hosting the leaders of britain , france , italy , japan , canada , the us and russia beginning on wednesday .
rostock was the scene of rioting over the weekend when hooded demonstrators taking part in an anti-globalization rally hurled rocks and bags of paint at police , who responded with water canons .
organizers of the alternative summit said it was being held because " the current form of globalization has produced and continues to produce many losers and very few winners . "
" we are looking for a confrontation , but with words , not stones , " said karsten smid , a spokesman for the environmental organization greenpeace . dw staff -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

statehood for kosovo is the latest . climate change and aid to africa have long been on the agenda for the g8 summit which kicks off on wednesday in heiligendamm on the north-eastern german coast . but the gathering of rich industrial nations that includes russia threatens to be overshadowed by divisions within the club from an unexpected source : kosovo . the tiny autonomous province in serbia , which is under un administration , has n't grabbed banner headlines since 1999 , when us-led air strikes forced out slobodan milosevic 's marauding army .
but that 's mainly because nato 's huge international contingent has kept the peace . territorial and ethnic tensions in the remains of the former yugoslavia are still simmering below the surface , and now with the un road map for kosovo 's independence from serbia on the table , the western powers want to finally put the last chapter of the balkans saga to bed . the world 's political powers meeting at the group of eight summit this week in germany should decide whether the un security council should proceed with a draft resolution dealing with the future of kosovo , the council president said monday . " we 'll see how the situation will evolve , " said belgium 's un ambassador johan verbeke .
" for the time being , it 's a wait-and-see period ; it 's a question of days , not weeks . " verbeke , whose country holds the rotating council presidency for june , said once the eight world leaders give the go-ahead , he will put the kosovo issue on the council 's monthly agenda .
he said the decision also belongs to capitals of 15 countries on the council .
bildunterschrift : rice -lrb- second from right -rrb- and lavrov -lrb- second from left -rrb- exchanged barbs over missile defense and kosovo russian opposition at last week 's foreign ministers meeting in potsdam - best known as the venue for the postwar meeting of us , british and soviet leaders - the cold war lines between europe and united states on one side , and russia on the other , were clearly drawn again . us secretary of state condoleezza rice and russian foreign minister sergey lavrov not only exchanged barbs about moscow 's opposition to plans for us anti-missile shield installations in poland and the czech republic , but also over the future status of kosovo . lavrov denounced the plan drawn up by un special envoy martti ahtisaari , which seeks to transfer custody of the overwhelmingly ethnic albanian province to the eu in the transitional period to nationhood .
the plan was approved by the parliament in kosovo , but rejected by the autonomous region 's serb minority and belgrade . the kremlin 's adamant opposition took the western allies by surprise , although lavrov stopped short of saying that russia would exercise its veto power in the un 's security council . one expert says the reasons moscow is supporting a fellow slavic state are complicated and need to be understood within the broad scope of russia 's relations with the eu and us . russian resurgence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patience for independance in kosovo is wearing thin " russia has no leverage over the balkan states and knows it .
there 's no way that russia could stop the ahtisaari plan if the west stands united in favor of it .
its veto power in the security council is symbolic .
after all the us invaded iraq without a un mandate , " said alexander rahr , program director for russia at the german council on foreign relations . " the russians are putting up a front .
they have their national pride , and do n't want to be seen as a junior partner of the west .
remember they were humiliated back in the 1990s , " said rahr , referring to a time when an economically weak and chaotic russia that had emerged from communism was unable to protect its serb ally in the war that nato waged without un authorization . " now the russians have got oil money , " added rahr , who explained that the windfall from its energy exports and increasing strategic importance because of it has led to a new assertiveness in president vladimir putin 's dealings with the west . besides russia has a point in pushing the conflicting parties - ethnic albanians and christian serbs - to work out their own lasting compromise , which could be preferable to the great powers imposing a nation-state from above , according to rahr . need to win over the serbs " the serbs wo n't agree to kosovo 's independence today , but who says they ca n't be won over in say , two years time ?
young serbs are not all nationalistic .
you need to win them over , make them european .
we in the eu made the mistake of not inviting serbia to join us , " he said . another concern shared by moscow and other countries is the precedent a un resolution would set , giving impetus to independence movements elsewhere , such as the basques in spain , kurds in turkey and the chechens in russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un plan named after martti ahtisaari has eu and us support other specialists say , however , that vladimir putin 's motivation for isolating russia against the eu and us on the kosovo issue is a puzzle , since he is not running for reelection when his term expires in 2008 and , with high domestic approval ratings anyway , he does not need to pander to an electorate at home . ever a tinderbox ? " kosovo is part of a host of issues - energy security , missile defense , human rights - that putin has used to wreak havoc , to divide the eu from within and split the eu and us , " said julianne smith , director of the europe program at the center for strategic and international studies in washington . " if the ahtisaari plan falls off the table , we could see instability and violence again in the balkans , which is not in russia 's interest either , " said smith , who explained that keeping the issue of kosovo 's independence on the back burner risks creating a backlash among the albanian kosovars , whose patience is wearing thin after seven years as a ward of the united nations . " kosovo is a tinderbox , and it wo n't take much to reignite it .
there is no other possible solution -lrb- to the ahtisaari plan -rrb- .
these two sides -lrb- serbs and albanian kosovars -rrb- will never come together , " said smith . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

statehood for kosovo is the latest . climate change and aid to africa have long been on the agenda for the g8 summit which kicks off on wednesday in heiligendamm on the north-eastern german coast . but the gathering of rich industrial nations that includes russia threatens to be overshadowed by divisions within the club from an unexpected source : kosovo . the tiny autonomous province in serbia , which is under un administration , has n't grabbed banner headlines since 1999 , when us-led air strikes forced out slobodan milosevic 's marauding army .
but that 's mainly because nato 's huge international contingent has kept the peace . territorial and ethnic tensions in the remains of the former yugoslavia are still simmering below the surface , and now with the un road map for kosovo 's independence from serbia on the table , the western powers want to finally put the last chapter of the balkans saga to bed . the world 's political powers meeting at the group of eight summit this week in germany should decide whether the un security council should proceed with a draft resolution dealing with the future of kosovo , the council president said monday . " we 'll see how the situation will evolve , " said belgium 's un ambassador johan verbeke .
" for the time being , it 's a wait-and-see period ; it 's a question of days , not weeks . " verbeke , whose country holds the rotating council presidency for june , said once the eight world leaders give the go-ahead , he will put the kosovo issue on the council 's monthly agenda .
he said the decision also belongs to capitals of 15 countries on the council .
bildunterschrift : rice -lrb- second from right -rrb- and lavrov -lrb- second from left -rrb- exchanged barbs over missile defense and kosovo russian opposition at last week 's foreign ministers meeting in potsdam - best known as the venue for the postwar meeting of us , british and soviet leaders - the cold war lines between europe and united states on one side , and russia on the other , were clearly drawn again . us secretary of state condoleezza rice and russian foreign minister sergey lavrov not only exchanged barbs about moscow 's opposition to plans for us anti-missile shield installations in poland and the czech republic , but also over the future status of kosovo . lavrov denounced the plan drawn up by un special envoy martti ahtisaari , which seeks to transfer custody of the overwhelmingly ethnic albanian province to the eu in the transitional period to nationhood .
the plan was approved by the parliament in kosovo , but rejected by the autonomous region 's serb minority and belgrade . the kremlin 's adamant opposition took the western allies by surprise , although lavrov stopped short of saying that russia would exercise its veto power in the un 's security council . one expert says the reasons moscow is supporting a fellow slavic state are complicated and need to be understood within the broad scope of russia 's relations with the eu and us . russian resurgence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patience for independance in kosovo is wearing thin " russia has no leverage over the balkan states and knows it .
there 's no way that russia could stop the ahtisaari plan if the west stands united in favor of it .
its veto power in the security council is symbolic .
after all the us invaded iraq without a un mandate , " said alexander rahr , program director for russia at the german council on foreign relations . " the russians are putting up a front .
they have their national pride , and do n't want to be seen as a junior partner of the west .
remember they were humiliated back in the 1990s , " said rahr , referring to a time when an economically weak and chaotic russia that had emerged from communism was unable to protect its serb ally in the war that nato waged without un authorization . " now the russians have got oil money , " added rahr , who explained that the windfall from its energy exports and increasing strategic importance because of it has led to a new assertiveness in president vladimir putin 's dealings with the west . besides russia has a point in pushing the conflicting parties - ethnic albanians and christian serbs - to work out their own lasting compromise , which could be preferable to the great powers imposing a nation-state from above , according to rahr . need to win over the serbs " the serbs wo n't agree to kosovo 's independence today , but who says they ca n't be won over in say , two years time ?

chief negotiators of the world 's leading industrial nations are meeting in berlin on tuesday in a last-ditch effort to remove obstacles threatening to derail a g8 deal on climate change . german chancellor angela merkel , whose country holds the current presidency of the g8 , wants this week 's summit participants in heiligendamm to agree to set long-term goals to cut greenhouse gas emissions . but she faces opposition from us president george w. bush , who wants to convene a global summit that includes a new generation of polluters from the developing world such as china , india and brazil . germany wants the g8 to agree to cut greenhouse gas emissions to 50 per cent below 1990 levels by the year 2050 in order to ensure that the world 's average temperature increase due to global warming does not exceed two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degree fahrenheit -rrb- . a new kyoto bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the talks are taking place far away from the g8 protests germany wants this to form the framework for a new united nations protocol on climate change to replace the kyoto agreement when it expires in 2012 . merkel won backing from british premier tony blair , although she appears to be less optimistic that a landmark deal will be reached at the summit to cover the post-kyoto period .

" this would allow the un talks to accelerate and reach earlier agreement so that we have a framework for kyoto in place by 2009 .

chief negotiators of the world 's leading industrial nations are meeting in berlin on tuesday in a last-ditch effort to remove obstacles threatening to derail a g8 deal on climate change . german chancellor angela merkel , whose country holds the current presidency of the g8 , wants this week 's summit participants in heiligendamm to agree to set long-term goals to cut greenhouse gas emissions . but she faces opposition from us president george w. bush , who wants to convene a global summit that includes a new generation of polluters from the developing world such as china , india and brazil . germany wants the g8 to agree to cut greenhouse gas emissions to 50 per cent below 1990 levels by the year 2050 in order to ensure that the world 's average temperature increase due to global warming does not exceed two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degree fahrenheit -rrb- . a new kyoto bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the talks are taking place far away from the g8 protests germany wants this to form the framework for a new united nations protocol on climate change to replace the kyoto agreement when it expires in 2012 . merkel won backing from british premier tony blair , although she appears to be less optimistic that a landmark deal will be reached at the summit to cover the post-kyoto period .

the announcement was on monday made in both german and english to the globalization opponents at the encampment located 10 kilometers -lrb- about 6 miles -rrb- south of the resort hotel where world leaders are scheduled to meet on wednesday .

the speech that outlined the ambitious plan was made 60 years ago today . the speech was without fanfare and lasted only 12 minutes , but it signaled a shift in the post-war era and heralded great changes to come . on june 5 , 1947 , us secretary of state george c. marshall addressed the graduating class at harvard university in cambridge , massachusetts .
within days , his recommendations became known as the marshall plan , which has gone down in history as the most successful civil-reconstruction project of the 20th century . " the marshall plan served as the economic and political foundation for the western alliance that waged the cold war , " said diane kunz , a professor of history at yale university .
" it allowed the united states gradually to engage itself in the bipolar confrontation by first committing money , not blood . " historians , however , disagree on how large a role the marshall plan money played in europe 's economic recovery . small speech , big idea marshall 's speech offered few details , but the powerful impact of his ideas , militarily and politically , were designed to make an imprint on europe for decades after the end of the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan began two years after the potsdam conference after the war , the united states - infrastructure intact and economy prospering - had a clear sense of where it was headed .
by contrast , experts were predicting financial and social collapse in europe . marshall , a future nobel peace prize winner , said at harvard that his proposal was " directed not against any country or doctrine but against hunger , poverty , desperation and chaos . "
he laid out his plan based on the initiative of the europeans and on their faith in the economic future of their countries and of europe as a whole . " it is logical that the united states should do whatever it is able to do to assist in the return of normal economic health in the world , without which there can be no political stability and no assured peace , " marshall said . within weeks of the speech , european governments - led by france and britain - began drafting marshall 's spending plan .
essentially , the plan was about supplying german importers of life-sustaining goods with hard currency . the marshall effect by the end of the marshall plan in 1952 , five years after marshall 's speech , the united states had invested more than $ 13 billion in goods and financial services , equal to $ 100 billion today -lrb- 74.3 billion euros -rrb- .
about $ 1.4 billion of the initial total was invested in rebuilding a germany that had been reduced to a landscape of rubble . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany was the fourth biggest recipient of us aid the offer of us help was made to all european countries .
the top four recipients of aid , in descending order , were britain , france , italy and germany .
moscow set the tone for the coming cold war , with a clear " nyet " that forbade the east european countries under its heel from accepting the largess of the capitalist benefactor . no one doubts that the marshall plan contributed mightily to cementing the division of europe and the world . washington 's intensions were plain : only with prosperity could western europe become a bulwark against communism .
the marshall plan helped make europe 's hungry masses reliable partners for the us . the designers of the marshall plan can not take all of the credit for this record of success .
local resources accounted for 80 to 90 per cent of capital formation in the major european economies during the first two years of the recovery program , according to university of iowa history professor michael hogan , a prominent expert on the marshall plan . yet , the marshall plan provided the " critical margin " of support that made european self-help possible .
it fuelled essential imports , eased production bottlenecks , encouraged higher rates of capital formation and helped to suppress inflation , hogan wrote in a paper marking the 50th anniversary of marshall 's speech . all these effects led to gains in productivity , improvements in trade and the most durable era of social peace and prosperity in modern european history . marshall plan today bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have considered setting up a new marshall plan help in iraq or the balkans the ideals of the marshall plan have been invoked countless times by well-meaning people , facing the tasks of rebuilding regions torn by crisis or failed states from latin america to the balkans and , now , iraq . there have been so many references that larry bland , director of the george marshall foundation , has stopped counting . historians wave aside calls for a new marshall plan , saying the structures and historical situation after world war ii were unique .
the marshall plan , in a sense , oiled the gears of existing machinery - it did not bear the burden of bringing trade and forging modern political structures in places with no experience of them . western europe for centuries had known the rule of law , democracy and private property and initiative .
the us was dealing with people who knew what to do and who knew the importance of the middle class , bland said .
they were people who did n't need to be taught democracy and free enterprise . dw staff dpa -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the motto of the meeting : melting ice – a hot topic ? the united nations environmental program used the occasion to release a new report entitled " the global outlook for ice and snow . "
according to the report ’ s findings , the lives of hundreds of millions of people across the world will be affected by declines in snow cover , sea ice , glaciers , permafrost and lake ice .
a collaboration of 70 researchers , the report found that the melting of snow and ice caps contributes greatly to climate change and global warming because less sunlight is being reflected back into the atmosphere .
less ice , more heat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glaciers are receding at an alarming rate " this report is about ice and snow and may to some people seem to address issues from remote and far-away places , " said achim steiner , un under-secretary general and unep executive director .
" but the report underlines that fate of the world 's snowy and icy places in a climatically challenged world should be cause for concern in every ministry , boardroom and living room across the world , " he said .
the report is a part of the ongoing international polar year , an initiative spearheaded by the international council for science and the world meteorological organization .
norway ’ s environment minister helen bjoernoey praised the report .
" this report gives us an overall picture of the changes in snow and ice cover and the consequences for human beings and nature , not only in the polar and mountainous areas , but all over the world .
to me it is particularly alarming to realize that climate change can be a reinforcing process - global warming results in further global warming " .
a hot topic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inuit hunters fear for their livelihood , and their lives for inuit and other indigenous people living in arctic regions , the rapid ice melt is a reality and a threat to their way of life .
sheila watt cloutier , a former president of the inuit circumpolar conference , is campaigning to raise awareness of climate change and is developing a network involving indigenous people all over the globe .
according to watt , the impact of melting ice can be seen most clearly in these arctic regions , but the effects will reach far wider , with rising sea levels and changing ocean currents .
" we are very negatively and disproportionately affected by climate change , " said cloutier .
" the melting of -lrb- the ice -rrb- is creating not only inconvenience but real issues of livelihoods that are at stake where safety and security have become a remarkable challenge for us . "
from north to south bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unep 's steiner does not see any good news the report also highlighted threats to people in non-arctic areas of the world stating that " impacts are likely to include significant changes in the availability of water supplies for drinking and agriculture , rising sea levels affecting low-lying coasts and islands . "
" melting ice and snow are also likely to increase hazards including avalanches and floods from the build-up of potentially unstable glacial lakes .
these can burst their ice and soil dams , sending walls of water down valleys , " said steiner in his remarks in tromso .

according to the report ’ s findings , the lives of hundreds of millions of people across the world will be affected by declines in snow cover , sea ice , glaciers , permafrost and lake ice .
a collaboration of 70 researchers , the report found that the melting of snow and ice caps contributes greatly to climate change and global warming because less sunlight is being reflected back into the atmosphere .
less ice , more heat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glaciers are receding at an alarming rate " this report is about ice and snow and may to some people seem to address issues from remote and far-away places , " said achim steiner , un under-secretary general and unep executive director .
" but the report underlines that fate of the world 's snowy and icy places in a climatically challenged world should be cause for concern in every ministry , boardroom and living room across the world , " he said .
the report is a part of the ongoing international polar year , an initiative spearheaded by the international council for science and the world meteorological organization .
norway ’ s environment minister helen bjoernoey praised the report .
" this report gives us an overall picture of the changes in snow and ice cover and the consequences for human beings and nature , not only in the polar and mountainous areas , but all over the world .
to me it is particularly alarming to realize that climate change can be a reinforcing process - global warming results in further global warming " .

sheila watt cloutier , a former president of the inuit circumpolar conference , is campaigning to raise awareness of climate change and is developing a network involving indigenous people all over the globe .
according to watt , the impact of melting ice can be seen most clearly in these arctic regions , but the effects will reach far wider , with rising sea levels and changing ocean currents .
" we are very negatively and disproportionately affected by climate change , " said cloutier .
" the melting of -lrb- the ice -rrb- is creating not only inconvenience but real issues of livelihoods that are at stake where safety and security have become a remarkable challenge for us . "
from north to south bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unep 's steiner does not see any good news the report also highlighted threats to people in non-arctic areas of the world stating that " impacts are likely to include significant changes in the availability of water supplies for drinking and agriculture , rising sea levels affecting low-lying coasts and islands . "
" melting ice and snow are also likely to increase hazards including avalanches and floods from the build-up of potentially unstable glacial lakes .
these can burst their ice and soil dams , sending walls of water down valleys , " said steiner in his remarks in tromso .

us president bush met protests when his plane touched down tuesday . protesters , who lost a last-ditch bid tuesday for court permission to march close to this week 's g8 summit , prepared in germany to mount sit-down protest to block roads when the three-day event begins wednesday . attac , a european group that believes globalization is dangerous and is leading the protests , said tuesday it was not organizing sit-downs and did not belong to block g8 , a group overseeing a planned " blockade , " but knew many attac members would be taking part . it said taking part in a sit-down was a misdemeanor , not a felony , and insisted german police only use " proportionate " force to clear sit-downs and avoid injuring anyone while doing so . road-block organizers promised tuesday they would ask peaceful demonstrators to abandon any blockade if the black block , an informal network of violence-prone militants who don black clothing and masks and congregate in the marches , took over and the incident turned into a violent confrontation . caustic clowns police had been taken by surprise by anti-g8 rioting saturday that left nearly 1,000 people injured .
officers claim they were facing a form of chemical warfare , with protesters dressed as clowns squirting them with a fluid that attacks the skin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eight offers were injured by chemical attacks eight police had needed hospital treatment , a spokesman said in rostock , a city 15 miles north-east of the heiligendamm beachside summit venue where small-scale protests were continuing and 11 persons were detained tuesday . at the first trial to deal with saturday 's rioters , a man aged 31 was sent to jail for 10 months for throwing stones at several police officers .
eight more persons , many of them non-german , were to come up for trial on wednesday . the police said a packet of white powder labeled " anthrax " found monday near the heiligendamm fence had only contained flour . protesters lose in court in the southern city of karlsruhe , germany 's constitutional court confirmed the legal restrictions junior judges had placed on the demonstrations . at the kempinski grand hotel in heiligendamm , only 15 representative protesters were allowed to hold a vigil starting tuesday , while demonstrators would also face a quota of 50 at a gate of rostock airport where the eight delegations were to land . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters complain their rights are being denied a mass demonstration at the airport must take place hundreds of meters away .
administrative tribunals had earlier modified the various restrictions put in place by the police . an appeal against a requirement that a mass protest on thursday remain on a highway which comes no closer than four miles to the summit hotel will be decided wednesday , a court spokeswoman said . more protests planned germany has deployed 16,000 police to protect the leaders of seven western nations and russia at the g8 summit as well as 10 other national leaders who are to join them on friday . the police are preparing to deal with both violent attacks by the black block and non-violent tactics from peaceful protesters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the black block is planning more protests police spokesman axel falkenberg rejected calls for german riot police to be armed with guns which shoot rubber bullets , which have never been used in germany .
officials said there were no such guns in the government 's armory . germany 's main weapon against riots is a fleet of trucks which shoot jets of cold water up to 50 meters . bush lands in rostock us president george w. bush was heckled by protesters as he arrived in rostock wednesday to attend the summit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials , and protestors , were on hand to meet bush in rostock he touched down just after 17:00 gmt from prague , where he accused russia of derailing democratic reforms , in a speech likely to further strain ties with moscow on the eve of the gathering . up to 1,000 anti-globalization activists waited for the helicopter behind a fence guarded by rows of police officers .

us president bush met protests when his plane touched down tuesday . protesters , who lost a last-ditch bid tuesday for court permission to march close to this week 's g8 summit , prepared in germany to mount sit-down protest to block roads when the three-day event begins wednesday . attac , a european group that believes globalization is dangerous and is leading the protests , said tuesday it was not organizing sit-downs and did not belong to block g8 , a group overseeing a planned " blockade , " but knew many attac members would be taking part . it said taking part in a sit-down was a misdemeanor , not a felony , and insisted german police only use " proportionate " force to clear sit-downs and avoid injuring anyone while doing so . road-block organizers promised tuesday they would ask peaceful demonstrators to abandon any blockade if the black block , an informal network of violence-prone militants who don black clothing and masks and congregate in the marches , took over and the incident turned into a violent confrontation . caustic clowns police had been taken by surprise by anti-g8 rioting saturday that left nearly 1,000 people injured .
officers claim they were facing a form of chemical warfare , with protesters dressed as clowns squirting them with a fluid that attacks the skin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eight offers were injured by chemical attacks eight police had needed hospital treatment , a spokesman said in rostock , a city 15 miles north-east of the heiligendamm beachside summit venue where small-scale protests were continuing and 11 persons were detained tuesday . at the first trial to deal with saturday 's rioters , a man aged 31 was sent to jail for 10 months for throwing stones at several police officers .
eight more persons , many of them non-german , were to come up for trial on wednesday . the police said a packet of white powder labeled " anthrax " found monday near the heiligendamm fence had only contained flour . protesters lose in court in the southern city of karlsruhe , germany 's constitutional court confirmed the legal restrictions junior judges had placed on the demonstrations . at the kempinski grand hotel in heiligendamm , only 15 representative protesters were allowed to hold a vigil starting tuesday , while demonstrators would also face a quota of 50 at a gate of rostock airport where the eight delegations were to land . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters complain their rights are being denied a mass demonstration at the airport must take place hundreds of meters away .
administrative tribunals had earlier modified the various restrictions put in place by the police . an appeal against a requirement that a mass protest on thursday remain on a highway which comes no closer than four miles to the summit hotel will be decided wednesday , a court spokeswoman said . more protests planned germany has deployed 16,000 police to protect the leaders of seven western nations and russia at the g8 summit as well as 10 other national leaders who are to join them on friday . the police are preparing to deal with both violent attacks by the black block and non-violent tactics from peaceful protesters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the black block is planning more protests police spokesman axel falkenberg rejected calls for german riot police to be armed with guns which shoot rubber bullets , which have never been used in germany .
officials said there were no such guns in the government 's armory . germany 's main weapon against riots is a fleet of trucks which shoot jets of cold water up to 50 meters . bush lands in rostock us president george w. bush was heckled by protesters as he arrived in rostock wednesday to attend the summit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials , and protestors , were on hand to meet bush in rostock he touched down just after 17:00 gmt from prague , where he accused russia of derailing democratic reforms , in a speech likely to further strain ties with moscow on the eve of the gathering . up to 1,000 anti-globalization activists waited for the helicopter behind a fence guarded by rows of police officers .

the speech that outlined the ambitious plan was made 60 years ago today . the speech was without fanfare and lasted only 12 minutes , but it signaled a shift in the post-war era and heralded great changes to come . on june 5 , 1947 , us secretary of state george c. marshall addressed the graduating class at harvard university in cambridge , massachusetts .
within days , his recommendations became known as the marshall plan , which has gone down in history as the most successful civil-reconstruction project of the 20th century . " the marshall plan served as the economic and political foundation for the western alliance that waged the cold war , " said diane kunz , a professor of history at yale university .
" it allowed the united states gradually to engage itself in the bipolar confrontation by first committing money , not blood . " historians , however , disagree on how large a role the marshall plan money played in europe 's economic recovery . small speech , big idea marshall 's speech offered few details , but the powerful impact of his ideas , militarily and politically , were designed to make an imprint on europe for decades after the end of the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan began two years after the potsdam conference after the war , the united states - infrastructure intact and economy prospering - had a clear sense of where it was headed .
by contrast , experts were predicting financial and social collapse in europe . marshall , a future nobel peace prize winner , said at harvard that his proposal was " directed not against any country or doctrine but against hunger , poverty , desperation and chaos . "
he laid out his plan based on the initiative of the europeans and on their faith in the economic future of their countries and of europe as a whole . " it is logical that the united states should do whatever it is able to do to assist in the return of normal economic health in the world , without which there can be no political stability and no assured peace , " marshall said . within weeks of the speech , european governments - led by france and britain - began drafting marshall 's spending plan .
essentially , the plan was about supplying german importers of life-sustaining goods with hard currency . the marshall effect by the end of the marshall plan in 1952 , five years after marshall 's speech , the united states had invested more than $ 13 billion in goods and financial services , equal to $ 100 billion today -lrb- 74.3 billion euros -rrb- .

the marshall plan helped make europe 's hungry masses reliable partners for the us . the designers of the marshall plan can not take all of the credit for this record of success .
local resources accounted for 80 to 90 per cent of capital formation in the major european economies during the first two years of the recovery program , according to university of iowa history professor michael hogan , a prominent expert on the marshall plan . yet , the marshall plan provided the " critical margin " of support that made european self-help possible .
it fuelled essential imports , eased production bottlenecks , encouraged higher rates of capital formation and helped to suppress inflation , hogan wrote in a paper marking the 50th anniversary of marshall 's speech . all these effects led to gains in productivity , improvements in trade and the most durable era of social peace and prosperity in modern european history . marshall plan today bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have considered setting up a new marshall plan help in iraq or the balkans the ideals of the marshall plan have been invoked countless times by well-meaning people , facing the tasks of rebuilding regions torn by crisis or failed states from latin america to the balkans and , now , iraq . there have been so many references that larry bland , director of the george marshall foundation , has stopped counting . historians wave aside calls for a new marshall plan , saying the structures and historical situation after world war ii were unique .

the speech that outlined the ambitious plan was made 60 years ago today . the speech was without fanfare and lasted only 12 minutes , but it signaled a shift in the post-war era and heralded great changes to come . on june 5 , 1947 , us secretary of state george c. marshall addressed the graduating class at harvard university in cambridge , massachusetts .
within days , his recommendations became known as the marshall plan , which has gone down in history as the most successful civil-reconstruction project of the 20th century . " the marshall plan served as the economic and political foundation for the western alliance that waged the cold war , " said diane kunz , a professor of history at yale university .
" it allowed the united states gradually to engage itself in the bipolar confrontation by first committing money , not blood . " historians , however , disagree on how large a role the marshall plan money played in europe 's economic recovery . small speech , big idea marshall 's speech offered few details , but the powerful impact of his ideas , militarily and politically , were designed to make an imprint on europe for decades after the end of the war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan began two years after the potsdam conference after the war , the united states - infrastructure intact and economy prospering - had a clear sense of where it was headed .
by contrast , experts were predicting financial and social collapse in europe . marshall , a future nobel peace prize winner , said at harvard that his proposal was " directed not against any country or doctrine but against hunger , poverty , desperation and chaos . "
he laid out his plan based on the initiative of the europeans and on their faith in the economic future of their countries and of europe as a whole . " it is logical that the united states should do whatever it is able to do to assist in the return of normal economic health in the world , without which there can be no political stability and no assured peace , " marshall said . within weeks of the speech , european governments - led by france and britain - began drafting marshall 's spending plan .
essentially , the plan was about supplying german importers of life-sustaining goods with hard currency . the marshall effect by the end of the marshall plan in 1952 , five years after marshall 's speech , the united states had invested more than $ 13 billion in goods and financial services , equal to $ 100 billion today -lrb- 74.3 billion euros -rrb- .
about $ 1.4 billion of the initial total was invested in rebuilding a germany that had been reduced to a landscape of rubble . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany was the fourth biggest recipient of us aid the offer of us help was made to all european countries .
the top four recipients of aid , in descending order , were britain , france , italy and germany .
moscow set the tone for the coming cold war , with a clear " nyet " that forbade the east european countries under its heel from accepting the largess of the capitalist benefactor . no one doubts that the marshall plan contributed mightily to cementing the division of europe and the world . washington 's intensions were plain : only with prosperity could western europe become a bulwark against communism .
the marshall plan helped make europe 's hungry masses reliable partners for the us . the designers of the marshall plan can not take all of the credit for this record of success .
local resources accounted for 80 to 90 per cent of capital formation in the major european economies during the first two years of the recovery program , according to university of iowa history professor michael hogan , a prominent expert on the marshall plan . yet , the marshall plan provided the " critical margin " of support that made european self-help possible .
it fuelled essential imports , eased production bottlenecks , encouraged higher rates of capital formation and helped to suppress inflation , hogan wrote in a paper marking the 50th anniversary of marshall 's speech . all these effects led to gains in productivity , improvements in trade and the most durable era of social peace and prosperity in modern european history . marshall plan today bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have considered setting up a new marshall plan help in iraq or the balkans the ideals of the marshall plan have been invoked countless times by well-meaning people , facing the tasks of rebuilding regions torn by crisis or failed states from latin america to the balkans and , now , iraq . there have been so many references that larry bland , director of the george marshall foundation , has stopped counting . historians wave aside calls for a new marshall plan , saying the structures and historical situation after world war ii were unique .
the marshall plan , in a sense , oiled the gears of existing machinery - it did not bear the burden of bringing trade and forging modern political structures in places with no experience of them . western europe for centuries had known the rule of law , democracy and private property and initiative .
the us was dealing with people who knew what to do and who knew the importance of the middle class , bland said .
they were people who did n't need to be taught democracy and free enterprise . dw staff dpa -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

us president bush met protests when his plane touched down tuesday . protesters , who lost a last-ditch bid tuesday for court permission to march close to this week 's g8 summit , prepared in germany to mount sit-down protest to block roads when the three-day event begins wednesday . attac , a european group that believes globalization is dangerous and is leading the protests , said tuesday it was not organizing sit-downs and did not belong to block g8 , a group overseeing a planned " blockade , " but knew many attac members would be taking part . it said taking part in a sit-down was a misdemeanor , not a felony , and insisted german police only use " proportionate " force to clear sit-downs and avoid injuring anyone while doing so . road-block organizers promised tuesday they would ask peaceful demonstrators to abandon any blockade if the black block , an informal network of violence-prone militants who don black clothing and masks and congregate in the marches , took over and the incident turned into a violent confrontation . caustic clowns police had been taken by surprise by anti-g8 rioting saturday that left nearly 1,000 people injured .
officers claim they were facing a form of chemical warfare , with protesters dressed as clowns squirting them with a fluid that attacks the skin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eight offers were injured by chemical attacks eight police had needed hospital treatment , a spokesman said in rostock , a city 15 miles north-east of the heiligendamm beachside summit venue where small-scale protests were continuing and 11 persons were detained tuesday . at the first trial to deal with saturday 's rioters , a man aged 31 was sent to jail for 10 months for throwing stones at several police officers .
eight more persons , many of them non-german , were to come up for trial on wednesday . the police said a packet of white powder labeled " anthrax " found monday near the heiligendamm fence had only contained flour . protesters lose in court in the southern city of karlsruhe , germany 's constitutional court confirmed the legal restrictions junior judges had placed on the demonstrations . at the kempinski grand hotel in heiligendamm , only 15 representative protesters were allowed to hold a vigil starting tuesday , while demonstrators would also face a quota of 50 at a gate of rostock airport where the eight delegations were to land . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters complain their rights are being denied a mass demonstration at the airport must take place hundreds of meters away .
administrative tribunals had earlier modified the various restrictions put in place by the police . an appeal against a requirement that a mass protest on thursday remain on a highway which comes no closer than four miles to the summit hotel will be decided wednesday , a court spokeswoman said . more protests planned germany has deployed 16,000 police to protect the leaders of seven western nations and russia at the g8 summit as well as 10 other national leaders who are to join them on friday . the police are preparing to deal with both violent attacks by the black block and non-violent tactics from peaceful protesters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the black block is planning more protests police spokesman axel falkenberg rejected calls for german riot police to be armed with guns which shoot rubber bullets , which have never been used in germany .
officials said there were no such guns in the government 's armory . germany 's main weapon against riots is a fleet of trucks which shoot jets of cold water up to 50 meters . bush lands in rostock us president george w. bush was heckled by protesters as he arrived in rostock wednesday to attend the summit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials , and protestors , were on hand to meet bush in rostock he touched down just after 17:00 gmt from prague , where he accused russia of derailing democratic reforms , in a speech likely to further strain ties with moscow on the eve of the gathering . up to 1,000 anti-globalization activists waited for the helicopter behind a fence guarded by rows of police officers .

the campaigners ' slogan has not changed over the years whether the topic is hunger , the wealth-sharing or international trade : " another world is possible . "
" industries are collapsing in africa because of subsidies paid to european products , " said jane nalunga , from uganda , of seatini -lrb- southern and eastern african trade information and negotiations institute -rrb- , an association which defends african economic interests .

" russia is not the enemy , " president george w. bush said , speaking at the medieval prague castle , where he met with czech leaders . " the cold war is over .
it ended . " bush met with czech president vaclav klaus and prime minister mirek topolanek during a european tour that will also see him sharing a table with russian premier vladimir putin at the g8 summit on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin has threatened to point missiles at europe the us president said he planned to assure putin that the proposed extension of the anti-missile umbrella into the czech republic and poland was a purely defensive measure , " aimed not at russia but at true threats . " invitation for cooperation addressing the joint press conference in prague , bush even invited skeptical russian military brass to inspect the system for themselves . " my message will be , vladimir - i call him vladimir - you should n't fear a missile defense system .
as a matter of fact , why do n't you cooperate with us on a missile defense system ? "
bush said . " why not send your generals over to see how such a system would work .
send your scientists ; let us have the ability to discuss this issue in an open forum , " he said . the increasingly tense rift between washington and moscow over the missile shield risks souring this year 's g8 talks .
putin has threatened to aim missiles at europe if the plans go ahead . escalation in rhetoric " there has been some escalation in the rhetoric .
we think that that is not helpful , " stephen hadley , us national security adviser , told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech opposition leader paroubek wants a referendum bush is due to visit poland on friday after the gathering of leaders from the world 's leading economies - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the us . his schedule in prague included talks with klaus , topolanek and opposition leader jiri paroubek that are expected to focus on the missile-shield proposal . opponents demand referendum russia has refused to accept repeated us assurances that the shield is aimed at defending against an attack from the likes of iran , which denies suspicions by the west that it is striving to create a nuclear arsenal . while klaus and topolanek have backed the plan as an opportunity for the czech republic , a former soviet satellite state , to demonstrate its nato credentials , paroubek has opposed it and demanded a referendum . hundreds of czechs had gathered in prague on monday night to protest against the u.s. plans for a missile defence shield , carrying banners that read , " shame on bush , no to base , " and , " the radar stinks of death . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shield is meant to defend against missiles from outside of europe at nato headquarters in brussels , a spokesman for the trans-atlantic alliance , james appathurai , said monday : " as far as i am aware , russia is the only country now speculating about targeting europe with missiles .

the motto of the meeting : melting ice – a hot topic ? the united nations environmental program used the occasion to release a new report entitled " the global outlook for ice and snow . "
according to the report ’ s findings , the lives of hundreds of millions of people across the world will be affected by declines in snow cover , sea ice , glaciers , permafrost and lake ice .
a collaboration of 70 researchers , the report found that the melting of snow and ice caps contributes greatly to climate change and global warming because less sunlight is being reflected back into the atmosphere .
less ice , more heat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glaciers are receding at an alarming rate " this report is about ice and snow and may to some people seem to address issues from remote and far-away places , " said achim steiner , un under-secretary general and unep executive director .
" but the report underlines that fate of the world 's snowy and icy places in a climatically challenged world should be cause for concern in every ministry , boardroom and living room across the world , " he said .
the report is a part of the ongoing international polar year , an initiative spearheaded by the international council for science and the world meteorological organization .
norway ’ s environment minister helen bjoernoey praised the report .
" this report gives us an overall picture of the changes in snow and ice cover and the consequences for human beings and nature , not only in the polar and mountainous areas , but all over the world .

sheila watt cloutier , a former president of the inuit circumpolar conference , is campaigning to raise awareness of climate change and is developing a network involving indigenous people all over the globe .
according to watt , the impact of melting ice can be seen most clearly in these arctic regions , but the effects will reach far wider , with rising sea levels and changing ocean currents .
" we are very negatively and disproportionately affected by climate change , " said cloutier .
" the melting of -lrb- the ice -rrb- is creating not only inconvenience but real issues of livelihoods that are at stake where safety and security have become a remarkable challenge for us . "
from north to south bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unep 's steiner does not see any good news the report also highlighted threats to people in non-arctic areas of the world stating that " impacts are likely to include significant changes in the availability of water supplies for drinking and agriculture , rising sea levels affecting low-lying coasts and islands . "
" melting ice and snow are also likely to increase hazards including avalanches and floods from the build-up of potentially unstable glacial lakes .
these can burst their ice and soil dams , sending walls of water down valleys , " said steiner in his remarks in tromso .

the motto of the meeting : melting ice – a hot topic ? the united nations environmental program used the occasion to release a new report entitled " the global outlook for ice and snow . "
according to the report ’ s findings , the lives of hundreds of millions of people across the world will be affected by declines in snow cover , sea ice , glaciers , permafrost and lake ice .
a collaboration of 70 researchers , the report found that the melting of snow and ice caps contributes greatly to climate change and global warming because less sunlight is being reflected back into the atmosphere .
less ice , more heat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glaciers are receding at an alarming rate " this report is about ice and snow and may to some people seem to address issues from remote and far-away places , " said achim steiner , un under-secretary general and unep executive director .
" but the report underlines that fate of the world 's snowy and icy places in a climatically challenged world should be cause for concern in every ministry , boardroom and living room across the world , " he said .
the report is a part of the ongoing international polar year , an initiative spearheaded by the international council for science and the world meteorological organization .
norway ’ s environment minister helen bjoernoey praised the report .
" this report gives us an overall picture of the changes in snow and ice cover and the consequences for human beings and nature , not only in the polar and mountainous areas , but all over the world .
to me it is particularly alarming to realize that climate change can be a reinforcing process - global warming results in further global warming " .
a hot topic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inuit hunters fear for their livelihood , and their lives for inuit and other indigenous people living in arctic regions , the rapid ice melt is a reality and a threat to their way of life .
sheila watt cloutier , a former president of the inuit circumpolar conference , is campaigning to raise awareness of climate change and is developing a network involving indigenous people all over the globe .
according to watt , the impact of melting ice can be seen most clearly in these arctic regions , but the effects will reach far wider , with rising sea levels and changing ocean currents .
" we are very negatively and disproportionately affected by climate change , " said cloutier .
" the melting of -lrb- the ice -rrb- is creating not only inconvenience but real issues of livelihoods that are at stake where safety and security have become a remarkable challenge for us . "
from north to south bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unep 's steiner does not see any good news the report also highlighted threats to people in non-arctic areas of the world stating that " impacts are likely to include significant changes in the availability of water supplies for drinking and agriculture , rising sea levels affecting low-lying coasts and islands . "
" melting ice and snow are also likely to increase hazards including avalanches and floods from the build-up of potentially unstable glacial lakes .
these can burst their ice and soil dams , sending walls of water down valleys , " said steiner in his remarks in tromso .
this year world environment day falls on the eve of the group of eight summit .

this time , we look at an international best-seller - a murder mystery with sheep as detectives . three bags full by leonie swann translated by anthea bell doubleday publishers 351 pages nearly any reader would admit that a book about a flock of sheep solving a murder mystery would lend itself to jokes about counting those sheep as one turns the pages . especially if the story starts off slowly and one is prone to spontaneous bouts of slumber - those z 's gently purring out of one 's mouth as the book gradually tilts forward , the reader nods off and images of fleecy sheep jumping over a fence loom ever larger in the mind 's eye . while reading the first chapters of leonie swann 's " three bags full " -lrb- " glennkill " in german -rrb- , this reader had to keep reminding herself that the book had become an international best-seller that had meanwhile been translated into at least 16 different languages . that fact , and the occasional bemusement at the soliloquies of the detective sheep pondering who had killed their shepherd , spurred me on , but not without resistance . puzzling idea somehow the compelling nature of their shepherd 's murder just did not come across in the initial pages of the book .
still , i read on , intrigued by how the debut novelist would depict the rest of the puzzle surrounding shepherd george glenn 's demise . after all , the setting was inviting - a hillside meadow near the irish village of glennkill , and the depth of the sheep 's outrage at finding george pinned to the ground with a spade did slowly emerge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hardcover version swann 's sheep , armed with their own literary accoutrements , deductive abilities and determination to avenge their shepherd 's death , begin tracking down the culprit .
with names like " othello " -lrb- the lead , black ram -rrb- and " miss maple " -lrb- a.k.a. " the smartest sheep in all glennkill " -rrb- , the animal protagonists already have an indirect link to murder and crime-solving . furthermore , they had developed their cognitive abilities by listening to their former shepherd george read aloud to them every afternoon when taking a break from grazing .
george 's literary tastes ranged from fairy tales to treatises on sheep diseases to trashy novels featuring red-headed heroines named " pamela . "
conveniently enough , george also once read a detective story to the sheep , so they feel adequately prepared to tackle the dirty business of crime-fighting . following their noses as they muse over the quirky behavior of human beings , the animals also apply their sharply honed sense of smell to aid them in solving the puzzle .
while swann 's countless descriptions of the sheep scenting the villagers to glean information do perhaps prompt a deeper understanding of just how animals tick , they also compose the sections of the novel that easily could have been whittled down .
the flowery depictions of the animals ' olfactory aptitude are initially amusing , and ultimately , annoying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in swann 's book , sheep have a mind of their own still , the sheep 's sense of smell gives them a straightforward approach that allows them to distinguish between the liars and truth-seekers in glennkill , among them : george 's estranged wife , the butcher , a rival shepherd , a pentecostal wallflower pining for the murdered man and george 's even more estranged daughter who returns to the village .
this ability to scent also eventually leads them to successfully , albeit indirectly , reveal george 's murderer . history of animal literary figures swann is not the first to employ animals as literary protagonists .
other smart animals carry the flag in well-known books such as george orwell 's " animal farm , " paul auster 's " timbuktu , " haruki murakami 's " kafka on the shore " or the children 's tale " charlotte 's web , " to name just a few . yet , as ian sansom wrote in the guardian , " with sheep as detectives swann solves one of the major problems in crime fiction , which is how to avoid the stereotypical jaded , cynical , alcoholic deadbeat gumshoe with relationship problems . " lending other animals in the book monikers such as " rameses , " " mopple the whale " and " satan " also helps to feed the reader 's imagination . mixed reviews some german literary critics have been harsh in their assessment of " three bags full , " with one writer in the weighty weekly die zeit wondering how swann 's " simple " language can generate a best-seller . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author leonie swann another critic in the influential daily süddeutsche zeitung imagined a clever talk between a literary agent and a prospective author that targeted cute sheep in narrative as harbingers of massive book sales . denis scheck , a prominent german literary critic , was kinder , calling the acquaintance with swann 's glennkill sheep a " real pleasure . " " three bags full " is a bit strange , but , as sansom wrote , it is also affecting .
if you can get over the initial slow pace of the book and a personal unwillingness to accept sheep as anything but dull , you will enjoy an occasional chuckle or smirk as you read on the train and glance up every now and then at your fellow commuters . ultimately , swann 's book offers readers perhaps less of a new take on how we perceive animals , and more of one on how they perceive us . it 's a lightly philosophical summer read , with the paperback edition due out at the beginning of july . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the announcement was on monday made in both german and english to the globalization opponents at the encampment located 10 kilometers -lrb- about 6 miles -rrb- south of the resort hotel where world leaders are scheduled to meet on wednesday .

peaceful protestors harbor extremists " we 've seen that they 've set up barricades so that the press and police ca n't drive through , " said gabi baumgart , a manager at a window company whose office borders the encampment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 05.06.2007 book review : clever sheep solve a murder mystery großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a good summer read occasionally , dw-world.de brings you reviews of some of the latest german books being published in english .
this time , we look at an international best-seller - a murder mystery with sheep as detectives . three bags full by leonie swann translated by anthea bell doubleday publishers 351 pages nearly any reader would admit that a book about a flock of sheep solving a murder mystery would lend itself to jokes about counting those sheep as one turns the pages . especially if the story starts off slowly and one is prone to spontaneous bouts of slumber - those z 's gently purring out of one 's mouth as the book gradually tilts forward , the reader nods off and images of fleecy sheep jumping over a fence loom ever larger in the mind 's eye . while reading the first chapters of leonie swann 's " three bags full " -lrb- " glennkill " in german -rrb- , this reader had to keep reminding herself that the book had become an international best-seller that had meanwhile been translated into at least 16 different languages . that fact , and the occasional bemusement at the soliloquies of the detective sheep pondering who had killed their shepherd , spurred me on , but not without resistance . puzzling idea somehow the compelling nature of their shepherd 's murder just did not come across in the initial pages of the book .
still , i read on , intrigued by how the debut novelist would depict the rest of the puzzle surrounding shepherd george glenn 's demise . after all , the setting was inviting - a hillside meadow near the irish village of glennkill , and the depth of the sheep 's outrage at finding george pinned to the ground with a spade did slowly emerge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hardcover version swann 's sheep , armed with their own literary accoutrements , deductive abilities and determination to avenge their shepherd 's death , begin tracking down the culprit .
with names like " othello " -lrb- the lead , black ram -rrb- and " miss maple " -lrb- a.k.a. " the smartest sheep in all glennkill " -rrb- , the animal protagonists already have an indirect link to murder and crime-solving . furthermore , they had developed their cognitive abilities by listening to their former shepherd george read aloud to them every afternoon when taking a break from grazing .
george 's literary tastes ranged from fairy tales to treatises on sheep diseases to trashy novels featuring red-headed heroines named " pamela . "
conveniently enough , george also once read a detective story to the sheep , so they feel adequately prepared to tackle the dirty business of crime-fighting . following their noses as they muse over the quirky behavior of human beings , the animals also apply their sharply honed sense of smell to aid them in solving the puzzle .
while swann 's countless descriptions of the sheep scenting the villagers to glean information do perhaps prompt a deeper understanding of just how animals tick , they also compose the sections of the novel that easily could have been whittled down .
the flowery depictions of the animals ' olfactory aptitude are initially amusing , and ultimately , annoying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in swann 's book , sheep have a mind of their own still , the sheep 's sense of smell gives them a straightforward approach that allows them to distinguish between the liars and truth-seekers in glennkill , among them : george 's estranged wife , the butcher , a rival shepherd , a pentecostal wallflower pining for the murdered man and george 's even more estranged daughter who returns to the village .
this ability to scent also eventually leads them to successfully , albeit indirectly , reveal george 's murderer . history of animal literary figures swann is not the first to employ animals as literary protagonists .
other smart animals carry the flag in well-known books such as george orwell 's " animal farm , " paul auster 's " timbuktu , " haruki murakami 's " kafka on the shore " or the children 's tale " charlotte 's web , " to name just a few . yet , as ian sansom wrote in the guardian , " with sheep as detectives swann solves one of the major problems in crime fiction , which is how to avoid the stereotypical jaded , cynical , alcoholic deadbeat gumshoe with relationship problems . " lending other animals in the book monikers such as " rameses , " " mopple the whale " and " satan " also helps to feed the reader 's imagination . mixed reviews some german literary critics have been harsh in their assessment of " three bags full , " with one writer in the weighty weekly die zeit wondering how swann 's " simple " language can generate a best-seller . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author leonie swann another critic in the influential daily süddeutsche zeitung imagined a clever talk between a literary agent and a prospective author that targeted cute sheep in narrative as harbingers of massive book sales . denis scheck , a prominent german literary critic , was kinder , calling the acquaintance with swann 's glennkill sheep a " real pleasure . " " three bags full " is a bit strange , but , as sansom wrote , it is also affecting .
if you can get over the initial slow pace of the book and a personal unwillingness to accept sheep as anything but dull , you will enjoy an occasional chuckle or smirk as you read on the train and glance up every now and then at your fellow commuters . ultimately , swann 's book offers readers perhaps less of a new take on how we perceive animals , and more of one on how they perceive us . it 's a lightly philosophical summer read , with the paperback edition due out at the beginning of july . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

chief negotiators of the world 's leading industrial nations are meeting in berlin on tuesday in a last-ditch effort to remove obstacles threatening to derail a g8 deal on climate change . german chancellor angela merkel , whose country holds the current presidency of the g8 , wants this week 's summit participants in heiligendamm to agree to set long-term goals to cut greenhouse gas emissions . but she faces opposition from us president george w. bush , who wants to convene a global summit that includes a new generation of polluters from the developing world such as china , india and brazil . germany wants the g8 to agree to cut greenhouse gas emissions to 50 per cent below 1990 levels by the year 2050 in order to ensure that the world 's average temperature increase due to global warming does not exceed two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degree fahrenheit -rrb- . a new kyoto bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the talks are taking place far away from the g8 protests germany wants this to form the framework for a new united nations protocol on climate change to replace the kyoto agreement when it expires in 2012 . merkel won backing from british premier tony blair , although she appears to be less optimistic that a landmark deal will be reached at the summit to cover the post-kyoto period . " at the g8 we need to agree the elements of a future framework , " blair told parliamentarians in the german capital on sunday .
" this would allow the un talks to accelerate and reach earlier agreement so that we have a framework for kyoto in place by 2009 . " the bush plan last week bush called for about 15 countries that account for the bulk of greenhouse-gas emissions , including the us , to meet later this year for talks on a " long-term global goal " for cutting emissions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush supports voluntary cuts in emissions the us has acknowledged that climate change is a serious problem caused by humans that requires action - though , in the us , only through voluntary steps . the role of china , which is not a member of the g8 , is crucial , as many experts believe it could overtake the united states this year as the world 's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases . china on monday issued its own plan for responding to global climate change but urged developed nations to take the lead and allow poorer nations to focus on economic development . at the same time , japan said it would use the g8 to launch an aid program for developing countries that would encourage them to fight global warming as well as pollution and poverty . bush versus merkel ? merkel , who has made the fight against global warming a key issue of germany 's g8 presidency , is scheduled to have lunch with bush immediately before the start of the g8 summit on wednesday . there has been a mixed reaction to the president 's call for global warming talks with a select group of polluter nations .
but it was not meant to sideline broader un discussions on climate change , us national security advisor stephen hadley said last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with or without bush , merkel is pushing global climate reform " it is an effort to try and find consensus on the way ahead , " he said ahead of the g8 summit grouping the us , canada , germany , japan , france , britain , italy and russia . " this week presents an opportunity to turn mr. bush 's newfound interest in climate change into a commitment to do something about it soon , " britain 's observer newspaper said in an editorial . merkel , who was to meet with canadian prime minister stephen harper on monday evening and japanese premier shinzo abe on tuesday , said she was confident the pre-summit talks would lead to " important steps " being agreed upon . " we will fight until the very last moment for concrete wording , " government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said in reference to the final communiqué to be issued by the end of the week . dw staff / dpa -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

statehood for kosovo is the latest . climate change and aid to africa have long been on the agenda for the g8 summit which kicks off on wednesday in heiligendamm on the north-eastern german coast . but the gathering of rich industrial nations that includes russia threatens to be overshadowed by divisions within the club from an unexpected source : kosovo . the tiny autonomous province in serbia , which is under un administration , has n't grabbed banner headlines since 1999 , when us-led air strikes forced out slobodan milosevic 's marauding army .
but that 's mainly because nato 's huge international contingent has kept the peace . territorial and ethnic tensions in the remains of the former yugoslavia are still simmering below the surface , and now with the un road map for kosovo 's independence from serbia on the table , the western powers want to finally put the last chapter of the balkans saga to bed . the world 's political powers meeting at the group of eight summit this week in germany should decide whether the un security council should proceed with a draft resolution dealing with the future of kosovo , the council president said monday . " we 'll see how the situation will evolve , " said belgium 's un ambassador johan verbeke .
" for the time being , it 's a wait-and-see period ; it 's a question of days , not weeks . " verbeke , whose country holds the rotating council presidency for june , said once the eight world leaders give the go-ahead , he will put the kosovo issue on the council 's monthly agenda .
he said the decision also belongs to capitals of 15 countries on the council .
bildunterschrift : rice -lrb- second from right -rrb- and lavrov -lrb- second from left -rrb- exchanged barbs over missile defense and kosovo russian opposition at last week 's foreign ministers meeting in potsdam - best known as the venue for the postwar meeting of us , british and soviet leaders - the cold war lines between europe and united states on one side , and russia on the other , were clearly drawn again . us secretary of state condoleezza rice and russian foreign minister sergey lavrov not only exchanged barbs about moscow 's opposition to plans for us anti-missile shield installations in poland and the czech republic , but also over the future status of kosovo . lavrov denounced the plan drawn up by un special envoy martti ahtisaari , which seeks to transfer custody of the overwhelmingly ethnic albanian province to the eu in the transitional period to nationhood .
the plan was approved by the parliament in kosovo , but rejected by the autonomous region 's serb minority and belgrade . the kremlin 's adamant opposition took the western allies by surprise , although lavrov stopped short of saying that russia would exercise its veto power in the un 's security council . one expert says the reasons moscow is supporting a fellow slavic state are complicated and need to be understood within the broad scope of russia 's relations with the eu and us . russian resurgence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patience for independance in kosovo is wearing thin " russia has no leverage over the balkan states and knows it .
there 's no way that russia could stop the ahtisaari plan if the west stands united in favor of it .
its veto power in the security council is symbolic .
after all the us invaded iraq without a un mandate , " said alexander rahr , program director for russia at the german council on foreign relations . " the russians are putting up a front .
they have their national pride , and do n't want to be seen as a junior partner of the west .
remember they were humiliated back in the 1990s , " said rahr , referring to a time when an economically weak and chaotic russia that had emerged from communism was unable to protect its serb ally in the war that nato waged without un authorization . " now the russians have got oil money , " added rahr , who explained that the windfall from its energy exports and increasing strategic importance because of it has led to a new assertiveness in president vladimir putin 's dealings with the west . besides russia has a point in pushing the conflicting parties - ethnic albanians and christian serbs - to work out their own lasting compromise , which could be preferable to the great powers imposing a nation-state from above , according to rahr . need to win over the serbs " the serbs wo n't agree to kosovo 's independence today , but who says they ca n't be won over in say , two years time ?
young serbs are not all nationalistic .
you need to win them over , make them european .
we in the eu made the mistake of not inviting serbia to join us , " he said . another concern shared by moscow and other countries is the precedent a un resolution would set , giving impetus to independence movements elsewhere , such as the basques in spain , kurds in turkey and the chechens in russia .

" kosovo is part of a host of issues - energy security , missile defense , human rights - that putin has used to wreak havoc , to divide the eu from within and split the eu and us , " said julianne smith , director of the europe program at the center for strategic and international studies in washington . " if the ahtisaari plan falls off the table , we could see instability and violence again in the balkans , which is not in russia 's interest either , " said smith , who explained that keeping the issue of kosovo 's independence on the back burner risks creating a backlash among the albanian kosovars , whose patience is wearing thin after seven years as a ward of the united nations . " kosovo is a tinderbox , and it wo n't take much to reignite it .

chief negotiators of the world 's leading industrial nations are meeting in berlin on tuesday in a last-ditch effort to remove obstacles threatening to derail a g8 deal on climate change . german chancellor angela merkel , whose country holds the current presidency of the g8 , wants this week 's summit participants in heiligendamm to agree to set long-term goals to cut greenhouse gas emissions . but she faces opposition from us president george w. bush , who wants to convene a global summit that includes a new generation of polluters from the developing world such as china , india and brazil . germany wants the g8 to agree to cut greenhouse gas emissions to 50 per cent below 1990 levels by the year 2050 in order to ensure that the world 's average temperature increase due to global warming does not exceed two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degree fahrenheit -rrb- . a new kyoto bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the talks are taking place far away from the g8 protests germany wants this to form the framework for a new united nations protocol on climate change to replace the kyoto agreement when it expires in 2012 . merkel won backing from british premier tony blair , although she appears to be less optimistic that a landmark deal will be reached at the summit to cover the post-kyoto period . " at the g8 we need to agree the elements of a future framework , " blair told parliamentarians in the german capital on sunday .
" this would allow the un talks to accelerate and reach earlier agreement so that we have a framework for kyoto in place by 2009 . " the bush plan last week bush called for about 15 countries that account for the bulk of greenhouse-gas emissions , including the us , to meet later this year for talks on a " long-term global goal " for cutting emissions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush supports voluntary cuts in emissions the us has acknowledged that climate change is a serious problem caused by humans that requires action - though , in the us , only through voluntary steps . the role of china , which is not a member of the g8 , is crucial , as many experts believe it could overtake the united states this year as the world 's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases . china on monday issued its own plan for responding to global climate change but urged developed nations to take the lead and allow poorer nations to focus on economic development . at the same time , japan said it would use the g8 to launch an aid program for developing countries that would encourage them to fight global warming as well as pollution and poverty . bush versus merkel ? merkel , who has made the fight against global warming a key issue of germany 's g8 presidency , is scheduled to have lunch with bush immediately before the start of the g8 summit on wednesday . there has been a mixed reaction to the president 's call for global warming talks with a select group of polluter nations .
but it was not meant to sideline broader un discussions on climate change , us national security advisor stephen hadley said last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with or without bush , merkel is pushing global climate reform " it is an effort to try and find consensus on the way ahead , " he said ahead of the g8 summit grouping the us , canada , germany , japan , france , britain , italy and russia . " this week presents an opportunity to turn mr. bush 's newfound interest in climate change into a commitment to do something about it soon , " britain 's observer newspaper said in an editorial . merkel , who was to meet with canadian prime minister stephen harper on monday evening and japanese premier shinzo abe on tuesday , said she was confident the pre-summit talks would lead to " important steps " being agreed upon . " we will fight until the very last moment for concrete wording , " government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said in reference to the final communiqué to be issued by the end of the week . dw staff / dpa -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

statehood for kosovo is the latest . climate change and aid to africa have long been on the agenda for the g8 summit which kicks off on wednesday in heiligendamm on the north-eastern german coast . but the gathering of rich industrial nations that includes russia threatens to be overshadowed by divisions within the club from an unexpected source : kosovo . the tiny autonomous province in serbia , which is under un administration , has n't grabbed banner headlines since 1999 , when us-led air strikes forced out slobodan milosevic 's marauding army .
but that 's mainly because nato 's huge international contingent has kept the peace . territorial and ethnic tensions in the remains of the former yugoslavia are still simmering below the surface , and now with the un road map for kosovo 's independence from serbia on the table , the western powers want to finally put the last chapter of the balkans saga to bed . the world 's political powers meeting at the group of eight summit this week in germany should decide whether the un security council should proceed with a draft resolution dealing with the future of kosovo , the council president said monday . " we 'll see how the situation will evolve , " said belgium 's un ambassador johan verbeke .
" for the time being , it 's a wait-and-see period ; it 's a question of days , not weeks . " verbeke , whose country holds the rotating council presidency for june , said once the eight world leaders give the go-ahead , he will put the kosovo issue on the council 's monthly agenda .
he said the decision also belongs to capitals of 15 countries on the council .
bildunterschrift : rice -lrb- second from right -rrb- and lavrov -lrb- second from left -rrb- exchanged barbs over missile defense and kosovo russian opposition at last week 's foreign ministers meeting in potsdam - best known as the venue for the postwar meeting of us , british and soviet leaders - the cold war lines between europe and united states on one side , and russia on the other , were clearly drawn again . us secretary of state condoleezza rice and russian foreign minister sergey lavrov not only exchanged barbs about moscow 's opposition to plans for us anti-missile shield installations in poland and the czech republic , but also over the future status of kosovo . lavrov denounced the plan drawn up by un special envoy martti ahtisaari , which seeks to transfer custody of the overwhelmingly ethnic albanian province to the eu in the transitional period to nationhood .
the plan was approved by the parliament in kosovo , but rejected by the autonomous region 's serb minority and belgrade . the kremlin 's adamant opposition took the western allies by surprise , although lavrov stopped short of saying that russia would exercise its veto power in the un 's security council . one expert says the reasons moscow is supporting a fellow slavic state are complicated and need to be understood within the broad scope of russia 's relations with the eu and us . russian resurgence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patience for independance in kosovo is wearing thin " russia has no leverage over the balkan states and knows it .
there 's no way that russia could stop the ahtisaari plan if the west stands united in favor of it .
its veto power in the security council is symbolic .
after all the us invaded iraq without a un mandate , " said alexander rahr , program director for russia at the german council on foreign relations . " the russians are putting up a front .
they have their national pride , and do n't want to be seen as a junior partner of the west .
remember they were humiliated back in the 1990s , " said rahr , referring to a time when an economically weak and chaotic russia that had emerged from communism was unable to protect its serb ally in the war that nato waged without un authorization . " now the russians have got oil money , " added rahr , who explained that the windfall from its energy exports and increasing strategic importance because of it has led to a new assertiveness in president vladimir putin 's dealings with the west . besides russia has a point in pushing the conflicting parties - ethnic albanians and christian serbs - to work out their own lasting compromise , which could be preferable to the great powers imposing a nation-state from above , according to rahr . need to win over the serbs " the serbs wo n't agree to kosovo 's independence today , but who says they ca n't be won over in say , two years time ?
young serbs are not all nationalistic .
you need to win them over , make them european .
we in the eu made the mistake of not inviting serbia to join us , " he said . another concern shared by moscow and other countries is the precedent a un resolution would set , giving impetus to independence movements elsewhere , such as the basques in spain , kurds in turkey and the chechens in russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un plan named after martti ahtisaari has eu and us support other specialists say , however , that vladimir putin 's motivation for isolating russia against the eu and us on the kosovo issue is a puzzle , since he is not running for reelection when his term expires in 2008 and , with high domestic approval ratings anyway , he does not need to pander to an electorate at home . ever a tinderbox ? " kosovo is part of a host of issues - energy security , missile defense , human rights - that putin has used to wreak havoc , to divide the eu from within and split the eu and us , " said julianne smith , director of the europe program at the center for strategic and international studies in washington . " if the ahtisaari plan falls off the table , we could see instability and violence again in the balkans , which is not in russia 's interest either , " said smith , who explained that keeping the issue of kosovo 's independence on the back burner risks creating a backlash among the albanian kosovars , whose patience is wearing thin after seven years as a ward of the united nations . " kosovo is a tinderbox , and it wo n't take much to reignite it .
there is no other possible solution -lrb- to the ahtisaari plan -rrb- .
these two sides -lrb- serbs and albanian kosovars -rrb- will never come together , " said smith . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many blame police for recent violence .
deutsche welle visited the demonstrators ' camp as they continue their campaign , seemingly at any cost . " training starts today at 12:00 at the information center . "
the announcement was on monday made in both german and english to the globalization opponents at the encampment located 10 kilometers -lrb- about 6 miles -rrb- south of the resort hotel where world leaders are scheduled to meet on wednesday .
in this case , " training " means preparing the demonstrators for blockades that are intended to massively disrupt the group of eight summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meet here for blockade training ready to break the law " it 's about active resistance , " said activist alex kristow from press group kempinski .
" we 've always said that it 's necessary to break the law in some situations in order to make people aware of major problems like neo-liberal globalization .
" it 's not enough to march through the streets carrying a sign , " continued kristow .
" we claim the right to block a street so that delegations who want to go to this summit ca n't get through . "
after demonstrations turned into violent riots in rostock on saturday , many of the demonstrators expect police to raid the camps in order to weed out potentially violent activists before the summit begins .
preparing for police raid " we believe that the police are trying to reduce the number of participants in coming protests by storming the camp and arresting the offenders from the last demonstrations , " said marius kürten , who traveled to the event from speyer in south-western germany .
" we 're going to mobilize the entire camp against the police . "
at the entrance to the camp , a banner has been raised with a message to the police : " you 're on call - we 're having fun . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peace ?
the relaxing music in the camp belies the tense mood .

many blame police for recent violence .
deutsche welle visited the demonstrators ' camp as they continue their campaign , seemingly at any cost . " training starts today at 12:00 at the information center . "
the announcement was on monday made in both german and english to the globalization opponents at the encampment located 10 kilometers -lrb- about 6 miles -rrb- south of the resort hotel where world leaders are scheduled to meet on wednesday .
in this case , " training " means preparing the demonstrators for blockades that are intended to massively disrupt the group of eight summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meet here for blockade training ready to break the law " it 's about active resistance , " said activist alex kristow from press group kempinski .
" we 've always said that it 's necessary to break the law in some situations in order to make people aware of major problems like neo-liberal globalization .
" it 's not enough to march through the streets carrying a sign , " continued kristow .
" we claim the right to block a street so that delegations who want to go to this summit ca n't get through . "
after demonstrations turned into violent riots in rostock on saturday , many of the demonstrators expect police to raid the camps in order to weed out potentially violent activists before the summit begins .
preparing for police raid " we believe that the police are trying to reduce the number of participants in coming protests by storming the camp and arresting the offenders from the last demonstrations , " said marius kürten , who traveled to the event from speyer in south-western germany .
" we 're going to mobilize the entire camp against the police . "
at the entrance to the camp , a banner has been raised with a message to the police : " you 're on call - we 're having fun . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peace ?
the relaxing music in the camp belies the tense mood .
the stretch of tents - roughly the size of three soccer fields - is seen as occupied territory off-limits to security forces .
police have parked their buses and set up headquarters some distance away , at the intersection leading to the camp entrance .
peaceful protestors harbor extremists " we 've seen that they 've set up barricades so that the press and police ca n't drive through , " said gabi baumgart , a manager at a window company whose office borders the encampment .

after demonstrations turned into violent riots in rostock on saturday , many of the demonstrators expect police to raid the camps in order to weed out potentially violent activists before the summit begins .
preparing for police raid " we believe that the police are trying to reduce the number of participants in coming protests by storming the camp and arresting the offenders from the last demonstrations , " said marius kürten , who traveled to the event from speyer in south-western germany .

chief negotiators of the world 's leading industrial nations are meeting in berlin on tuesday in a last-ditch effort to remove obstacles threatening to derail a g8 deal on climate change . german chancellor angela merkel , whose country holds the current presidency of the g8 , wants this week 's summit participants in heiligendamm to agree to set long-term goals to cut greenhouse gas emissions . but she faces opposition from us president george w. bush , who wants to convene a global summit that includes a new generation of polluters from the developing world such as china , india and brazil . germany wants the g8 to agree to cut greenhouse gas emissions to 50 per cent below 1990 levels by the year 2050 in order to ensure that the world 's average temperature increase due to global warming does not exceed two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degree fahrenheit -rrb- . a new kyoto bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the talks are taking place far away from the g8 protests germany wants this to form the framework for a new united nations protocol on climate change to replace the kyoto agreement when it expires in 2012 . merkel won backing from british premier tony blair , although she appears to be less optimistic that a landmark deal will be reached at the summit to cover the post-kyoto period . " at the g8 we need to agree the elements of a future framework , " blair told parliamentarians in the german capital on sunday .
" this would allow the un talks to accelerate and reach earlier agreement so that we have a framework for kyoto in place by 2009 . " the bush plan last week bush called for about 15 countries that account for the bulk of greenhouse-gas emissions , including the us , to meet later this year for talks on a " long-term global goal " for cutting emissions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush supports voluntary cuts in emissions the us has acknowledged that climate change is a serious problem caused by humans that requires action - though , in the us , only through voluntary steps . the role of china , which is not a member of the g8 , is crucial , as many experts believe it could overtake the united states this year as the world 's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases . china on monday issued its own plan for responding to global climate change but urged developed nations to take the lead and allow poorer nations to focus on economic development . at the same time , japan said it would use the g8 to launch an aid program for developing countries that would encourage them to fight global warming as well as pollution and poverty . bush versus merkel ? merkel , who has made the fight against global warming a key issue of germany 's g8 presidency , is scheduled to have lunch with bush immediately before the start of the g8 summit on wednesday . there has been a mixed reaction to the president 's call for global warming talks with a select group of polluter nations .
but it was not meant to sideline broader un discussions on climate change , us national security advisor stephen hadley said last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with or without bush , merkel is pushing global climate reform " it is an effort to try and find consensus on the way ahead , " he said ahead of the g8 summit grouping the us , canada , germany , japan , france , britain , italy and russia . " this week presents an opportunity to turn mr. bush 's newfound interest in climate change into a commitment to do something about it soon , " britain 's observer newspaper said in an editorial . merkel , who was to meet with canadian prime minister stephen harper on monday evening and japanese premier shinzo abe on tuesday , said she was confident the pre-summit talks would lead to " important steps " being agreed upon . " we will fight until the very last moment for concrete wording , " government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said in reference to the final communiqué to be issued by the end of the week . dw staff / dpa -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 05.06.2007 kosovo question contributes to eu-russia troubles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un and nato have kept the peace in kosovo a us anti-missile defense system , pipeline politics , polish meat , press freedom and iran policy have all been issues in the disputes between the west and russia ahead of the g8 summit .
statehood for kosovo is the latest . climate change and aid to africa have long been on the agenda for the g8 summit which kicks off on wednesday in heiligendamm on the north-eastern german coast . but the gathering of rich industrial nations that includes russia threatens to be overshadowed by divisions within the club from an unexpected source : kosovo . the tiny autonomous province in serbia , which is under un administration , has n't grabbed banner headlines since 1999 , when us-led air strikes forced out slobodan milosevic 's marauding army .
but that 's mainly because nato 's huge international contingent has kept the peace . territorial and ethnic tensions in the remains of the former yugoslavia are still simmering below the surface , and now with the un road map for kosovo 's independence from serbia on the table , the western powers want to finally put the last chapter of the balkans saga to bed . the world 's political powers meeting at the group of eight summit this week in germany should decide whether the un security council should proceed with a draft resolution dealing with the future of kosovo , the council president said monday . " we 'll see how the situation will evolve , " said belgium 's un ambassador johan verbeke .
" for the time being , it 's a wait-and-see period ; it 's a question of days , not weeks . " verbeke , whose country holds the rotating council presidency for june , said once the eight world leaders give the go-ahead , he will put the kosovo issue on the council 's monthly agenda .
he said the decision also belongs to capitals of 15 countries on the council .
bildunterschrift : rice -lrb- second from right -rrb- and lavrov -lrb- second from left -rrb- exchanged barbs over missile defense and kosovo russian opposition at last week 's foreign ministers meeting in potsdam - best known as the venue for the postwar meeting of us , british and soviet leaders - the cold war lines between europe and united states on one side , and russia on the other , were clearly drawn again . us secretary of state condoleezza rice and russian foreign minister sergey lavrov not only exchanged barbs about moscow 's opposition to plans for us anti-missile shield installations in poland and the czech republic , but also over the future status of kosovo . lavrov denounced the plan drawn up by un special envoy martti ahtisaari , which seeks to transfer custody of the overwhelmingly ethnic albanian province to the eu in the transitional period to nationhood .
the plan was approved by the parliament in kosovo , but rejected by the autonomous region 's serb minority and belgrade . the kremlin 's adamant opposition took the western allies by surprise , although lavrov stopped short of saying that russia would exercise its veto power in the un 's security council . one expert says the reasons moscow is supporting a fellow slavic state are complicated and need to be understood within the broad scope of russia 's relations with the eu and us . russian resurgence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patience for independance in kosovo is wearing thin " russia has no leverage over the balkan states and knows it .
there 's no way that russia could stop the ahtisaari plan if the west stands united in favor of it .
its veto power in the security council is symbolic .
after all the us invaded iraq without a un mandate , " said alexander rahr , program director for russia at the german council on foreign relations . " the russians are putting up a front .
they have their national pride , and do n't want to be seen as a junior partner of the west .
remember they were humiliated back in the 1990s , " said rahr , referring to a time when an economically weak and chaotic russia that had emerged from communism was unable to protect its serb ally in the war that nato waged without un authorization . " now the russians have got oil money , " added rahr , who explained that the windfall from its energy exports and increasing strategic importance because of it has led to a new assertiveness in president vladimir putin 's dealings with the west . besides russia has a point in pushing the conflicting parties - ethnic albanians and christian serbs - to work out their own lasting compromise , which could be preferable to the great powers imposing a nation-state from above , according to rahr . need to win over the serbs " the serbs wo n't agree to kosovo 's independence today , but who says they ca n't be won over in say , two years time ?
young serbs are not all nationalistic .
you need to win them over , make them european .
we in the eu made the mistake of not inviting serbia to join us , " he said . another concern shared by moscow and other countries is the precedent a un resolution would set , giving impetus to independence movements elsewhere , such as the basques in spain , kurds in turkey and the chechens in russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un plan named after martti ahtisaari has eu and us support other specialists say , however , that vladimir putin 's motivation for isolating russia against the eu and us on the kosovo issue is a puzzle , since he is not running for reelection when his term expires in 2008 and , with high domestic approval ratings anyway , he does not need to pander to an electorate at home . ever a tinderbox ? " kosovo is part of a host of issues - energy security , missile defense , human rights - that putin has used to wreak havoc , to divide the eu from within and split the eu and us , " said julianne smith , director of the europe program at the center for strategic and international studies in washington .

chief negotiators of the world 's leading industrial nations are meeting in berlin on tuesday in a last-ditch effort to remove obstacles threatening to derail a g8 deal on climate change . german chancellor angela merkel , whose country holds the current presidency of the g8 , wants this week 's summit participants in heiligendamm to agree to set long-term goals to cut greenhouse gas emissions . but she faces opposition from us president george w. bush , who wants to convene a global summit that includes a new generation of polluters from the developing world such as china , india and brazil . germany wants the g8 to agree to cut greenhouse gas emissions to 50 per cent below 1990 levels by the year 2050 in order to ensure that the world 's average temperature increase due to global warming does not exceed two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degree fahrenheit -rrb- . a new kyoto bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the talks are taking place far away from the g8 protests germany wants this to form the framework for a new united nations protocol on climate change to replace the kyoto agreement when it expires in 2012 . merkel won backing from british premier tony blair , although she appears to be less optimistic that a landmark deal will be reached at the summit to cover the post-kyoto period . " at the g8 we need to agree the elements of a future framework , " blair told parliamentarians in the german capital on sunday .
" this would allow the un talks to accelerate and reach earlier agreement so that we have a framework for kyoto in place by 2009 . " the bush plan last week bush called for about 15 countries that account for the bulk of greenhouse-gas emissions , including the us , to meet later this year for talks on a " long-term global goal " for cutting emissions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush supports voluntary cuts in emissions the us has acknowledged that climate change is a serious problem caused by humans that requires action - though , in the us , only through voluntary steps . the role of china , which is not a member of the g8 , is crucial , as many experts believe it could overtake the united states this year as the world 's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases . china on monday issued its own plan for responding to global climate change but urged developed nations to take the lead and allow poorer nations to focus on economic development . at the same time , japan said it would use the g8 to launch an aid program for developing countries that would encourage them to fight global warming as well as pollution and poverty . bush versus merkel ? merkel , who has made the fight against global warming a key issue of germany 's g8 presidency , is scheduled to have lunch with bush immediately before the start of the g8 summit on wednesday . there has been a mixed reaction to the president 's call for global warming talks with a select group of polluter nations .
but it was not meant to sideline broader un discussions on climate change , us national security advisor stephen hadley said last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with or without bush , merkel is pushing global climate reform " it is an effort to try and find consensus on the way ahead , " he said ahead of the g8 summit grouping the us , canada , germany , japan , france , britain , italy and russia . " this week presents an opportunity to turn mr. bush 's newfound interest in climate change into a commitment to do something about it soon , " britain 's observer newspaper said in an editorial . merkel , who was to meet with canadian prime minister stephen harper on monday evening and japanese premier shinzo abe on tuesday , said she was confident the pre-summit talks would lead to " important steps " being agreed upon . " we will fight until the very last moment for concrete wording , " government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said in reference to the final communiqué to be issued by the end of the week . dw staff / dpa -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this time , we look at an international best-seller - a murder mystery with sheep as detectives . three bags full by leonie swann translated by anthea bell doubleday publishers 351 pages nearly any reader would admit that a book about a flock of sheep solving a murder mystery would lend itself to jokes about counting those sheep as one turns the pages . especially if the story starts off slowly and one is prone to spontaneous bouts of slumber - those z 's gently purring out of one 's mouth as the book gradually tilts forward , the reader nods off and images of fleecy sheep jumping over a fence loom ever larger in the mind 's eye . while reading the first chapters of leonie swann 's " three bags full " -lrb- " glennkill " in german -rrb- , this reader had to keep reminding herself that the book had become an international best-seller that had meanwhile been translated into at least 16 different languages . that fact , and the occasional bemusement at the soliloquies of the detective sheep pondering who had killed their shepherd , spurred me on , but not without resistance . puzzling idea somehow the compelling nature of their shepherd 's murder just did not come across in the initial pages of the book .
still , i read on , intrigued by how the debut novelist would depict the rest of the puzzle surrounding shepherd george glenn 's demise . after all , the setting was inviting - a hillside meadow near the irish village of glennkill , and the depth of the sheep 's outrage at finding george pinned to the ground with a spade did slowly emerge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hardcover version swann 's sheep , armed with their own literary accoutrements , deductive abilities and determination to avenge their shepherd 's death , begin tracking down the culprit .
with names like " othello " -lrb- the lead , black ram -rrb- and " miss maple " -lrb- a.k.a. " the smartest sheep in all glennkill " -rrb- , the animal protagonists already have an indirect link to murder and crime-solving . furthermore , they had developed their cognitive abilities by listening to their former shepherd george read aloud to them every afternoon when taking a break from grazing .
george 's literary tastes ranged from fairy tales to treatises on sheep diseases to trashy novels featuring red-headed heroines named " pamela . "
conveniently enough , george also once read a detective story to the sheep , so they feel adequately prepared to tackle the dirty business of crime-fighting . following their noses as they muse over the quirky behavior of human beings , the animals also apply their sharply honed sense of smell to aid them in solving the puzzle .
while swann 's countless descriptions of the sheep scenting the villagers to glean information do perhaps prompt a deeper understanding of just how animals tick , they also compose the sections of the novel that easily could have been whittled down .
the flowery depictions of the animals ' olfactory aptitude are initially amusing , and ultimately , annoying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in swann 's book , sheep have a mind of their own still , the sheep 's sense of smell gives them a straightforward approach that allows them to distinguish between the liars and truth-seekers in glennkill , among them : george 's estranged wife , the butcher , a rival shepherd , a pentecostal wallflower pining for the murdered man and george 's even more estranged daughter who returns to the village .
this ability to scent also eventually leads them to successfully , albeit indirectly , reveal george 's murderer . history of animal literary figures swann is not the first to employ animals as literary protagonists .
other smart animals carry the flag in well-known books such as george orwell 's " animal farm , " paul auster 's " timbuktu , " haruki murakami 's " kafka on the shore " or the children 's tale " charlotte 's web , " to name just a few . yet , as ian sansom wrote in the guardian , " with sheep as detectives swann solves one of the major problems in crime fiction , which is how to avoid the stereotypical jaded , cynical , alcoholic deadbeat gumshoe with relationship problems . " lending other animals in the book monikers such as " rameses , " " mopple the whale " and " satan " also helps to feed the reader 's imagination . mixed reviews some german literary critics have been harsh in their assessment of " three bags full , " with one writer in the weighty weekly die zeit wondering how swann 's " simple " language can generate a best-seller . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author leonie swann another critic in the influential daily süddeutsche zeitung imagined a clever talk between a literary agent and a prospective author that targeted cute sheep in narrative as harbingers of massive book sales . denis scheck , a prominent german literary critic , was kinder , calling the acquaintance with swann 's glennkill sheep a " real pleasure .

if you can get over the initial slow pace of the book and a personal unwillingness to accept sheep as anything but dull , you will enjoy an occasional chuckle or smirk as you read on the train and glance up every now and then at your fellow commuters . ultimately , swann 's book offers readers perhaps less of a new take on how we perceive animals , and more of one on how they perceive us . it 's a lightly philosophical summer read , with the paperback edition due out at the beginning of july . louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this time , we look at an international best-seller - a murder mystery with sheep as detectives . three bags full by leonie swann translated by anthea bell doubleday publishers 351 pages nearly any reader would admit that a book about a flock of sheep solving a murder mystery would lend itself to jokes about counting those sheep as one turns the pages . especially if the story starts off slowly and one is prone to spontaneous bouts of slumber - those z 's gently purring out of one 's mouth as the book gradually tilts forward , the reader nods off and images of fleecy sheep jumping over a fence loom ever larger in the mind 's eye . while reading the first chapters of leonie swann 's " three bags full " -lrb- " glennkill " in german -rrb- , this reader had to keep reminding herself that the book had become an international best-seller that had meanwhile been translated into at least 16 different languages . that fact , and the occasional bemusement at the soliloquies of the detective sheep pondering who had killed their shepherd , spurred me on , but not without resistance . puzzling idea somehow the compelling nature of their shepherd 's murder just did not come across in the initial pages of the book .
still , i read on , intrigued by how the debut novelist would depict the rest of the puzzle surrounding shepherd george glenn 's demise . after all , the setting was inviting - a hillside meadow near the irish village of glennkill , and the depth of the sheep 's outrage at finding george pinned to the ground with a spade did slowly emerge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hardcover version swann 's sheep , armed with their own literary accoutrements , deductive abilities and determination to avenge their shepherd 's death , begin tracking down the culprit .
with names like " othello " -lrb- the lead , black ram -rrb- and " miss maple " -lrb- a.k.a. " the smartest sheep in all glennkill " -rrb- , the animal protagonists already have an indirect link to murder and crime-solving . furthermore , they had developed their cognitive abilities by listening to their former shepherd george read aloud to them every afternoon when taking a break from grazing .
george 's literary tastes ranged from fairy tales to treatises on sheep diseases to trashy novels featuring red-headed heroines named " pamela . "
conveniently enough , george also once read a detective story to the sheep , so they feel adequately prepared to tackle the dirty business of crime-fighting . following their noses as they muse over the quirky behavior of human beings , the animals also apply their sharply honed sense of smell to aid them in solving the puzzle .
while swann 's countless descriptions of the sheep scenting the villagers to glean information do perhaps prompt a deeper understanding of just how animals tick , they also compose the sections of the novel that easily could have been whittled down .
the flowery depictions of the animals ' olfactory aptitude are initially amusing , and ultimately , annoying . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in swann 's book , sheep have a mind of their own still , the sheep 's sense of smell gives them a straightforward approach that allows them to distinguish between the liars and truth-seekers in glennkill , among them : george 's estranged wife , the butcher , a rival shepherd , a pentecostal wallflower pining for the murdered man and george 's even more estranged daughter who returns to the village .
this ability to scent also eventually leads them to successfully , albeit indirectly , reveal george 's murderer . history of animal literary figures swann is not the first to employ animals as literary protagonists .
other smart animals carry the flag in well-known books such as george orwell 's " animal farm , " paul auster 's " timbuktu , " haruki murakami 's " kafka on the shore " or the children 's tale " charlotte 's web , " to name just a few . yet , as ian sansom wrote in the guardian , " with sheep as detectives swann solves one of the major problems in crime fiction , which is how to avoid the stereotypical jaded , cynical , alcoholic deadbeat gumshoe with relationship problems . " lending other animals in the book monikers such as " rameses , " " mopple the whale " and " satan " also helps to feed the reader 's imagination . mixed reviews some german literary critics have been harsh in their assessment of " three bags full , " with one writer in the weighty weekly die zeit wondering how swann 's " simple " language can generate a best-seller . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author leonie swann another critic in the influential daily süddeutsche zeitung imagined a clever talk between a literary agent and a prospective author that targeted cute sheep in narrative as harbingers of massive book sales . denis scheck , a prominent german literary critic , was kinder , calling the acquaintance with swann 's glennkill sheep a " real pleasure .

the motto of the meeting : melting ice – a hot topic ? the united nations environmental program used the occasion to release a new report entitled " the global outlook for ice and snow . "
according to the report ’ s findings , the lives of hundreds of millions of people across the world will be affected by declines in snow cover , sea ice , glaciers , permafrost and lake ice .
a collaboration of 70 researchers , the report found that the melting of snow and ice caps contributes greatly to climate change and global warming because less sunlight is being reflected back into the atmosphere .
less ice , more heat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glaciers are receding at an alarming rate " this report is about ice and snow and may to some people seem to address issues from remote and far-away places , " said achim steiner , un under-secretary general and unep executive director .
" but the report underlines that fate of the world 's snowy and icy places in a climatically challenged world should be cause for concern in every ministry , boardroom and living room across the world , " he said .
the report is a part of the ongoing international polar year , an initiative spearheaded by the international council for science and the world meteorological organization .
norway ’ s environment minister helen bjoernoey praised the report .
" this report gives us an overall picture of the changes in snow and ice cover and the consequences for human beings and nature , not only in the polar and mountainous areas , but all over the world .
to me it is particularly alarming to realize that climate change can be a reinforcing process - global warming results in further global warming " .
a hot topic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inuit hunters fear for their livelihood , and their lives for inuit and other indigenous people living in arctic regions , the rapid ice melt is a reality and a threat to their way of life .
sheila watt cloutier , a former president of the inuit circumpolar conference , is campaigning to raise awareness of climate change and is developing a network involving indigenous people all over the globe .
according to watt , the impact of melting ice can be seen most clearly in these arctic regions , but the effects will reach far wider , with rising sea levels and changing ocean currents .
" we are very negatively and disproportionately affected by climate change , " said cloutier .
" the melting of -lrb- the ice -rrb- is creating not only inconvenience but real issues of livelihoods that are at stake where safety and security have become a remarkable challenge for us . "
from north to south bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unep 's steiner does not see any good news the report also highlighted threats to people in non-arctic areas of the world stating that " impacts are likely to include significant changes in the availability of water supplies for drinking and agriculture , rising sea levels affecting low-lying coasts and islands . "

the motto of the meeting : melting ice – a hot topic ? the united nations environmental program used the occasion to release a new report entitled " the global outlook for ice and snow . "
according to the report ’ s findings , the lives of hundreds of millions of people across the world will be affected by declines in snow cover , sea ice , glaciers , permafrost and lake ice .
a collaboration of 70 researchers , the report found that the melting of snow and ice caps contributes greatly to climate change and global warming because less sunlight is being reflected back into the atmosphere .
less ice , more heat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glaciers are receding at an alarming rate " this report is about ice and snow and may to some people seem to address issues from remote and far-away places , " said achim steiner , un under-secretary general and unep executive director .
" but the report underlines that fate of the world 's snowy and icy places in a climatically challenged world should be cause for concern in every ministry , boardroom and living room across the world , " he said .
the report is a part of the ongoing international polar year , an initiative spearheaded by the international council for science and the world meteorological organization .
norway ’ s environment minister helen bjoernoey praised the report .
" this report gives us an overall picture of the changes in snow and ice cover and the consequences for human beings and nature , not only in the polar and mountainous areas , but all over the world .
to me it is particularly alarming to realize that climate change can be a reinforcing process - global warming results in further global warming " .
a hot topic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inuit hunters fear for their livelihood , and their lives for inuit and other indigenous people living in arctic regions , the rapid ice melt is a reality and a threat to their way of life .
sheila watt cloutier , a former president of the inuit circumpolar conference , is campaigning to raise awareness of climate change and is developing a network involving indigenous people all over the globe .
according to watt , the impact of melting ice can be seen most clearly in these arctic regions , but the effects will reach far wider , with rising sea levels and changing ocean currents .
" we are very negatively and disproportionately affected by climate change , " said cloutier .
" the melting of -lrb- the ice -rrb- is creating not only inconvenience but real issues of livelihoods that are at stake where safety and security have become a remarkable challenge for us . "
from north to south bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unep 's steiner does not see any good news the report also highlighted threats to people in non-arctic areas of the world stating that " impacts are likely to include significant changes in the availability of water supplies for drinking and agriculture , rising sea levels affecting low-lying coasts and islands . "
" melting ice and snow are also likely to increase hazards including avalanches and floods from the build-up of potentially unstable glacial lakes .
these can burst their ice and soil dams , sending walls of water down valleys , " said steiner in his remarks in tromso .

chief negotiators of the world 's leading industrial nations are meeting in berlin on tuesday in a last-ditch effort to remove obstacles threatening to derail a g8 deal on climate change . german chancellor angela merkel , whose country holds the current presidency of the g8 , wants this week 's summit participants in heiligendamm to agree to set long-term goals to cut greenhouse gas emissions . but she faces opposition from us president george w. bush , who wants to convene a global summit that includes a new generation of polluters from the developing world such as china , india and brazil . germany wants the g8 to agree to cut greenhouse gas emissions to 50 per cent below 1990 levels by the year 2050 in order to ensure that the world 's average temperature increase due to global warming does not exceed two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degree fahrenheit -rrb- . a new kyoto bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the talks are taking place far away from the g8 protests germany wants this to form the framework for a new united nations protocol on climate change to replace the kyoto agreement when it expires in 2012 . merkel won backing from british premier tony blair , although she appears to be less optimistic that a landmark deal will be reached at the summit to cover the post-kyoto period . " at the g8 we need to agree the elements of a future framework , " blair told parliamentarians in the german capital on sunday .
" this would allow the un talks to accelerate and reach earlier agreement so that we have a framework for kyoto in place by 2009 . " the bush plan last week bush called for about 15 countries that account for the bulk of greenhouse-gas emissions , including the us , to meet later this year for talks on a " long-term global goal " for cutting emissions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush supports voluntary cuts in emissions the us has acknowledged that climate change is a serious problem caused by humans that requires action - though , in the us , only through voluntary steps . the role of china , which is not a member of the g8 , is crucial , as many experts believe it could overtake the united states this year as the world 's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases . china on monday issued its own plan for responding to global climate change but urged developed nations to take the lead and allow poorer nations to focus on economic development . at the same time , japan said it would use the g8 to launch an aid program for developing countries that would encourage them to fight global warming as well as pollution and poverty . bush versus merkel ? merkel , who has made the fight against global warming a key issue of germany 's g8 presidency , is scheduled to have lunch with bush immediately before the start of the g8 summit on wednesday . there has been a mixed reaction to the president 's call for global warming talks with a select group of polluter nations .
but it was not meant to sideline broader un discussions on climate change , us national security advisor stephen hadley said last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with or without bush , merkel is pushing global climate reform " it is an effort to try and find consensus on the way ahead , " he said ahead of the g8 summit grouping the us , canada , germany , japan , france , britain , italy and russia . " this week presents an opportunity to turn mr. bush 's newfound interest in climate change into a commitment to do something about it soon , " britain 's observer newspaper said in an editorial . merkel , who was to meet with canadian prime minister stephen harper on monday evening and japanese premier shinzo abe on tuesday , said she was confident the pre-summit talks would lead to " important steps " being agreed upon .

some 43 % of 1,148 adults quizzed for the children 's society said children should not be allowed out with friends until they were 14 .
but most said they had been allowed out without supervision aged 10 or younger .
the charity said spending time with friends was fundamental to children 's well-being and development .
the over-60s were the most cautious of the respondents , with 22 % of them saying children should be aged over 16 before going out alone .
nearly seven out of 10 -lrb- 69 % -rrb- of those asked said they were still in touch with at least one childhood friend .
isolation warning the survey was part of the charity 's good childhood inquiry - a series of reflections on childhood .
experts told the inquiry of the importance of letting children have the freedom to play independently and make friends .

children said having lots of friends and being able to spend time with them were central to having a good childhood .
chief executive of the children 's society bob reitemeier said : " children have told us loud and clear that friendship matters and yet this is an area in which we appear to be failing them .
" as a society we are in a real quandary .
on the one hand we want freedom for our children , but on the other we are becoming increasingly frightened to let them out . "
he added : " if we go too far down the road of being over-protective and not allowing children to explore , to play , to be up with their peers , but also with children of other ages , then we may be influencing the way in which they look at society and social interaction later on . "
children 's well-being teachers have expressed concern about the lack of play in the curriculum being taught to young people .
there are also fears youngsters face too much pressure from national tests .
adrian voce , from the play england project , said it was unfair to blame parents as they only had their children 's well-being at heart .
" compared to the well-being derived from being out and about and socialising and growing and developing , weighed up against real threats to your child 's safety - real or perceived threats - it 's a no-brainer for parents , " he said .
" they 'd rather their child was short of a few friends and over-weight than dead on the road . "

he added : " if we go too far down the road of being over-protective and not allowing children to explore , to play , to be up with their peers , but also with children of other ages , then we may be influencing the way in which they look at society and social interaction later on . "
children 's well-being teachers have expressed concern about the lack of play in the curriculum being taught to young people .
there are also fears youngsters face too much pressure from national tests .
adrian voce , from the play england project , said it was unfair to blame parents as they only had their children 's well-being at heart .
" compared to the well-being derived from being out and about and socialising and growing and developing , weighed up against real threats to your child 's safety - real or perceived threats - it 's a no-brainer for parents , " he said .

an investigation by bbc radio 4 's file on 4 programme has found that after two and half years the scheme has yet to cut in carbon dioxide emissions .
the consumer body energywatch said customers are getting a raw deal .
but a government minister has promised that the scheme 's next phase will be a big improvement .
the eu 's emission trading scheme - a key part of the uk government 's drive to combat climate change - began in 2005 and created a trade in carbon allowances .
it is essentially a permit to pollute .
power generators received their allowances free of charge but were allowed to reflect the value of those in increased prices to customers , as if the companies had actually had to buy the allowances .
energywatch believes this increased electricity bills by about 7 % in 2005 .
' windfall profits ' and according to one government estimate , that delivered windfall profits of up to £ 1.3bn to the generators in that year - higher than environmental campaigners had claimed last year .
however , so far the carbon scheme has brought no clear payback in terms of cutting emissions .
provisional government figures from the department for environment food and rural affairs -lrb- defra -rrb- suggest co2 output in britain actually went up , by 1.25 % last year wiping out a slight drop of 0.01 % in 2005 .
it is also reckoned that co2 emissions across the eu also rose by between 1 and 1.5 % over the last two years .
carbon reduction the chief executive of energywatch , allan asher , said , " consumers increasingly accept the need for reductions in carbon .
" however they are paying the price and not seeing the benefits .
the big generators are banking huge amounts of money and consumers are n't benefiting . "
but the minister for climate change , ian pearson , told file on 4 that the carbon trading scheme has been an administrative success yet concedes there have been problems in the first three year phase to the end of 2007 .
" if you are saying to me it has n't achieved a massive amount so far when it comes to co2 reductions , well i agree with you and i think phase two will be a big , big improvement ... and a key instrument in helping us all to achieve our carbon reduction targets across europe . "

an investigation by bbc radio 4 's file on 4 programme has found that after two and half years the scheme has yet to cut in carbon dioxide emissions .
the consumer body energywatch said customers are getting a raw deal .
but a government minister has promised that the scheme 's next phase will be a big improvement .
the eu 's emission trading scheme - a key part of the uk government 's drive to combat climate change - began in 2005 and created a trade in carbon allowances .
it is essentially a permit to pollute .
power generators received their allowances free of charge but were allowed to reflect the value of those in increased prices to customers , as if the companies had actually had to buy the allowances .
energywatch believes this increased electricity bills by about 7 % in 2005 .
' windfall profits ' and according to one government estimate , that delivered windfall profits of up to £ 1.3bn to the generators in that year - higher than environmental campaigners had claimed last year .
however , so far the carbon scheme has brought no clear payback in terms of cutting emissions .

doctors at harefield hospital found under 3 % of patients treated with angioplasty at the specialist heart centre had died after 30 days .
but of those patients taken first to a general hospital before referral to the centre , more than 10 % died .
the study was presented at a british cardiovascular society conference .
this gives better long-term results - time is muscle dr miles dalby ' it saved my life ' the british heart foundation estimates that 230,000 people in the uk have a heart attack each year , and that about 30 % of these are fatal .
dr miles dalby , a consultant cardiologist at harefield hospital , and colleagues looked at 180 patients who received direct primary angioplasty at their hospital .
fast treatment the patients were taken there directly by ambulance staff trained to identify patients who would benefit from the treatment .
dr dalby says patients at the hospital 's heart attack centre receive treatment and have their blood flow restored within an average of 24 minutes after arrival .
they compared these with 181 patients who had received the treatment after being referred to the centre from a general hospital .
cardiologists perform primary angioplasty to clear blockages in the heart 's arteries - the artery is unblocked using a thin tube , then opened by inflating a small balloon , and held open with a metal tube , or stent .
in non-specialist centres treatment is often by thrombolysis drugs which dissolve the blood clots , but the study found in patients treated with thrombolysis in the preceding two years , around 9 % died .
dr dalby said prompt treatment is vital for effective primary angioplasty , and that taking patients directly to heart attacks centres could reduce the number of deaths " significantly . "
he said : " during a heart attack , blood flow to the heart muscle is blocked which damages it .
" the sooner the patient receives treatment enabling the blood flow to return to the coronary arteries , the less damage occurs .
" this gives better long-term results - time is muscle . "
more detail needed dr clive weston , associate director of royal college of physician 's myocardial infarction national audit project , which collects data on heart attack patients , said the results were " quite remarkable " .
however he warned that in rural areas , where it make take some time to travel to a specialist centre , methods such as delivering thrombolytic treatments in ambulances could be more effective .
and he said the data needed to be explored in more detail to check there were no biases .
thrombolysis is very effective if delivered soon after heart attack symptoms develop .
however , as time passes , angioplasty becomes the more effective treatment .
and dr weston said another benefit of primary angioplasty was that it allowed to doctors to see more of the coronary anatomy so they could see what had caused the heart attack and help prevent future attacks .
judy o 'sullivan , cardiac nurse at the british heart foundation , said : " the study published by the harefield team shows promising results for recent advances in the treatment of heart attacks at such specialist centres . "
she said in the future angioplasty was likely to supercede thrombolysis as the treatment of choice for heart attacks , and added that patients ' speed of response in dialling 999 could also affect their survival chances .

doctors at harefield hospital found under 3 % of patients treated with angioplasty at the specialist heart centre had died after 30 days .
but of those patients taken first to a general hospital before referral to the centre , more than 10 % died .
the study was presented at a british cardiovascular society conference .
this gives better long-term results - time is muscle dr miles dalby ' it saved my life ' the british heart foundation estimates that 230,000 people in the uk have a heart attack each year , and that about 30 % of these are fatal .
dr miles dalby , a consultant cardiologist at harefield hospital , and colleagues looked at 180 patients who received direct primary angioplasty at their hospital .
fast treatment the patients were taken there directly by ambulance staff trained to identify patients who would benefit from the treatment .
dr dalby says patients at the hospital 's heart attack centre receive treatment and have their blood flow restored within an average of 24 minutes after arrival .
they compared these with 181 patients who had received the treatment after being referred to the centre from a general hospital .
cardiologists perform primary angioplasty to clear blockages in the heart 's arteries - the artery is unblocked using a thin tube , then opened by inflating a small balloon , and held open with a metal tube , or stent .
in non-specialist centres treatment is often by thrombolysis drugs which dissolve the blood clots , but the study found in patients treated with thrombolysis in the preceding two years , around 9 % died .
dr dalby said prompt treatment is vital for effective primary angioplasty , and that taking patients directly to heart attacks centres could reduce the number of deaths " significantly . "
he said : " during a heart attack , blood flow to the heart muscle is blocked which damages it .
" the sooner the patient receives treatment enabling the blood flow to return to the coronary arteries , the less damage occurs .
" this gives better long-term results - time is muscle . "
more detail needed dr clive weston , associate director of royal college of physician 's myocardial infarction national audit project , which collects data on heart attack patients , said the results were " quite remarkable " .
however he warned that in rural areas , where it make take some time to travel to a specialist centre , methods such as delivering thrombolytic treatments in ambulances could be more effective .
and he said the data needed to be explored in more detail to check there were no biases .
thrombolysis is very effective if delivered soon after heart attack symptoms develop .

he was taken directly to harefield hospital , a specialist heart attack centre , where he received an emergency primary angioplasty , which he says saved his life .
mr gloyens was boarding a plane to miami at heathrow , having had to run from the security checks to make it , when he started to feel unwell , and he decided to get off the plane before it took off .
he said : " i started to feel unwell so i decided to get off which was quite a good decision - one of my better decisions . "
he said he had a burning sensation in his chest and throat and a paramedic from the airport was called , who asked if he suffered from acid reflux .

it is then inflated and removed , leaving in place a ' stent ' - a rigid support which squashes the fatty deposit blocking the artery , allowing blood to flow more easily mr gloyens said : " the time from the ambulance doors opening to the time they finished the whole thing was under 20 minutes which is just flabbergasting really - it 's astonishingly quick .

mr gloyens said since the heart attack he had been taking things easy , and is taking cardiac rehabilitation classes .

the benchmark shanghai index had continued to slide for much of the day , with investors worried beijing might bring in further plans to slow growth .
the index ended 2.63 % up at 3,767.10 , after having lost as much as 7 % .
this followed monday 's record 8.3 % fall - as investors offloaded stocks in reaction to government plans to cool the economy .
strong demand the volatility in the chinese stock market does not appear to have had a knock-on effect on other markets - in contrast to february , when chinese market falls caused jitters around the world .
in the us , the dow jones closed at record high on monday , adding 8.21 points to 13,676.32 .
in japan , the benchmark nikkei 225 share index was up 73.3 points at 18,046.7 in late trade .
despite monday 's record fall in china , which followed a dramatic slide last wednesday , analysts say they expect the trend to be short-lived .
china has been embarking on a range of economic measures in a bid to slow runaway economic growth , including raising a tax on stock trades 0.1 % to 0.3 % .
strong demand from domestic investors has lifted chinese stocks in recent months .

the fair play football league is a joint project between council , police and youth groups in lincolnshire for 13 to 16-year-olds .
the league aims to reduce anti-social behaviour by giving young people a focus on friday nights .
the scheme can now be offered across the county thanks to an £ 80,000 grant .
the money has been awarded by the safer stronger communities fund .
' safe and supervised ' " we need things out of hours for kids to stop them getting bored , give them things that they want to do ... to get them off the streets and keep them safe and supervised , " said pc mick kelly , from lincolnshire police 's anti-social behaviour unit .
pc kelly said the eight-week football courses gave children an incentive to behave .
" we use a points-based reward scheme so they know their behaviour will be monitored for eight weeks and it holds them to account . "
fair play football started in 2005 and gives eight groups of 10 youngsters the chance to take part in a league .

a new 18,500 all-seater arena is to be built on the horfield site .
the pirates still plan to play over half of their league one campaign at the memorial stadium between august and december .

bristol rugby club , which shares the " mem " with rovers , said the situation regarding its coming season was " ongoing " .
whaddon road is 40 miles up the m5 from the club 's current home and has a capacity of 7,066 .
the move is set to be formally rubber-stamped by the football league later in the week , ahead of the release of the 2007/08 fixture list next thursday .
" we feel the size of whaddon road will help create an excellent atmosphere , much the same as twerton park did for us when we moved to bath in 1986 , " he said .
" the playing surface is also superb and will suit the type of football lennie lawrence and paul trollope wish to play . "
rovers spent a decade in exile in bath , when they were unable to secure a home ground in bristol .
" when we relocated to bath many residents were apprehensive , but as a club we showed respect for the neighbourhood and the environment around us , and over time we added value to the local community , " added mr dunford .

islington council is holding a referendum on a bid to vary residential parking charges according to how much co2 pollution each vehicle produces .
council leader james kempton said : " two thirds of people in islington will pay less if they vote ' yes ' . "
residents have until 25 june to return their ballot papers .
the council currently charges residents £ 95 for an annual parking permit , with a £ 20 discount for vehicles with engine capacities less than 1400cc or those powered by a greener fuel source .
' no income increase ' " the most ' gas guzzling ' cars will be paying double under this plan , and that 's what i think is right , " said mr kempton .
" the reality is whatever car you drive is polluting the environment and we want to encourage people to choose less polluting cars . "
mr kempton said that , by rewarding owners of vehicles which pollute less while penalising owners of vehicles which pollute more , the plan would not increase the council 's income from parking permit charges .
" this particular green policy would impact on a lot of people , " he added .
" we know there will be both supporters and opponents and we look forward to engaging them in the debate . "
the referendum follows similar proposals announced by richmond council last october .
it plans to charge owners of high-emission cars £ 750 a year for a parking permit , compared with £ 200 now , while making the greenest cars exempt .

' no income increase ' " the most ' gas guzzling ' cars will be paying double under this plan , and that 's what i think is right , " said mr kempton .
" the reality is whatever car you drive is polluting the environment and we want to encourage people to choose less polluting cars . "
mr kempton said that , by rewarding owners of vehicles which pollute less while penalising owners of vehicles which pollute more , the plan would not increase the council 's income from parking permit charges .
" this particular green policy would impact on a lot of people , " he added .
" we know there will be both supporters and opponents and we look forward to engaging them in the debate . "
the referendum follows similar proposals announced by richmond council last october .
it plans to charge owners of high-emission cars £ 750 a year for a parking permit , compared with £ 200 now , while making the greenest cars exempt .

motions are debated and voted upon , but ministers insist they are not binding .
what is the point of having a parliament , if its discussions do n't count ?
what is happening in the new stormont assembly ?
in truth , the stormont chamber is still in a running-in period .
it is waiting for the executive to make decisions on big issues like water charges and for the new ministers to work their ideas up into proposals for new laws .
but some early bills are starting to come before the chamber - these include proposals for the reform of welfare benefits .
so how will these bills become law ?
a bill starts its life with a minister , a committee or an individual member who can present the measure to the speaker , willie hay , for his consideration .
if mr hay 's office believes the bill falls within the assembly 's remit , it will then be introduced and debated in the assembly chamber .
after that it is referred to one of the stormont committees , so that assembly members can scrutinise the details of any measure .
the committee will report back to the assembly , allowing other members to consider the details and propose amendments changing the law .
the assembly then reconsiders the measure and a final vote is taken .
once a measure is approved , the speaker asks the northern ireland secretary to secure royal assent from the queen .
the bill becomes law and is then known as an act .
referring the matter to the monarch is a purely formal stage in the process .
the assembly can only pass laws on devolved matters , such as health , education , the economy , agriculture , the environment and so on .
areas which may be devolved in the future , such as policing and justice , are known as " reserved matters " .
areas which the government does not intend to devolve such as foreign policy and external defence are known as " excepted matters " .
whilst individual politicians can introduce their own bills , in practice bills brought by ministers , with the approval of the executive , are likely to take priority .
in the early days of the assembly , most motions have been voted on by a simple majority .
but if there is a contentious measure in the future , parties will insist it is treated differently .
devolution returned to stormont on 8 may under the rules of the assembly , important decisions or bills which involve the commitment of financial resources have to win cross-community support .
this means either winning the backing of both a majority of unionists and a majority of nationalists , or the support of 40 % of both sides and more than 60 % of all assembly members .
as things stand , both the dup and sinn fein represent more than 60 % of their respective designations .
if 30 members of the assembly are concerned about a decision , they can petition for it to be referred back to the executive .
on the executive , if any three ministers are concerned about a decision by one of their colleagues , they can insist on a cross-community vote amongst the 12 members .
apart from passing laws , the assembly has a role in holding executive ministers to account .
assembly committees shadow the work of individual departments and , on mondays , from early june , ministers will appear in the stormont chamber to answer assembly members ' questions .

motions are debated and voted upon , but ministers insist they are not binding .
what is the point of having a parliament , if its discussions do n't count ?
what is happening in the new stormont assembly ?
in truth , the stormont chamber is still in a running-in period .
it is waiting for the executive to make decisions on big issues like water charges and for the new ministers to work their ideas up into proposals for new laws .
but some early bills are starting to come before the chamber - these include proposals for the reform of welfare benefits .
so how will these bills become law ?
a bill starts its life with a minister , a committee or an individual member who can present the measure to the speaker , willie hay , for his consideration .
if mr hay 's office believes the bill falls within the assembly 's remit , it will then be introduced and debated in the assembly chamber .
after that it is referred to one of the stormont committees , so that assembly members can scrutinise the details of any measure .
the committee will report back to the assembly , allowing other members to consider the details and propose amendments changing the law .
the assembly then reconsiders the measure and a final vote is taken .
once a measure is approved , the speaker asks the northern ireland secretary to secure royal assent from the queen .
the bill becomes law and is then known as an act .
referring the matter to the monarch is a purely formal stage in the process .
the assembly can only pass laws on devolved matters , such as health , education , the economy , agriculture , the environment and so on .
areas which may be devolved in the future , such as policing and justice , are known as " reserved matters " .
areas which the government does not intend to devolve such as foreign policy and external defence are known as " excepted matters " .
whilst individual politicians can introduce their own bills , in practice bills brought by ministers , with the approval of the executive , are likely to take priority .
in the early days of the assembly , most motions have been voted on by a simple majority .
but if there is a contentious measure in the future , parties will insist it is treated differently .
devolution returned to stormont on 8 may under the rules of the assembly , important decisions or bills which involve the commitment of financial resources have to win cross-community support .
this means either winning the backing of both a majority of unionists and a majority of nationalists , or the support of 40 % of both sides and more than 60 % of all assembly members .
as things stand , both the dup and sinn fein represent more than 60 % of their respective designations .
if 30 members of the assembly are concerned about a decision , they can petition for it to be referred back to the executive .
on the executive , if any three ministers are concerned about a decision by one of their colleagues , they can insist on a cross-community vote amongst the 12 members .
