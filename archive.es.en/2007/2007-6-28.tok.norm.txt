the procedure is a breakthrough in bio-technology and fuels hope of a cure for aids . the laboratory procedure removing the aids virus used an enzyme , said joachim hauber of the heinrich pette institute for experimental virology and immunology in hamburg . " we have rid the cells of the virus , " hauber said on thursday .
" no one else has done this before . "
he called it " a breakthrough in bio-technology . " hauber said it was his " cautious " hope that a cure for aids could be found within 10 years . current therapies can only limit the spread of the human immunodeficiency virus -lrb- hiv -rrb- and not remove it from the body .
hiv is a retrovirus that nests in the dna or key genetic material of infected cells . the max planck institute for molecular cell biology and genetics in dresden was the partner in the research , which will be reported in friday 's issue of the scientific journal science . cutting dna and recombining it three years of experiments on mice were planned next , to be followed by tests on humans in hamburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the enzyme knows just where to cut the dna the scientists ' method used the ability of so-called recombinase enzymes to cut strands of dna at certain places like a pair of scissors and recombine the strands . the new enzyme , tre , always recognized the right spot to snip the dna where the hiv started .
the scientists said it recognized a characteristic hiv sequence that scarcely ever mutated . tre was adapted from an existing natural enzyme , cre , which recognized similar genetic sequences . stem cells necessary for therapy the laboratories artificially evolved cre into tre through more than 120 recombinase generations .
hauber said the cell then flushed out the snipped-away dna as waste . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists have been analyzing the hiv virus for years " after that , it is healthy , " hauber said . any therapy , though , would require stem cells to be obtained from a patient 's blood .
they would then be treated in the laboratory and re-injected to regenerate a healthy immune system , hauber said . " it 's high-tech medicine , " hauber said .

the us says they are key in its war against terrorism but europeans worry the measures erode civil liberties . eu officials said wednesday that the eu and the us had reached a deal following a meeting between franco frattini , the eu justice and home affairs commissioner , michael chertoff , the us secretary for homeland security and wolfgang schäuble , the interior minister of germany which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
" a political agreement in principle was reached , " said roscam abbing , a spokesman for frattini .
data privacy a thorny issue data privacy has been a sticking point between the eu and the us ever since washington intensified anti-terrorism efforts after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks .
following the attacks on new york and washington , the eu and the us signed an agreement under which the eu agreed to grant us authorities access to up to 34 categories of information on passengers on all flights to the us taking off from eu member states .
these included names , addresses , phone numbers and credit card numbers of travelers .
that agreement , which is set to expire on july 31 , had stirred unease among eu lawmakers amid mounting concerns that civil liberties were being eroded in the fight against global terrorism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flying to the us is usually a security hassle for passengers in a letter this month to interior and justice ministers of portugal , which takes over the eu presidency from germany next month , the european data protection supervisor , peter hustinx said eu governments were sacrificing too much of their citizens ' privacy in the fight against terrorism . " i fear that messages such as ' no right to privacy until life and security are guaranteed ' are developing into a mantra suggesting that fundamental rights and freedoms are a luxury that security can not afford , " hustinx wrote . last may , the air travel data deal was annulled by the european court of justice in luxembourg and the two sides reached an interim agreement .
the eu had warned that airlines would be vulnerable to privacy complaints if no replacement deal had been reached before the interim one expired .
though details of the accord reached this week have not been released , german interior minister schäuble told an eu parliamentary briefing in strasbourg that the aim was to reduce the number of stored data on passengers that the us currently receives from 34 to 20 .
it remains unclear what pieces of personal data will be left out from the new us list .
an eu diplomat said under the new arrangement the data would now be kept by the us for 15 years , up from 3 1/2 years in the interim agreement .
the european side also sought to end the us ability to directly access flight booking computers , arguing instead that airlines should send the data .
europeans are the biggest group of travelers to the us .
deal on access to bank data separately , the us and the eu also struck a deal setting conditions for the us treasury department to view records of the international banking network swift in anti-terrorism probes .
european civil liberties group watchdogs had complained that swift , which handles global financial transfers and is based in brussels , violated european privacy laws by allowing the us to secretly consult its records .
washington has argued that the access is essential for its drive to end funding to terror networks .
the us will now only use swift data for counter-terrorism purposes and store it for a maximum of five years , according to the terms of the new deal . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the future of the internet is now germans hesitant to look for love online " the synapses of a collective brain are growing " the internet and everyday life : the constant revolution the future is now internet -pipe- 28.06.2007 wikipedia founder : " great ideas come from different places " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikipedia founder jimmi wales its critics said it would n't last but the online encyclopaedia wikipedia has gone on to become one of the world 's most popular websites .
founder jimmy wales spoke to dw-world about the secret of its success . jimmy wales was born in alabama , usa , in 1966 .
he studied finance and worked as a research director at the chicago stock exchange .
in 2001 he founded wikipedia which is a multilingual , web-based , free content encyclopedia project .
it is written collaboratively by volunteers .
the vast majority of its articles can be edited by anyone with access to the internet .
from 2003 to 2006 , jimmy wales was headed the wikimedia foundation , wikipedia 's non-profit parent organization .
in 2004 , he founded the for-profit internet portal wikia , which is now supposed to carry on his newest project , the search engine wikia search .
jimmy wales lives in florida with his wife and his daughter . dw-world : a famous american magazine has chosen you as one of the 100 people who shape our world .
how does it feel to be a world shaper ?
jimmy wales : i thought that was sort of funny .
i enjoyed it of course , but tyra banks - the supermodel - was also on the list .
so i don ’ t know how meaningful it really is .
but i feel a real sense of responsibility that i am in a position where i can have some influence and i can say something people listen to .
i try not to say very much because of that .
because i want to make sure that what i do say is something that i can really believe in .
equality , unlimited faculty , no hierarchy : is that just the philosophy of wikipedia or is it your philosophy of life in general ?
that is pretty much my philosophy .
a lot of wikipedia reflects things that i believe in very strongly .
sometimes people think if you believe that everyone should participate then you think right and wrong don ‘ t matter and everybody ’ s opinion is as good as everyone else ’ s .
it may seem paradoxical to them , but , no , i think that some people are really not that smart and that they are not that useful .
but leaving open the possibility for participation means that we are able to get a lot of great ideas from lots of different places .
wikipedia owes its success to the community , to all the people who write articles every day without getting paid .
why do they do that for wikipedia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikipedia has 75,000 contributors in over 100 languages .
i think there are two reasons .
one reason is that the charity of our mission is inspiring a lot of people .
but i think that ’ s a fairly limited reason .
the main reason is that it ’ s fun .
the people just enjoy the process , they enjoy meeting other intellectual people , it ’ s a great hobby .
we know that intuitively if we think about people plying football on the weekends .
we don ’ t say : " gee , gosh , you 're going to play football and you don ’ t get paid for that ? ”
that ’ s silly , right ?
obviously people are doing it because they enjoy it and they have fun .
it is a similar thing with wikipedia .
some people earn a lot of money writing but others can do it just for fun .
you seem to do it just for fun too .
because although wikipedia is very successful you are not earning any money because it is a charitable project .
do you sometimes think that you did something wrong ?
i always joke that when i registered wikipedia as a non-profit organization , it was either the dumbest thing or the smartest thing i ever did .
the dumbest for the obvious reason that i get to hang out with billionaires but i don ’ t have any money .
the smartest , though , because i don ‘ t think it could have been nearly as successful as it is and also because i think it will be remembered in the future .
100 or 200 years from now people will point to wikipedia and say : that was a really good thing that did something beneficial for the world .
so that is something i am very proud of .
why wouldn ’ t it have worked out as a commercial organization ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new era of user generated content and social networking is often referred to as web 2.0 i think that for an encyclopedia that is really attempting this very grand ethical mission of sharing knowledge with everyone , being a non-profit organization is really the right approach .
it means that , as a community , we have the luxury of doing things the right way rather than doing things in a way that is dictated by current economic circumstances .
the internet video platform you tube was sold for $ 1.65 billion -lrb- 1.23 billion euros -rrb- .
how much would sell wikipedia for ?
i don ’ t know what it ’ s worth , it ’ s really interesting .
it has very low revenue .
but i guess you could slap ads all over it and make some money .
i think the wikimedia foundation - the owner of wikipedia - could in fact sell it .
nobody ’ s interested in doing that , but certainly if there was an offer of $ 3 billion , i think the foundation would have to seriously think about what could be done for the charitable purposes of the foundation in distributing free knowledge if we outsourced the community or something .
your new project , the search engine wikia search , which will launch at the end of this year , will be commercial .
why did you change your mind ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wales aims to challenge google 's dominance in the search engine market .
for some types of projects - if you think about running hospitals or the red cross - the charitable model works well .
people are willing to donate money , enough to make it last .
but for other things like running a chain of grocery stores , there have never been very successful charities that have done such things .
i think different kinds of work demands different kinds of organization .
there are so many search engines on the internet already .
why does the world actually need another one ?
the search engines we have right now are black boxes and not transparent .
they are not community controlled and the quality is ... well , it 's pretty good but it stagnated the last two or three years .
there are lots of ways in which searches have not improved as much as a lot of us would have liked .
i don ’ t know how to improve search beyond what already exists .
but i do think that a broad community of people and an open scientific dialogue about how to do that can probably make some progress .
anyway it ’ s fun .
i always do the most fun thing .
and what will be the next big thing coming up on the internet ?
i don ’ t know .
i always remind people that five years ago , i was just this guy sitting at home in my pajamas typing on the internet .
and now i get asked deep questions about the future .
the trend i see right now is that we are very much at the beginning of free licensing of culture .
and we are still very much at the beginning of the design of communities for producing good quality work .
so i think that there is still a lot of room in those areas . christine elsaesser interviewed jimmy wales send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the future of the internet is now germans hesitant to look for love online " the synapses of a collective brain are growing " the internet and everyday life : the constant revolution the future is now internet -pipe- 28.06.2007 wikipedia founder : " great ideas come from different places " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikipedia founder jimmi wales its critics said it would n't last but the online encyclopaedia wikipedia has gone on to become one of the world 's most popular websites .
founder jimmy wales spoke to dw-world about the secret of its success . jimmy wales was born in alabama , usa , in 1966 .
he studied finance and worked as a research director at the chicago stock exchange .
in 2001 he founded wikipedia which is a multilingual , web-based , free content encyclopedia project .
it is written collaboratively by volunteers .
the vast majority of its articles can be edited by anyone with access to the internet .
from 2003 to 2006 , jimmy wales was headed the wikimedia foundation , wikipedia 's non-profit parent organization .
in 2004 , he founded the for-profit internet portal wikia , which is now supposed to carry on his newest project , the search engine wikia search .
jimmy wales lives in florida with his wife and his daughter . dw-world : a famous american magazine has chosen you as one of the 100 people who shape our world .
how does it feel to be a world shaper ?
jimmy wales : i thought that was sort of funny .
i enjoyed it of course , but tyra banks - the supermodel - was also on the list .
so i don ’ t know how meaningful it really is .
but i feel a real sense of responsibility that i am in a position where i can have some influence and i can say something people listen to .
i try not to say very much because of that .
because i want to make sure that what i do say is something that i can really believe in .
equality , unlimited faculty , no hierarchy : is that just the philosophy of wikipedia or is it your philosophy of life in general ?
that is pretty much my philosophy .
a lot of wikipedia reflects things that i believe in very strongly .
sometimes people think if you believe that everyone should participate then you think right and wrong don ‘ t matter and everybody ’ s opinion is as good as everyone else ’ s .
it may seem paradoxical to them , but , no , i think that some people are really not that smart and that they are not that useful .
but leaving open the possibility for participation means that we are able to get a lot of great ideas from lots of different places .
wikipedia owes its success to the community , to all the people who write articles every day without getting paid .
why do they do that for wikipedia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikipedia has 75,000 contributors in over 100 languages .
i think there are two reasons .
one reason is that the charity of our mission is inspiring a lot of people .
but i think that ’ s a fairly limited reason .
the main reason is that it ’ s fun .
the people just enjoy the process , they enjoy meeting other intellectual people , it ’ s a great hobby .
we know that intuitively if we think about people plying football on the weekends .
we don ’ t say : " gee , gosh , you 're going to play football and you don ’ t get paid for that ? ”
that ’ s silly , right ?
obviously people are doing it because they enjoy it and they have fun .
it is a similar thing with wikipedia .
some people earn a lot of money writing but others can do it just for fun .
you seem to do it just for fun too .
because although wikipedia is very successful you are not earning any money because it is a charitable project .
do you sometimes think that you did something wrong ?
i always joke that when i registered wikipedia as a non-profit organization , it was either the dumbest thing or the smartest thing i ever did .
the dumbest for the obvious reason that i get to hang out with billionaires but i don ’ t have any money .
the smartest , though , because i don ‘ t think it could have been nearly as successful as it is and also because i think it will be remembered in the future .
100 or 200 years from now people will point to wikipedia and say : that was a really good thing that did something beneficial for the world .
so that is something i am very proud of .
why wouldn ’ t it have worked out as a commercial organization ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new era of user generated content and social networking is often referred to as web 2.0 i think that for an encyclopedia that is really attempting this very grand ethical mission of sharing knowledge with everyone , being a non-profit organization is really the right approach .
it means that , as a community , we have the luxury of doing things the right way rather than doing things in a way that is dictated by current economic circumstances .
the internet video platform you tube was sold for $ 1.65 billion -lrb- 1.23 billion euros -rrb- .
how much would sell wikipedia for ?
i don ’ t know what it ’ s worth , it ’ s really interesting .
it has very low revenue .
but i guess you could slap ads all over it and make some money .
i think the wikimedia foundation - the owner of wikipedia - could in fact sell it .
nobody ’ s interested in doing that , but certainly if there was an offer of $ 3 billion , i think the foundation would have to seriously think about what could be done for the charitable purposes of the foundation in distributing free knowledge if we outsourced the community or something .
your new project , the search engine wikia search , which will launch at the end of this year , will be commercial .
why did you change your mind ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wales aims to challenge google 's dominance in the search engine market .
for some types of projects - if you think about running hospitals or the red cross - the charitable model works well .
people are willing to donate money , enough to make it last .
but for other things like running a chain of grocery stores , there have never been very successful charities that have done such things .
i think different kinds of work demands different kinds of organization .
there are so many search engines on the internet already .
why does the world actually need another one ?
the search engines we have right now are black boxes and not transparent .
they are not community controlled and the quality is ... well , it 's pretty good but it stagnated the last two or three years .
there are lots of ways in which searches have not improved as much as a lot of us would have liked .
i don ’ t know how to improve search beyond what already exists .
but i do think that a broad community of people and an open scientific dialogue about how to do that can probably make some progress .
anyway it ’ s fun .
i always do the most fun thing .
and what will be the next big thing coming up on the internet ?
i don ’ t know .
i always remind people that five years ago , i was just this guy sitting at home in my pajamas typing on the internet .
and now i get asked deep questions about the future .
the trend i see right now is that we are very much at the beginning of free licensing of culture .
and we are still very much at the beginning of the design of communities for producing good quality work .
so i think that there is still a lot of room in those areas . christine elsaesser interviewed jimmy wales send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

these plans , which won the second competition staged to find a design for the building , were attacked for being insensitive and even dubbed a " toilet block " by one critic .
the winner of the first competition giorgio grassi had also seen his design blocked - an occurrence not unusual in a country where passions about architecture run high .
" half-hearted " bildunterschrift : only time will tell if chipperfield 's new plans get implemented the new blueprint echoes elements of the existing ensemble with an open staircase and colonnades .
but a number of german newspapers have criticized the revamped architecture .
the süddeutsche zeitung praised some aspects of the design , but described it essentially as being " half-hearted " and " undecided , " while the berliner morgenpost also said it did not form a " convincing whole . "
chipperfield 's building will complete the renovation of the museum island in the spree river , a large museum complex which was damaged in world war ii and and fell into neglect during the communist era .
final touch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bust of the egyptian queen nefertiti is the most famous exhibit in the complex the new building will be called the james simon gallery after a jewish patron of the arts , and will be attached to the pergamon museum , one of berlin 's biggest tourist attractions .
the architect said it would cost about 73 million euros -lrb- $ 98 million -rrb- and be completed in 2012 .
he said the gallery would blend in with the architectural design of the museums and house a conference center and shops .
the architect is also overseeing renovations at the pergamon to restore the facade to its pre-war glory and modernize the museum 's interior .
the pergamon includes a reconstruction of the ishtar gate from babylon with stones from the original structure .
unesco site bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bode museum is the latest museum on the island to be renovated the museum island , which was declared a unesco world heritage site in 1999 , also houses the bode museum , die alte nationalgalerie , the neues museum and the altes museum - best known for its world-famous 3,400-year-old egyptian bust of nefertiti .
the government has spent hundreds of billions of euros restoring the 19th-century complex and the scheme is due to be finished in 2015 .

" anybody who tries to weigh up the dead of the second world war against votes in the -lrb- eu -rrb- council has to be rejected out of hand , " martin schulz , leader of the socialist group in the european parliament , told fellow lawmakers in brussels on wednesday to loud applause .
" the eu is an idea aimed at eliminating the specters of the past ...
we will not permit the few to bring up those specters , " he added .
schulz was referring to kacyznski 's remarks that poland deserved more voting power in the eu because its population would have been far larger if it had not been decimated during the nazi era .
the prime minister compounded matters on tuesday when he compared modern-day germany to the era that brought adolf hitler to power .

he praised germany for avoiding any kind of " demonstration of power " in its role as holder of the eu presidency vis-a-vis poland and other eu states and praised german chancellor angela merkel 's pleasant " new leadership style . "
poland eventually won concessions at the summit , notably a delay to the introduction of the new voting system which it opposed , but faced criticism for its negotiating manner .
the german chancellor continues to seek to play down the dispute with poland .
" for us our polish neighbor has the same importance as our french neighbor , " she said in a speech on wednesday in brussels .
she has not commented on a controversial caricature of her that appeared on the front cover of the conservative polish magazine wprost on monday .
entitled the " stepmother of europe , " the photomontage depicted the german chancellor breast-feeding the kaczynski twins .

he told the hannoversche allgemeine zeitung that press freedom also protected things that people might regard as stupid or tasteless .

at that time berlin responded to protests from warsaw by referring to the freedom of the press .

" anybody who tries to weigh up the dead of the second world war against votes in the -lrb- eu -rrb- council has to be rejected out of hand , " martin schulz , leader of the socialist group in the european parliament , told fellow lawmakers in brussels on wednesday to loud applause .
" the eu is an idea aimed at eliminating the specters of the past ...
we will not permit the few to bring up those specters , " he added .
schulz was referring to kacyznski 's remarks that poland deserved more voting power in the eu because its population would have been far larger if it had not been decimated during the nazi era .
the prime minister compounded matters on tuesday when he compared modern-day germany to the era that brought adolf hitler to power .
" not representative " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bilateral relations have been strained since the kaczynski twins came to power marek siwiec , a polish member of the european parliament said that kaczynski 's comments and the polish blocking tactics at the eu summit did not represent the views of the polish people .
he praised germany for avoiding any kind of " demonstration of power " in its role as holder of the eu presidency vis-a-vis poland and other eu states and praised german chancellor angela merkel 's pleasant " new leadership style . "
poland eventually won concessions at the summit , notably a delay to the introduction of the new voting system which it opposed , but faced criticism for its negotiating manner .
the german chancellor continues to seek to play down the dispute with poland .
" for us our polish neighbor has the same importance as our french neighbor , " she said in a speech on wednesday in brussels .
she has not commented on a controversial caricature of her that appeared on the front cover of the conservative polish magazine wprost on monday .
entitled the " stepmother of europe , " the photomontage depicted the german chancellor breast-feeding the kaczynski twins .
outrage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this controversial caricature has also provoked a storm of outrage a number of german politicians expressed outrage on tuesday about the caricature that accompanied an article written by mariusz muszynski , the polish foreign minister 's commissioner for german-polish relations .
but eckart von klaeden , the foreign policy spokesman for the conservative cdu / csu bloc , has also called for the matter to be approached in a more relaxed manner .
he told the hannoversche allgemeine zeitung that press freedom also protected things that people might regard as stupid or tasteless .
von klaeden also referred to a caricature that appeared in germany 's taz newspaper a year ago that compared the polish president as " poland 's new potato . "
at that time berlin responded to protests from warsaw by referring to the freedom of the press .
" exactly the same standards should apply with regards to the cover of a polish magazine , " he said .
von klaeden also expressed optimism that the tensions between germany and poland would soon settle .
" once all the momentary fuss has subsided , it will be possible to clearly see the success of the summit in brussels , " he said . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that would be a spontaneous reaction to blair 's appointment as middle east envoy .
actually , just about anyone who did n't have the colonial past of a briton in the middle east , had not driven the iraq war as a " lap dog " of the american president and not delayed a truce during the lebanon war last year as blair did would have been a better person for the job .
despite these facts , the mideast quartet - which comprises the us , the eu , the un and russia - chose the former british prime minister as the new mideast envoy .
the quartet did n't seem to have any serious reservations about the appointment .
even the russians did n't seem to have any doubts about blair 's skills as a trouble shooter despite being at loggerheads with him in the scandal involving the murder of a former russian agent .
but can the former british premier position himself as a neutral representative and mediator ?
you have to doubt it in light of his close alliance with the us and israel .
the question is whether blair will really mediate in the ongoing trouble in the middle east .
his responsibility largely lies in helping the palestinian parties lift themselves out of the crisis .
he is meant to help the palestinians build democratic institutions and in the course of that job he will naturally have to often report to washington to request specific american help .
given his excellent ties with the white house , that should be easy for blair as compared with honorable representatives from second-tier friendly nations .
there 's no disputing that less mistrust of the mideast envoy would make his job easier .
but in the past even american jews such as henry kissinger or dennis ross have successfully mediated in the middle east on behalf of the white house .
why should blair not have the same success on behalf of the mideast quartet ?
especially considering that it will be the quartet and not blair who will decide which direction to take .
that decision too will be limited since the direction is long well known ; it 's that path that negotiators ca n't agree on .
during his farewell speech to the house of commons , blair declared that the middle east must have place for two states - israel and palestine .
by now all sensible and right-minded individuals accept that formula and it also forms the core of the " roadmap " of the middle east aimed to resolve the conflict .
the arab league too is committed to the " two state " solution .
only radical groups continue to reject it .
but then again nobody would try to talk peace with them .
that 's why blair might succeed in moving things along .
and if he does n't then he would n't be the first to fail at the task .

actually , just about anyone who did n't have the colonial past of a briton in the middle east , had not driven the iraq war as a " lap dog " of the american president and not delayed a truce during the lebanon war last year as blair did would have been a better person for the job .
despite these facts , the mideast quartet - which comprises the us , the eu , the un and russia - chose the former british prime minister as the new mideast envoy .
the quartet did n't seem to have any serious reservations about the appointment .
even the russians did n't seem to have any doubts about blair 's skills as a trouble shooter despite being at loggerheads with him in the scandal involving the murder of a former russian agent .
but can the former british premier position himself as a neutral representative and mediator ?
you have to doubt it in light of his close alliance with the us and israel .
the question is whether blair will really mediate in the ongoing trouble in the middle east .
his responsibility largely lies in helping the palestinian parties lift themselves out of the crisis .
he is meant to help the palestinians build democratic institutions and in the course of that job he will naturally have to often report to washington to request specific american help .
given his excellent ties with the white house , that should be easy for blair as compared with honorable representatives from second-tier friendly nations .
there 's no disputing that less mistrust of the mideast envoy would make his job easier .
but in the past even american jews such as henry kissinger or dennis ross have successfully mediated in the middle east on behalf of the white house .
why should blair not have the same success on behalf of the mideast quartet ?
especially considering that it will be the quartet and not blair who will decide which direction to take .
that decision too will be limited since the direction is long well known ; it 's that path that negotiators ca n't agree on .
during his farewell speech to the house of commons , blair declared that the middle east must have place for two states - israel and palestine .
by now all sensible and right-minded individuals accept that formula and it also forms the core of the " roadmap " of the middle east aimed to resolve the conflict .
the arab league too is committed to the " two state " solution .
only radical groups continue to reject it .
but then again nobody would try to talk peace with them .
that 's why blair might succeed in moving things along .
and if he does n't then he would n't be the first to fail at the task .

we are unusual , as british people go , but for my husband and me , germany is probably our favorite holiday destination and one reason for that is the stunning variety on offer .
each state has its own culture , architecture and natural scenery .
looking for new places to explore and discover , we started going east a couple of years ago and we were not disappointed - far from it .
from large , culture-rich cities like dresden and weimar to small , historic towns like meissen and quedlinburg , we 've found much to recommend .
there is so much history to explore and we have found the local people extremely welcoming , very helpful and eager to provide an excellent service to visitors .
our only surprise has been the low numbers of other visitors -lrb- especially other western europeans -rrb- .
if you do n't go soon , then you 'll be missing something extraordinary precisely because it is a place in transition , yet still , in parts , clinging to its unique identity and culture .
this will go in time , as is the way in a globalized society , so make the most of it while you can ! - liz , great britain eurail is a great bargain !
if you can , buy a pass .
trains in germany make our amtrak look like the trash it is .
i also recommend public transport in german cities .
germany was smart when they kept trams in their cities .
dresden is a great art treasure and we plan to return soon .
i also recommend leipzig , especially if you enjoy baroque and classical music . - samuel r. ganczaruk , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : take a christmas cruise , recommended a reader we are a group of spaniards visiting frankfurt .
at the suggestion of one local we went yesterday to a typical frankfurt cider tavern called zur sonne .
people here told us not to go to sachsenhausen -lrb- trashy and touristy , full of irish pubs and caipirinha bars these days -rrb- but rather to the north end and bornheim district , which are very young and picturesque .
apple wine , as everyone warned us , takes some " getting used to " but after a few glasses it tastes almost like a good penedes !
-lrb- only a joke ! -rrb-
the atmosphere in these taverns - which during warm months have large gardens - is very friendly and convivial .
the food is wonderful -lrb- try the local specialty , green sauce -rrb- and prices are very fair . - ramiro ruiz , spain i 've visited germany twice .
it is really a very nice country to visit .
everything is well prepared .
i really enjoyed my vacation and hope to visit another time . - sawsan , sudan germany has restored my happy feelings for christmas and i send my sincere congratulations to the german people for their celebration of christmas .
the christmas markets are wonderful and the people are very friendly and a joy to be with .
we were on a river cruise in december 2006 , starting in cologne and ending in nuremberg .
my wife is an organist and loved every opportunity to hear another organ .

the procedure is a breakthrough in bio-technology and fuels hope of a cure for aids . the laboratory procedure removing the aids virus used an enzyme , said joachim hauber of the heinrich pette institute for experimental virology and immunology in hamburg . " we have rid the cells of the virus , " hauber said on thursday .
" no one else has done this before . "
he called it " a breakthrough in bio-technology . " hauber said it was his " cautious " hope that a cure for aids could be found within 10 years . current therapies can only limit the spread of the human immunodeficiency virus -lrb- hiv -rrb- and not remove it from the body .
hiv is a retrovirus that nests in the dna or key genetic material of infected cells . the max planck institute for molecular cell biology and genetics in dresden was the partner in the research , which will be reported in friday 's issue of the scientific journal science . cutting dna and recombining it three years of experiments on mice were planned next , to be followed by tests on humans in hamburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the enzyme knows just where to cut the dna the scientists ' method used the ability of so-called recombinase enzymes to cut strands of dna at certain places like a pair of scissors and recombine the strands . the new enzyme , tre , always recognized the right spot to snip the dna where the hiv started .
the scientists said it recognized a characteristic hiv sequence that scarcely ever mutated . tre was adapted from an existing natural enzyme , cre , which recognized similar genetic sequences . stem cells necessary for therapy the laboratories artificially evolved cre into tre through more than 120 recombinase generations .
hauber said the cell then flushed out the snipped-away dna as waste . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists have been analyzing the hiv virus for years " after that , it is healthy , " hauber said . any therapy , though , would require stem cells to be obtained from a patient 's blood .
they would then be treated in the laboratory and re-injected to regenerate a healthy immune system , hauber said . " it 's high-tech medicine , " hauber said .

analysts had forecast that seasonally adjusted unemployment would drop by 20,000 from may , when the jobless rate stood at 9.2 per cent .
" the driver is the good economic performance , " said alexander koch , an economist at the hypovereinsbank .
he added that employers were now complaining of growing labor shortages in key sectors of the economy .
consumer confidence gaining in strength job vacancies rose by 11.6 percent to 648,096 , thursday 's data showed as chancellor angela merkel 's government considers possible measures which could ease the way for skilled foreign workers to enter the german labor market to fill gaps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers are n't holding back falling unemployment has also helped to shore up consumer confidence in germany where stagnating household spending has been a drag on economic growth in recent years .
german consumer confidence is at a six-month high , a survey released this week showed .
predictions of higher wages in the nation are helping to fuel optimism among the nation 's consumers , the survey said .
the number of unemployed fell by 26,000 in the economically more important western part of the nation , the labor agency said , and by 11,000 in the nation 's former communist east .
growth could exceed 2.8 percent amid signs that the german economy has rebounded unexpectedly strongly from the hefty and unpopular hike in the nation 's value-added tax in january and this year 's us economic slowdown , economists have been revising upwards their 2007 growth forecasts for germany .
many economists now project german economic growth to match or possibly surpass last year 's perky 2.8 percent expansion rate .
but with two major economic sentiment surveys - the zew investor confidence report and the ifo business confidence index - recently pointing down , analysts also say that the nation 's economic expansion could be starting to plateau out .
indeed , germany 's retail traders ' association -lrb- hde -rrb- said on thursday it expected 2007 retail sales to fall in real terms after a difficult start to the year .
pollitically sensitive data in the meantime , thursday 's jobless figures showed the politically-sensitive unadjusted labor market data also fell in june , dropping by 25,000 from may to 3.687 million in june with the unemployment rate edging down 0.3 percentage points to 8.8 percent .
" the demand for workers has increased again , " said federal labor agency chief frank jürgen weise .
the june unadjusted unemployment figures represented a 712,000 decline compared to june 2006 , when the jobless rate stood at 10.5 percent .
this represents an average monthly fall of 60,000 over the last 12 months .
the fall in seasonally unadjusted or headline unemployment was also more than expected by analysts , who had forecast a month-on-month fall in june of about 75,000 .
while the economists see the seasonally adjusted data as pointing to trends in the labor market , the headline data has become more politically significant in germany . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the june unadjusted unemployment figures represented a 712,000 decline compared to june 2006 , when the jobless rate stood at 10.5 percent .
this represents an average monthly fall of 60,000 over the last 12 months .
the fall in seasonally unadjusted or headline unemployment was also more than expected by analysts , who had forecast a month-on-month fall in june of about 75,000 .

brown also appointed the youngest foreign secretary in 30 years - rising star david miliband .
analysts regard the move to put 41-year-old miliband , a reported critic of the iraq war , in charge of external affairs as an attempt to signal a shift of tone in foreign policy .
" the opportunities and challenges of the modern world require , in my view , a diplomacy that is patient as well as purposeful , which listens as well as leads , " miliband said .
change on iraq bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's new foreign secretary is dubbed the boy wonder because of his youthful looks and his brains blair 's approach to the iraq war has proved extremely unpopular amongst british voters and brown clearly recognizes the need for a change .
miliband 's predecessor margaret beckett was dropped from the cabinet in the reshuffle .
britain has been reducing troop numbers in iraq and now has about 5,500 in the south of the country .
while brown has pledged to stick to britain 's commitments in iraq , there is speculation the withdrawal may speed up .
miliband , whose brother ed is also a member of the new brown government as cabinet office minister , was elected to parliament for the first time in 2001 and has held two cabinet posts since 2005 .
douglas alexander , a loyal brown supporter , was promoted to the department of international development , a key plank of brown 's foreign agenda .

brown 's campaign manager jack straw becomes justice minister .
ed balls , brown 's right-hand man at the treasury , was named as children , schools and families minister .
hilary benn , formerly at international development , becomes environment secretary .
james purnell , a work and pensions minister , was promoted to secretary of state for culture , media and sport .
des browne remains in his post at defense .
brown 's reshuffle saw seven members of the blair cabinet leave altogether .

these plans , which won the second competition staged to find a design for the building , were attacked for being insensitive and even dubbed a " toilet block " by one critic .
the winner of the first competition giorgio grassi had also seen his design blocked - an occurrence not unusual in a country where passions about architecture run high .
" half-hearted " bildunterschrift : only time will tell if chipperfield 's new plans get implemented the new blueprint echoes elements of the existing ensemble with an open staircase and colonnades .
but a number of german newspapers have criticized the revamped architecture .
the süddeutsche zeitung praised some aspects of the design , but described it essentially as being " half-hearted " and " undecided , " while the berliner morgenpost also said it did not form a " convincing whole . "
chipperfield 's building will complete the renovation of the museum island in the spree river , a large museum complex which was damaged in world war ii and and fell into neglect during the communist era .
final touch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bust of the egyptian queen nefertiti is the most famous exhibit in the complex the new building will be called the james simon gallery after a jewish patron of the arts , and will be attached to the pergamon museum , one of berlin 's biggest tourist attractions .
the architect said it would cost about 73 million euros -lrb- $ 98 million -rrb- and be completed in 2012 .
he said the gallery would blend in with the architectural design of the museums and house a conference center and shops .
the architect is also overseeing renovations at the pergamon to restore the facade to its pre-war glory and modernize the museum 's interior .
the pergamon includes a reconstruction of the ishtar gate from babylon with stones from the original structure .
unesco site bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bode museum is the latest museum on the island to be renovated the museum island , which was declared a unesco world heritage site in 1999 , also houses the bode museum , die alte nationalgalerie , the neues museum and the altes museum - best known for its world-famous 3,400-year-old egyptian bust of nefertiti .
the government has spent hundreds of billions of euros restoring the 19th-century complex and the scheme is due to be finished in 2015 .
berlin city authorities expect to attract four million visitors a year once the project is completed . dw-staff with wire reports -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the us says they are key in its war against terrorism but europeans worry the measures erode civil liberties . eu officials said wednesday that the eu and the us had reached a deal following a meeting between franco frattini , the eu justice and home affairs commissioner , michael chertoff , the us secretary for homeland security and wolfgang schäuble , the interior minister of germany which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
" a political agreement in principle was reached , " said roscam abbing , a spokesman for frattini .
data privacy a thorny issue data privacy has been a sticking point between the eu and the us ever since washington intensified anti-terrorism efforts after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks .
following the attacks on new york and washington , the eu and the us signed an agreement under which the eu agreed to grant us authorities access to up to 34 categories of information on passengers on all flights to the us taking off from eu member states .
these included names , addresses , phone numbers and credit card numbers of travelers .
that agreement , which is set to expire on july 31 , had stirred unease among eu lawmakers amid mounting concerns that civil liberties were being eroded in the fight against global terrorism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flying to the us is usually a security hassle for passengers in a letter this month to interior and justice ministers of portugal , which takes over the eu presidency from germany next month , the european data protection supervisor , peter hustinx said eu governments were sacrificing too much of their citizens ' privacy in the fight against terrorism . " i fear that messages such as ' no right to privacy until life and security are guaranteed ' are developing into a mantra suggesting that fundamental rights and freedoms are a luxury that security can not afford , " hustinx wrote . last may , the air travel data deal was annulled by the european court of justice in luxembourg and the two sides reached an interim agreement .
the eu had warned that airlines would be vulnerable to privacy complaints if no replacement deal had been reached before the interim one expired .
though details of the accord reached this week have not been released , german interior minister schäuble told an eu parliamentary briefing in strasbourg that the aim was to reduce the number of stored data on passengers that the us currently receives from 34 to 20 .
it remains unclear what pieces of personal data will be left out from the new us list .
an eu diplomat said under the new arrangement the data would now be kept by the us for 15 years , up from 3 1/2 years in the interim agreement .
the european side also sought to end the us ability to directly access flight booking computers , arguing instead that airlines should send the data .
europeans are the biggest group of travelers to the us .
deal on access to bank data separately , the us and the eu also struck a deal setting conditions for the us treasury department to view records of the international banking network swift in anti-terrorism probes .
european civil liberties group watchdogs had complained that swift , which handles global financial transfers and is based in brussels , violated european privacy laws by allowing the us to secretly consult its records .
washington has argued that the access is essential for its drive to end funding to terror networks .
the us will now only use swift data for counter-terrorism purposes and store it for a maximum of five years , according to the terms of the new deal . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 28.06.2007 germany plays down differences over blair as mideast envoy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair said goodbye to downing street and hello to the middle east german chancellor angela merkel on thursday played down reports of disagreements over the way former british premier tony blair was chosen for his new role as an international middle east peace envoy . merkel said that blair was the unanimous choice of the middle east quartet linking the european union , united nations , russia and the united states in their roles as mediators in the israeli-palestinian conflict . blair would deal directly with the quartet , she said following talks with french prime minister francois fillon in berlin . " the political responsibility will remain as before on the shoulders of the quartet , " she added . on wednesday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier complained of a lack of consultation with members of the quartet before the appointment was made .
germany is the eu 's representative on the panel . washington got its choice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel , right , and french prime minister francois fillon , left , deliver press satatements supporting blair . blair held confidential discussions on the post with washington , which formally recommended him without prior consultation with the other quartet members , press reports said . the united nations announced blair 's appointment just hours after he stepped down as prime minister on wednesday .
the united states had pushed hard for blair - a close friend and ally of president george w. bush - to get the post .
reports said the announcement was apparently delayed because of russian reservations . merkel described blair as a man of great political experience , who could provide an important contribution to finding a solution to the mideast conflict . european media reports said the decision had been made solely between the us and blair behind closed doors .
the quartet was then informed of it later . blair 's power will be limited steinmeier said blair would receive a closely defined mandate .
his work would focus on " institution building in , and political strengthening of , the palestinian authority , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the quartet will keep control of the middle east peace process this limitation was due to the fact " that the quartet itself wants to keep the political task of shaping the middle east peace process in its own hands , " steinmeier said .
the minister did n't express any doubts about blair 's qualification for the post .
but at the same time , he did n't explicitly praise blair either . according to media reports , there are concerns in berlin that blair could seize the diplomatic process in the middle east and therefore harm the quartet 's work .
other eu member states fear that blair could weaken the position of eu foreign policy chief javier solana , who has been working on solutions to the arab-israeli conflict for years . " solana is a member of the quartet while blair will be working for the quartet , " steinmeier said .
" the difference is clear . " russia held back un spokeswoman michele montas said on wednesday that blair would " mobilize international assistance to the palestinians , working closely with donors and existing coordination bodies . "
his tasks included helping to identify and secure " appropriate international support in addressing the institutional governance needs of the palestinian state , " she said . blair 's work would be " in support of the agreed quartet objectives , " montas said . a small team of experts based in jerusalem will support blair , who will spend significant time in the region , montas added . russia had previously stalled blair 's appointment .
according to german officials , russia had held back its support because of the lack of consultation on the move .
only on tuesday did moscow give its assent . allies support blair 's appointment although he is well respected in israel , the arab world has sharply criticized blair for britain 's role in the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq , as well as his support of israel 's war in lebanon last summer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana is a key architect of the roadmap for peace in the middle east but blair won backing from his allies for his new role . " tony will help palestinians develop the political and economic institutions they will need for a democratic , sovereign state able to provide for its people and live in peace and security with israel , " bush said . palestinian president mahmud abbas and israel also expressed their approval .
israeli prime minister ehud olmert " believes that blair can have a favorable impact , in particular by helping the palestinians develop solid governmental structures , " his spokeswoman miri eisin said . but the hamas movement controlling the gaza strip said the appointment " is not acceptable to hamas nor to the palestinians . " the middle east quartet has tried to implement a " roadmap " for israeli-palestinian peace since 2003 .
but the three-stage blueprint that should have led to the creation of a palestinian state living side by side in peace with israel by 2005 has since decayed . the post of quartet representative had been vacant since former world bank chairman james wolfensohn resigned in frustration in may 2006 . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the political responsibility will remain as before on the shoulders of the quartet , " she added . on wednesday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier complained of a lack of consultation with members of the quartet before the appointment was made .
germany is the eu 's representative on the panel . washington got its choice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel , right , and french prime minister francois fillon , left , deliver press satatements supporting blair . blair held confidential discussions on the post with washington , which formally recommended him without prior consultation with the other quartet members , press reports said . the united nations announced blair 's appointment just hours after he stepped down as prime minister on wednesday .
the united states had pushed hard for blair - a close friend and ally of president george w. bush - to get the post .
reports said the announcement was apparently delayed because of russian reservations . merkel described blair as a man of great political experience , who could provide an important contribution to finding a solution to the mideast conflict . european media reports said the decision had been made solely between the us and blair behind closed doors .
the quartet was then informed of it later . blair 's power will be limited steinmeier said blair would receive a closely defined mandate .
his work would focus on " institution building in , and political strengthening of , the palestinian authority , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the quartet will keep control of the middle east peace process this limitation was due to the fact " that the quartet itself wants to keep the political task of shaping the middle east peace process in its own hands , " steinmeier said .
the minister did n't express any doubts about blair 's qualification for the post .
but at the same time , he did n't explicitly praise blair either . according to media reports , there are concerns in berlin that blair could seize the diplomatic process in the middle east and therefore harm the quartet 's work .
other eu member states fear that blair could weaken the position of eu foreign policy chief javier solana , who has been working on solutions to the arab-israeli conflict for years . " solana is a member of the quartet while blair will be working for the quartet , " steinmeier said .
" the difference is clear . " russia held back un spokeswoman michele montas said on wednesday that blair would " mobilize international assistance to the palestinians , working closely with donors and existing coordination bodies . "
his tasks included helping to identify and secure " appropriate international support in addressing the institutional governance needs of the palestinian state , " she said . blair 's work would be " in support of the agreed quartet objectives , " montas said . a small team of experts based in jerusalem will support blair , who will spend significant time in the region , montas added . russia had previously stalled blair 's appointment .
according to german officials , russia had held back its support because of the lack of consultation on the move .
only on tuesday did moscow give its assent . allies support blair 's appointment although he is well respected in israel , the arab world has sharply criticized blair for britain 's role in the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq , as well as his support of israel 's war in lebanon last summer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana is a key architect of the roadmap for peace in the middle east but blair won backing from his allies for his new role . " tony will help palestinians develop the political and economic institutions they will need for a democratic , sovereign state able to provide for its people and live in peace and security with israel , " bush said . palestinian president mahmud abbas and israel also expressed their approval .
israeli prime minister ehud olmert " believes that blair can have a favorable impact , in particular by helping the palestinians develop solid governmental structures , " his spokeswoman miri eisin said . but the hamas movement controlling the gaza strip said the appointment " is not acceptable to hamas nor to the palestinians . " the middle east quartet has tried to implement a " roadmap " for israeli-palestinian peace since 2003 .
but the three-stage blueprint that should have led to the creation of a palestinian state living side by side in peace with israel by 2005 has since decayed . the post of quartet representative had been vacant since former world bank chairman james wolfensohn resigned in frustration in may 2006 . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the future of the internet is now germans hesitant to look for love online " the synapses of a collective brain are growing " the internet and everyday life : the constant revolution the future is now internet -pipe- 28.06.2007 wikipedia founder : " great ideas come from different places " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikipedia founder jimmi wales its critics said it would n't last but the online encyclopaedia wikipedia has gone on to become one of the world 's most popular websites .
founder jimmy wales spoke to dw-world about the secret of its success . jimmy wales was born in alabama , usa , in 1966 .
he studied finance and worked as a research director at the chicago stock exchange .
in 2001 he founded wikipedia which is a multilingual , web-based , free content encyclopedia project .
it is written collaboratively by volunteers .
the vast majority of its articles can be edited by anyone with access to the internet .
from 2003 to 2006 , jimmy wales was headed the wikimedia foundation , wikipedia 's non-profit parent organization .
in 2004 , he founded the for-profit internet portal wikia , which is now supposed to carry on his newest project , the search engine wikia search .
jimmy wales lives in florida with his wife and his daughter . dw-world : a famous american magazine has chosen you as one of the 100 people who shape our world .
how does it feel to be a world shaper ?
jimmy wales : i thought that was sort of funny .
i enjoyed it of course , but tyra banks - the supermodel - was also on the list .
so i don ’ t know how meaningful it really is .
but i feel a real sense of responsibility that i am in a position where i can have some influence and i can say something people listen to .
i try not to say very much because of that .
because i want to make sure that what i do say is something that i can really believe in .
equality , unlimited faculty , no hierarchy : is that just the philosophy of wikipedia or is it your philosophy of life in general ?
that is pretty much my philosophy .
a lot of wikipedia reflects things that i believe in very strongly .
sometimes people think if you believe that everyone should participate then you think right and wrong don ‘ t matter and everybody ’ s opinion is as good as everyone else ’ s .
it may seem paradoxical to them , but , no , i think that some people are really not that smart and that they are not that useful .
but leaving open the possibility for participation means that we are able to get a lot of great ideas from lots of different places .
wikipedia owes its success to the community , to all the people who write articles every day without getting paid .
why do they do that for wikipedia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikipedia has 75,000 contributors in over 100 languages .
i think there are two reasons .
one reason is that the charity of our mission is inspiring a lot of people .
but i think that ’ s a fairly limited reason .
the main reason is that it ’ s fun .
the people just enjoy the process , they enjoy meeting other intellectual people , it ’ s a great hobby .
we know that intuitively if we think about people plying football on the weekends .
we don ’ t say : " gee , gosh , you 're going to play football and you don ’ t get paid for that ? ”
that ’ s silly , right ?
obviously people are doing it because they enjoy it and they have fun .
it is a similar thing with wikipedia .
some people earn a lot of money writing but others can do it just for fun .
you seem to do it just for fun too .
because although wikipedia is very successful you are not earning any money because it is a charitable project .
do you sometimes think that you did something wrong ?
i always joke that when i registered wikipedia as a non-profit organization , it was either the dumbest thing or the smartest thing i ever did .
the dumbest for the obvious reason that i get to hang out with billionaires but i don ’ t have any money .
the smartest , though , because i don ‘ t think it could have been nearly as successful as it is and also because i think it will be remembered in the future .
100 or 200 years from now people will point to wikipedia and say : that was a really good thing that did something beneficial for the world .
so that is something i am very proud of .
why wouldn ’ t it have worked out as a commercial organization ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new era of user generated content and social networking is often referred to as web 2.0 i think that for an encyclopedia that is really attempting this very grand ethical mission of sharing knowledge with everyone , being a non-profit organization is really the right approach .
it means that , as a community , we have the luxury of doing things the right way rather than doing things in a way that is dictated by current economic circumstances .
the internet video platform you tube was sold for $ 1.65 billion -lrb- 1.23 billion euros -rrb- .
how much would sell wikipedia for ?
i don ’ t know what it ’ s worth , it ’ s really interesting .
it has very low revenue .
but i guess you could slap ads all over it and make some money .
i think the wikimedia foundation - the owner of wikipedia - could in fact sell it .
nobody ’ s interested in doing that , but certainly if there was an offer of $ 3 billion , i think the foundation would have to seriously think about what could be done for the charitable purposes of the foundation in distributing free knowledge if we outsourced the community or something .
your new project , the search engine wikia search , which will launch at the end of this year , will be commercial .
why did you change your mind ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wales aims to challenge google 's dominance in the search engine market .
for some types of projects - if you think about running hospitals or the red cross - the charitable model works well .
people are willing to donate money , enough to make it last .
but for other things like running a chain of grocery stores , there have never been very successful charities that have done such things .
i think different kinds of work demands different kinds of organization .
there are so many search engines on the internet already .
why does the world actually need another one ?
the search engines we have right now are black boxes and not transparent .
they are not community controlled and the quality is ... well , it 's pretty good but it stagnated the last two or three years .
there are lots of ways in which searches have not improved as much as a lot of us would have liked .
i don ’ t know how to improve search beyond what already exists .
but i do think that a broad community of people and an open scientific dialogue about how to do that can probably make some progress .
anyway it ’ s fun .
i always do the most fun thing .
and what will be the next big thing coming up on the internet ?
i don ’ t know .
i always remind people that five years ago , i was just this guy sitting at home in my pajamas typing on the internet .
and now i get asked deep questions about the future .
the trend i see right now is that we are very much at the beginning of free licensing of culture .
and we are still very much at the beginning of the design of communities for producing good quality work .
so i think that there is still a lot of room in those areas . christine elsaesser interviewed jimmy wales send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the political responsibility will remain as before on the shoulders of the quartet , " she added . on wednesday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier complained of a lack of consultation with members of the quartet before the appointment was made .
germany is the eu 's representative on the panel . washington got its choice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel , right , and french prime minister francois fillon , left , deliver press satatements supporting blair . blair held confidential discussions on the post with washington , which formally recommended him without prior consultation with the other quartet members , press reports said . the united nations announced blair 's appointment just hours after he stepped down as prime minister on wednesday .
the united states had pushed hard for blair - a close friend and ally of president george w. bush - to get the post .
reports said the announcement was apparently delayed because of russian reservations . merkel described blair as a man of great political experience , who could provide an important contribution to finding a solution to the mideast conflict . european media reports said the decision had been made solely between the us and blair behind closed doors .
the quartet was then informed of it later . blair 's power will be limited steinmeier said blair would receive a closely defined mandate .
his work would focus on " institution building in , and political strengthening of , the palestinian authority , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the quartet will keep control of the middle east peace process this limitation was due to the fact " that the quartet itself wants to keep the political task of shaping the middle east peace process in its own hands , " steinmeier said .
the minister did n't express any doubts about blair 's qualification for the post .
but at the same time , he did n't explicitly praise blair either . according to media reports , there are concerns in berlin that blair could seize the diplomatic process in the middle east and therefore harm the quartet 's work .
other eu member states fear that blair could weaken the position of eu foreign policy chief javier solana , who has been working on solutions to the arab-israeli conflict for years . " solana is a member of the quartet while blair will be working for the quartet , " steinmeier said .
" the difference is clear . " russia held back un spokeswoman michele montas said on wednesday that blair would " mobilize international assistance to the palestinians , working closely with donors and existing coordination bodies . "
his tasks included helping to identify and secure " appropriate international support in addressing the institutional governance needs of the palestinian state , " she said . blair 's work would be " in support of the agreed quartet objectives , " montas said . a small team of experts based in jerusalem will support blair , who will spend significant time in the region , montas added . russia had previously stalled blair 's appointment .
according to german officials , russia had held back its support because of the lack of consultation on the move .
only on tuesday did moscow give its assent . allies support blair 's appointment although he is well respected in israel , the arab world has sharply criticized blair for britain 's role in the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq , as well as his support of israel 's war in lebanon last summer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana is a key architect of the roadmap for peace in the middle east but blair won backing from his allies for his new role . " tony will help palestinians develop the political and economic institutions they will need for a democratic , sovereign state able to provide for its people and live in peace and security with israel , " bush said . palestinian president mahmud abbas and israel also expressed their approval .
israeli prime minister ehud olmert " believes that blair can have a favorable impact , in particular by helping the palestinians develop solid governmental structures , " his spokeswoman miri eisin said . but the hamas movement controlling the gaza strip said the appointment " is not acceptable to hamas nor to the palestinians . " the middle east quartet has tried to implement a " roadmap " for israeli-palestinian peace since 2003 .
but the three-stage blueprint that should have led to the creation of a palestinian state living side by side in peace with israel by 2005 has since decayed . the post of quartet representative had been vacant since former world bank chairman james wolfensohn resigned in frustration in may 2006 . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the future of the internet is now germans hesitant to look for love online " the synapses of a collective brain are growing " the internet and everyday life : the constant revolution the future is now internet -pipe- 28.06.2007 wikipedia founder : " great ideas come from different places " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikipedia founder jimmi wales its critics said it would n't last but the online encyclopaedia wikipedia has gone on to become one of the world 's most popular websites .
founder jimmy wales spoke to dw-world about the secret of its success . jimmy wales was born in alabama , usa , in 1966 .
he studied finance and worked as a research director at the chicago stock exchange .
in 2001 he founded wikipedia which is a multilingual , web-based , free content encyclopedia project .
it is written collaboratively by volunteers .
the vast majority of its articles can be edited by anyone with access to the internet .
from 2003 to 2006 , jimmy wales was headed the wikimedia foundation , wikipedia 's non-profit parent organization .
in 2004 , he founded the for-profit internet portal wikia , which is now supposed to carry on his newest project , the search engine wikia search .
jimmy wales lives in florida with his wife and his daughter . dw-world : a famous american magazine has chosen you as one of the 100 people who shape our world .
how does it feel to be a world shaper ?
jimmy wales : i thought that was sort of funny .
i enjoyed it of course , but tyra banks - the supermodel - was also on the list .
so i don ’ t know how meaningful it really is .
but i feel a real sense of responsibility that i am in a position where i can have some influence and i can say something people listen to .
i try not to say very much because of that .
because i want to make sure that what i do say is something that i can really believe in .
equality , unlimited faculty , no hierarchy : is that just the philosophy of wikipedia or is it your philosophy of life in general ?
that is pretty much my philosophy .
a lot of wikipedia reflects things that i believe in very strongly .
sometimes people think if you believe that everyone should participate then you think right and wrong don ‘ t matter and everybody ’ s opinion is as good as everyone else ’ s .
it may seem paradoxical to them , but , no , i think that some people are really not that smart and that they are not that useful .
but leaving open the possibility for participation means that we are able to get a lot of great ideas from lots of different places .
wikipedia owes its success to the community , to all the people who write articles every day without getting paid .
why do they do that for wikipedia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikipedia has 75,000 contributors in over 100 languages .
i think there are two reasons .
one reason is that the charity of our mission is inspiring a lot of people .
but i think that ’ s a fairly limited reason .
the main reason is that it ’ s fun .
the people just enjoy the process , they enjoy meeting other intellectual people , it ’ s a great hobby .
we know that intuitively if we think about people plying football on the weekends .
we don ’ t say : " gee , gosh , you 're going to play football and you don ’ t get paid for that ? ”
that ’ s silly , right ?
obviously people are doing it because they enjoy it and they have fun .
it is a similar thing with wikipedia .
some people earn a lot of money writing but others can do it just for fun .
you seem to do it just for fun too .
because although wikipedia is very successful you are not earning any money because it is a charitable project .
do you sometimes think that you did something wrong ?
i always joke that when i registered wikipedia as a non-profit organization , it was either the dumbest thing or the smartest thing i ever did .
the dumbest for the obvious reason that i get to hang out with billionaires but i don ’ t have any money .
the smartest , though , because i don ‘ t think it could have been nearly as successful as it is and also because i think it will be remembered in the future .
100 or 200 years from now people will point to wikipedia and say : that was a really good thing that did something beneficial for the world .
so that is something i am very proud of .
why wouldn ’ t it have worked out as a commercial organization ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new era of user generated content and social networking is often referred to as web 2.0 i think that for an encyclopedia that is really attempting this very grand ethical mission of sharing knowledge with everyone , being a non-profit organization is really the right approach .
it means that , as a community , we have the luxury of doing things the right way rather than doing things in a way that is dictated by current economic circumstances .
the internet video platform you tube was sold for $ 1.65 billion -lrb- 1.23 billion euros -rrb- .
how much would sell wikipedia for ?
i don ’ t know what it ’ s worth , it ’ s really interesting .
it has very low revenue .
but i guess you could slap ads all over it and make some money .
i think the wikimedia foundation - the owner of wikipedia - could in fact sell it .
nobody ’ s interested in doing that , but certainly if there was an offer of $ 3 billion , i think the foundation would have to seriously think about what could be done for the charitable purposes of the foundation in distributing free knowledge if we outsourced the community or something .
your new project , the search engine wikia search , which will launch at the end of this year , will be commercial .
why did you change your mind ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wales aims to challenge google 's dominance in the search engine market .
for some types of projects - if you think about running hospitals or the red cross - the charitable model works well .
people are willing to donate money , enough to make it last .
but for other things like running a chain of grocery stores , there have never been very successful charities that have done such things .
i think different kinds of work demands different kinds of organization .
there are so many search engines on the internet already .
why does the world actually need another one ?
the search engines we have right now are black boxes and not transparent .
they are not community controlled and the quality is ... well , it 's pretty good but it stagnated the last two or three years .
there are lots of ways in which searches have not improved as much as a lot of us would have liked .
i don ’ t know how to improve search beyond what already exists .
but i do think that a broad community of people and an open scientific dialogue about how to do that can probably make some progress .
anyway it ’ s fun .
i always do the most fun thing .
and what will be the next big thing coming up on the internet ?
i don ’ t know .
i always remind people that five years ago , i was just this guy sitting at home in my pajamas typing on the internet .
and now i get asked deep questions about the future .
the trend i see right now is that we are very much at the beginning of free licensing of culture .
and we are still very much at the beginning of the design of communities for producing good quality work .
so i think that there is still a lot of room in those areas . christine elsaesser interviewed jimmy wales send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

these plans , which won the second competition staged to find a design for the building , were attacked for being insensitive and even dubbed a " toilet block " by one critic .
the winner of the first competition giorgio grassi had also seen his design blocked - an occurrence not unusual in a country where passions about architecture run high .
" half-hearted " bildunterschrift : only time will tell if chipperfield 's new plans get implemented the new blueprint echoes elements of the existing ensemble with an open staircase and colonnades .
but a number of german newspapers have criticized the revamped architecture .
the süddeutsche zeitung praised some aspects of the design , but described it essentially as being " half-hearted " and " undecided , " while the berliner morgenpost also said it did not form a " convincing whole . "
chipperfield 's building will complete the renovation of the museum island in the spree river , a large museum complex which was damaged in world war ii and and fell into neglect during the communist era .
final touch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bust of the egyptian queen nefertiti is the most famous exhibit in the complex the new building will be called the james simon gallery after a jewish patron of the arts , and will be attached to the pergamon museum , one of berlin 's biggest tourist attractions .
the architect said it would cost about 73 million euros -lrb- $ 98 million -rrb- and be completed in 2012 .
he said the gallery would blend in with the architectural design of the museums and house a conference center and shops .
the architect is also overseeing renovations at the pergamon to restore the facade to its pre-war glory and modernize the museum 's interior .
the pergamon includes a reconstruction of the ishtar gate from babylon with stones from the original structure .

the procedure is a breakthrough in bio-technology and fuels hope of a cure for aids . the laboratory procedure removing the aids virus used an enzyme , said joachim hauber of the heinrich pette institute for experimental virology and immunology in hamburg . " we have rid the cells of the virus , " hauber said on thursday .
" no one else has done this before . "
he called it " a breakthrough in bio-technology . " hauber said it was his " cautious " hope that a cure for aids could be found within 10 years . current therapies can only limit the spread of the human immunodeficiency virus -lrb- hiv -rrb- and not remove it from the body .
hiv is a retrovirus that nests in the dna or key genetic material of infected cells . the max planck institute for molecular cell biology and genetics in dresden was the partner in the research , which will be reported in friday 's issue of the scientific journal science . cutting dna and recombining it three years of experiments on mice were planned next , to be followed by tests on humans in hamburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the enzyme knows just where to cut the dna the scientists ' method used the ability of so-called recombinase enzymes to cut strands of dna at certain places like a pair of scissors and recombine the strands . the new enzyme , tre , always recognized the right spot to snip the dna where the hiv started .
the scientists said it recognized a characteristic hiv sequence that scarcely ever mutated . tre was adapted from an existing natural enzyme , cre , which recognized similar genetic sequences . stem cells necessary for therapy the laboratories artificially evolved cre into tre through more than 120 recombinase generations .
hauber said the cell then flushed out the snipped-away dna as waste . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists have been analyzing the hiv virus for years " after that , it is healthy , " hauber said . any therapy , though , would require stem cells to be obtained from a patient 's blood .
they would then be treated in the laboratory and re-injected to regenerate a healthy immune system , hauber said . " it 's high-tech medicine , " hauber said .

we are unusual , as british people go , but for my husband and me , germany is probably our favorite holiday destination and one reason for that is the stunning variety on offer .
each state has its own culture , architecture and natural scenery .
looking for new places to explore and discover , we started going east a couple of years ago and we were not disappointed - far from it .
from large , culture-rich cities like dresden and weimar to small , historic towns like meissen and quedlinburg , we 've found much to recommend .
there is so much history to explore and we have found the local people extremely welcoming , very helpful and eager to provide an excellent service to visitors .
our only surprise has been the low numbers of other visitors -lrb- especially other western europeans -rrb- .
if you do n't go soon , then you 'll be missing something extraordinary precisely because it is a place in transition , yet still , in parts , clinging to its unique identity and culture .
this will go in time , as is the way in a globalized society , so make the most of it while you can ! - liz , great britain eurail is a great bargain !
if you can , buy a pass .
trains in germany make our amtrak look like the trash it is .
i also recommend public transport in german cities .
germany was smart when they kept trams in their cities .
dresden is a great art treasure and we plan to return soon .
i also recommend leipzig , especially if you enjoy baroque and classical music . - samuel r. ganczaruk , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : take a christmas cruise , recommended a reader we are a group of spaniards visiting frankfurt .
at the suggestion of one local we went yesterday to a typical frankfurt cider tavern called zur sonne .
people here told us not to go to sachsenhausen -lrb- trashy and touristy , full of irish pubs and caipirinha bars these days -rrb- but rather to the north end and bornheim district , which are very young and picturesque .
apple wine , as everyone warned us , takes some " getting used to " but after a few glasses it tastes almost like a good penedes !

we are unusual , as british people go , but for my husband and me , germany is probably our favorite holiday destination and one reason for that is the stunning variety on offer .
each state has its own culture , architecture and natural scenery .
looking for new places to explore and discover , we started going east a couple of years ago and we were not disappointed - far from it .
from large , culture-rich cities like dresden and weimar to small , historic towns like meissen and quedlinburg , we 've found much to recommend .
there is so much history to explore and we have found the local people extremely welcoming , very helpful and eager to provide an excellent service to visitors .
our only surprise has been the low numbers of other visitors -lrb- especially other western europeans -rrb- .
if you do n't go soon , then you 'll be missing something extraordinary precisely because it is a place in transition , yet still , in parts , clinging to its unique identity and culture .
this will go in time , as is the way in a globalized society , so make the most of it while you can ! - liz , great britain eurail is a great bargain !

trains in germany make our amtrak look like the trash it is .

that would be a spontaneous reaction to blair 's appointment as middle east envoy .
actually , just about anyone who did n't have the colonial past of a briton in the middle east , had not driven the iraq war as a " lap dog " of the american president and not delayed a truce during the lebanon war last year as blair did would have been a better person for the job .
despite these facts , the mideast quartet - which comprises the us , the eu , the un and russia - chose the former british prime minister as the new mideast envoy .
the quartet did n't seem to have any serious reservations about the appointment .
even the russians did n't seem to have any doubts about blair 's skills as a trouble shooter despite being at loggerheads with him in the scandal involving the murder of a former russian agent .
but can the former british premier position himself as a neutral representative and mediator ?
you have to doubt it in light of his close alliance with the us and israel .
the question is whether blair will really mediate in the ongoing trouble in the middle east .
his responsibility largely lies in helping the palestinian parties lift themselves out of the crisis .
he is meant to help the palestinians build democratic institutions and in the course of that job he will naturally have to often report to washington to request specific american help .
given his excellent ties with the white house , that should be easy for blair as compared with honorable representatives from second-tier friendly nations .
there 's no disputing that less mistrust of the mideast envoy would make his job easier .
but in the past even american jews such as henry kissinger or dennis ross have successfully mediated in the middle east on behalf of the white house .
why should blair not have the same success on behalf of the mideast quartet ?
especially considering that it will be the quartet and not blair who will decide which direction to take .
that decision too will be limited since the direction is long well known ; it 's that path that negotiators ca n't agree on .
during his farewell speech to the house of commons , blair declared that the middle east must have place for two states - israel and palestine .
by now all sensible and right-minded individuals accept that formula and it also forms the core of the " roadmap " of the middle east aimed to resolve the conflict .
the arab league too is committed to the " two state " solution .
only radical groups continue to reject it .
but then again nobody would try to talk peace with them .
that 's why blair might succeed in moving things along .
and if he does n't then he would n't be the first to fail at the task .

that would be a spontaneous reaction to blair 's appointment as middle east envoy .
actually , just about anyone who did n't have the colonial past of a briton in the middle east , had not driven the iraq war as a " lap dog " of the american president and not delayed a truce during the lebanon war last year as blair did would have been a better person for the job .
despite these facts , the mideast quartet - which comprises the us , the eu , the un and russia - chose the former british prime minister as the new mideast envoy .
the quartet did n't seem to have any serious reservations about the appointment .
even the russians did n't seem to have any doubts about blair 's skills as a trouble shooter despite being at loggerheads with him in the scandal involving the murder of a former russian agent .
but can the former british premier position himself as a neutral representative and mediator ?
you have to doubt it in light of his close alliance with the us and israel .
the question is whether blair will really mediate in the ongoing trouble in the middle east .
his responsibility largely lies in helping the palestinian parties lift themselves out of the crisis .
he is meant to help the palestinians build democratic institutions and in the course of that job he will naturally have to often report to washington to request specific american help .
given his excellent ties with the white house , that should be easy for blair as compared with honorable representatives from second-tier friendly nations .
there 's no disputing that less mistrust of the mideast envoy would make his job easier .
but in the past even american jews such as henry kissinger or dennis ross have successfully mediated in the middle east on behalf of the white house .
why should blair not have the same success on behalf of the mideast quartet ?
especially considering that it will be the quartet and not blair who will decide which direction to take .
that decision too will be limited since the direction is long well known ; it 's that path that negotiators ca n't agree on .
during his farewell speech to the house of commons , blair declared that the middle east must have place for two states - israel and palestine .
by now all sensible and right-minded individuals accept that formula and it also forms the core of the " roadmap " of the middle east aimed to resolve the conflict .

analysts had forecast that seasonally adjusted unemployment would drop by 20,000 from may , when the jobless rate stood at 9.2 per cent .
" the driver is the good economic performance , " said alexander koch , an economist at the hypovereinsbank .
he added that employers were now complaining of growing labor shortages in key sectors of the economy .
consumer confidence gaining in strength job vacancies rose by 11.6 percent to 648,096 , thursday 's data showed as chancellor angela merkel 's government considers possible measures which could ease the way for skilled foreign workers to enter the german labor market to fill gaps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers are n't holding back falling unemployment has also helped to shore up consumer confidence in germany where stagnating household spending has been a drag on economic growth in recent years .
german consumer confidence is at a six-month high , a survey released this week showed .
predictions of higher wages in the nation are helping to fuel optimism among the nation 's consumers , the survey said .
the number of unemployed fell by 26,000 in the economically more important western part of the nation , the labor agency said , and by 11,000 in the nation 's former communist east .
growth could exceed 2.8 percent amid signs that the german economy has rebounded unexpectedly strongly from the hefty and unpopular hike in the nation 's value-added tax in january and this year 's us economic slowdown , economists have been revising upwards their 2007 growth forecasts for germany .
many economists now project german economic growth to match or possibly surpass last year 's perky 2.8 percent expansion rate .
but with two major economic sentiment surveys - the zew investor confidence report and the ifo business confidence index - recently pointing down , analysts also say that the nation 's economic expansion could be starting to plateau out .
indeed , germany 's retail traders ' association -lrb- hde -rrb- said on thursday it expected 2007 retail sales to fall in real terms after a difficult start to the year .
pollitically sensitive data in the meantime , thursday 's jobless figures showed the politically-sensitive unadjusted labor market data also fell in june , dropping by 25,000 from may to 3.687 million in june with the unemployment rate edging down 0.3 percentage points to 8.8 percent .
" the demand for workers has increased again , " said federal labor agency chief frank jürgen weise .
the june unadjusted unemployment figures represented a 712,000 decline compared to june 2006 , when the jobless rate stood at 10.5 percent .
this represents an average monthly fall of 60,000 over the last 12 months .
the fall in seasonally unadjusted or headline unemployment was also more than expected by analysts , who had forecast a month-on-month fall in june of about 75,000 .
while the economists see the seasonally adjusted data as pointing to trends in the labor market , the headline data has become more politically significant in germany . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" anybody who tries to weigh up the dead of the second world war against votes in the -lrb- eu -rrb- council has to be rejected out of hand , " martin schulz , leader of the socialist group in the european parliament , told fellow lawmakers in brussels on wednesday to loud applause .
" the eu is an idea aimed at eliminating the specters of the past ...

schulz was referring to kacyznski 's remarks that poland deserved more voting power in the eu because its population would have been far larger if it had not been decimated during the nazi era .
the prime minister compounded matters on tuesday when he compared modern-day germany to the era that brought adolf hitler to power .

but eckart von klaeden , the foreign policy spokesman for the conservative cdu / csu bloc , has also called for the matter to be approached in a more relaxed manner .
he told the hannoversche allgemeine zeitung that press freedom also protected things that people might regard as stupid or tasteless .
von klaeden also referred to a caricature that appeared in germany 's taz newspaper a year ago that compared the polish president as " poland 's new potato . "
at that time berlin responded to protests from warsaw by referring to the freedom of the press .
" exactly the same standards should apply with regards to the cover of a polish magazine , " he said .

" anybody who tries to weigh up the dead of the second world war against votes in the -lrb- eu -rrb- council has to be rejected out of hand , " martin schulz , leader of the socialist group in the european parliament , told fellow lawmakers in brussels on wednesday to loud applause .
" the eu is an idea aimed at eliminating the specters of the past ...
we will not permit the few to bring up those specters , " he added .
schulz was referring to kacyznski 's remarks that poland deserved more voting power in the eu because its population would have been far larger if it had not been decimated during the nazi era .
the prime minister compounded matters on tuesday when he compared modern-day germany to the era that brought adolf hitler to power .

he praised germany for avoiding any kind of " demonstration of power " in its role as holder of the eu presidency vis-a-vis poland and other eu states and praised german chancellor angela merkel 's pleasant " new leadership style . "
poland eventually won concessions at the summit , notably a delay to the introduction of the new voting system which it opposed , but faced criticism for its negotiating manner .
the german chancellor continues to seek to play down the dispute with poland .
" for us our polish neighbor has the same importance as our french neighbor , " she said in a speech on wednesday in brussels .
she has not commented on a controversial caricature of her that appeared on the front cover of the conservative polish magazine wprost on monday .

he told the hannoversche allgemeine zeitung that press freedom also protected things that people might regard as stupid or tasteless .

analysts had forecast that seasonally adjusted unemployment would drop by 20,000 from may , when the jobless rate stood at 9.2 per cent .
" the driver is the good economic performance , " said alexander koch , an economist at the hypovereinsbank .
he added that employers were now complaining of growing labor shortages in key sectors of the economy .

german consumer confidence is at a six-month high , a survey released this week showed .
predictions of higher wages in the nation are helping to fuel optimism among the nation 's consumers , the survey said .
the number of unemployed fell by 26,000 in the economically more important western part of the nation , the labor agency said , and by 11,000 in the nation 's former communist east .
growth could exceed 2.8 percent amid signs that the german economy has rebounded unexpectedly strongly from the hefty and unpopular hike in the nation 's value-added tax in january and this year 's us economic slowdown , economists have been revising upwards their 2007 growth forecasts for germany .
many economists now project german economic growth to match or possibly surpass last year 's perky 2.8 percent expansion rate .
but with two major economic sentiment surveys - the zew investor confidence report and the ifo business confidence index - recently pointing down , analysts also say that the nation 's economic expansion could be starting to plateau out .
indeed , germany 's retail traders ' association -lrb- hde -rrb- said on thursday it expected 2007 retail sales to fall in real terms after a difficult start to the year .

" the demand for workers has increased again , " said federal labor agency chief frank jürgen weise .
the june unadjusted unemployment figures represented a 712,000 decline compared to june 2006 , when the jobless rate stood at 10.5 percent .
this represents an average monthly fall of 60,000 over the last 12 months .
the fall in seasonally unadjusted or headline unemployment was also more than expected by analysts , who had forecast a month-on-month fall in june of about 75,000 .

" the political responsibility will remain as before on the shoulders of the quartet , " she added . on wednesday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier complained of a lack of consultation with members of the quartet before the appointment was made .
germany is the eu 's representative on the panel . washington got its choice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel , right , and french prime minister francois fillon , left , deliver press satatements supporting blair . blair held confidential discussions on the post with washington , which formally recommended him without prior consultation with the other quartet members , press reports said . the united nations announced blair 's appointment just hours after he stepped down as prime minister on wednesday .
the united states had pushed hard for blair - a close friend and ally of president george w. bush - to get the post .
reports said the announcement was apparently delayed because of russian reservations . merkel described blair as a man of great political experience , who could provide an important contribution to finding a solution to the mideast conflict . european media reports said the decision had been made solely between the us and blair behind closed doors .
the quartet was then informed of it later . blair 's power will be limited steinmeier said blair would receive a closely defined mandate .
his work would focus on " institution building in , and political strengthening of , the palestinian authority , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the quartet will keep control of the middle east peace process this limitation was due to the fact " that the quartet itself wants to keep the political task of shaping the middle east peace process in its own hands , " steinmeier said .
the minister did n't express any doubts about blair 's qualification for the post .
but at the same time , he did n't explicitly praise blair either . according to media reports , there are concerns in berlin that blair could seize the diplomatic process in the middle east and therefore harm the quartet 's work .
other eu member states fear that blair could weaken the position of eu foreign policy chief javier solana , who has been working on solutions to the arab-israeli conflict for years . " solana is a member of the quartet while blair will be working for the quartet , " steinmeier said .
" the difference is clear . " russia held back un spokeswoman michele montas said on wednesday that blair would " mobilize international assistance to the palestinians , working closely with donors and existing coordination bodies . "
his tasks included helping to identify and secure " appropriate international support in addressing the institutional governance needs of the palestinian state , " she said . blair 's work would be " in support of the agreed quartet objectives , " montas said . a small team of experts based in jerusalem will support blair , who will spend significant time in the region , montas added . russia had previously stalled blair 's appointment .
according to german officials , russia had held back its support because of the lack of consultation on the move .
only on tuesday did moscow give its assent . allies support blair 's appointment although he is well respected in israel , the arab world has sharply criticized blair for britain 's role in the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq , as well as his support of israel 's war in lebanon last summer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana is a key architect of the roadmap for peace in the middle east but blair won backing from his allies for his new role . " tony will help palestinians develop the political and economic institutions they will need for a democratic , sovereign state able to provide for its people and live in peace and security with israel , " bush said . palestinian president mahmud abbas and israel also expressed their approval .

germany is the eu 's representative on the panel . washington got its choice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel , right , and french prime minister francois fillon , left , deliver press satatements supporting blair . blair held confidential discussions on the post with washington , which formally recommended him without prior consultation with the other quartet members , press reports said . the united nations announced blair 's appointment just hours after he stepped down as prime minister on wednesday .
the united states had pushed hard for blair - a close friend and ally of president george w. bush - to get the post .

his tasks included helping to identify and secure " appropriate international support in addressing the institutional governance needs of the palestinian state , " she said . blair 's work would be " in support of the agreed quartet objectives , " montas said . a small team of experts based in jerusalem will support blair , who will spend significant time in the region , montas added . russia had previously stalled blair 's appointment .
according to german officials , russia had held back its support because of the lack of consultation on the move .
only on tuesday did moscow give its assent . allies support blair 's appointment although he is well respected in israel , the arab world has sharply criticized blair for britain 's role in the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq , as well as his support of israel 's war in lebanon last summer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana is a key architect of the roadmap for peace in the middle east but blair won backing from his allies for his new role .

analysts had forecast that seasonally adjusted unemployment would drop by 20,000 from may , when the jobless rate stood at 9.2 per cent .
" the driver is the good economic performance , " said alexander koch , an economist at the hypovereinsbank .
he added that employers were now complaining of growing labor shortages in key sectors of the economy .
consumer confidence gaining in strength job vacancies rose by 11.6 percent to 648,096 , thursday 's data showed as chancellor angela merkel 's government considers possible measures which could ease the way for skilled foreign workers to enter the german labor market to fill gaps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers are n't holding back falling unemployment has also helped to shore up consumer confidence in germany where stagnating household spending has been a drag on economic growth in recent years .
german consumer confidence is at a six-month high , a survey released this week showed .
predictions of higher wages in the nation are helping to fuel optimism among the nation 's consumers , the survey said .
the number of unemployed fell by 26,000 in the economically more important western part of the nation , the labor agency said , and by 11,000 in the nation 's former communist east .
growth could exceed 2.8 percent amid signs that the german economy has rebounded unexpectedly strongly from the hefty and unpopular hike in the nation 's value-added tax in january and this year 's us economic slowdown , economists have been revising upwards their 2007 growth forecasts for germany .
many economists now project german economic growth to match or possibly surpass last year 's perky 2.8 percent expansion rate .
but with two major economic sentiment surveys - the zew investor confidence report and the ifo business confidence index - recently pointing down , analysts also say that the nation 's economic expansion could be starting to plateau out .
indeed , germany 's retail traders ' association -lrb- hde -rrb- said on thursday it expected 2007 retail sales to fall in real terms after a difficult start to the year .
pollitically sensitive data in the meantime , thursday 's jobless figures showed the politically-sensitive unadjusted labor market data also fell in june , dropping by 25,000 from may to 3.687 million in june with the unemployment rate edging down 0.3 percentage points to 8.8 percent .
" the demand for workers has increased again , " said federal labor agency chief frank jürgen weise .
the june unadjusted unemployment figures represented a 712,000 decline compared to june 2006 , when the jobless rate stood at 10.5 percent .
this represents an average monthly fall of 60,000 over the last 12 months .
the fall in seasonally unadjusted or headline unemployment was also more than expected by analysts , who had forecast a month-on-month fall in june of about 75,000 .
while the economists see the seasonally adjusted data as pointing to trends in the labor market , the headline data has become more politically significant in germany . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the us says they are key in its war against terrorism but europeans worry the measures erode civil liberties . eu officials said wednesday that the eu and the us had reached a deal following a meeting between franco frattini , the eu justice and home affairs commissioner , michael chertoff , the us secretary for homeland security and wolfgang schäuble , the interior minister of germany which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
" a political agreement in principle was reached , " said roscam abbing , a spokesman for frattini .
data privacy a thorny issue data privacy has been a sticking point between the eu and the us ever since washington intensified anti-terrorism efforts after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks .
following the attacks on new york and washington , the eu and the us signed an agreement under which the eu agreed to grant us authorities access to up to 34 categories of information on passengers on all flights to the us taking off from eu member states .
these included names , addresses , phone numbers and credit card numbers of travelers .
that agreement , which is set to expire on july 31 , had stirred unease among eu lawmakers amid mounting concerns that civil liberties were being eroded in the fight against global terrorism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flying to the us is usually a security hassle for passengers in a letter this month to interior and justice ministers of portugal , which takes over the eu presidency from germany next month , the european data protection supervisor , peter hustinx said eu governments were sacrificing too much of their citizens ' privacy in the fight against terrorism . " i fear that messages such as ' no right to privacy until life and security are guaranteed ' are developing into a mantra suggesting that fundamental rights and freedoms are a luxury that security can not afford , " hustinx wrote . last may , the air travel data deal was annulled by the european court of justice in luxembourg and the two sides reached an interim agreement .
the eu had warned that airlines would be vulnerable to privacy complaints if no replacement deal had been reached before the interim one expired .
though details of the accord reached this week have not been released , german interior minister schäuble told an eu parliamentary briefing in strasbourg that the aim was to reduce the number of stored data on passengers that the us currently receives from 34 to 20 .
it remains unclear what pieces of personal data will be left out from the new us list .
an eu diplomat said under the new arrangement the data would now be kept by the us for 15 years , up from 3 1/2 years in the interim agreement .
the european side also sought to end the us ability to directly access flight booking computers , arguing instead that airlines should send the data .
europeans are the biggest group of travelers to the us .
deal on access to bank data separately , the us and the eu also struck a deal setting conditions for the us treasury department to view records of the international banking network swift in anti-terrorism probes .
european civil liberties group watchdogs had complained that swift , which handles global financial transfers and is based in brussels , violated european privacy laws by allowing the us to secretly consult its records .
washington has argued that the access is essential for its drive to end funding to terror networks .

it remains unclear what pieces of personal data will be left out from the new us list .
an eu diplomat said under the new arrangement the data would now be kept by the us for 15 years , up from 3 1/2 years in the interim agreement .

founder jimmy wales spoke to dw-world about the secret of its success . jimmy wales was born in alabama , usa , in 1966 .
he studied finance and worked as a research director at the chicago stock exchange .
in 2001 he founded wikipedia which is a multilingual , web-based , free content encyclopedia project .
it is written collaboratively by volunteers .
the vast majority of its articles can be edited by anyone with access to the internet .
from 2003 to 2006 , jimmy wales was headed the wikimedia foundation , wikipedia 's non-profit parent organization .
in 2004 , he founded the for-profit internet portal wikia , which is now supposed to carry on his newest project , the search engine wikia search .
jimmy wales lives in florida with his wife and his daughter . dw-world : a famous american magazine has chosen you as one of the 100 people who shape our world .
how does it feel to be a world shaper ?
jimmy wales : i thought that was sort of funny .
i enjoyed it of course , but tyra banks - the supermodel - was also on the list .
so i don ’ t know how meaningful it really is .
but i feel a real sense of responsibility that i am in a position where i can have some influence and i can say something people listen to .
i try not to say very much because of that .
because i want to make sure that what i do say is something that i can really believe in .
equality , unlimited faculty , no hierarchy : is that just the philosophy of wikipedia or is it your philosophy of life in general ?
that is pretty much my philosophy .
a lot of wikipedia reflects things that i believe in very strongly .
sometimes people think if you believe that everyone should participate then you think right and wrong don ‘ t matter and everybody ’ s opinion is as good as everyone else ’ s .
it may seem paradoxical to them , but , no , i think that some people are really not that smart and that they are not that useful .
but leaving open the possibility for participation means that we are able to get a lot of great ideas from lots of different places .
wikipedia owes its success to the community , to all the people who write articles every day without getting paid .
why do they do that for wikipedia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikipedia has 75,000 contributors in over 100 languages .
i think there are two reasons .
one reason is that the charity of our mission is inspiring a lot of people .
but i think that ’ s a fairly limited reason .
the main reason is that it ’ s fun .
the people just enjoy the process , they enjoy meeting other intellectual people , it ’ s a great hobby .
we know that intuitively if we think about people plying football on the weekends .
we don ’ t say : " gee , gosh , you 're going to play football and you don ’ t get paid for that ? ”
that ’ s silly , right ?
obviously people are doing it because they enjoy it and they have fun .
it is a similar thing with wikipedia .
some people earn a lot of money writing but others can do it just for fun .
you seem to do it just for fun too .
because although wikipedia is very successful you are not earning any money because it is a charitable project .
do you sometimes think that you did something wrong ?
i always joke that when i registered wikipedia as a non-profit organization , it was either the dumbest thing or the smartest thing i ever did .
the dumbest for the obvious reason that i get to hang out with billionaires but i don ’ t have any money .
the smartest , though , because i don ‘ t think it could have been nearly as successful as it is and also because i think it will be remembered in the future .
100 or 200 years from now people will point to wikipedia and say : that was a really good thing that did something beneficial for the world .
so that is something i am very proud of .
why wouldn ’ t it have worked out as a commercial organization ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new era of user generated content and social networking is often referred to as web 2.0 i think that for an encyclopedia that is really attempting this very grand ethical mission of sharing knowledge with everyone , being a non-profit organization is really the right approach .
it means that , as a community , we have the luxury of doing things the right way rather than doing things in a way that is dictated by current economic circumstances .
the internet video platform you tube was sold for $ 1.65 billion -lrb- 1.23 billion euros -rrb- .
how much would sell wikipedia for ?
i don ’ t know what it ’ s worth , it ’ s really interesting .
it has very low revenue .
but i guess you could slap ads all over it and make some money .
i think the wikimedia foundation - the owner of wikipedia - could in fact sell it .
nobody ’ s interested in doing that , but certainly if there was an offer of $ 3 billion , i think the foundation would have to seriously think about what could be done for the charitable purposes of the foundation in distributing free knowledge if we outsourced the community or something .
your new project , the search engine wikia search , which will launch at the end of this year , will be commercial .
why did you change your mind ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wales aims to challenge google 's dominance in the search engine market .
for some types of projects - if you think about running hospitals or the red cross - the charitable model works well .
people are willing to donate money , enough to make it last .
but for other things like running a chain of grocery stores , there have never been very successful charities that have done such things .
i think different kinds of work demands different kinds of organization .
there are so many search engines on the internet already .
why does the world actually need another one ?
the search engines we have right now are black boxes and not transparent .
they are not community controlled and the quality is ... well , it 's pretty good but it stagnated the last two or three years .
there are lots of ways in which searches have not improved as much as a lot of us would have liked .
i don ’ t know how to improve search beyond what already exists .
but i do think that a broad community of people and an open scientific dialogue about how to do that can probably make some progress .
anyway it ’ s fun .
i always do the most fun thing .
and what will be the next big thing coming up on the internet ?
i don ’ t know .
i always remind people that five years ago , i was just this guy sitting at home in my pajamas typing on the internet .
and now i get asked deep questions about the future .
the trend i see right now is that we are very much at the beginning of free licensing of culture .
and we are still very much at the beginning of the design of communities for producing good quality work .
so i think that there is still a lot of room in those areas . christine elsaesser interviewed jimmy wales send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

you seem to do it just for fun too .
because although wikipedia is very successful you are not earning any money because it is a charitable project .
do you sometimes think that you did something wrong ?
i always joke that when i registered wikipedia as a non-profit organization , it was either the dumbest thing or the smartest thing i ever did .
the dumbest for the obvious reason that i get to hang out with billionaires but i don ’ t have any money .
the smartest , though , because i don ‘ t think it could have been nearly as successful as it is and also because i think it will be remembered in the future .
100 or 200 years from now people will point to wikipedia and say : that was a really good thing that did something beneficial for the world .
so that is something i am very proud of .
why wouldn ’ t it have worked out as a commercial organization ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new era of user generated content and social networking is often referred to as web 2.0 i think that for an encyclopedia that is really attempting this very grand ethical mission of sharing knowledge with everyone , being a non-profit organization is really the right approach .
it means that , as a community , we have the luxury of doing things the right way rather than doing things in a way that is dictated by current economic circumstances .
the internet video platform you tube was sold for $ 1.65 billion -lrb- 1.23 billion euros -rrb- .
how much would sell wikipedia for ?
i don ’ t know what it ’ s worth , it ’ s really interesting .
it has very low revenue .
but i guess you could slap ads all over it and make some money .
i think the wikimedia foundation - the owner of wikipedia - could in fact sell it .
nobody ’ s interested in doing that , but certainly if there was an offer of $ 3 billion , i think the foundation would have to seriously think about what could be done for the charitable purposes of the foundation in distributing free knowledge if we outsourced the community or something .
your new project , the search engine wikia search , which will launch at the end of this year , will be commercial .
why did you change your mind ?

for some types of projects - if you think about running hospitals or the red cross - the charitable model works well .
people are willing to donate money , enough to make it last .
but for other things like running a chain of grocery stores , there have never been very successful charities that have done such things .
i think different kinds of work demands different kinds of organization .
there are so many search engines on the internet already .
why does the world actually need another one ?
the search engines we have right now are black boxes and not transparent .
they are not community controlled and the quality is ... well , it 's pretty good but it stagnated the last two or three years .
there are lots of ways in which searches have not improved as much as a lot of us would have liked .
i don ’ t know how to improve search beyond what already exists .
but i do think that a broad community of people and an open scientific dialogue about how to do that can probably make some progress .
anyway it ’ s fun .
i always do the most fun thing .
and what will be the next big thing coming up on the internet ?
i don ’ t know .
i always remind people that five years ago , i was just this guy sitting at home in my pajamas typing on the internet .
and now i get asked deep questions about the future .
the trend i see right now is that we are very much at the beginning of free licensing of culture .
and we are still very much at the beginning of the design of communities for producing good quality work .
so i think that there is still a lot of room in those areas . christine elsaesser interviewed jimmy wales send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

founder jimmy wales spoke to dw-world about the secret of its success . jimmy wales was born in alabama , usa , in 1966 .
he studied finance and worked as a research director at the chicago stock exchange .
in 2001 he founded wikipedia which is a multilingual , web-based , free content encyclopedia project .
it is written collaboratively by volunteers .
the vast majority of its articles can be edited by anyone with access to the internet .
from 2003 to 2006 , jimmy wales was headed the wikimedia foundation , wikipedia 's non-profit parent organization .
in 2004 , he founded the for-profit internet portal wikia , which is now supposed to carry on his newest project , the search engine wikia search .
jimmy wales lives in florida with his wife and his daughter . dw-world : a famous american magazine has chosen you as one of the 100 people who shape our world .
how does it feel to be a world shaper ?
jimmy wales : i thought that was sort of funny .
i enjoyed it of course , but tyra banks - the supermodel - was also on the list .
so i don ’ t know how meaningful it really is .
but i feel a real sense of responsibility that i am in a position where i can have some influence and i can say something people listen to .
i try not to say very much because of that .
because i want to make sure that what i do say is something that i can really believe in .
equality , unlimited faculty , no hierarchy : is that just the philosophy of wikipedia or is it your philosophy of life in general ?
that is pretty much my philosophy .
a lot of wikipedia reflects things that i believe in very strongly .
sometimes people think if you believe that everyone should participate then you think right and wrong don ‘ t matter and everybody ’ s opinion is as good as everyone else ’ s .
it may seem paradoxical to them , but , no , i think that some people are really not that smart and that they are not that useful .
but leaving open the possibility for participation means that we are able to get a lot of great ideas from lots of different places .
wikipedia owes its success to the community , to all the people who write articles every day without getting paid .
why do they do that for wikipedia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikipedia has 75,000 contributors in over 100 languages .
i think there are two reasons .
one reason is that the charity of our mission is inspiring a lot of people .
but i think that ’ s a fairly limited reason .
the main reason is that it ’ s fun .
the people just enjoy the process , they enjoy meeting other intellectual people , it ’ s a great hobby .
we know that intuitively if we think about people plying football on the weekends .
we don ’ t say : " gee , gosh , you 're going to play football and you don ’ t get paid for that ? ”
that ’ s silly , right ?
obviously people are doing it because they enjoy it and they have fun .

founder jimmy wales spoke to dw-world about the secret of its success . jimmy wales was born in alabama , usa , in 1966 .
he studied finance and worked as a research director at the chicago stock exchange .
in 2001 he founded wikipedia which is a multilingual , web-based , free content encyclopedia project .
it is written collaboratively by volunteers .
the vast majority of its articles can be edited by anyone with access to the internet .
from 2003 to 2006 , jimmy wales was headed the wikimedia foundation , wikipedia 's non-profit parent organization .
in 2004 , he founded the for-profit internet portal wikia , which is now supposed to carry on his newest project , the search engine wikia search .
jimmy wales lives in florida with his wife and his daughter . dw-world : a famous american magazine has chosen you as one of the 100 people who shape our world .
how does it feel to be a world shaper ?
jimmy wales : i thought that was sort of funny .
i enjoyed it of course , but tyra banks - the supermodel - was also on the list .
so i don ’ t know how meaningful it really is .
but i feel a real sense of responsibility that i am in a position where i can have some influence and i can say something people listen to .
i try not to say very much because of that .
because i want to make sure that what i do say is something that i can really believe in .
equality , unlimited faculty , no hierarchy : is that just the philosophy of wikipedia or is it your philosophy of life in general ?
that is pretty much my philosophy .
a lot of wikipedia reflects things that i believe in very strongly .
sometimes people think if you believe that everyone should participate then you think right and wrong don ‘ t matter and everybody ’ s opinion is as good as everyone else ’ s .
it may seem paradoxical to them , but , no , i think that some people are really not that smart and that they are not that useful .
but leaving open the possibility for participation means that we are able to get a lot of great ideas from lots of different places .
wikipedia owes its success to the community , to all the people who write articles every day without getting paid .
why do they do that for wikipedia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikipedia has 75,000 contributors in over 100 languages .
i think there are two reasons .
one reason is that the charity of our mission is inspiring a lot of people .
but i think that ’ s a fairly limited reason .
the main reason is that it ’ s fun .
the people just enjoy the process , they enjoy meeting other intellectual people , it ’ s a great hobby .
we know that intuitively if we think about people plying football on the weekends .
we don ’ t say : " gee , gosh , you 're going to play football and you don ’ t get paid for that ? ”
that ’ s silly , right ?
obviously people are doing it because they enjoy it and they have fun .
it is a similar thing with wikipedia .
some people earn a lot of money writing but others can do it just for fun .
you seem to do it just for fun too .
because although wikipedia is very successful you are not earning any money because it is a charitable project .
do you sometimes think that you did something wrong ?
i always joke that when i registered wikipedia as a non-profit organization , it was either the dumbest thing or the smartest thing i ever did .
the dumbest for the obvious reason that i get to hang out with billionaires but i don ’ t have any money .
the smartest , though , because i don ‘ t think it could have been nearly as successful as it is and also because i think it will be remembered in the future .
100 or 200 years from now people will point to wikipedia and say : that was a really good thing that did something beneficial for the world .
so that is something i am very proud of .
why wouldn ’ t it have worked out as a commercial organization ?

these plans , which won the second competition staged to find a design for the building , were attacked for being insensitive and even dubbed a " toilet block " by one critic .
the winner of the first competition giorgio grassi had also seen his design blocked - an occurrence not unusual in a country where passions about architecture run high .
" half-hearted " bildunterschrift : only time will tell if chipperfield 's new plans get implemented the new blueprint echoes elements of the existing ensemble with an open staircase and colonnades .
but a number of german newspapers have criticized the revamped architecture .
the süddeutsche zeitung praised some aspects of the design , but described it essentially as being " half-hearted " and " undecided , " while the berliner morgenpost also said it did not form a " convincing whole . "
chipperfield 's building will complete the renovation of the museum island in the spree river , a large museum complex which was damaged in world war ii and and fell into neglect during the communist era .
final touch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bust of the egyptian queen nefertiti is the most famous exhibit in the complex the new building will be called the james simon gallery after a jewish patron of the arts , and will be attached to the pergamon museum , one of berlin 's biggest tourist attractions .
the architect said it would cost about 73 million euros -lrb- $ 98 million -rrb- and be completed in 2012 .
he said the gallery would blend in with the architectural design of the museums and house a conference center and shops .
the architect is also overseeing renovations at the pergamon to restore the facade to its pre-war glory and modernize the museum 's interior .
the pergamon includes a reconstruction of the ishtar gate from babylon with stones from the original structure .
unesco site bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bode museum is the latest museum on the island to be renovated the museum island , which was declared a unesco world heritage site in 1999 , also houses the bode museum , die alte nationalgalerie , the neues museum and the altes museum - best known for its world-famous 3,400-year-old egyptian bust of nefertiti .
the government has spent hundreds of billions of euros restoring the 19th-century complex and the scheme is due to be finished in 2015 .

these plans , which won the second competition staged to find a design for the building , were attacked for being insensitive and even dubbed a " toilet block " by one critic .
the winner of the first competition giorgio grassi had also seen his design blocked - an occurrence not unusual in a country where passions about architecture run high .
" half-hearted " bildunterschrift : only time will tell if chipperfield 's new plans get implemented the new blueprint echoes elements of the existing ensemble with an open staircase and colonnades .
but a number of german newspapers have criticized the revamped architecture .
the süddeutsche zeitung praised some aspects of the design , but described it essentially as being " half-hearted " and " undecided , " while the berliner morgenpost also said it did not form a " convincing whole . "
chipperfield 's building will complete the renovation of the museum island in the spree river , a large museum complex which was damaged in world war ii and and fell into neglect during the communist era .
final touch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bust of the egyptian queen nefertiti is the most famous exhibit in the complex the new building will be called the james simon gallery after a jewish patron of the arts , and will be attached to the pergamon museum , one of berlin 's biggest tourist attractions .
the architect said it would cost about 73 million euros -lrb- $ 98 million -rrb- and be completed in 2012 .
he said the gallery would blend in with the architectural design of the museums and house a conference center and shops .
the architect is also overseeing renovations at the pergamon to restore the facade to its pre-war glory and modernize the museum 's interior .
the pergamon includes a reconstruction of the ishtar gate from babylon with stones from the original structure .
unesco site bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bode museum is the latest museum on the island to be renovated the museum island , which was declared a unesco world heritage site in 1999 , also houses the bode museum , die alte nationalgalerie , the neues museum and the altes museum - best known for its world-famous 3,400-year-old egyptian bust of nefertiti .
the government has spent hundreds of billions of euros restoring the 19th-century complex and the scheme is due to be finished in 2015 .
berlin city authorities expect to attract four million visitors a year once the project is completed . dw-staff with wire reports -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

we are unusual , as british people go , but for my husband and me , germany is probably our favorite holiday destination and one reason for that is the stunning variety on offer .
each state has its own culture , architecture and natural scenery .
looking for new places to explore and discover , we started going east a couple of years ago and we were not disappointed - far from it .
from large , culture-rich cities like dresden and weimar to small , historic towns like meissen and quedlinburg , we 've found much to recommend .
there is so much history to explore and we have found the local people extremely welcoming , very helpful and eager to provide an excellent service to visitors .
our only surprise has been the low numbers of other visitors -lrb- especially other western europeans -rrb- .
if you do n't go soon , then you 'll be missing something extraordinary precisely because it is a place in transition , yet still , in parts , clinging to its unique identity and culture .
this will go in time , as is the way in a globalized society , so make the most of it while you can ! - liz , great britain eurail is a great bargain !
if you can , buy a pass .
trains in germany make our amtrak look like the trash it is .
i also recommend public transport in german cities .
germany was smart when they kept trams in their cities .
dresden is a great art treasure and we plan to return soon .
i also recommend leipzig , especially if you enjoy baroque and classical music . - samuel r. ganczaruk , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : take a christmas cruise , recommended a reader we are a group of spaniards visiting frankfurt .
at the suggestion of one local we went yesterday to a typical frankfurt cider tavern called zur sonne .
people here told us not to go to sachsenhausen -lrb- trashy and touristy , full of irish pubs and caipirinha bars these days -rrb- but rather to the north end and bornheim district , which are very young and picturesque .
apple wine , as everyone warned us , takes some " getting used to " but after a few glasses it tastes almost like a good penedes !
-lrb- only a joke ! -rrb-
the atmosphere in these taverns - which during warm months have large gardens - is very friendly and convivial .
the food is wonderful -lrb- try the local specialty , green sauce -rrb- and prices are very fair . - ramiro ruiz , spain i 've visited germany twice .
it is really a very nice country to visit .
everything is well prepared .
i really enjoyed my vacation and hope to visit another time . - sawsan , sudan germany has restored my happy feelings for christmas and i send my sincere congratulations to the german people for their celebration of christmas .
the christmas markets are wonderful and the people are very friendly and a joy to be with .
we were on a river cruise in december 2006 , starting in cologne and ending in nuremberg .
my wife is an organist and loved every opportunity to hear another organ .
we were so impressed with the entire trip that we are planning for another christmas cruise in december 2008 and are inviting family and friends to share the experience . - joseph , us compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de readers recommend visiting dresden , bamberg , lübeck readers wrote in with tips on train travel in germany and recommendations on where to go .

we are unusual , as british people go , but for my husband and me , germany is probably our favorite holiday destination and one reason for that is the stunning variety on offer .
each state has its own culture , architecture and natural scenery .
looking for new places to explore and discover , we started going east a couple of years ago and we were not disappointed - far from it .
from large , culture-rich cities like dresden and weimar to small , historic towns like meissen and quedlinburg , we 've found much to recommend .
there is so much history to explore and we have found the local people extremely welcoming , very helpful and eager to provide an excellent service to visitors .
our only surprise has been the low numbers of other visitors -lrb- especially other western europeans -rrb- .
if you do n't go soon , then you 'll be missing something extraordinary precisely because it is a place in transition , yet still , in parts , clinging to its unique identity and culture .
this will go in time , as is the way in a globalized society , so make the most of it while you can ! - liz , great britain eurail is a great bargain !
if you can , buy a pass .
trains in germany make our amtrak look like the trash it is .
i also recommend public transport in german cities .
germany was smart when they kept trams in their cities .
dresden is a great art treasure and we plan to return soon .
i also recommend leipzig , especially if you enjoy baroque and classical music . - samuel r. ganczaruk , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : take a christmas cruise , recommended a reader we are a group of spaniards visiting frankfurt .
at the suggestion of one local we went yesterday to a typical frankfurt cider tavern called zur sonne .
people here told us not to go to sachsenhausen -lrb- trashy and touristy , full of irish pubs and caipirinha bars these days -rrb- but rather to the north end and bornheim district , which are very young and picturesque .
apple wine , as everyone warned us , takes some " getting used to " but after a few glasses it tastes almost like a good penedes !
-lrb- only a joke ! -rrb-
the atmosphere in these taverns - which during warm months have large gardens - is very friendly and convivial .
the food is wonderful -lrb- try the local specialty , green sauce -rrb- and prices are very fair . - ramiro ruiz , spain i 've visited germany twice .
it is really a very nice country to visit .
everything is well prepared .
i really enjoyed my vacation and hope to visit another time . - sawsan , sudan germany has restored my happy feelings for christmas and i send my sincere congratulations to the german people for their celebration of christmas .
the christmas markets are wonderful and the people are very friendly and a joy to be with .

that would be a spontaneous reaction to blair 's appointment as middle east envoy .
actually , just about anyone who did n't have the colonial past of a briton in the middle east , had not driven the iraq war as a " lap dog " of the american president and not delayed a truce during the lebanon war last year as blair did would have been a better person for the job .
despite these facts , the mideast quartet - which comprises the us , the eu , the un and russia - chose the former british prime minister as the new mideast envoy .
the quartet did n't seem to have any serious reservations about the appointment .
even the russians did n't seem to have any doubts about blair 's skills as a trouble shooter despite being at loggerheads with him in the scandal involving the murder of a former russian agent .
but can the former british premier position himself as a neutral representative and mediator ?
you have to doubt it in light of his close alliance with the us and israel .
the question is whether blair will really mediate in the ongoing trouble in the middle east .
his responsibility largely lies in helping the palestinian parties lift themselves out of the crisis .
he is meant to help the palestinians build democratic institutions and in the course of that job he will naturally have to often report to washington to request specific american help .
given his excellent ties with the white house , that should be easy for blair as compared with honorable representatives from second-tier friendly nations .
there 's no disputing that less mistrust of the mideast envoy would make his job easier .
but in the past even american jews such as henry kissinger or dennis ross have successfully mediated in the middle east on behalf of the white house .
why should blair not have the same success on behalf of the mideast quartet ?
especially considering that it will be the quartet and not blair who will decide which direction to take .
that decision too will be limited since the direction is long well known ; it 's that path that negotiators ca n't agree on .
during his farewell speech to the house of commons , blair declared that the middle east must have place for two states - israel and palestine .
by now all sensible and right-minded individuals accept that formula and it also forms the core of the " roadmap " of the middle east aimed to resolve the conflict .
the arab league too is committed to the " two state " solution .
only radical groups continue to reject it .
but then again nobody would try to talk peace with them .
that 's why blair might succeed in moving things along .
and if he does n't then he would n't be the first to fail at the task .

these plans , which won the second competition staged to find a design for the building , were attacked for being insensitive and even dubbed a " toilet block " by one critic .

that would be a spontaneous reaction to blair 's appointment as middle east envoy .
actually , just about anyone who did n't have the colonial past of a briton in the middle east , had not driven the iraq war as a " lap dog " of the american president and not delayed a truce during the lebanon war last year as blair did would have been a better person for the job .
despite these facts , the mideast quartet - which comprises the us , the eu , the un and russia - chose the former british prime minister as the new mideast envoy .
the quartet did n't seem to have any serious reservations about the appointment .
even the russians did n't seem to have any doubts about blair 's skills as a trouble shooter despite being at loggerheads with him in the scandal involving the murder of a former russian agent .
but can the former british premier position himself as a neutral representative and mediator ?
you have to doubt it in light of his close alliance with the us and israel .
the question is whether blair will really mediate in the ongoing trouble in the middle east .
his responsibility largely lies in helping the palestinian parties lift themselves out of the crisis .
he is meant to help the palestinians build democratic institutions and in the course of that job he will naturally have to often report to washington to request specific american help .
given his excellent ties with the white house , that should be easy for blair as compared with honorable representatives from second-tier friendly nations .
there 's no disputing that less mistrust of the mideast envoy would make his job easier .
but in the past even american jews such as henry kissinger or dennis ross have successfully mediated in the middle east on behalf of the white house .
why should blair not have the same success on behalf of the mideast quartet ?
especially considering that it will be the quartet and not blair who will decide which direction to take .
that decision too will be limited since the direction is long well known ; it 's that path that negotiators ca n't agree on .
during his farewell speech to the house of commons , blair declared that the middle east must have place for two states - israel and palestine .
by now all sensible and right-minded individuals accept that formula and it also forms the core of the " roadmap " of the middle east aimed to resolve the conflict .
the arab league too is committed to the " two state " solution .
only radical groups continue to reject it .
but then again nobody would try to talk peace with them .
that 's why blair might succeed in moving things along .
and if he does n't then he would n't be the first to fail at the task .

these plans , which won the second competition staged to find a design for the building , were attacked for being insensitive and even dubbed a " toilet block " by one critic .
the winner of the first competition giorgio grassi had also seen his design blocked - an occurrence not unusual in a country where passions about architecture run high .
" half-hearted " bildunterschrift : only time will tell if chipperfield 's new plans get implemented the new blueprint echoes elements of the existing ensemble with an open staircase and colonnades .
but a number of german newspapers have criticized the revamped architecture .
the süddeutsche zeitung praised some aspects of the design , but described it essentially as being " half-hearted " and " undecided , " while the berliner morgenpost also said it did not form a " convincing whole . "
chipperfield 's building will complete the renovation of the museum island in the spree river , a large museum complex which was damaged in world war ii and and fell into neglect during the communist era .
final touch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bust of the egyptian queen nefertiti is the most famous exhibit in the complex the new building will be called the james simon gallery after a jewish patron of the arts , and will be attached to the pergamon museum , one of berlin 's biggest tourist attractions .
the architect said it would cost about 73 million euros -lrb- $ 98 million -rrb- and be completed in 2012 .
he said the gallery would blend in with the architectural design of the museums and house a conference center and shops .
the architect is also overseeing renovations at the pergamon to restore the facade to its pre-war glory and modernize the museum 's interior .
the pergamon includes a reconstruction of the ishtar gate from babylon with stones from the original structure .
unesco site bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bode museum is the latest museum on the island to be renovated the museum island , which was declared a unesco world heritage site in 1999 , also houses the bode museum , die alte nationalgalerie , the neues museum and the altes museum - best known for its world-famous 3,400-year-old egyptian bust of nefertiti .
the government has spent hundreds of billions of euros restoring the 19th-century complex and the scheme is due to be finished in 2015 .
berlin city authorities expect to attract four million visitors a year once the project is completed . dw-staff with wire reports -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the us says they are key in its war against terrorism but europeans worry the measures erode civil liberties . eu officials said wednesday that the eu and the us had reached a deal following a meeting between franco frattini , the eu justice and home affairs commissioner , michael chertoff , the us secretary for homeland security and wolfgang schäuble , the interior minister of germany which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
" a political agreement in principle was reached , " said roscam abbing , a spokesman for frattini .
data privacy a thorny issue data privacy has been a sticking point between the eu and the us ever since washington intensified anti-terrorism efforts after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks .
following the attacks on new york and washington , the eu and the us signed an agreement under which the eu agreed to grant us authorities access to up to 34 categories of information on passengers on all flights to the us taking off from eu member states .
these included names , addresses , phone numbers and credit card numbers of travelers .
that agreement , which is set to expire on july 31 , had stirred unease among eu lawmakers amid mounting concerns that civil liberties were being eroded in the fight against global terrorism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flying to the us is usually a security hassle for passengers in a letter this month to interior and justice ministers of portugal , which takes over the eu presidency from germany next month , the european data protection supervisor , peter hustinx said eu governments were sacrificing too much of their citizens ' privacy in the fight against terrorism . " i fear that messages such as ' no right to privacy until life and security are guaranteed ' are developing into a mantra suggesting that fundamental rights and freedoms are a luxury that security can not afford , " hustinx wrote . last may , the air travel data deal was annulled by the european court of justice in luxembourg and the two sides reached an interim agreement .
the eu had warned that airlines would be vulnerable to privacy complaints if no replacement deal had been reached before the interim one expired .
though details of the accord reached this week have not been released , german interior minister schäuble told an eu parliamentary briefing in strasbourg that the aim was to reduce the number of stored data on passengers that the us currently receives from 34 to 20 .
it remains unclear what pieces of personal data will be left out from the new us list .
an eu diplomat said under the new arrangement the data would now be kept by the us for 15 years , up from 3 1/2 years in the interim agreement .
the european side also sought to end the us ability to directly access flight booking computers , arguing instead that airlines should send the data .
europeans are the biggest group of travelers to the us .
deal on access to bank data separately , the us and the eu also struck a deal setting conditions for the us treasury department to view records of the international banking network swift in anti-terrorism probes .
european civil liberties group watchdogs had complained that swift , which handles global financial transfers and is based in brussels , violated european privacy laws by allowing the us to secretly consult its records .
washington has argued that the access is essential for its drive to end funding to terror networks .
the us will now only use swift data for counter-terrorism purposes and store it for a maximum of five years , according to the terms of the new deal . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

we are unusual , as british people go , but for my husband and me , germany is probably our favorite holiday destination and one reason for that is the stunning variety on offer .
each state has its own culture , architecture and natural scenery .
looking for new places to explore and discover , we started going east a couple of years ago and we were not disappointed - far from it .
from large , culture-rich cities like dresden and weimar to small , historic towns like meissen and quedlinburg , we 've found much to recommend .
there is so much history to explore and we have found the local people extremely welcoming , very helpful and eager to provide an excellent service to visitors .
our only surprise has been the low numbers of other visitors -lrb- especially other western europeans -rrb- .
if you do n't go soon , then you 'll be missing something extraordinary precisely because it is a place in transition , yet still , in parts , clinging to its unique identity and culture .
this will go in time , as is the way in a globalized society , so make the most of it while you can ! - liz , great britain eurail is a great bargain !
if you can , buy a pass .
trains in germany make our amtrak look like the trash it is .
i also recommend public transport in german cities .
germany was smart when they kept trams in their cities .
dresden is a great art treasure and we plan to return soon .
i also recommend leipzig , especially if you enjoy baroque and classical music . - samuel r. ganczaruk , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : take a christmas cruise , recommended a reader we are a group of spaniards visiting frankfurt .
at the suggestion of one local we went yesterday to a typical frankfurt cider tavern called zur sonne .
people here told us not to go to sachsenhausen -lrb- trashy and touristy , full of irish pubs and caipirinha bars these days -rrb- but rather to the north end and bornheim district , which are very young and picturesque .
apple wine , as everyone warned us , takes some " getting used to " but after a few glasses it tastes almost like a good penedes !
-lrb- only a joke ! -rrb-
the atmosphere in these taverns - which during warm months have large gardens - is very friendly and convivial .
the food is wonderful -lrb- try the local specialty , green sauce -rrb- and prices are very fair . - ramiro ruiz , spain i 've visited germany twice .
it is really a very nice country to visit .
everything is well prepared .
i really enjoyed my vacation and hope to visit another time . - sawsan , sudan germany has restored my happy feelings for christmas and i send my sincere congratulations to the german people for their celebration of christmas .
the christmas markets are wonderful and the people are very friendly and a joy to be with .
we were on a river cruise in december 2006 , starting in cologne and ending in nuremberg .

" anybody who tries to weigh up the dead of the second world war against votes in the -lrb- eu -rrb- council has to be rejected out of hand , " martin schulz , leader of the socialist group in the european parliament , told fellow lawmakers in brussels on wednesday to loud applause .
" the eu is an idea aimed at eliminating the specters of the past ...
we will not permit the few to bring up those specters , " he added .
schulz was referring to kacyznski 's remarks that poland deserved more voting power in the eu because its population would have been far larger if it had not been decimated during the nazi era .
the prime minister compounded matters on tuesday when he compared modern-day germany to the era that brought adolf hitler to power .
" not representative " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bilateral relations have been strained since the kaczynski twins came to power marek siwiec , a polish member of the european parliament said that kaczynski 's comments and the polish blocking tactics at the eu summit did not represent the views of the polish people .
he praised germany for avoiding any kind of " demonstration of power " in its role as holder of the eu presidency vis-a-vis poland and other eu states and praised german chancellor angela merkel 's pleasant " new leadership style . "
poland eventually won concessions at the summit , notably a delay to the introduction of the new voting system which it opposed , but faced criticism for its negotiating manner .
the german chancellor continues to seek to play down the dispute with poland .
" for us our polish neighbor has the same importance as our french neighbor , " she said in a speech on wednesday in brussels .
she has not commented on a controversial caricature of her that appeared on the front cover of the conservative polish magazine wprost on monday .
entitled the " stepmother of europe , " the photomontage depicted the german chancellor breast-feeding the kaczynski twins .
outrage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this controversial caricature has also provoked a storm of outrage a number of german politicians expressed outrage on tuesday about the caricature that accompanied an article written by mariusz muszynski , the polish foreign minister 's commissioner for german-polish relations .
but eckart von klaeden , the foreign policy spokesman for the conservative cdu / csu bloc , has also called for the matter to be approached in a more relaxed manner .
he told the hannoversche allgemeine zeitung that press freedom also protected things that people might regard as stupid or tasteless .
von klaeden also referred to a caricature that appeared in germany 's taz newspaper a year ago that compared the polish president as " poland 's new potato . "
at that time berlin responded to protests from warsaw by referring to the freedom of the press .
" exactly the same standards should apply with regards to the cover of a polish magazine , " he said .
von klaeden also expressed optimism that the tensions between germany and poland would soon settle .
" once all the momentary fuss has subsided , it will be possible to clearly see the success of the summit in brussels , " he said . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the procedure is a breakthrough in bio-technology and fuels hope of a cure for aids . the laboratory procedure removing the aids virus used an enzyme , said joachim hauber of the heinrich pette institute for experimental virology and immunology in hamburg . " we have rid the cells of the virus , " hauber said on thursday .
" no one else has done this before . "
he called it " a breakthrough in bio-technology . " hauber said it was his " cautious " hope that a cure for aids could be found within 10 years . current therapies can only limit the spread of the human immunodeficiency virus -lrb- hiv -rrb- and not remove it from the body .
hiv is a retrovirus that nests in the dna or key genetic material of infected cells . the max planck institute for molecular cell biology and genetics in dresden was the partner in the research , which will be reported in friday 's issue of the scientific journal science . cutting dna and recombining it three years of experiments on mice were planned next , to be followed by tests on humans in hamburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the enzyme knows just where to cut the dna the scientists ' method used the ability of so-called recombinase enzymes to cut strands of dna at certain places like a pair of scissors and recombine the strands . the new enzyme , tre , always recognized the right spot to snip the dna where the hiv started .
the scientists said it recognized a characteristic hiv sequence that scarcely ever mutated . tre was adapted from an existing natural enzyme , cre , which recognized similar genetic sequences . stem cells necessary for therapy the laboratories artificially evolved cre into tre through more than 120 recombinase generations .
hauber said the cell then flushed out the snipped-away dna as waste . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists have been analyzing the hiv virus for years " after that , it is healthy , " hauber said . any therapy , though , would require stem cells to be obtained from a patient 's blood .
they would then be treated in the laboratory and re-injected to regenerate a healthy immune system , hauber said . " it 's high-tech medicine , " hauber said .

lisbon also wants to send a " signal of good will " to turkey , a muslim country aspiring to join the eu .
prime minister socrates , however , has promised that the southern emphasis will not lead portugal to neglect other crucial concerns such as the stabilization of the balkans or relations with russia , the portuguese presidency faces a complex agenda .

" the political responsibility will remain as before on the shoulders of the quartet , " she added . on wednesday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier complained of a lack of consultation with members of the quartet before the appointment was made .
germany is the eu 's representative on the panel . washington got its choice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel , right , and french prime minister francois fillon , left , deliver press satatements supporting blair . blair held confidential discussions on the post with washington , which formally recommended him without prior consultation with the other quartet members , press reports said . the united nations announced blair 's appointment just hours after he stepped down as prime minister on wednesday .
the united states had pushed hard for blair - a close friend and ally of president george w. bush - to get the post .
reports said the announcement was apparently delayed because of russian reservations . merkel described blair as a man of great political experience , who could provide an important contribution to finding a solution to the mideast conflict . european media reports said the decision had been made solely between the us and blair behind closed doors .

his work would focus on " institution building in , and political strengthening of , the palestinian authority , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the quartet will keep control of the middle east peace process this limitation was due to the fact " that the quartet itself wants to keep the political task of shaping the middle east peace process in its own hands , " steinmeier said .

but at the same time , he did n't explicitly praise blair either . according to media reports , there are concerns in berlin that blair could seize the diplomatic process in the middle east and therefore harm the quartet 's work .
other eu member states fear that blair could weaken the position of eu foreign policy chief javier solana , who has been working on solutions to the arab-israeli conflict for years . " solana is a member of the quartet while blair will be working for the quartet , " steinmeier said .
" the difference is clear . " russia held back un spokeswoman michele montas said on wednesday that blair would " mobilize international assistance to the palestinians , working closely with donors and existing coordination bodies . "
his tasks included helping to identify and secure " appropriate international support in addressing the institutional governance needs of the palestinian state , " she said . blair 's work would be " in support of the agreed quartet objectives , " montas said . a small team of experts based in jerusalem will support blair , who will spend significant time in the region , montas added . russia had previously stalled blair 's appointment .
according to german officials , russia had held back its support because of the lack of consultation on the move .
only on tuesday did moscow give its assent . allies support blair 's appointment although he is well respected in israel , the arab world has sharply criticized blair for britain 's role in the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq , as well as his support of israel 's war in lebanon last summer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana is a key architect of the roadmap for peace in the middle east but blair won backing from his allies for his new role . " tony will help palestinians develop the political and economic institutions they will need for a democratic , sovereign state able to provide for its people and live in peace and security with israel , " bush said . palestinian president mahmud abbas and israel also expressed their approval .
israeli prime minister ehud olmert " believes that blair can have a favorable impact , in particular by helping the palestinians develop solid governmental structures , " his spokeswoman miri eisin said . but the hamas movement controlling the gaza strip said the appointment " is not acceptable to hamas nor to the palestinians . " the middle east quartet has tried to implement a " roadmap " for israeli-palestinian peace since 2003 .

these plans , which won the second competition staged to find a design for the building , were attacked for being insensitive and even dubbed a " toilet block " by one critic .
the winner of the first competition giorgio grassi had also seen his design blocked - an occurrence not unusual in a country where passions about architecture run high .
" half-hearted " bildunterschrift : only time will tell if chipperfield 's new plans get implemented the new blueprint echoes elements of the existing ensemble with an open staircase and colonnades .
but a number of german newspapers have criticized the revamped architecture .
the süddeutsche zeitung praised some aspects of the design , but described it essentially as being " half-hearted " and " undecided , " while the berliner morgenpost also said it did not form a " convincing whole . "
chipperfield 's building will complete the renovation of the museum island in the spree river , a large museum complex which was damaged in world war ii and and fell into neglect during the communist era .
final touch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bust of the egyptian queen nefertiti is the most famous exhibit in the complex the new building will be called the james simon gallery after a jewish patron of the arts , and will be attached to the pergamon museum , one of berlin 's biggest tourist attractions .
the architect said it would cost about 73 million euros -lrb- $ 98 million -rrb- and be completed in 2012 .
he said the gallery would blend in with the architectural design of the museums and house a conference center and shops .
the architect is also overseeing renovations at the pergamon to restore the facade to its pre-war glory and modernize the museum 's interior .
the pergamon includes a reconstruction of the ishtar gate from babylon with stones from the original structure .

the government has spent hundreds of billions of euros restoring the 19th-century complex and the scheme is due to be finished in 2015 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the future of the internet is now germans hesitant to look for love online " the synapses of a collective brain are growing " the internet and everyday life : the constant revolution the future is now internet -pipe- 28.06.2007 wikipedia founder : " great ideas come from different places " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikipedia founder jimmi wales its critics said it would n't last but the online encyclopaedia wikipedia has gone on to become one of the world 's most popular websites .
founder jimmy wales spoke to dw-world about the secret of its success . jimmy wales was born in alabama , usa , in 1966 .
he studied finance and worked as a research director at the chicago stock exchange .
in 2001 he founded wikipedia which is a multilingual , web-based , free content encyclopedia project .
it is written collaboratively by volunteers .
the vast majority of its articles can be edited by anyone with access to the internet .
from 2003 to 2006 , jimmy wales was headed the wikimedia foundation , wikipedia 's non-profit parent organization .
in 2004 , he founded the for-profit internet portal wikia , which is now supposed to carry on his newest project , the search engine wikia search .
jimmy wales lives in florida with his wife and his daughter . dw-world : a famous american magazine has chosen you as one of the 100 people who shape our world .
how does it feel to be a world shaper ?
jimmy wales : i thought that was sort of funny .
i enjoyed it of course , but tyra banks - the supermodel - was also on the list .
so i don ’ t know how meaningful it really is .
but i feel a real sense of responsibility that i am in a position where i can have some influence and i can say something people listen to .
i try not to say very much because of that .
because i want to make sure that what i do say is something that i can really believe in .
equality , unlimited faculty , no hierarchy : is that just the philosophy of wikipedia or is it your philosophy of life in general ?
that is pretty much my philosophy .
a lot of wikipedia reflects things that i believe in very strongly .
sometimes people think if you believe that everyone should participate then you think right and wrong don ‘ t matter and everybody ’ s opinion is as good as everyone else ’ s .
it may seem paradoxical to them , but , no , i think that some people are really not that smart and that they are not that useful .
but leaving open the possibility for participation means that we are able to get a lot of great ideas from lots of different places .
wikipedia owes its success to the community , to all the people who write articles every day without getting paid .
why do they do that for wikipedia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikipedia has 75,000 contributors in over 100 languages .
i think there are two reasons .
one reason is that the charity of our mission is inspiring a lot of people .
but i think that ’ s a fairly limited reason .
the main reason is that it ’ s fun .
the people just enjoy the process , they enjoy meeting other intellectual people , it ’ s a great hobby .
we know that intuitively if we think about people plying football on the weekends .
we don ’ t say : " gee , gosh , you 're going to play football and you don ’ t get paid for that ? ”
that ’ s silly , right ?
obviously people are doing it because they enjoy it and they have fun .
it is a similar thing with wikipedia .
some people earn a lot of money writing but others can do it just for fun .
you seem to do it just for fun too .
because although wikipedia is very successful you are not earning any money because it is a charitable project .
do you sometimes think that you did something wrong ?
i always joke that when i registered wikipedia as a non-profit organization , it was either the dumbest thing or the smartest thing i ever did .
the dumbest for the obvious reason that i get to hang out with billionaires but i don ’ t have any money .
the smartest , though , because i don ‘ t think it could have been nearly as successful as it is and also because i think it will be remembered in the future .
100 or 200 years from now people will point to wikipedia and say : that was a really good thing that did something beneficial for the world .
so that is something i am very proud of .
why wouldn ’ t it have worked out as a commercial organization ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new era of user generated content and social networking is often referred to as web 2.0 i think that for an encyclopedia that is really attempting this very grand ethical mission of sharing knowledge with everyone , being a non-profit organization is really the right approach .
it means that , as a community , we have the luxury of doing things the right way rather than doing things in a way that is dictated by current economic circumstances .
the internet video platform you tube was sold for $ 1.65 billion -lrb- 1.23 billion euros -rrb- .
how much would sell wikipedia for ?
i don ’ t know what it ’ s worth , it ’ s really interesting .
it has very low revenue .
but i guess you could slap ads all over it and make some money .
i think the wikimedia foundation - the owner of wikipedia - could in fact sell it .
nobody ’ s interested in doing that , but certainly if there was an offer of $ 3 billion , i think the foundation would have to seriously think about what could be done for the charitable purposes of the foundation in distributing free knowledge if we outsourced the community or something .
your new project , the search engine wikia search , which will launch at the end of this year , will be commercial .
why did you change your mind ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wales aims to challenge google 's dominance in the search engine market .
for some types of projects - if you think about running hospitals or the red cross - the charitable model works well .
people are willing to donate money , enough to make it last .
but for other things like running a chain of grocery stores , there have never been very successful charities that have done such things .
i think different kinds of work demands different kinds of organization .
there are so many search engines on the internet already .
why does the world actually need another one ?
the search engines we have right now are black boxes and not transparent .
they are not community controlled and the quality is ... well , it 's pretty good but it stagnated the last two or three years .
there are lots of ways in which searches have not improved as much as a lot of us would have liked .
i don ’ t know how to improve search beyond what already exists .
but i do think that a broad community of people and an open scientific dialogue about how to do that can probably make some progress .
anyway it ’ s fun .
i always do the most fun thing .
and what will be the next big thing coming up on the internet ?
i don ’ t know .
i always remind people that five years ago , i was just this guy sitting at home in my pajamas typing on the internet .
and now i get asked deep questions about the future .
the trend i see right now is that we are very much at the beginning of free licensing of culture .
and we are still very much at the beginning of the design of communities for producing good quality work .
so i think that there is still a lot of room in those areas . christine elsaesser interviewed jimmy wales send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the political responsibility will remain as before on the shoulders of the quartet , " she added . on wednesday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier complained of a lack of consultation with members of the quartet before the appointment was made .
germany is the eu 's representative on the panel . washington got its choice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel , right , and french prime minister francois fillon , left , deliver press satatements supporting blair . blair held confidential discussions on the post with washington , which formally recommended him without prior consultation with the other quartet members , press reports said . the united nations announced blair 's appointment just hours after he stepped down as prime minister on wednesday .
the united states had pushed hard for blair - a close friend and ally of president george w. bush - to get the post .
reports said the announcement was apparently delayed because of russian reservations . merkel described blair as a man of great political experience , who could provide an important contribution to finding a solution to the mideast conflict . european media reports said the decision had been made solely between the us and blair behind closed doors .
the quartet was then informed of it later . blair 's power will be limited steinmeier said blair would receive a closely defined mandate .
his work would focus on " institution building in , and political strengthening of , the palestinian authority , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the quartet will keep control of the middle east peace process this limitation was due to the fact " that the quartet itself wants to keep the political task of shaping the middle east peace process in its own hands , " steinmeier said .
the minister did n't express any doubts about blair 's qualification for the post .
but at the same time , he did n't explicitly praise blair either . according to media reports , there are concerns in berlin that blair could seize the diplomatic process in the middle east and therefore harm the quartet 's work .
other eu member states fear that blair could weaken the position of eu foreign policy chief javier solana , who has been working on solutions to the arab-israeli conflict for years . " solana is a member of the quartet while blair will be working for the quartet , " steinmeier said .
" the difference is clear . " russia held back un spokeswoman michele montas said on wednesday that blair would " mobilize international assistance to the palestinians , working closely with donors and existing coordination bodies . "
his tasks included helping to identify and secure " appropriate international support in addressing the institutional governance needs of the palestinian state , " she said . blair 's work would be " in support of the agreed quartet objectives , " montas said . a small team of experts based in jerusalem will support blair , who will spend significant time in the region , montas added . russia had previously stalled blair 's appointment .
according to german officials , russia had held back its support because of the lack of consultation on the move .
only on tuesday did moscow give its assent . allies support blair 's appointment although he is well respected in israel , the arab world has sharply criticized blair for britain 's role in the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq , as well as his support of israel 's war in lebanon last summer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana is a key architect of the roadmap for peace in the middle east but blair won backing from his allies for his new role . " tony will help palestinians develop the political and economic institutions they will need for a democratic , sovereign state able to provide for its people and live in peace and security with israel , " bush said . palestinian president mahmud abbas and israel also expressed their approval .
israeli prime minister ehud olmert " believes that blair can have a favorable impact , in particular by helping the palestinians develop solid governmental structures , " his spokeswoman miri eisin said . but the hamas movement controlling the gaza strip said the appointment " is not acceptable to hamas nor to the palestinians . " the middle east quartet has tried to implement a " roadmap " for israeli-palestinian peace since 2003 .
but the three-stage blueprint that should have led to the creation of a palestinian state living side by side in peace with israel by 2005 has since decayed . the post of quartet representative had been vacant since former world bank chairman james wolfensohn resigned in frustration in may 2006 . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the us says they are key in its war against terrorism but europeans worry the measures erode civil liberties . eu officials said wednesday that the eu and the us had reached a deal following a meeting between franco frattini , the eu justice and home affairs commissioner , michael chertoff , the us secretary for homeland security and wolfgang schäuble , the interior minister of germany which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
" a political agreement in principle was reached , " said roscam abbing , a spokesman for frattini .
data privacy a thorny issue data privacy has been a sticking point between the eu and the us ever since washington intensified anti-terrorism efforts after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks .
following the attacks on new york and washington , the eu and the us signed an agreement under which the eu agreed to grant us authorities access to up to 34 categories of information on passengers on all flights to the us taking off from eu member states .
these included names , addresses , phone numbers and credit card numbers of travelers .
that agreement , which is set to expire on july 31 , had stirred unease among eu lawmakers amid mounting concerns that civil liberties were being eroded in the fight against global terrorism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flying to the us is usually a security hassle for passengers in a letter this month to interior and justice ministers of portugal , which takes over the eu presidency from germany next month , the european data protection supervisor , peter hustinx said eu governments were sacrificing too much of their citizens ' privacy in the fight against terrorism . " i fear that messages such as ' no right to privacy until life and security are guaranteed ' are developing into a mantra suggesting that fundamental rights and freedoms are a luxury that security can not afford , " hustinx wrote . last may , the air travel data deal was annulled by the european court of justice in luxembourg and the two sides reached an interim agreement .
the eu had warned that airlines would be vulnerable to privacy complaints if no replacement deal had been reached before the interim one expired .
though details of the accord reached this week have not been released , german interior minister schäuble told an eu parliamentary briefing in strasbourg that the aim was to reduce the number of stored data on passengers that the us currently receives from 34 to 20 .
it remains unclear what pieces of personal data will be left out from the new us list .
an eu diplomat said under the new arrangement the data would now be kept by the us for 15 years , up from 3 1/2 years in the interim agreement .
the european side also sought to end the us ability to directly access flight booking computers , arguing instead that airlines should send the data .
europeans are the biggest group of travelers to the us .
deal on access to bank data separately , the us and the eu also struck a deal setting conditions for the us treasury department to view records of the international banking network swift in anti-terrorism probes .
european civil liberties group watchdogs had complained that swift , which handles global financial transfers and is based in brussels , violated european privacy laws by allowing the us to secretly consult its records .
washington has argued that the access is essential for its drive to end funding to terror networks .
the us will now only use swift data for counter-terrorism purposes and store it for a maximum of five years , according to the terms of the new deal . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the us says they are key in its war against terrorism but europeans worry the measures erode civil liberties . eu officials said wednesday that the eu and the us had reached a deal following a meeting between franco frattini , the eu justice and home affairs commissioner , michael chertoff , the us secretary for homeland security and wolfgang schäuble , the interior minister of germany which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
" a political agreement in principle was reached , " said roscam abbing , a spokesman for frattini .
data privacy a thorny issue data privacy has been a sticking point between the eu and the us ever since washington intensified anti-terrorism efforts after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks .
following the attacks on new york and washington , the eu and the us signed an agreement under which the eu agreed to grant us authorities access to up to 34 categories of information on passengers on all flights to the us taking off from eu member states .
these included names , addresses , phone numbers and credit card numbers of travelers .
that agreement , which is set to expire on july 31 , had stirred unease among eu lawmakers amid mounting concerns that civil liberties were being eroded in the fight against global terrorism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flying to the us is usually a security hassle for passengers in a letter this month to interior and justice ministers of portugal , which takes over the eu presidency from germany next month , the european data protection supervisor , peter hustinx said eu governments were sacrificing too much of their citizens ' privacy in the fight against terrorism . " i fear that messages such as ' no right to privacy until life and security are guaranteed ' are developing into a mantra suggesting that fundamental rights and freedoms are a luxury that security can not afford , " hustinx wrote . last may , the air travel data deal was annulled by the european court of justice in luxembourg and the two sides reached an interim agreement .
the eu had warned that airlines would be vulnerable to privacy complaints if no replacement deal had been reached before the interim one expired .
though details of the accord reached this week have not been released , german interior minister schäuble told an eu parliamentary briefing in strasbourg that the aim was to reduce the number of stored data on passengers that the us currently receives from 34 to 20 .
it remains unclear what pieces of personal data will be left out from the new us list .
an eu diplomat said under the new arrangement the data would now be kept by the us for 15 years , up from 3 1/2 years in the interim agreement .
the european side also sought to end the us ability to directly access flight booking computers , arguing instead that airlines should send the data .
europeans are the biggest group of travelers to the us .
deal on access to bank data separately , the us and the eu also struck a deal setting conditions for the us treasury department to view records of the international banking network swift in anti-terrorism probes .
european civil liberties group watchdogs had complained that swift , which handles global financial transfers and is based in brussels , violated european privacy laws by allowing the us to secretly consult its records .
washington has argued that the access is essential for its drive to end funding to terror networks .
the us will now only use swift data for counter-terrorism purposes and store it for a maximum of five years , according to the terms of the new deal . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

founder jimmy wales spoke to dw-world about the secret of its success . jimmy wales was born in alabama , usa , in 1966 .
he studied finance and worked as a research director at the chicago stock exchange .
in 2001 he founded wikipedia which is a multilingual , web-based , free content encyclopedia project .
it is written collaboratively by volunteers .
the vast majority of its articles can be edited by anyone with access to the internet .
from 2003 to 2006 , jimmy wales was headed the wikimedia foundation , wikipedia 's non-profit parent organization .
in 2004 , he founded the for-profit internet portal wikia , which is now supposed to carry on his newest project , the search engine wikia search .
jimmy wales lives in florida with his wife and his daughter . dw-world : a famous american magazine has chosen you as one of the 100 people who shape our world .
how does it feel to be a world shaper ?
jimmy wales : i thought that was sort of funny .
i enjoyed it of course , but tyra banks - the supermodel - was also on the list .
so i don ’ t know how meaningful it really is .
but i feel a real sense of responsibility that i am in a position where i can have some influence and i can say something people listen to .
i try not to say very much because of that .
because i want to make sure that what i do say is something that i can really believe in .
equality , unlimited faculty , no hierarchy : is that just the philosophy of wikipedia or is it your philosophy of life in general ?
that is pretty much my philosophy .
a lot of wikipedia reflects things that i believe in very strongly .
sometimes people think if you believe that everyone should participate then you think right and wrong don ‘ t matter and everybody ’ s opinion is as good as everyone else ’ s .
it may seem paradoxical to them , but , no , i think that some people are really not that smart and that they are not that useful .
but leaving open the possibility for participation means that we are able to get a lot of great ideas from lots of different places .
wikipedia owes its success to the community , to all the people who write articles every day without getting paid .
why do they do that for wikipedia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikipedia has 75,000 contributors in over 100 languages .
i think there are two reasons .
one reason is that the charity of our mission is inspiring a lot of people .
but i think that ’ s a fairly limited reason .
the main reason is that it ’ s fun .
the people just enjoy the process , they enjoy meeting other intellectual people , it ’ s a great hobby .
we know that intuitively if we think about people plying football on the weekends .
we don ’ t say : " gee , gosh , you 're going to play football and you don ’ t get paid for that ? ”
that ’ s silly , right ?
obviously people are doing it because they enjoy it and they have fun .
it is a similar thing with wikipedia .
some people earn a lot of money writing but others can do it just for fun .
you seem to do it just for fun too .
because although wikipedia is very successful you are not earning any money because it is a charitable project .
do you sometimes think that you did something wrong ?
i always joke that when i registered wikipedia as a non-profit organization , it was either the dumbest thing or the smartest thing i ever did .
the dumbest for the obvious reason that i get to hang out with billionaires but i don ’ t have any money .
the smartest , though , because i don ‘ t think it could have been nearly as successful as it is and also because i think it will be remembered in the future .
100 or 200 years from now people will point to wikipedia and say : that was a really good thing that did something beneficial for the world .
so that is something i am very proud of .
why wouldn ’ t it have worked out as a commercial organization ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new era of user generated content and social networking is often referred to as web 2.0 i think that for an encyclopedia that is really attempting this very grand ethical mission of sharing knowledge with everyone , being a non-profit organization is really the right approach .
it means that , as a community , we have the luxury of doing things the right way rather than doing things in a way that is dictated by current economic circumstances .
the internet video platform you tube was sold for $ 1.65 billion -lrb- 1.23 billion euros -rrb- .
how much would sell wikipedia for ?
i don ’ t know what it ’ s worth , it ’ s really interesting .
it has very low revenue .
but i guess you could slap ads all over it and make some money .
i think the wikimedia foundation - the owner of wikipedia - could in fact sell it .
nobody ’ s interested in doing that , but certainly if there was an offer of $ 3 billion , i think the foundation would have to seriously think about what could be done for the charitable purposes of the foundation in distributing free knowledge if we outsourced the community or something .
your new project , the search engine wikia search , which will launch at the end of this year , will be commercial .
why did you change your mind ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wales aims to challenge google 's dominance in the search engine market .
for some types of projects - if you think about running hospitals or the red cross - the charitable model works well .
people are willing to donate money , enough to make it last .
but for other things like running a chain of grocery stores , there have never been very successful charities that have done such things .
i think different kinds of work demands different kinds of organization .
there are so many search engines on the internet already .
why does the world actually need another one ?
the search engines we have right now are black boxes and not transparent .
they are not community controlled and the quality is ... well , it 's pretty good but it stagnated the last two or three years .
there are lots of ways in which searches have not improved as much as a lot of us would have liked .
i don ’ t know how to improve search beyond what already exists .
but i do think that a broad community of people and an open scientific dialogue about how to do that can probably make some progress .
anyway it ’ s fun .
i always do the most fun thing .
and what will be the next big thing coming up on the internet ?
i don ’ t know .
i always remind people that five years ago , i was just this guy sitting at home in my pajamas typing on the internet .
and now i get asked deep questions about the future .
the trend i see right now is that we are very much at the beginning of free licensing of culture .
and we are still very much at the beginning of the design of communities for producing good quality work .
so i think that there is still a lot of room in those areas . christine elsaesser interviewed jimmy wales send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a lot of wikipedia reflects things that i believe in very strongly .
sometimes people think if you believe that everyone should participate then you think right and wrong don ‘ t matter and everybody ’ s opinion is as good as everyone else ’ s .
it may seem paradoxical to them , but , no , i think that some people are really not that smart and that they are not that useful .
but leaving open the possibility for participation means that we are able to get a lot of great ideas from lots of different places .
wikipedia owes its success to the community , to all the people who write articles every day without getting paid .
why do they do that for wikipedia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikipedia has 75,000 contributors in over 100 languages .
i think there are two reasons .
one reason is that the charity of our mission is inspiring a lot of people .
but i think that ’ s a fairly limited reason .
the main reason is that it ’ s fun .
the people just enjoy the process , they enjoy meeting other intellectual people , it ’ s a great hobby .
we know that intuitively if we think about people plying football on the weekends .
we don ’ t say : " gee , gosh , you 're going to play football and you don ’ t get paid for that ? ”
that ’ s silly , right ?
obviously people are doing it because they enjoy it and they have fun .
it is a similar thing with wikipedia .
some people earn a lot of money writing but others can do it just for fun .
you seem to do it just for fun too .
because although wikipedia is very successful you are not earning any money because it is a charitable project .
do you sometimes think that you did something wrong ?
i always joke that when i registered wikipedia as a non-profit organization , it was either the dumbest thing or the smartest thing i ever did .
the dumbest for the obvious reason that i get to hang out with billionaires but i don ’ t have any money .
the smartest , though , because i don ‘ t think it could have been nearly as successful as it is and also because i think it will be remembered in the future .
100 or 200 years from now people will point to wikipedia and say : that was a really good thing that did something beneficial for the world .
so that is something i am very proud of .
why wouldn ’ t it have worked out as a commercial organization ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new era of user generated content and social networking is often referred to as web 2.0 i think that for an encyclopedia that is really attempting this very grand ethical mission of sharing knowledge with everyone , being a non-profit organization is really the right approach .
it means that , as a community , we have the luxury of doing things the right way rather than doing things in a way that is dictated by current economic circumstances .
the internet video platform you tube was sold for $ 1.65 billion -lrb- 1.23 billion euros -rrb- .
how much would sell wikipedia for ?
i don ’ t know what it ’ s worth , it ’ s really interesting .
it has very low revenue .
but i guess you could slap ads all over it and make some money .
i think the wikimedia foundation - the owner of wikipedia - could in fact sell it .
nobody ’ s interested in doing that , but certainly if there was an offer of $ 3 billion , i think the foundation would have to seriously think about what could be done for the charitable purposes of the foundation in distributing free knowledge if we outsourced the community or something .
your new project , the search engine wikia search , which will launch at the end of this year , will be commercial .
why did you change your mind ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wales aims to challenge google 's dominance in the search engine market .
for some types of projects - if you think about running hospitals or the red cross - the charitable model works well .
people are willing to donate money , enough to make it last .
but for other things like running a chain of grocery stores , there have never been very successful charities that have done such things .
i think different kinds of work demands different kinds of organization .
there are so many search engines on the internet already .
why does the world actually need another one ?
the search engines we have right now are black boxes and not transparent .
they are not community controlled and the quality is ... well , it 's pretty good but it stagnated the last two or three years .
there are lots of ways in which searches have not improved as much as a lot of us would have liked .
i don ’ t know how to improve search beyond what already exists .
but i do think that a broad community of people and an open scientific dialogue about how to do that can probably make some progress .
anyway it ’ s fun .
i always do the most fun thing .
and what will be the next big thing coming up on the internet ?
i don ’ t know .
i always remind people that five years ago , i was just this guy sitting at home in my pajamas typing on the internet .
and now i get asked deep questions about the future .
the trend i see right now is that we are very much at the beginning of free licensing of culture .
and we are still very much at the beginning of the design of communities for producing good quality work .
so i think that there is still a lot of room in those areas . christine elsaesser interviewed jimmy wales send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 28.06.2007 german scientists develop new approach to treating aids großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new enzyme can cut the aids virus out of sick cells german scientists have succeeded in snipping the virus that causes aids out of human cells , leaving them healthy again .
the procedure is a breakthrough in bio-technology and fuels hope of a cure for aids . the laboratory procedure removing the aids virus used an enzyme , said joachim hauber of the heinrich pette institute for experimental virology and immunology in hamburg . " we have rid the cells of the virus , " hauber said on thursday .
" no one else has done this before . "
he called it " a breakthrough in bio-technology . " hauber said it was his " cautious " hope that a cure for aids could be found within 10 years . current therapies can only limit the spread of the human immunodeficiency virus -lrb- hiv -rrb- and not remove it from the body .
hiv is a retrovirus that nests in the dna or key genetic material of infected cells . the max planck institute for molecular cell biology and genetics in dresden was the partner in the research , which will be reported in friday 's issue of the scientific journal science . cutting dna and recombining it three years of experiments on mice were planned next , to be followed by tests on humans in hamburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the enzyme knows just where to cut the dna the scientists ' method used the ability of so-called recombinase enzymes to cut strands of dna at certain places like a pair of scissors and recombine the strands . the new enzyme , tre , always recognized the right spot to snip the dna where the hiv started .
the scientists said it recognized a characteristic hiv sequence that scarcely ever mutated . tre was adapted from an existing natural enzyme , cre , which recognized similar genetic sequences . stem cells necessary for therapy the laboratories artificially evolved cre into tre through more than 120 recombinase generations .

analysts had forecast that seasonally adjusted unemployment would drop by 20,000 from may , when the jobless rate stood at 9.2 per cent .
" the driver is the good economic performance , " said alexander koch , an economist at the hypovereinsbank .
he added that employers were now complaining of growing labor shortages in key sectors of the economy .
consumer confidence gaining in strength job vacancies rose by 11.6 percent to 648,096 , thursday 's data showed as chancellor angela merkel 's government considers possible measures which could ease the way for skilled foreign workers to enter the german labor market to fill gaps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers are n't holding back falling unemployment has also helped to shore up consumer confidence in germany where stagnating household spending has been a drag on economic growth in recent years .
german consumer confidence is at a six-month high , a survey released this week showed .
predictions of higher wages in the nation are helping to fuel optimism among the nation 's consumers , the survey said .
the number of unemployed fell by 26,000 in the economically more important western part of the nation , the labor agency said , and by 11,000 in the nation 's former communist east .
growth could exceed 2.8 percent amid signs that the german economy has rebounded unexpectedly strongly from the hefty and unpopular hike in the nation 's value-added tax in january and this year 's us economic slowdown , economists have been revising upwards their 2007 growth forecasts for germany .
many economists now project german economic growth to match or possibly surpass last year 's perky 2.8 percent expansion rate .
but with two major economic sentiment surveys - the zew investor confidence report and the ifo business confidence index - recently pointing down , analysts also say that the nation 's economic expansion could be starting to plateau out .
indeed , germany 's retail traders ' association -lrb- hde -rrb- said on thursday it expected 2007 retail sales to fall in real terms after a difficult start to the year .
pollitically sensitive data in the meantime , thursday 's jobless figures showed the politically-sensitive unadjusted labor market data also fell in june , dropping by 25,000 from may to 3.687 million in june with the unemployment rate edging down 0.3 percentage points to 8.8 percent .
" the demand for workers has increased again , " said federal labor agency chief frank jürgen weise .
the june unadjusted unemployment figures represented a 712,000 decline compared to june 2006 , when the jobless rate stood at 10.5 percent .
this represents an average monthly fall of 60,000 over the last 12 months .
the fall in seasonally unadjusted or headline unemployment was also more than expected by analysts , who had forecast a month-on-month fall in june of about 75,000 .
while the economists see the seasonally adjusted data as pointing to trends in the labor market , the headline data has become more politically significant in germany . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" anybody who tries to weigh up the dead of the second world war against votes in the -lrb- eu -rrb- council has to be rejected out of hand , " martin schulz , leader of the socialist group in the european parliament , told fellow lawmakers in brussels on wednesday to loud applause .
" the eu is an idea aimed at eliminating the specters of the past ...
we will not permit the few to bring up those specters , " he added .
schulz was referring to kacyznski 's remarks that poland deserved more voting power in the eu because its population would have been far larger if it had not been decimated during the nazi era .
the prime minister compounded matters on tuesday when he compared modern-day germany to the era that brought adolf hitler to power .

poland eventually won concessions at the summit , notably a delay to the introduction of the new voting system which it opposed , but faced criticism for its negotiating manner .
the german chancellor continues to seek to play down the dispute with poland .

but eckart von klaeden , the foreign policy spokesman for the conservative cdu / csu bloc , has also called for the matter to be approached in a more relaxed manner .
he told the hannoversche allgemeine zeitung that press freedom also protected things that people might regard as stupid or tasteless .
von klaeden also referred to a caricature that appeared in germany 's taz newspaper a year ago that compared the polish president as " poland 's new potato . "
at that time berlin responded to protests from warsaw by referring to the freedom of the press .
" exactly the same standards should apply with regards to the cover of a polish magazine , " he said .
von klaeden also expressed optimism that the tensions between germany and poland would soon settle .

but eckart von klaeden , the foreign policy spokesman for the conservative cdu / csu bloc , has also called for the matter to be approached in a more relaxed manner .
he told the hannoversche allgemeine zeitung that press freedom also protected things that people might regard as stupid or tasteless .
von klaeden also referred to a caricature that appeared in germany 's taz newspaper a year ago that compared the polish president as " poland 's new potato . "
at that time berlin responded to protests from warsaw by referring to the freedom of the press .

that would be a spontaneous reaction to blair 's appointment as middle east envoy .
actually , just about anyone who did n't have the colonial past of a briton in the middle east , had not driven the iraq war as a " lap dog " of the american president and not delayed a truce during the lebanon war last year as blair did would have been a better person for the job .
despite these facts , the mideast quartet - which comprises the us , the eu , the un and russia - chose the former british prime minister as the new mideast envoy .
the quartet did n't seem to have any serious reservations about the appointment .
even the russians did n't seem to have any doubts about blair 's skills as a trouble shooter despite being at loggerheads with him in the scandal involving the murder of a former russian agent .
but can the former british premier position himself as a neutral representative and mediator ?
you have to doubt it in light of his close alliance with the us and israel .
the question is whether blair will really mediate in the ongoing trouble in the middle east .
his responsibility largely lies in helping the palestinian parties lift themselves out of the crisis .
he is meant to help the palestinians build democratic institutions and in the course of that job he will naturally have to often report to washington to request specific american help .
given his excellent ties with the white house , that should be easy for blair as compared with honorable representatives from second-tier friendly nations .
there 's no disputing that less mistrust of the mideast envoy would make his job easier .
but in the past even american jews such as henry kissinger or dennis ross have successfully mediated in the middle east on behalf of the white house .
why should blair not have the same success on behalf of the mideast quartet ?
especially considering that it will be the quartet and not blair who will decide which direction to take .
that decision too will be limited since the direction is long well known ; it 's that path that negotiators ca n't agree on .
during his farewell speech to the house of commons , blair declared that the middle east must have place for two states - israel and palestine .
by now all sensible and right-minded individuals accept that formula and it also forms the core of the " roadmap " of the middle east aimed to resolve the conflict .
the arab league too is committed to the " two state " solution .
only radical groups continue to reject it .
but then again nobody would try to talk peace with them .
that 's why blair might succeed in moving things along .
and if he does n't then he would n't be the first to fail at the task .

we are unusual , as british people go , but for my husband and me , germany is probably our favorite holiday destination and one reason for that is the stunning variety on offer .
each state has its own culture , architecture and natural scenery .
looking for new places to explore and discover , we started going east a couple of years ago and we were not disappointed - far from it .
from large , culture-rich cities like dresden and weimar to small , historic towns like meissen and quedlinburg , we 've found much to recommend .
there is so much history to explore and we have found the local people extremely welcoming , very helpful and eager to provide an excellent service to visitors .
our only surprise has been the low numbers of other visitors -lrb- especially other western europeans -rrb- .
if you do n't go soon , then you 'll be missing something extraordinary precisely because it is a place in transition , yet still , in parts , clinging to its unique identity and culture .
this will go in time , as is the way in a globalized society , so make the most of it while you can ! - liz , great britain eurail is a great bargain !
if you can , buy a pass .
trains in germany make our amtrak look like the trash it is .
i also recommend public transport in german cities .
germany was smart when they kept trams in their cities .
dresden is a great art treasure and we plan to return soon .
i also recommend leipzig , especially if you enjoy baroque and classical music . - samuel r. ganczaruk , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : take a christmas cruise , recommended a reader we are a group of spaniards visiting frankfurt .
at the suggestion of one local we went yesterday to a typical frankfurt cider tavern called zur sonne .
people here told us not to go to sachsenhausen -lrb- trashy and touristy , full of irish pubs and caipirinha bars these days -rrb- but rather to the north end and bornheim district , which are very young and picturesque .
apple wine , as everyone warned us , takes some " getting used to " but after a few glasses it tastes almost like a good penedes !
-lrb- only a joke ! -rrb-
the atmosphere in these taverns - which during warm months have large gardens - is very friendly and convivial .
the food is wonderful -lrb- try the local specialty , green sauce -rrb- and prices are very fair . - ramiro ruiz , spain i 've visited germany twice .
it is really a very nice country to visit .
everything is well prepared .
i really enjoyed my vacation and hope to visit another time . - sawsan , sudan germany has restored my happy feelings for christmas and i send my sincere congratulations to the german people for their celebration of christmas .
the christmas markets are wonderful and the people are very friendly and a joy to be with .
we were on a river cruise in december 2006 , starting in cologne and ending in nuremberg .
my wife is an organist and loved every opportunity to hear another organ .
we were so impressed with the entire trip that we are planning for another christmas cruise in december 2008 and are inviting family and friends to share the experience . - joseph , us compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de readers recommend visiting dresden , bamberg , lübeck readers wrote in with tips on train travel in germany and recommendations on where to go .

" anybody who tries to weigh up the dead of the second world war against votes in the -lrb- eu -rrb- council has to be rejected out of hand , " martin schulz , leader of the socialist group in the european parliament , told fellow lawmakers in brussels on wednesday to loud applause .
" the eu is an idea aimed at eliminating the specters of the past ...
we will not permit the few to bring up those specters , " he added .
schulz was referring to kacyznski 's remarks that poland deserved more voting power in the eu because its population would have been far larger if it had not been decimated during the nazi era .
the prime minister compounded matters on tuesday when he compared modern-day germany to the era that brought adolf hitler to power .
" not representative " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bilateral relations have been strained since the kaczynski twins came to power marek siwiec , a polish member of the european parliament said that kaczynski 's comments and the polish blocking tactics at the eu summit did not represent the views of the polish people .
he praised germany for avoiding any kind of " demonstration of power " in its role as holder of the eu presidency vis-a-vis poland and other eu states and praised german chancellor angela merkel 's pleasant " new leadership style . "
poland eventually won concessions at the summit , notably a delay to the introduction of the new voting system which it opposed , but faced criticism for its negotiating manner .
the german chancellor continues to seek to play down the dispute with poland .
" for us our polish neighbor has the same importance as our french neighbor , " she said in a speech on wednesday in brussels .
she has not commented on a controversial caricature of her that appeared on the front cover of the conservative polish magazine wprost on monday .
entitled the " stepmother of europe , " the photomontage depicted the german chancellor breast-feeding the kaczynski twins .
outrage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this controversial caricature has also provoked a storm of outrage a number of german politicians expressed outrage on tuesday about the caricature that accompanied an article written by mariusz muszynski , the polish foreign minister 's commissioner for german-polish relations .
but eckart von klaeden , the foreign policy spokesman for the conservative cdu / csu bloc , has also called for the matter to be approached in a more relaxed manner .
he told the hannoversche allgemeine zeitung that press freedom also protected things that people might regard as stupid or tasteless .
von klaeden also referred to a caricature that appeared in germany 's taz newspaper a year ago that compared the polish president as " poland 's new potato . "
at that time berlin responded to protests from warsaw by referring to the freedom of the press .
" exactly the same standards should apply with regards to the cover of a polish magazine , " he said .
von klaeden also expressed optimism that the tensions between germany and poland would soon settle .
" once all the momentary fuss has subsided , it will be possible to clearly see the success of the summit in brussels , " he said . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

analysts had forecast that seasonally adjusted unemployment would drop by 20,000 from may , when the jobless rate stood at 9.2 per cent .
" the driver is the good economic performance , " said alexander koch , an economist at the hypovereinsbank .
he added that employers were now complaining of growing labor shortages in key sectors of the economy .
consumer confidence gaining in strength job vacancies rose by 11.6 percent to 648,096 , thursday 's data showed as chancellor angela merkel 's government considers possible measures which could ease the way for skilled foreign workers to enter the german labor market to fill gaps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers are n't holding back falling unemployment has also helped to shore up consumer confidence in germany where stagnating household spending has been a drag on economic growth in recent years .
german consumer confidence is at a six-month high , a survey released this week showed .
predictions of higher wages in the nation are helping to fuel optimism among the nation 's consumers , the survey said .
the number of unemployed fell by 26,000 in the economically more important western part of the nation , the labor agency said , and by 11,000 in the nation 's former communist east .
growth could exceed 2.8 percent amid signs that the german economy has rebounded unexpectedly strongly from the hefty and unpopular hike in the nation 's value-added tax in january and this year 's us economic slowdown , economists have been revising upwards their 2007 growth forecasts for germany .
many economists now project german economic growth to match or possibly surpass last year 's perky 2.8 percent expansion rate .
but with two major economic sentiment surveys - the zew investor confidence report and the ifo business confidence index - recently pointing down , analysts also say that the nation 's economic expansion could be starting to plateau out .
indeed , germany 's retail traders ' association -lrb- hde -rrb- said on thursday it expected 2007 retail sales to fall in real terms after a difficult start to the year .
pollitically sensitive data in the meantime , thursday 's jobless figures showed the politically-sensitive unadjusted labor market data also fell in june , dropping by 25,000 from may to 3.687 million in june with the unemployment rate edging down 0.3 percentage points to 8.8 percent .
" the demand for workers has increased again , " said federal labor agency chief frank jürgen weise .
the june unadjusted unemployment figures represented a 712,000 decline compared to june 2006 , when the jobless rate stood at 10.5 percent .
this represents an average monthly fall of 60,000 over the last 12 months .
the fall in seasonally unadjusted or headline unemployment was also more than expected by analysts , who had forecast a month-on-month fall in june of about 75,000 .
while the economists see the seasonally adjusted data as pointing to trends in the labor market , the headline data has become more politically significant in germany . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we will do all we can to place relations with the south higher up on the european list of priorities , " prime minister jose socrates said .
lisbon will also try to revitalize relations with africa , boost mediterranean dialog and contribute to middle east peace efforts .
lisbon must take on the treaty starting on july 1 , when it officially takes over the presidency from germany , portugal will also take on considerable baggage , in particular the challenge of getting a revamped eu reform treaty approved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's federal chancellor angela merkel during treaty negotiations the recent eu summit in brussels forged a compromise on a reform treaty to overhaul decision-making processes in the 27-nation bloc , replacing a more ambitious plan for a common constitution .
the new document is shorter , but could be fraught with more legal problems , partly because of special arrangements granted to britain and poland .
" our goal is ... not to lose the dynamics of the agreement reached in brussels and to approve a new treaty as soon as possible , " socrates said on wednesday .
lisbon wants a conference to begin drawing up the treaty on july 23 so that it can be approved in october .

the foreign policy changes sought by portugal include attempts to seek peace in the middle east .
lisbon also wants to send a " signal of good will " to turkey , a muslim country aspiring to join the eu .
prime minister socrates , however , has promised that the southern emphasis will not lead portugal to neglect other crucial concerns such as the stabilization of the balkans or relations with russia , the portuguese presidency faces a complex agenda .
its task could be made a little easier by smooth communication with european commission president jose manuel barroso , a former portuguese prime minister , observers said . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

analysts had forecast that seasonally adjusted unemployment would drop by 20,000 from may , when the jobless rate stood at 9.2 per cent .
" the driver is the good economic performance , " said alexander koch , an economist at the hypovereinsbank .
he added that employers were now complaining of growing labor shortages in key sectors of the economy .
consumer confidence gaining in strength job vacancies rose by 11.6 percent to 648,096 , thursday 's data showed as chancellor angela merkel 's government considers possible measures which could ease the way for skilled foreign workers to enter the german labor market to fill gaps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers are n't holding back falling unemployment has also helped to shore up consumer confidence in germany where stagnating household spending has been a drag on economic growth in recent years .
german consumer confidence is at a six-month high , a survey released this week showed .
predictions of higher wages in the nation are helping to fuel optimism among the nation 's consumers , the survey said .
the number of unemployed fell by 26,000 in the economically more important western part of the nation , the labor agency said , and by 11,000 in the nation 's former communist east .
growth could exceed 2.8 percent amid signs that the german economy has rebounded unexpectedly strongly from the hefty and unpopular hike in the nation 's value-added tax in january and this year 's us economic slowdown , economists have been revising upwards their 2007 growth forecasts for germany .
many economists now project german economic growth to match or possibly surpass last year 's perky 2.8 percent expansion rate .
but with two major economic sentiment surveys - the zew investor confidence report and the ifo business confidence index - recently pointing down , analysts also say that the nation 's economic expansion could be starting to plateau out .
indeed , germany 's retail traders ' association -lrb- hde -rrb- said on thursday it expected 2007 retail sales to fall in real terms after a difficult start to the year .
pollitically sensitive data in the meantime , thursday 's jobless figures showed the politically-sensitive unadjusted labor market data also fell in june , dropping by 25,000 from may to 3.687 million in june with the unemployment rate edging down 0.3 percentage points to 8.8 percent .
" the demand for workers has increased again , " said federal labor agency chief frank jürgen weise .
the june unadjusted unemployment figures represented a 712,000 decline compared to june 2006 , when the jobless rate stood at 10.5 percent .
this represents an average monthly fall of 60,000 over the last 12 months .
the fall in seasonally unadjusted or headline unemployment was also more than expected by analysts , who had forecast a month-on-month fall in june of about 75,000 .
while the economists see the seasonally adjusted data as pointing to trends in the labor market , the headline data has become more politically significant in germany . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" anybody who tries to weigh up the dead of the second world war against votes in the -lrb- eu -rrb- council has to be rejected out of hand , " martin schulz , leader of the socialist group in the european parliament , told fellow lawmakers in brussels on wednesday to loud applause .
" the eu is an idea aimed at eliminating the specters of the past ...
we will not permit the few to bring up those specters , " he added .
schulz was referring to kacyznski 's remarks that poland deserved more voting power in the eu because its population would have been far larger if it had not been decimated during the nazi era .
the prime minister compounded matters on tuesday when he compared modern-day germany to the era that brought adolf hitler to power .
" not representative " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bilateral relations have been strained since the kaczynski twins came to power marek siwiec , a polish member of the european parliament said that kaczynski 's comments and the polish blocking tactics at the eu summit did not represent the views of the polish people .
he praised germany for avoiding any kind of " demonstration of power " in its role as holder of the eu presidency vis-a-vis poland and other eu states and praised german chancellor angela merkel 's pleasant " new leadership style . "
poland eventually won concessions at the summit , notably a delay to the introduction of the new voting system which it opposed , but faced criticism for its negotiating manner .
the german chancellor continues to seek to play down the dispute with poland .
" for us our polish neighbor has the same importance as our french neighbor , " she said in a speech on wednesday in brussels .
she has not commented on a controversial caricature of her that appeared on the front cover of the conservative polish magazine wprost on monday .
entitled the " stepmother of europe , " the photomontage depicted the german chancellor breast-feeding the kaczynski twins .
outrage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this controversial caricature has also provoked a storm of outrage a number of german politicians expressed outrage on tuesday about the caricature that accompanied an article written by mariusz muszynski , the polish foreign minister 's commissioner for german-polish relations .
but eckart von klaeden , the foreign policy spokesman for the conservative cdu / csu bloc , has also called for the matter to be approached in a more relaxed manner .
he told the hannoversche allgemeine zeitung that press freedom also protected things that people might regard as stupid or tasteless .
von klaeden also referred to a caricature that appeared in germany 's taz newspaper a year ago that compared the polish president as " poland 's new potato . "
at that time berlin responded to protests from warsaw by referring to the freedom of the press .
" exactly the same standards should apply with regards to the cover of a polish magazine , " he said .
von klaeden also expressed optimism that the tensions between germany and poland would soon settle .
" once all the momentary fuss has subsided , it will be possible to clearly see the success of the summit in brussels , " he said . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

we are unusual , as british people go , but for my husband and me , germany is probably our favorite holiday destination and one reason for that is the stunning variety on offer .
each state has its own culture , architecture and natural scenery .
looking for new places to explore and discover , we started going east a couple of years ago and we were not disappointed - far from it .
from large , culture-rich cities like dresden and weimar to small , historic towns like meissen and quedlinburg , we 've found much to recommend .
there is so much history to explore and we have found the local people extremely welcoming , very helpful and eager to provide an excellent service to visitors .
our only surprise has been the low numbers of other visitors -lrb- especially other western europeans -rrb- .
if you do n't go soon , then you 'll be missing something extraordinary precisely because it is a place in transition , yet still , in parts , clinging to its unique identity and culture .
this will go in time , as is the way in a globalized society , so make the most of it while you can ! - liz , great britain eurail is a great bargain !
if you can , buy a pass .
trains in germany make our amtrak look like the trash it is .
i also recommend public transport in german cities .
germany was smart when they kept trams in their cities .
dresden is a great art treasure and we plan to return soon .
i also recommend leipzig , especially if you enjoy baroque and classical music . - samuel r. ganczaruk , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : take a christmas cruise , recommended a reader we are a group of spaniards visiting frankfurt .
at the suggestion of one local we went yesterday to a typical frankfurt cider tavern called zur sonne .
people here told us not to go to sachsenhausen -lrb- trashy and touristy , full of irish pubs and caipirinha bars these days -rrb- but rather to the north end and bornheim district , which are very young and picturesque .
apple wine , as everyone warned us , takes some " getting used to " but after a few glasses it tastes almost like a good penedes !
-lrb- only a joke ! -rrb-
the atmosphere in these taverns - which during warm months have large gardens - is very friendly and convivial .
the food is wonderful -lrb- try the local specialty , green sauce -rrb- and prices are very fair . - ramiro ruiz , spain i 've visited germany twice .
it is really a very nice country to visit .
everything is well prepared .
i really enjoyed my vacation and hope to visit another time . - sawsan , sudan germany has restored my happy feelings for christmas and i send my sincere congratulations to the german people for their celebration of christmas .
the christmas markets are wonderful and the people are very friendly and a joy to be with .
we were on a river cruise in december 2006 , starting in cologne and ending in nuremberg .
my wife is an organist and loved every opportunity to hear another organ .
we were so impressed with the entire trip that we are planning for another christmas cruise in december 2008 and are inviting family and friends to share the experience . - joseph , us compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de readers recommend visiting dresden , bamberg , lübeck readers wrote in with tips on train travel in germany and recommendations on where to go .

founder jimmy wales spoke to dw-world about the secret of its success . jimmy wales was born in alabama , usa , in 1966 .
he studied finance and worked as a research director at the chicago stock exchange .
in 2001 he founded wikipedia which is a multilingual , web-based , free content encyclopedia project .
it is written collaboratively by volunteers .
the vast majority of its articles can be edited by anyone with access to the internet .
from 2003 to 2006 , jimmy wales was headed the wikimedia foundation , wikipedia 's non-profit parent organization .
in 2004 , he founded the for-profit internet portal wikia , which is now supposed to carry on his newest project , the search engine wikia search .
jimmy wales lives in florida with his wife and his daughter . dw-world : a famous american magazine has chosen you as one of the 100 people who shape our world .
how does it feel to be a world shaper ?
jimmy wales : i thought that was sort of funny .
i enjoyed it of course , but tyra banks - the supermodel - was also on the list .
so i don ’ t know how meaningful it really is .
but i feel a real sense of responsibility that i am in a position where i can have some influence and i can say something people listen to .
i try not to say very much because of that .
because i want to make sure that what i do say is something that i can really believe in .
equality , unlimited faculty , no hierarchy : is that just the philosophy of wikipedia or is it your philosophy of life in general ?
that is pretty much my philosophy .
a lot of wikipedia reflects things that i believe in very strongly .
sometimes people think if you believe that everyone should participate then you think right and wrong don ‘ t matter and everybody ’ s opinion is as good as everyone else ’ s .
it may seem paradoxical to them , but , no , i think that some people are really not that smart and that they are not that useful .
but leaving open the possibility for participation means that we are able to get a lot of great ideas from lots of different places .
wikipedia owes its success to the community , to all the people who write articles every day without getting paid .
why do they do that for wikipedia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikipedia has 75,000 contributors in over 100 languages .
i think there are two reasons .
one reason is that the charity of our mission is inspiring a lot of people .
but i think that ’ s a fairly limited reason .
the main reason is that it ’ s fun .
the people just enjoy the process , they enjoy meeting other intellectual people , it ’ s a great hobby .
we know that intuitively if we think about people plying football on the weekends .
we don ’ t say : " gee , gosh , you 're going to play football and you don ’ t get paid for that ? ”
that ’ s silly , right ?
obviously people are doing it because they enjoy it and they have fun .
it is a similar thing with wikipedia .
some people earn a lot of money writing but others can do it just for fun .
you seem to do it just for fun too .
because although wikipedia is very successful you are not earning any money because it is a charitable project .
do you sometimes think that you did something wrong ?
i always joke that when i registered wikipedia as a non-profit organization , it was either the dumbest thing or the smartest thing i ever did .
the dumbest for the obvious reason that i get to hang out with billionaires but i don ’ t have any money .
the smartest , though , because i don ‘ t think it could have been nearly as successful as it is and also because i think it will be remembered in the future .
100 or 200 years from now people will point to wikipedia and say : that was a really good thing that did something beneficial for the world .
so that is something i am very proud of .
why wouldn ’ t it have worked out as a commercial organization ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new era of user generated content and social networking is often referred to as web 2.0 i think that for an encyclopedia that is really attempting this very grand ethical mission of sharing knowledge with everyone , being a non-profit organization is really the right approach .
it means that , as a community , we have the luxury of doing things the right way rather than doing things in a way that is dictated by current economic circumstances .
the internet video platform you tube was sold for $ 1.65 billion -lrb- 1.23 billion euros -rrb- .
how much would sell wikipedia for ?
i don ’ t know what it ’ s worth , it ’ s really interesting .
it has very low revenue .
but i guess you could slap ads all over it and make some money .
i think the wikimedia foundation - the owner of wikipedia - could in fact sell it .
nobody ’ s interested in doing that , but certainly if there was an offer of $ 3 billion , i think the foundation would have to seriously think about what could be done for the charitable purposes of the foundation in distributing free knowledge if we outsourced the community or something .
your new project , the search engine wikia search , which will launch at the end of this year , will be commercial .
why did you change your mind ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wales aims to challenge google 's dominance in the search engine market .
for some types of projects - if you think about running hospitals or the red cross - the charitable model works well .
people are willing to donate money , enough to make it last .
but for other things like running a chain of grocery stores , there have never been very successful charities that have done such things .
i think different kinds of work demands different kinds of organization .
there are so many search engines on the internet already .
why does the world actually need another one ?
the search engines we have right now are black boxes and not transparent .
they are not community controlled and the quality is ... well , it 's pretty good but it stagnated the last two or three years .
there are lots of ways in which searches have not improved as much as a lot of us would have liked .
i don ’ t know how to improve search beyond what already exists .
but i do think that a broad community of people and an open scientific dialogue about how to do that can probably make some progress .
anyway it ’ s fun .
i always do the most fun thing .
and what will be the next big thing coming up on the internet ?
i don ’ t know .
i always remind people that five years ago , i was just this guy sitting at home in my pajamas typing on the internet .
and now i get asked deep questions about the future .
the trend i see right now is that we are very much at the beginning of free licensing of culture .
and we are still very much at the beginning of the design of communities for producing good quality work .
so i think that there is still a lot of room in those areas . christine elsaesser interviewed jimmy wales send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that would be a spontaneous reaction to blair 's appointment as middle east envoy .
actually , just about anyone who did n't have the colonial past of a briton in the middle east , had not driven the iraq war as a " lap dog " of the american president and not delayed a truce during the lebanon war last year as blair did would have been a better person for the job .
despite these facts , the mideast quartet - which comprises the us , the eu , the un and russia - chose the former british prime minister as the new mideast envoy .
the quartet did n't seem to have any serious reservations about the appointment .
even the russians did n't seem to have any doubts about blair 's skills as a trouble shooter despite being at loggerheads with him in the scandal involving the murder of a former russian agent .
but can the former british premier position himself as a neutral representative and mediator ?
you have to doubt it in light of his close alliance with the us and israel .
the question is whether blair will really mediate in the ongoing trouble in the middle east .
his responsibility largely lies in helping the palestinian parties lift themselves out of the crisis .
he is meant to help the palestinians build democratic institutions and in the course of that job he will naturally have to often report to washington to request specific american help .
given his excellent ties with the white house , that should be easy for blair as compared with honorable representatives from second-tier friendly nations .
there 's no disputing that less mistrust of the mideast envoy would make his job easier .
but in the past even american jews such as henry kissinger or dennis ross have successfully mediated in the middle east on behalf of the white house .
why should blair not have the same success on behalf of the mideast quartet ?
especially considering that it will be the quartet and not blair who will decide which direction to take .
that decision too will be limited since the direction is long well known ; it 's that path that negotiators ca n't agree on .
during his farewell speech to the house of commons , blair declared that the middle east must have place for two states - israel and palestine .
by now all sensible and right-minded individuals accept that formula and it also forms the core of the " roadmap " of the middle east aimed to resolve the conflict .
the arab league too is committed to the " two state " solution .
only radical groups continue to reject it .
but then again nobody would try to talk peace with them .
that 's why blair might succeed in moving things along .
and if he does n't then he would n't be the first to fail at the task .

analysts had forecast that seasonally adjusted unemployment would drop by 20,000 from may , when the jobless rate stood at 9.2 per cent .
" the driver is the good economic performance , " said alexander koch , an economist at the hypovereinsbank .
he added that employers were now complaining of growing labor shortages in key sectors of the economy .
consumer confidence gaining in strength job vacancies rose by 11.6 percent to 648,096 , thursday 's data showed as chancellor angela merkel 's government considers possible measures which could ease the way for skilled foreign workers to enter the german labor market to fill gaps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers are n't holding back falling unemployment has also helped to shore up consumer confidence in germany where stagnating household spending has been a drag on economic growth in recent years .
german consumer confidence is at a six-month high , a survey released this week showed .
predictions of higher wages in the nation are helping to fuel optimism among the nation 's consumers , the survey said .
the number of unemployed fell by 26,000 in the economically more important western part of the nation , the labor agency said , and by 11,000 in the nation 's former communist east .
growth could exceed 2.8 percent amid signs that the german economy has rebounded unexpectedly strongly from the hefty and unpopular hike in the nation 's value-added tax in january and this year 's us economic slowdown , economists have been revising upwards their 2007 growth forecasts for germany .
many economists now project german economic growth to match or possibly surpass last year 's perky 2.8 percent expansion rate .
but with two major economic sentiment surveys - the zew investor confidence report and the ifo business confidence index - recently pointing down , analysts also say that the nation 's economic expansion could be starting to plateau out .
indeed , germany 's retail traders ' association -lrb- hde -rrb- said on thursday it expected 2007 retail sales to fall in real terms after a difficult start to the year .
pollitically sensitive data in the meantime , thursday 's jobless figures showed the politically-sensitive unadjusted labor market data also fell in june , dropping by 25,000 from may to 3.687 million in june with the unemployment rate edging down 0.3 percentage points to 8.8 percent .
" the demand for workers has increased again , " said federal labor agency chief frank jürgen weise .
the june unadjusted unemployment figures represented a 712,000 decline compared to june 2006 , when the jobless rate stood at 10.5 percent .
this represents an average monthly fall of 60,000 over the last 12 months .
the fall in seasonally unadjusted or headline unemployment was also more than expected by analysts , who had forecast a month-on-month fall in june of about 75,000 .
while the economists see the seasonally adjusted data as pointing to trends in the labor market , the headline data has become more politically significant in germany . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that would be a spontaneous reaction to blair 's appointment as middle east envoy .
actually , just about anyone who did n't have the colonial past of a briton in the middle east , had not driven the iraq war as a " lap dog " of the american president and not delayed a truce during the lebanon war last year as blair did would have been a better person for the job .
despite these facts , the mideast quartet - which comprises the us , the eu , the un and russia - chose the former british prime minister as the new mideast envoy .
the quartet did n't seem to have any serious reservations about the appointment .
even the russians did n't seem to have any doubts about blair 's skills as a trouble shooter despite being at loggerheads with him in the scandal involving the murder of a former russian agent .
but can the former british premier position himself as a neutral representative and mediator ?
you have to doubt it in light of his close alliance with the us and israel .
the question is whether blair will really mediate in the ongoing trouble in the middle east .
his responsibility largely lies in helping the palestinian parties lift themselves out of the crisis .
he is meant to help the palestinians build democratic institutions and in the course of that job he will naturally have to often report to washington to request specific american help .
given his excellent ties with the white house , that should be easy for blair as compared with honorable representatives from second-tier friendly nations .
there 's no disputing that less mistrust of the mideast envoy would make his job easier .
but in the past even american jews such as henry kissinger or dennis ross have successfully mediated in the middle east on behalf of the white house .
why should blair not have the same success on behalf of the mideast quartet ?
especially considering that it will be the quartet and not blair who will decide which direction to take .
that decision too will be limited since the direction is long well known ; it 's that path that negotiators ca n't agree on .
during his farewell speech to the house of commons , blair declared that the middle east must have place for two states - israel and palestine .
by now all sensible and right-minded individuals accept that formula and it also forms the core of the " roadmap " of the middle east aimed to resolve the conflict .
the arab league too is committed to the " two state " solution .
only radical groups continue to reject it .
but then again nobody would try to talk peace with them .
that 's why blair might succeed in moving things along .
and if he does n't then he would n't be the first to fail at the task .

the us says they are key in its war against terrorism but europeans worry the measures erode civil liberties . eu officials said wednesday that the eu and the us had reached a deal following a meeting between franco frattini , the eu justice and home affairs commissioner , michael chertoff , the us secretary for homeland security and wolfgang schäuble , the interior minister of germany which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
" a political agreement in principle was reached , " said roscam abbing , a spokesman for frattini .
data privacy a thorny issue data privacy has been a sticking point between the eu and the us ever since washington intensified anti-terrorism efforts after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks .
following the attacks on new york and washington , the eu and the us signed an agreement under which the eu agreed to grant us authorities access to up to 34 categories of information on passengers on all flights to the us taking off from eu member states .
these included names , addresses , phone numbers and credit card numbers of travelers .
that agreement , which is set to expire on july 31 , had stirred unease among eu lawmakers amid mounting concerns that civil liberties were being eroded in the fight against global terrorism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flying to the us is usually a security hassle for passengers in a letter this month to interior and justice ministers of portugal , which takes over the eu presidency from germany next month , the european data protection supervisor , peter hustinx said eu governments were sacrificing too much of their citizens ' privacy in the fight against terrorism . " i fear that messages such as ' no right to privacy until life and security are guaranteed ' are developing into a mantra suggesting that fundamental rights and freedoms are a luxury that security can not afford , " hustinx wrote . last may , the air travel data deal was annulled by the european court of justice in luxembourg and the two sides reached an interim agreement .
the eu had warned that airlines would be vulnerable to privacy complaints if no replacement deal had been reached before the interim one expired .
though details of the accord reached this week have not been released , german interior minister schäuble told an eu parliamentary briefing in strasbourg that the aim was to reduce the number of stored data on passengers that the us currently receives from 34 to 20 .
it remains unclear what pieces of personal data will be left out from the new us list .
an eu diplomat said under the new arrangement the data would now be kept by the us for 15 years , up from 3 1/2 years in the interim agreement .
the european side also sought to end the us ability to directly access flight booking computers , arguing instead that airlines should send the data .
europeans are the biggest group of travelers to the us .

european civil liberties group watchdogs had complained that swift , which handles global financial transfers and is based in brussels , violated european privacy laws by allowing the us to secretly consult its records .
washington has argued that the access is essential for its drive to end funding to terror networks .

the us says they are key in its war against terrorism but europeans worry the measures erode civil liberties . eu officials said wednesday that the eu and the us had reached a deal following a meeting between franco frattini , the eu justice and home affairs commissioner , michael chertoff , the us secretary for homeland security and wolfgang schäuble , the interior minister of germany which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
" a political agreement in principle was reached , " said roscam abbing , a spokesman for frattini .
data privacy a thorny issue data privacy has been a sticking point between the eu and the us ever since washington intensified anti-terrorism efforts after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks .
following the attacks on new york and washington , the eu and the us signed an agreement under which the eu agreed to grant us authorities access to up to 34 categories of information on passengers on all flights to the us taking off from eu member states .
these included names , addresses , phone numbers and credit card numbers of travelers .
that agreement , which is set to expire on july 31 , had stirred unease among eu lawmakers amid mounting concerns that civil liberties were being eroded in the fight against global terrorism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flying to the us is usually a security hassle for passengers in a letter this month to interior and justice ministers of portugal , which takes over the eu presidency from germany next month , the european data protection supervisor , peter hustinx said eu governments were sacrificing too much of their citizens ' privacy in the fight against terrorism . " i fear that messages such as ' no right to privacy until life and security are guaranteed ' are developing into a mantra suggesting that fundamental rights and freedoms are a luxury that security can not afford , " hustinx wrote . last may , the air travel data deal was annulled by the european court of justice in luxembourg and the two sides reached an interim agreement .
the eu had warned that airlines would be vulnerable to privacy complaints if no replacement deal had been reached before the interim one expired .
though details of the accord reached this week have not been released , german interior minister schäuble told an eu parliamentary briefing in strasbourg that the aim was to reduce the number of stored data on passengers that the us currently receives from 34 to 20 .
it remains unclear what pieces of personal data will be left out from the new us list .
an eu diplomat said under the new arrangement the data would now be kept by the us for 15 years , up from 3 1/2 years in the interim agreement .
the european side also sought to end the us ability to directly access flight booking computers , arguing instead that airlines should send the data .
europeans are the biggest group of travelers to the us .
deal on access to bank data separately , the us and the eu also struck a deal setting conditions for the us treasury department to view records of the international banking network swift in anti-terrorism probes .
european civil liberties group watchdogs had complained that swift , which handles global financial transfers and is based in brussels , violated european privacy laws by allowing the us to secretly consult its records .
washington has argued that the access is essential for its drive to end funding to terror networks .
the us will now only use swift data for counter-terrorism purposes and store it for a maximum of five years , according to the terms of the new deal . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the political responsibility will remain as before on the shoulders of the quartet , " she added . on wednesday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier complained of a lack of consultation with members of the quartet before the appointment was made .
germany is the eu 's representative on the panel . washington got its choice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel , right , and french prime minister francois fillon , left , deliver press satatements supporting blair . blair held confidential discussions on the post with washington , which formally recommended him without prior consultation with the other quartet members , press reports said . the united nations announced blair 's appointment just hours after he stepped down as prime minister on wednesday .
the united states had pushed hard for blair - a close friend and ally of president george w. bush - to get the post .
reports said the announcement was apparently delayed because of russian reservations . merkel described blair as a man of great political experience , who could provide an important contribution to finding a solution to the mideast conflict . european media reports said the decision had been made solely between the us and blair behind closed doors .

his work would focus on " institution building in , and political strengthening of , the palestinian authority , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the quartet will keep control of the middle east peace process this limitation was due to the fact " that the quartet itself wants to keep the political task of shaping the middle east peace process in its own hands , " steinmeier said .
the minister did n't express any doubts about blair 's qualification for the post .
but at the same time , he did n't explicitly praise blair either . according to media reports , there are concerns in berlin that blair could seize the diplomatic process in the middle east and therefore harm the quartet 's work .
other eu member states fear that blair could weaken the position of eu foreign policy chief javier solana , who has been working on solutions to the arab-israeli conflict for years . " solana is a member of the quartet while blair will be working for the quartet , " steinmeier said .
" the difference is clear . " russia held back un spokeswoman michele montas said on wednesday that blair would " mobilize international assistance to the palestinians , working closely with donors and existing coordination bodies . "
his tasks included helping to identify and secure " appropriate international support in addressing the institutional governance needs of the palestinian state , " she said . blair 's work would be " in support of the agreed quartet objectives , " montas said . a small team of experts based in jerusalem will support blair , who will spend significant time in the region , montas added . russia had previously stalled blair 's appointment .
according to german officials , russia had held back its support because of the lack of consultation on the move .
only on tuesday did moscow give its assent . allies support blair 's appointment although he is well respected in israel , the arab world has sharply criticized blair for britain 's role in the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq , as well as his support of israel 's war in lebanon last summer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana is a key architect of the roadmap for peace in the middle east but blair won backing from his allies for his new role . " tony will help palestinians develop the political and economic institutions they will need for a democratic , sovereign state able to provide for its people and live in peace and security with israel , " bush said . palestinian president mahmud abbas and israel also expressed their approval .

" anybody who tries to weigh up the dead of the second world war against votes in the -lrb- eu -rrb- council has to be rejected out of hand , " martin schulz , leader of the socialist group in the european parliament , told fellow lawmakers in brussels on wednesday to loud applause .
" the eu is an idea aimed at eliminating the specters of the past ...
we will not permit the few to bring up those specters , " he added .
schulz was referring to kacyznski 's remarks that poland deserved more voting power in the eu because its population would have been far larger if it had not been decimated during the nazi era .
the prime minister compounded matters on tuesday when he compared modern-day germany to the era that brought adolf hitler to power .
" not representative " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bilateral relations have been strained since the kaczynski twins came to power marek siwiec , a polish member of the european parliament said that kaczynski 's comments and the polish blocking tactics at the eu summit did not represent the views of the polish people .
he praised germany for avoiding any kind of " demonstration of power " in its role as holder of the eu presidency vis-a-vis poland and other eu states and praised german chancellor angela merkel 's pleasant " new leadership style . "
poland eventually won concessions at the summit , notably a delay to the introduction of the new voting system which it opposed , but faced criticism for its negotiating manner .
the german chancellor continues to seek to play down the dispute with poland .
" for us our polish neighbor has the same importance as our french neighbor , " she said in a speech on wednesday in brussels .
she has not commented on a controversial caricature of her that appeared on the front cover of the conservative polish magazine wprost on monday .
entitled the " stepmother of europe , " the photomontage depicted the german chancellor breast-feeding the kaczynski twins .
outrage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this controversial caricature has also provoked a storm of outrage a number of german politicians expressed outrage on tuesday about the caricature that accompanied an article written by mariusz muszynski , the polish foreign minister 's commissioner for german-polish relations .
but eckart von klaeden , the foreign policy spokesman for the conservative cdu / csu bloc , has also called for the matter to be approached in a more relaxed manner .
he told the hannoversche allgemeine zeitung that press freedom also protected things that people might regard as stupid or tasteless .
von klaeden also referred to a caricature that appeared in germany 's taz newspaper a year ago that compared the polish president as " poland 's new potato . "
at that time berlin responded to protests from warsaw by referring to the freedom of the press .
" exactly the same standards should apply with regards to the cover of a polish magazine , " he said .
von klaeden also expressed optimism that the tensions between germany and poland would soon settle .
" once all the momentary fuss has subsided , it will be possible to clearly see the success of the summit in brussels , " he said . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" anybody who tries to weigh up the dead of the second world war against votes in the -lrb- eu -rrb- council has to be rejected out of hand , " martin schulz , leader of the socialist group in the european parliament , told fellow lawmakers in brussels on wednesday to loud applause .
" the eu is an idea aimed at eliminating the specters of the past ...
we will not permit the few to bring up those specters , " he added .
schulz was referring to kacyznski 's remarks that poland deserved more voting power in the eu because its population would have been far larger if it had not been decimated during the nazi era .
the prime minister compounded matters on tuesday when he compared modern-day germany to the era that brought adolf hitler to power .
" not representative " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bilateral relations have been strained since the kaczynski twins came to power marek siwiec , a polish member of the european parliament said that kaczynski 's comments and the polish blocking tactics at the eu summit did not represent the views of the polish people .
he praised germany for avoiding any kind of " demonstration of power " in its role as holder of the eu presidency vis-a-vis poland and other eu states and praised german chancellor angela merkel 's pleasant " new leadership style . "

the german chancellor continues to seek to play down the dispute with poland .
" for us our polish neighbor has the same importance as our french neighbor , " she said in a speech on wednesday in brussels .
she has not commented on a controversial caricature of her that appeared on the front cover of the conservative polish magazine wprost on monday .

but eckart von klaeden , the foreign policy spokesman for the conservative cdu / csu bloc , has also called for the matter to be approached in a more relaxed manner .
he told the hannoversche allgemeine zeitung that press freedom also protected things that people might regard as stupid or tasteless .
von klaeden also referred to a caricature that appeared in germany 's taz newspaper a year ago that compared the polish president as " poland 's new potato . "
at that time berlin responded to protests from warsaw by referring to the freedom of the press .
" exactly the same standards should apply with regards to the cover of a polish magazine , " he said .

that would be a spontaneous reaction to blair 's appointment as middle east envoy .
actually , just about anyone who did n't have the colonial past of a briton in the middle east , had not driven the iraq war as a " lap dog " of the american president and not delayed a truce during the lebanon war last year as blair did would have been a better person for the job .
despite these facts , the mideast quartet - which comprises the us , the eu , the un and russia - chose the former british prime minister as the new mideast envoy .
the quartet did n't seem to have any serious reservations about the appointment .
even the russians did n't seem to have any doubts about blair 's skills as a trouble shooter despite being at loggerheads with him in the scandal involving the murder of a former russian agent .
but can the former british premier position himself as a neutral representative and mediator ?
you have to doubt it in light of his close alliance with the us and israel .
the question is whether blair will really mediate in the ongoing trouble in the middle east .
his responsibility largely lies in helping the palestinian parties lift themselves out of the crisis .
he is meant to help the palestinians build democratic institutions and in the course of that job he will naturally have to often report to washington to request specific american help .
given his excellent ties with the white house , that should be easy for blair as compared with honorable representatives from second-tier friendly nations .
there 's no disputing that less mistrust of the mideast envoy would make his job easier .
but in the past even american jews such as henry kissinger or dennis ross have successfully mediated in the middle east on behalf of the white house .
why should blair not have the same success on behalf of the mideast quartet ?
especially considering that it will be the quartet and not blair who will decide which direction to take .
that decision too will be limited since the direction is long well known ; it 's that path that negotiators ca n't agree on .
during his farewell speech to the house of commons , blair declared that the middle east must have place for two states - israel and palestine .
by now all sensible and right-minded individuals accept that formula and it also forms the core of the " roadmap " of the middle east aimed to resolve the conflict .
the arab league too is committed to the " two state " solution .
only radical groups continue to reject it .
but then again nobody would try to talk peace with them .
that 's why blair might succeed in moving things along .
and if he does n't then he would n't be the first to fail at the task .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 28.06.2007 britain 's brown names new cabinet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gordon brown vowed change on taking over as prime minister on wednesday gordon brown has appointed britain 's first ever female home secretary in a wide-ranging cabinet shakeup a day after he took over as prime minister from tony blair . brown 's naming of jacqui smith to the top job at the home office , or interior ministry , was probably among his most unexpected moves .
brown also appointed the youngest foreign secretary in 30 years - rising star david miliband .
analysts regard the move to put 41-year-old miliband , a reported critic of the iraq war , in charge of external affairs as an attempt to signal a shift of tone in foreign policy .
" the opportunities and challenges of the modern world require , in my view , a diplomacy that is patient as well as purposeful , which listens as well as leads , " miliband said .
change on iraq bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's new foreign secretary is dubbed the boy wonder because of his youthful looks and his brains blair 's approach to the iraq war has proved extremely unpopular amongst british voters and brown clearly recognizes the need for a change .
miliband 's predecessor margaret beckett was dropped from the cabinet in the reshuffle .
britain has been reducing troop numbers in iraq and now has about 5,500 in the south of the country .
while brown has pledged to stick to britain 's commitments in iraq , there is speculation the withdrawal may speed up .
miliband , whose brother ed is also a member of the new brown government as cabinet office minister , was elected to parliament for the first time in 2001 and has held two cabinet posts since 2005 .
douglas alexander , a loyal brown supporter , was promoted to the department of international development , a key plank of brown 's foreign agenda .
economic continuity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deputy prime minister john prescott also handed in his resignation on tony blair 's departure meanwhile , brown has appointed another trusted ally alastair darling as his replacement at the treasury - a sign of continuity in economic policy .
darling has a reputation as a fixer and his analytical skills are highly valued by the new prime minister .
brown 's campaign manager jack straw becomes justice minister .
ed balls , brown 's right-hand man at the treasury , was named as children , schools and families minister .
hilary benn , formerly at international development , becomes environment secretary .
james purnell , a work and pensions minister , was promoted to secretary of state for culture , media and sport .
des browne remains in his post at defense .
brown 's reshuffle saw seven members of the blair cabinet leave altogether .
the new prime minister , who vowed to herald decisive change as he took over the helm on wednesday , is expected to make a number of key policy statements in the weeks to come . dw staff with wire reports send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the future of the internet is now germans hesitant to look for love online " the synapses of a collective brain are growing " the internet and everyday life : the constant revolution the future is now internet -pipe- 28.06.2007 wikipedia founder : " great ideas come from different places " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikipedia founder jimmi wales its critics said it would n't last but the online encyclopaedia wikipedia has gone on to become one of the world 's most popular websites .
founder jimmy wales spoke to dw-world about the secret of its success . jimmy wales was born in alabama , usa , in 1966 .
he studied finance and worked as a research director at the chicago stock exchange .
in 2001 he founded wikipedia which is a multilingual , web-based , free content encyclopedia project .
it is written collaboratively by volunteers .
the vast majority of its articles can be edited by anyone with access to the internet .
from 2003 to 2006 , jimmy wales was headed the wikimedia foundation , wikipedia 's non-profit parent organization .
in 2004 , he founded the for-profit internet portal wikia , which is now supposed to carry on his newest project , the search engine wikia search .
jimmy wales lives in florida with his wife and his daughter . dw-world : a famous american magazine has chosen you as one of the 100 people who shape our world .
how does it feel to be a world shaper ?
jimmy wales : i thought that was sort of funny .
i enjoyed it of course , but tyra banks - the supermodel - was also on the list .
so i don ’ t know how meaningful it really is .
but i feel a real sense of responsibility that i am in a position where i can have some influence and i can say something people listen to .
i try not to say very much because of that .
because i want to make sure that what i do say is something that i can really believe in .
equality , unlimited faculty , no hierarchy : is that just the philosophy of wikipedia or is it your philosophy of life in general ?
that is pretty much my philosophy .
a lot of wikipedia reflects things that i believe in very strongly .
sometimes people think if you believe that everyone should participate then you think right and wrong don ‘ t matter and everybody ’ s opinion is as good as everyone else ’ s .
it may seem paradoxical to them , but , no , i think that some people are really not that smart and that they are not that useful .
but leaving open the possibility for participation means that we are able to get a lot of great ideas from lots of different places .
wikipedia owes its success to the community , to all the people who write articles every day without getting paid .
why do they do that for wikipedia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikipedia has 75,000 contributors in over 100 languages .
i think there are two reasons .
one reason is that the charity of our mission is inspiring a lot of people .
but i think that ’ s a fairly limited reason .
the main reason is that it ’ s fun .
the people just enjoy the process , they enjoy meeting other intellectual people , it ’ s a great hobby .
we know that intuitively if we think about people plying football on the weekends .
we don ’ t say : " gee , gosh , you 're going to play football and you don ’ t get paid for that ? ”
that ’ s silly , right ?
obviously people are doing it because they enjoy it and they have fun .
it is a similar thing with wikipedia .
some people earn a lot of money writing but others can do it just for fun .
you seem to do it just for fun too .
because although wikipedia is very successful you are not earning any money because it is a charitable project .
do you sometimes think that you did something wrong ?
i always joke that when i registered wikipedia as a non-profit organization , it was either the dumbest thing or the smartest thing i ever did .
the dumbest for the obvious reason that i get to hang out with billionaires but i don ’ t have any money .
the smartest , though , because i don ‘ t think it could have been nearly as successful as it is and also because i think it will be remembered in the future .
100 or 200 years from now people will point to wikipedia and say : that was a really good thing that did something beneficial for the world .
so that is something i am very proud of .
why wouldn ’ t it have worked out as a commercial organization ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new era of user generated content and social networking is often referred to as web 2.0 i think that for an encyclopedia that is really attempting this very grand ethical mission of sharing knowledge with everyone , being a non-profit organization is really the right approach .
it means that , as a community , we have the luxury of doing things the right way rather than doing things in a way that is dictated by current economic circumstances .
the internet video platform you tube was sold for $ 1.65 billion -lrb- 1.23 billion euros -rrb- .
how much would sell wikipedia for ?
i don ’ t know what it ’ s worth , it ’ s really interesting .
it has very low revenue .
but i guess you could slap ads all over it and make some money .
i think the wikimedia foundation - the owner of wikipedia - could in fact sell it .
nobody ’ s interested in doing that , but certainly if there was an offer of $ 3 billion , i think the foundation would have to seriously think about what could be done for the charitable purposes of the foundation in distributing free knowledge if we outsourced the community or something .
your new project , the search engine wikia search , which will launch at the end of this year , will be commercial .
why did you change your mind ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wales aims to challenge google 's dominance in the search engine market .
for some types of projects - if you think about running hospitals or the red cross - the charitable model works well .
people are willing to donate money , enough to make it last .
but for other things like running a chain of grocery stores , there have never been very successful charities that have done such things .
i think different kinds of work demands different kinds of organization .
there are so many search engines on the internet already .
why does the world actually need another one ?
the search engines we have right now are black boxes and not transparent .
they are not community controlled and the quality is ... well , it 's pretty good but it stagnated the last two or three years .
there are lots of ways in which searches have not improved as much as a lot of us would have liked .
i don ’ t know how to improve search beyond what already exists .
but i do think that a broad community of people and an open scientific dialogue about how to do that can probably make some progress .
anyway it ’ s fun .
i always do the most fun thing .
and what will be the next big thing coming up on the internet ?
i don ’ t know .
i always remind people that five years ago , i was just this guy sitting at home in my pajamas typing on the internet .
and now i get asked deep questions about the future .
the trend i see right now is that we are very much at the beginning of free licensing of culture .
and we are still very much at the beginning of the design of communities for producing good quality work .
so i think that there is still a lot of room in those areas . christine elsaesser interviewed jimmy wales send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

these plans , which won the second competition staged to find a design for the building , were attacked for being insensitive and even dubbed a " toilet block " by one critic .

the scientists said it recognized a characteristic hiv sequence that scarcely ever mutated . tre was adapted from an existing natural enzyme , cre , which recognized similar genetic sequences . stem cells necessary for therapy the laboratories artificially evolved cre into tre through more than 120 recombinase generations .
hauber said the cell then flushed out the snipped-away dna as waste . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists have been analyzing the hiv virus for years " after that , it is healthy , " hauber said . any therapy , though , would require stem cells to be obtained from a patient 's blood .

lisbon intends to place the former portuguese colony and latin american giant on an equal footing with the eu 's privileged partners such as the united states , russia , china or india .
" we will do all we can to place relations with the south higher up on the european list of priorities , " prime minister jose socrates said .
lisbon will also try to revitalize relations with africa , boost mediterranean dialog and contribute to middle east peace efforts .
lisbon must take on the treaty starting on july 1 , when it officially takes over the presidency from germany , portugal will also take on considerable baggage , in particular the challenge of getting a revamped eu reform treaty approved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's federal chancellor angela merkel during treaty negotiations the recent eu summit in brussels forged a compromise on a reform treaty to overhaul decision-making processes in the 27-nation bloc , replacing a more ambitious plan for a common constitution .
the new document is shorter , but could be fraught with more legal problems , partly because of special arrangements granted to britain and poland .
" our goal is ... not to lose the dynamics of the agreement reached in brussels and to approve a new treaty as soon as possible , " socrates said on wednesday .
lisbon wants a conference to begin drawing up the treaty on july 23 so that it can be approved in october .
africa will be a priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigrants from africa are a cause of concern in the eu lisbon has also declared africa an urgent concern , as china and the united states are extending their influence there at europe 's expense .

the foreign policy changes sought by portugal include attempts to seek peace in the middle east .
lisbon also wants to send a " signal of good will " to turkey , a muslim country aspiring to join the eu .
prime minister socrates , however , has promised that the southern emphasis will not lead portugal to neglect other crucial concerns such as the stabilization of the balkans or relations with russia , the portuguese presidency faces a complex agenda .
its task could be made a little easier by smooth communication with european commission president jose manuel barroso , a former portuguese prime minister , observers said . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

these plans , which won the second competition staged to find a design for the building , were attacked for being insensitive and even dubbed a " toilet block " by one critic .
the winner of the first competition giorgio grassi had also seen his design blocked - an occurrence not unusual in a country where passions about architecture run high .
" half-hearted " bildunterschrift : only time will tell if chipperfield 's new plans get implemented the new blueprint echoes elements of the existing ensemble with an open staircase and colonnades .
but a number of german newspapers have criticized the revamped architecture .
the süddeutsche zeitung praised some aspects of the design , but described it essentially as being " half-hearted " and " undecided , " while the berliner morgenpost also said it did not form a " convincing whole . "
chipperfield 's building will complete the renovation of the museum island in the spree river , a large museum complex which was damaged in world war ii and and fell into neglect during the communist era .
final touch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bust of the egyptian queen nefertiti is the most famous exhibit in the complex the new building will be called the james simon gallery after a jewish patron of the arts , and will be attached to the pergamon museum , one of berlin 's biggest tourist attractions .
the architect said it would cost about 73 million euros -lrb- $ 98 million -rrb- and be completed in 2012 .
he said the gallery would blend in with the architectural design of the museums and house a conference center and shops .
the architect is also overseeing renovations at the pergamon to restore the facade to its pre-war glory and modernize the museum 's interior .
the pergamon includes a reconstruction of the ishtar gate from babylon with stones from the original structure .
unesco site bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bode museum is the latest museum on the island to be renovated the museum island , which was declared a unesco world heritage site in 1999 , also houses the bode museum , die alte nationalgalerie , the neues museum and the altes museum - best known for its world-famous 3,400-year-old egyptian bust of nefertiti .
the government has spent hundreds of billions of euros restoring the 19th-century complex and the scheme is due to be finished in 2015 .

we are unusual , as british people go , but for my husband and me , germany is probably our favorite holiday destination and one reason for that is the stunning variety on offer .
each state has its own culture , architecture and natural scenery .
looking for new places to explore and discover , we started going east a couple of years ago and we were not disappointed - far from it .
from large , culture-rich cities like dresden and weimar to small , historic towns like meissen and quedlinburg , we 've found much to recommend .
there is so much history to explore and we have found the local people extremely welcoming , very helpful and eager to provide an excellent service to visitors .
our only surprise has been the low numbers of other visitors -lrb- especially other western europeans -rrb- .
if you do n't go soon , then you 'll be missing something extraordinary precisely because it is a place in transition , yet still , in parts , clinging to its unique identity and culture .
this will go in time , as is the way in a globalized society , so make the most of it while you can ! - liz , great britain eurail is a great bargain !
if you can , buy a pass .
trains in germany make our amtrak look like the trash it is .
i also recommend public transport in german cities .
germany was smart when they kept trams in their cities .
dresden is a great art treasure and we plan to return soon .
i also recommend leipzig , especially if you enjoy baroque and classical music . - samuel r. ganczaruk , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : take a christmas cruise , recommended a reader we are a group of spaniards visiting frankfurt .
at the suggestion of one local we went yesterday to a typical frankfurt cider tavern called zur sonne .
people here told us not to go to sachsenhausen -lrb- trashy and touristy , full of irish pubs and caipirinha bars these days -rrb- but rather to the north end and bornheim district , which are very young and picturesque .
apple wine , as everyone warned us , takes some " getting used to " but after a few glasses it tastes almost like a good penedes !
-lrb- only a joke ! -rrb-
the atmosphere in these taverns - which during warm months have large gardens - is very friendly and convivial .
the food is wonderful -lrb- try the local specialty , green sauce -rrb- and prices are very fair . - ramiro ruiz , spain i 've visited germany twice .
it is really a very nice country to visit .
everything is well prepared .
i really enjoyed my vacation and hope to visit another time . - sawsan , sudan germany has restored my happy feelings for christmas and i send my sincere congratulations to the german people for their celebration of christmas .
the christmas markets are wonderful and the people are very friendly and a joy to be with .
we were on a river cruise in december 2006 , starting in cologne and ending in nuremberg .
my wife is an organist and loved every opportunity to hear another organ .
we were so impressed with the entire trip that we are planning for another christmas cruise in december 2008 and are inviting family and friends to share the experience . - joseph , us compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de readers recommend visiting dresden , bamberg , lübeck readers wrote in with tips on train travel in germany and recommendations on where to go .

these plans , which won the second competition staged to find a design for the building , were attacked for being insensitive and even dubbed a " toilet block " by one critic .
the winner of the first competition giorgio grassi had also seen his design blocked - an occurrence not unusual in a country where passions about architecture run high .
" half-hearted " bildunterschrift : only time will tell if chipperfield 's new plans get implemented the new blueprint echoes elements of the existing ensemble with an open staircase and colonnades .
but a number of german newspapers have criticized the revamped architecture .
the süddeutsche zeitung praised some aspects of the design , but described it essentially as being " half-hearted " and " undecided , " while the berliner morgenpost also said it did not form a " convincing whole . "
chipperfield 's building will complete the renovation of the museum island in the spree river , a large museum complex which was damaged in world war ii and and fell into neglect during the communist era .
final touch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bust of the egyptian queen nefertiti is the most famous exhibit in the complex the new building will be called the james simon gallery after a jewish patron of the arts , and will be attached to the pergamon museum , one of berlin 's biggest tourist attractions .
the architect said it would cost about 73 million euros -lrb- $ 98 million -rrb- and be completed in 2012 .
he said the gallery would blend in with the architectural design of the museums and house a conference center and shops .
the architect is also overseeing renovations at the pergamon to restore the facade to its pre-war glory and modernize the museum 's interior .
the pergamon includes a reconstruction of the ishtar gate from babylon with stones from the original structure .
unesco site bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bode museum is the latest museum on the island to be renovated the museum island , which was declared a unesco world heritage site in 1999 , also houses the bode museum , die alte nationalgalerie , the neues museum and the altes museum - best known for its world-famous 3,400-year-old egyptian bust of nefertiti .
the government has spent hundreds of billions of euros restoring the 19th-century complex and the scheme is due to be finished in 2015 .
berlin city authorities expect to attract four million visitors a year once the project is completed . dw-staff with wire reports -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we will do all we can to place relations with the south higher up on the european list of priorities , " prime minister jose socrates said .
lisbon will also try to revitalize relations with africa , boost mediterranean dialog and contribute to middle east peace efforts .
lisbon must take on the treaty starting on july 1 , when it officially takes over the presidency from germany , portugal will also take on considerable baggage , in particular the challenge of getting a revamped eu reform treaty approved .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's federal chancellor angela merkel during treaty negotiations the recent eu summit in brussels forged a compromise on a reform treaty to overhaul decision-making processes in the 27-nation bloc , replacing a more ambitious plan for a common constitution .
the new document is shorter , but could be fraught with more legal problems , partly because of special arrangements granted to britain and poland .
" our goal is ... not to lose the dynamics of the agreement reached in brussels and to approve a new treaty as soon as possible , " socrates said on wednesday .

the foreign policy changes sought by portugal include attempts to seek peace in the middle east .
lisbon also wants to send a " signal of good will " to turkey , a muslim country aspiring to join the eu .
prime minister socrates , however , has promised that the southern emphasis will not lead portugal to neglect other crucial concerns such as the stabilization of the balkans or relations with russia , the portuguese presidency faces a complex agenda .
its task could be made a little easier by smooth communication with european commission president jose manuel barroso , a former portuguese prime minister , observers said . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

analysts had forecast that seasonally adjusted unemployment would drop by 20,000 from may , when the jobless rate stood at 9.2 per cent .
" the driver is the good economic performance , " said alexander koch , an economist at the hypovereinsbank .
he added that employers were now complaining of growing labor shortages in key sectors of the economy .
consumer confidence gaining in strength job vacancies rose by 11.6 percent to 648,096 , thursday 's data showed as chancellor angela merkel 's government considers possible measures which could ease the way for skilled foreign workers to enter the german labor market to fill gaps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers are n't holding back falling unemployment has also helped to shore up consumer confidence in germany where stagnating household spending has been a drag on economic growth in recent years .
german consumer confidence is at a six-month high , a survey released this week showed .
predictions of higher wages in the nation are helping to fuel optimism among the nation 's consumers , the survey said .
the number of unemployed fell by 26,000 in the economically more important western part of the nation , the labor agency said , and by 11,000 in the nation 's former communist east .
growth could exceed 2.8 percent amid signs that the german economy has rebounded unexpectedly strongly from the hefty and unpopular hike in the nation 's value-added tax in january and this year 's us economic slowdown , economists have been revising upwards their 2007 growth forecasts for germany .
many economists now project german economic growth to match or possibly surpass last year 's perky 2.8 percent expansion rate .
but with two major economic sentiment surveys - the zew investor confidence report and the ifo business confidence index - recently pointing down , analysts also say that the nation 's economic expansion could be starting to plateau out .
indeed , germany 's retail traders ' association -lrb- hde -rrb- said on thursday it expected 2007 retail sales to fall in real terms after a difficult start to the year .

" the demand for workers has increased again , " said federal labor agency chief frank jürgen weise .
the june unadjusted unemployment figures represented a 712,000 decline compared to june 2006 , when the jobless rate stood at 10.5 percent .
this represents an average monthly fall of 60,000 over the last 12 months .
the fall in seasonally unadjusted or headline unemployment was also more than expected by analysts , who had forecast a month-on-month fall in june of about 75,000 .

founder jimmy wales spoke to dw-world about the secret of its success . jimmy wales was born in alabama , usa , in 1966 .
he studied finance and worked as a research director at the chicago stock exchange .
in 2001 he founded wikipedia which is a multilingual , web-based , free content encyclopedia project .
it is written collaboratively by volunteers .
the vast majority of its articles can be edited by anyone with access to the internet .
from 2003 to 2006 , jimmy wales was headed the wikimedia foundation , wikipedia 's non-profit parent organization .
in 2004 , he founded the for-profit internet portal wikia , which is now supposed to carry on his newest project , the search engine wikia search .
jimmy wales lives in florida with his wife and his daughter . dw-world : a famous american magazine has chosen you as one of the 100 people who shape our world .
how does it feel to be a world shaper ?
jimmy wales : i thought that was sort of funny .
i enjoyed it of course , but tyra banks - the supermodel - was also on the list .
so i don ’ t know how meaningful it really is .
but i feel a real sense of responsibility that i am in a position where i can have some influence and i can say something people listen to .
i try not to say very much because of that .
because i want to make sure that what i do say is something that i can really believe in .
equality , unlimited faculty , no hierarchy : is that just the philosophy of wikipedia or is it your philosophy of life in general ?
that is pretty much my philosophy .
a lot of wikipedia reflects things that i believe in very strongly .
sometimes people think if you believe that everyone should participate then you think right and wrong don ‘ t matter and everybody ’ s opinion is as good as everyone else ’ s .
it may seem paradoxical to them , but , no , i think that some people are really not that smart and that they are not that useful .
but leaving open the possibility for participation means that we are able to get a lot of great ideas from lots of different places .
wikipedia owes its success to the community , to all the people who write articles every day without getting paid .
why do they do that for wikipedia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikipedia has 75,000 contributors in over 100 languages .
i think there are two reasons .
one reason is that the charity of our mission is inspiring a lot of people .
but i think that ’ s a fairly limited reason .
the main reason is that it ’ s fun .
the people just enjoy the process , they enjoy meeting other intellectual people , it ’ s a great hobby .
we know that intuitively if we think about people plying football on the weekends .
we don ’ t say : " gee , gosh , you 're going to play football and you don ’ t get paid for that ? ”
that ’ s silly , right ?
obviously people are doing it because they enjoy it and they have fun .
it is a similar thing with wikipedia .
some people earn a lot of money writing but others can do it just for fun .
you seem to do it just for fun too .
because although wikipedia is very successful you are not earning any money because it is a charitable project .
do you sometimes think that you did something wrong ?
i always joke that when i registered wikipedia as a non-profit organization , it was either the dumbest thing or the smartest thing i ever did .
the dumbest for the obvious reason that i get to hang out with billionaires but i don ’ t have any money .
the smartest , though , because i don ‘ t think it could have been nearly as successful as it is and also because i think it will be remembered in the future .
100 or 200 years from now people will point to wikipedia and say : that was a really good thing that did something beneficial for the world .
so that is something i am very proud of .
why wouldn ’ t it have worked out as a commercial organization ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new era of user generated content and social networking is often referred to as web 2.0 i think that for an encyclopedia that is really attempting this very grand ethical mission of sharing knowledge with everyone , being a non-profit organization is really the right approach .
it means that , as a community , we have the luxury of doing things the right way rather than doing things in a way that is dictated by current economic circumstances .
the internet video platform you tube was sold for $ 1.65 billion -lrb- 1.23 billion euros -rrb- .
how much would sell wikipedia for ?
i don ’ t know what it ’ s worth , it ’ s really interesting .
it has very low revenue .
but i guess you could slap ads all over it and make some money .
i think the wikimedia foundation - the owner of wikipedia - could in fact sell it .
nobody ’ s interested in doing that , but certainly if there was an offer of $ 3 billion , i think the foundation would have to seriously think about what could be done for the charitable purposes of the foundation in distributing free knowledge if we outsourced the community or something .
your new project , the search engine wikia search , which will launch at the end of this year , will be commercial .
why did you change your mind ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wales aims to challenge google 's dominance in the search engine market .
for some types of projects - if you think about running hospitals or the red cross - the charitable model works well .
people are willing to donate money , enough to make it last .
but for other things like running a chain of grocery stores , there have never been very successful charities that have done such things .
i think different kinds of work demands different kinds of organization .
there are so many search engines on the internet already .
why does the world actually need another one ?
the search engines we have right now are black boxes and not transparent .
they are not community controlled and the quality is ... well , it 's pretty good but it stagnated the last two or three years .
there are lots of ways in which searches have not improved as much as a lot of us would have liked .
i don ’ t know how to improve search beyond what already exists .
but i do think that a broad community of people and an open scientific dialogue about how to do that can probably make some progress .
anyway it ’ s fun .
i always do the most fun thing .
and what will be the next big thing coming up on the internet ?
i don ’ t know .
i always remind people that five years ago , i was just this guy sitting at home in my pajamas typing on the internet .
and now i get asked deep questions about the future .
the trend i see right now is that we are very much at the beginning of free licensing of culture .
and we are still very much at the beginning of the design of communities for producing good quality work .
so i think that there is still a lot of room in those areas . christine elsaesser interviewed jimmy wales send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

we are unusual , as british people go , but for my husband and me , germany is probably our favorite holiday destination and one reason for that is the stunning variety on offer .
each state has its own culture , architecture and natural scenery .
looking for new places to explore and discover , we started going east a couple of years ago and we were not disappointed - far from it .
from large , culture-rich cities like dresden and weimar to small , historic towns like meissen and quedlinburg , we 've found much to recommend .
there is so much history to explore and we have found the local people extremely welcoming , very helpful and eager to provide an excellent service to visitors .
our only surprise has been the low numbers of other visitors -lrb- especially other western europeans -rrb- .
if you do n't go soon , then you 'll be missing something extraordinary precisely because it is a place in transition , yet still , in parts , clinging to its unique identity and culture .
this will go in time , as is the way in a globalized society , so make the most of it while you can ! - liz , great britain eurail is a great bargain !
if you can , buy a pass .
trains in germany make our amtrak look like the trash it is .
i also recommend public transport in german cities .
germany was smart when they kept trams in their cities .
dresden is a great art treasure and we plan to return soon .
i also recommend leipzig , especially if you enjoy baroque and classical music . - samuel r. ganczaruk , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : take a christmas cruise , recommended a reader we are a group of spaniards visiting frankfurt .
at the suggestion of one local we went yesterday to a typical frankfurt cider tavern called zur sonne .
people here told us not to go to sachsenhausen -lrb- trashy and touristy , full of irish pubs and caipirinha bars these days -rrb- but rather to the north end and bornheim district , which are very young and picturesque .
apple wine , as everyone warned us , takes some " getting used to " but after a few glasses it tastes almost like a good penedes !
-lrb- only a joke ! -rrb-
the atmosphere in these taverns - which during warm months have large gardens - is very friendly and convivial .
the food is wonderful -lrb- try the local specialty , green sauce -rrb- and prices are very fair . - ramiro ruiz , spain i 've visited germany twice .
it is really a very nice country to visit .
everything is well prepared .
i really enjoyed my vacation and hope to visit another time . - sawsan , sudan germany has restored my happy feelings for christmas and i send my sincere congratulations to the german people for their celebration of christmas .
the christmas markets are wonderful and the people are very friendly and a joy to be with .
we were on a river cruise in december 2006 , starting in cologne and ending in nuremberg .
my wife is an organist and loved every opportunity to hear another organ .
we were so impressed with the entire trip that we are planning for another christmas cruise in december 2008 and are inviting family and friends to share the experience . - joseph , us compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de readers recommend visiting dresden , bamberg , lübeck readers wrote in with tips on train travel in germany and recommendations on where to go .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 28.06.2007 opinion : a surprising choice , but not necessarily a bad one großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former british premier tony blair 's new appointment as mideast envoy is a strange choice but given his close ties with the us , he might just succeed , says dw 's peter philipp . a former scandinavian head of state or one from asia , africa or another small european country would have been better suited for the job than tony blair .
that would be a spontaneous reaction to blair 's appointment as middle east envoy .
actually , just about anyone who did n't have the colonial past of a briton in the middle east , had not driven the iraq war as a " lap dog " of the american president and not delayed a truce during the lebanon war last year as blair did would have been a better person for the job .
despite these facts , the mideast quartet - which comprises the us , the eu , the un and russia - chose the former british prime minister as the new mideast envoy .
the quartet did n't seem to have any serious reservations about the appointment .
even the russians did n't seem to have any doubts about blair 's skills as a trouble shooter despite being at loggerheads with him in the scandal involving the murder of a former russian agent .
but can the former british premier position himself as a neutral representative and mediator ?
you have to doubt it in light of his close alliance with the us and israel .
the question is whether blair will really mediate in the ongoing trouble in the middle east .
his responsibility largely lies in helping the palestinian parties lift themselves out of the crisis .
he is meant to help the palestinians build democratic institutions and in the course of that job he will naturally have to often report to washington to request specific american help .
given his excellent ties with the white house , that should be easy for blair as compared with honorable representatives from second-tier friendly nations .
there 's no disputing that less mistrust of the mideast envoy would make his job easier .
but in the past even american jews such as henry kissinger or dennis ross have successfully mediated in the middle east on behalf of the white house .
why should blair not have the same success on behalf of the mideast quartet ?
especially considering that it will be the quartet and not blair who will decide which direction to take .
that decision too will be limited since the direction is long well known ; it 's that path that negotiators ca n't agree on .
during his farewell speech to the house of commons , blair declared that the middle east must have place for two states - israel and palestine .
by now all sensible and right-minded individuals accept that formula and it also forms the core of the " roadmap " of the middle east aimed to resolve the conflict .
the arab league too is committed to the " two state " solution .
only radical groups continue to reject it .
but then again nobody would try to talk peace with them .
that 's why blair might succeed in moving things along .
and if he does n't then he would n't be the first to fail at the task .

brown also appointed the youngest foreign secretary in 30 years - rising star david miliband .
analysts regard the move to put 41-year-old miliband , a reported critic of the iraq war , in charge of external affairs as an attempt to signal a shift of tone in foreign policy .
" the opportunities and challenges of the modern world require , in my view , a diplomacy that is patient as well as purposeful , which listens as well as leads , " miliband said .
change on iraq bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's new foreign secretary is dubbed the boy wonder because of his youthful looks and his brains blair 's approach to the iraq war has proved extremely unpopular amongst british voters and brown clearly recognizes the need for a change .
miliband 's predecessor margaret beckett was dropped from the cabinet in the reshuffle .
britain has been reducing troop numbers in iraq and now has about 5,500 in the south of the country .
while brown has pledged to stick to britain 's commitments in iraq , there is speculation the withdrawal may speed up .
miliband , whose brother ed is also a member of the new brown government as cabinet office minister , was elected to parliament for the first time in 2001 and has held two cabinet posts since 2005 .
douglas alexander , a loyal brown supporter , was promoted to the department of international development , a key plank of brown 's foreign agenda .
economic continuity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deputy prime minister john prescott also handed in his resignation on tony blair 's departure meanwhile , brown has appointed another trusted ally alastair darling as his replacement at the treasury - a sign of continuity in economic policy .
darling has a reputation as a fixer and his analytical skills are highly valued by the new prime minister .
brown 's campaign manager jack straw becomes justice minister .
ed balls , brown 's right-hand man at the treasury , was named as children , schools and families minister .
hilary benn , formerly at international development , becomes environment secretary .
james purnell , a work and pensions minister , was promoted to secretary of state for culture , media and sport .
des browne remains in his post at defense .
brown 's reshuffle saw seven members of the blair cabinet leave altogether .
the new prime minister , who vowed to herald decisive change as he took over the helm on wednesday , is expected to make a number of key policy statements in the weeks to come . dw staff with wire reports send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

these plans , which won the second competition staged to find a design for the building , were attacked for being insensitive and even dubbed a " toilet block " by one critic .
the winner of the first competition giorgio grassi had also seen his design blocked - an occurrence not unusual in a country where passions about architecture run high .
" half-hearted " bildunterschrift : only time will tell if chipperfield 's new plans get implemented the new blueprint echoes elements of the existing ensemble with an open staircase and colonnades .
but a number of german newspapers have criticized the revamped architecture .
the süddeutsche zeitung praised some aspects of the design , but described it essentially as being " half-hearted " and " undecided , " while the berliner morgenpost also said it did not form a " convincing whole . "
chipperfield 's building will complete the renovation of the museum island in the spree river , a large museum complex which was damaged in world war ii and and fell into neglect during the communist era .
final touch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bust of the egyptian queen nefertiti is the most famous exhibit in the complex the new building will be called the james simon gallery after a jewish patron of the arts , and will be attached to the pergamon museum , one of berlin 's biggest tourist attractions .
the architect said it would cost about 73 million euros -lrb- $ 98 million -rrb- and be completed in 2012 .
he said the gallery would blend in with the architectural design of the museums and house a conference center and shops .
the architect is also overseeing renovations at the pergamon to restore the facade to its pre-war glory and modernize the museum 's interior .
the pergamon includes a reconstruction of the ishtar gate from babylon with stones from the original structure .
unesco site bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bode museum is the latest museum on the island to be renovated the museum island , which was declared a unesco world heritage site in 1999 , also houses the bode museum , die alte nationalgalerie , the neues museum and the altes museum - best known for its world-famous 3,400-year-old egyptian bust of nefertiti .
the government has spent hundreds of billions of euros restoring the 19th-century complex and the scheme is due to be finished in 2015 .

the procedure is a breakthrough in bio-technology and fuels hope of a cure for aids . the laboratory procedure removing the aids virus used an enzyme , said joachim hauber of the heinrich pette institute for experimental virology and immunology in hamburg . " we have rid the cells of the virus , " hauber said on thursday .

he called it " a breakthrough in bio-technology . " hauber said it was his " cautious " hope that a cure for aids could be found within 10 years . current therapies can only limit the spread of the human immunodeficiency virus -lrb- hiv -rrb- and not remove it from the body .
hiv is a retrovirus that nests in the dna or key genetic material of infected cells . the max planck institute for molecular cell biology and genetics in dresden was the partner in the research , which will be reported in friday 's issue of the scientific journal science . cutting dna and recombining it three years of experiments on mice were planned next , to be followed by tests on humans in hamburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the enzyme knows just where to cut the dna the scientists ' method used the ability of so-called recombinase enzymes to cut strands of dna at certain places like a pair of scissors and recombine the strands . the new enzyme , tre , always recognized the right spot to snip the dna where the hiv started .
the scientists said it recognized a characteristic hiv sequence that scarcely ever mutated . tre was adapted from an existing natural enzyme , cre , which recognized similar genetic sequences . stem cells necessary for therapy the laboratories artificially evolved cre into tre through more than 120 recombinase generations .
hauber said the cell then flushed out the snipped-away dna as waste . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists have been analyzing the hiv virus for years " after that , it is healthy , " hauber said . any therapy , though , would require stem cells to be obtained from a patient 's blood .

these plans , which won the second competition staged to find a design for the building , were attacked for being insensitive and even dubbed a " toilet block " by one critic .
the winner of the first competition giorgio grassi had also seen his design blocked - an occurrence not unusual in a country where passions about architecture run high .
" half-hearted " bildunterschrift : only time will tell if chipperfield 's new plans get implemented the new blueprint echoes elements of the existing ensemble with an open staircase and colonnades .
but a number of german newspapers have criticized the revamped architecture .
the süddeutsche zeitung praised some aspects of the design , but described it essentially as being " half-hearted " and " undecided , " while the berliner morgenpost also said it did not form a " convincing whole . "
chipperfield 's building will complete the renovation of the museum island in the spree river , a large museum complex which was damaged in world war ii and and fell into neglect during the communist era .

the architect said it would cost about 73 million euros -lrb- $ 98 million -rrb- and be completed in 2012 .
he said the gallery would blend in with the architectural design of the museums and house a conference center and shops .
the architect is also overseeing renovations at the pergamon to restore the facade to its pre-war glory and modernize the museum 's interior .
the pergamon includes a reconstruction of the ishtar gate from babylon with stones from the original structure .

founder jimmy wales spoke to dw-world about the secret of its success . jimmy wales was born in alabama , usa , in 1966 .
he studied finance and worked as a research director at the chicago stock exchange .
in 2001 he founded wikipedia which is a multilingual , web-based , free content encyclopedia project .
it is written collaboratively by volunteers .
the vast majority of its articles can be edited by anyone with access to the internet .
from 2003 to 2006 , jimmy wales was headed the wikimedia foundation , wikipedia 's non-profit parent organization .
in 2004 , he founded the for-profit internet portal wikia , which is now supposed to carry on his newest project , the search engine wikia search .
jimmy wales lives in florida with his wife and his daughter . dw-world : a famous american magazine has chosen you as one of the 100 people who shape our world .
how does it feel to be a world shaper ?
jimmy wales : i thought that was sort of funny .
i enjoyed it of course , but tyra banks - the supermodel - was also on the list .
so i don ’ t know how meaningful it really is .
but i feel a real sense of responsibility that i am in a position where i can have some influence and i can say something people listen to .
i try not to say very much because of that .
because i want to make sure that what i do say is something that i can really believe in .
equality , unlimited faculty , no hierarchy : is that just the philosophy of wikipedia or is it your philosophy of life in general ?
that is pretty much my philosophy .
a lot of wikipedia reflects things that i believe in very strongly .
sometimes people think if you believe that everyone should participate then you think right and wrong don ‘ t matter and everybody ’ s opinion is as good as everyone else ’ s .
it may seem paradoxical to them , but , no , i think that some people are really not that smart and that they are not that useful .
but leaving open the possibility for participation means that we are able to get a lot of great ideas from lots of different places .
wikipedia owes its success to the community , to all the people who write articles every day without getting paid .
why do they do that for wikipedia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikipedia has 75,000 contributors in over 100 languages .
i think there are two reasons .
one reason is that the charity of our mission is inspiring a lot of people .
but i think that ’ s a fairly limited reason .
the main reason is that it ’ s fun .
the people just enjoy the process , they enjoy meeting other intellectual people , it ’ s a great hobby .
we know that intuitively if we think about people plying football on the weekends .
we don ’ t say : " gee , gosh , you 're going to play football and you don ’ t get paid for that ? ”
that ’ s silly , right ?
obviously people are doing it because they enjoy it and they have fun .
it is a similar thing with wikipedia .
some people earn a lot of money writing but others can do it just for fun .
you seem to do it just for fun too .
because although wikipedia is very successful you are not earning any money because it is a charitable project .
do you sometimes think that you did something wrong ?
i always joke that when i registered wikipedia as a non-profit organization , it was either the dumbest thing or the smartest thing i ever did .
the dumbest for the obvious reason that i get to hang out with billionaires but i don ’ t have any money .
the smartest , though , because i don ‘ t think it could have been nearly as successful as it is and also because i think it will be remembered in the future .
100 or 200 years from now people will point to wikipedia and say : that was a really good thing that did something beneficial for the world .
so that is something i am very proud of .
why wouldn ’ t it have worked out as a commercial organization ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new era of user generated content and social networking is often referred to as web 2.0 i think that for an encyclopedia that is really attempting this very grand ethical mission of sharing knowledge with everyone , being a non-profit organization is really the right approach .
it means that , as a community , we have the luxury of doing things the right way rather than doing things in a way that is dictated by current economic circumstances .
the internet video platform you tube was sold for $ 1.65 billion -lrb- 1.23 billion euros -rrb- .
how much would sell wikipedia for ?
i don ’ t know what it ’ s worth , it ’ s really interesting .
it has very low revenue .
but i guess you could slap ads all over it and make some money .
i think the wikimedia foundation - the owner of wikipedia - could in fact sell it .
nobody ’ s interested in doing that , but certainly if there was an offer of $ 3 billion , i think the foundation would have to seriously think about what could be done for the charitable purposes of the foundation in distributing free knowledge if we outsourced the community or something .
your new project , the search engine wikia search , which will launch at the end of this year , will be commercial .
why did you change your mind ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wales aims to challenge google 's dominance in the search engine market .
for some types of projects - if you think about running hospitals or the red cross - the charitable model works well .
people are willing to donate money , enough to make it last .
but for other things like running a chain of grocery stores , there have never been very successful charities that have done such things .
i think different kinds of work demands different kinds of organization .
there are so many search engines on the internet already .
why does the world actually need another one ?
the search engines we have right now are black boxes and not transparent .
they are not community controlled and the quality is ... well , it 's pretty good but it stagnated the last two or three years .
there are lots of ways in which searches have not improved as much as a lot of us would have liked .
i don ’ t know how to improve search beyond what already exists .
but i do think that a broad community of people and an open scientific dialogue about how to do that can probably make some progress .
anyway it ’ s fun .
i always do the most fun thing .
and what will be the next big thing coming up on the internet ?
i don ’ t know .
i always remind people that five years ago , i was just this guy sitting at home in my pajamas typing on the internet .
and now i get asked deep questions about the future .
the trend i see right now is that we are very much at the beginning of free licensing of culture .
and we are still very much at the beginning of the design of communities for producing good quality work .
so i think that there is still a lot of room in those areas . christine elsaesser interviewed jimmy wales send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

founder jimmy wales spoke to dw-world about the secret of its success . jimmy wales was born in alabama , usa , in 1966 .
he studied finance and worked as a research director at the chicago stock exchange .
in 2001 he founded wikipedia which is a multilingual , web-based , free content encyclopedia project .
it is written collaboratively by volunteers .
the vast majority of its articles can be edited by anyone with access to the internet .
from 2003 to 2006 , jimmy wales was headed the wikimedia foundation , wikipedia 's non-profit parent organization .
in 2004 , he founded the for-profit internet portal wikia , which is now supposed to carry on his newest project , the search engine wikia search .
jimmy wales lives in florida with his wife and his daughter . dw-world : a famous american magazine has chosen you as one of the 100 people who shape our world .
how does it feel to be a world shaper ?
jimmy wales : i thought that was sort of funny .
i enjoyed it of course , but tyra banks - the supermodel - was also on the list .
so i don ’ t know how meaningful it really is .
but i feel a real sense of responsibility that i am in a position where i can have some influence and i can say something people listen to .
i try not to say very much because of that .
because i want to make sure that what i do say is something that i can really believe in .
equality , unlimited faculty , no hierarchy : is that just the philosophy of wikipedia or is it your philosophy of life in general ?
that is pretty much my philosophy .
a lot of wikipedia reflects things that i believe in very strongly .
sometimes people think if you believe that everyone should participate then you think right and wrong don ‘ t matter and everybody ’ s opinion is as good as everyone else ’ s .
it may seem paradoxical to them , but , no , i think that some people are really not that smart and that they are not that useful .
but leaving open the possibility for participation means that we are able to get a lot of great ideas from lots of different places .
wikipedia owes its success to the community , to all the people who write articles every day without getting paid .
why do they do that for wikipedia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikipedia has 75,000 contributors in over 100 languages .
i think there are two reasons .
one reason is that the charity of our mission is inspiring a lot of people .
but i think that ’ s a fairly limited reason .
the main reason is that it ’ s fun .
the people just enjoy the process , they enjoy meeting other intellectual people , it ’ s a great hobby .
we know that intuitively if we think about people plying football on the weekends .
we don ’ t say : " gee , gosh , you 're going to play football and you don ’ t get paid for that ? ”
that ’ s silly , right ?
obviously people are doing it because they enjoy it and they have fun .
it is a similar thing with wikipedia .
some people earn a lot of money writing but others can do it just for fun .
you seem to do it just for fun too .
because although wikipedia is very successful you are not earning any money because it is a charitable project .
do you sometimes think that you did something wrong ?
i always joke that when i registered wikipedia as a non-profit organization , it was either the dumbest thing or the smartest thing i ever did .
the dumbest for the obvious reason that i get to hang out with billionaires but i don ’ t have any money .
the smartest , though , because i don ‘ t think it could have been nearly as successful as it is and also because i think it will be remembered in the future .
100 or 200 years from now people will point to wikipedia and say : that was a really good thing that did something beneficial for the world .
so that is something i am very proud of .
why wouldn ’ t it have worked out as a commercial organization ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new era of user generated content and social networking is often referred to as web 2.0 i think that for an encyclopedia that is really attempting this very grand ethical mission of sharing knowledge with everyone , being a non-profit organization is really the right approach .
it means that , as a community , we have the luxury of doing things the right way rather than doing things in a way that is dictated by current economic circumstances .
the internet video platform you tube was sold for $ 1.65 billion -lrb- 1.23 billion euros -rrb- .
how much would sell wikipedia for ?
i don ’ t know what it ’ s worth , it ’ s really interesting .
it has very low revenue .
but i guess you could slap ads all over it and make some money .
i think the wikimedia foundation - the owner of wikipedia - could in fact sell it .
nobody ’ s interested in doing that , but certainly if there was an offer of $ 3 billion , i think the foundation would have to seriously think about what could be done for the charitable purposes of the foundation in distributing free knowledge if we outsourced the community or something .
your new project , the search engine wikia search , which will launch at the end of this year , will be commercial .
why did you change your mind ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wales aims to challenge google 's dominance in the search engine market .
for some types of projects - if you think about running hospitals or the red cross - the charitable model works well .
people are willing to donate money , enough to make it last .
but for other things like running a chain of grocery stores , there have never been very successful charities that have done such things .
i think different kinds of work demands different kinds of organization .
there are so many search engines on the internet already .
why does the world actually need another one ?
the search engines we have right now are black boxes and not transparent .
they are not community controlled and the quality is ... well , it 's pretty good but it stagnated the last two or three years .
there are lots of ways in which searches have not improved as much as a lot of us would have liked .
i don ’ t know how to improve search beyond what already exists .
but i do think that a broad community of people and an open scientific dialogue about how to do that can probably make some progress .
anyway it ’ s fun .
i always do the most fun thing .
and what will be the next big thing coming up on the internet ?
i don ’ t know .
i always remind people that five years ago , i was just this guy sitting at home in my pajamas typing on the internet .
and now i get asked deep questions about the future .
the trend i see right now is that we are very much at the beginning of free licensing of culture .
and we are still very much at the beginning of the design of communities for producing good quality work .
so i think that there is still a lot of room in those areas . christine elsaesser interviewed jimmy wales send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

analysts had forecast that seasonally adjusted unemployment would drop by 20,000 from may , when the jobless rate stood at 9.2 per cent .
" the driver is the good economic performance , " said alexander koch , an economist at the hypovereinsbank .
he added that employers were now complaining of growing labor shortages in key sectors of the economy .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers are n't holding back falling unemployment has also helped to shore up consumer confidence in germany where stagnating household spending has been a drag on economic growth in recent years .
german consumer confidence is at a six-month high , a survey released this week showed .
predictions of higher wages in the nation are helping to fuel optimism among the nation 's consumers , the survey said .
the number of unemployed fell by 26,000 in the economically more important western part of the nation , the labor agency said , and by 11,000 in the nation 's former communist east .
growth could exceed 2.8 percent amid signs that the german economy has rebounded unexpectedly strongly from the hefty and unpopular hike in the nation 's value-added tax in january and this year 's us economic slowdown , economists have been revising upwards their 2007 growth forecasts for germany .
many economists now project german economic growth to match or possibly surpass last year 's perky 2.8 percent expansion rate .
but with two major economic sentiment surveys - the zew investor confidence report and the ifo business confidence index - recently pointing down , analysts also say that the nation 's economic expansion could be starting to plateau out .
indeed , germany 's retail traders ' association -lrb- hde -rrb- said on thursday it expected 2007 retail sales to fall in real terms after a difficult start to the year .
pollitically sensitive data in the meantime , thursday 's jobless figures showed the politically-sensitive unadjusted labor market data also fell in june , dropping by 25,000 from may to 3.687 million in june with the unemployment rate edging down 0.3 percentage points to 8.8 percent .
" the demand for workers has increased again , " said federal labor agency chief frank jürgen weise .
the june unadjusted unemployment figures represented a 712,000 decline compared to june 2006 , when the jobless rate stood at 10.5 percent .
this represents an average monthly fall of 60,000 over the last 12 months .
the fall in seasonally unadjusted or headline unemployment was also more than expected by analysts , who had forecast a month-on-month fall in june of about 75,000 .
while the economists see the seasonally adjusted data as pointing to trends in the labor market , the headline data has become more politically significant in germany . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

analysts had forecast that seasonally adjusted unemployment would drop by 20,000 from may , when the jobless rate stood at 9.2 per cent .
" the driver is the good economic performance , " said alexander koch , an economist at the hypovereinsbank .
he added that employers were now complaining of growing labor shortages in key sectors of the economy .
consumer confidence gaining in strength job vacancies rose by 11.6 percent to 648,096 , thursday 's data showed as chancellor angela merkel 's government considers possible measures which could ease the way for skilled foreign workers to enter the german labor market to fill gaps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers are n't holding back falling unemployment has also helped to shore up consumer confidence in germany where stagnating household spending has been a drag on economic growth in recent years .
german consumer confidence is at a six-month high , a survey released this week showed .
predictions of higher wages in the nation are helping to fuel optimism among the nation 's consumers , the survey said .
the number of unemployed fell by 26,000 in the economically more important western part of the nation , the labor agency said , and by 11,000 in the nation 's former communist east .
growth could exceed 2.8 percent amid signs that the german economy has rebounded unexpectedly strongly from the hefty and unpopular hike in the nation 's value-added tax in january and this year 's us economic slowdown , economists have been revising upwards their 2007 growth forecasts for germany .
many economists now project german economic growth to match or possibly surpass last year 's perky 2.8 percent expansion rate .
but with two major economic sentiment surveys - the zew investor confidence report and the ifo business confidence index - recently pointing down , analysts also say that the nation 's economic expansion could be starting to plateau out .
indeed , germany 's retail traders ' association -lrb- hde -rrb- said on thursday it expected 2007 retail sales to fall in real terms after a difficult start to the year .
pollitically sensitive data in the meantime , thursday 's jobless figures showed the politically-sensitive unadjusted labor market data also fell in june , dropping by 25,000 from may to 3.687 million in june with the unemployment rate edging down 0.3 percentage points to 8.8 percent .
" the demand for workers has increased again , " said federal labor agency chief frank jürgen weise .
the june unadjusted unemployment figures represented a 712,000 decline compared to june 2006 , when the jobless rate stood at 10.5 percent .
this represents an average monthly fall of 60,000 over the last 12 months .
the fall in seasonally unadjusted or headline unemployment was also more than expected by analysts , who had forecast a month-on-month fall in june of about 75,000 .
while the economists see the seasonally adjusted data as pointing to trends in the labor market , the headline data has become more politically significant in germany . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

we are unusual , as british people go , but for my husband and me , germany is probably our favorite holiday destination and one reason for that is the stunning variety on offer .
each state has its own culture , architecture and natural scenery .
looking for new places to explore and discover , we started going east a couple of years ago and we were not disappointed - far from it .
from large , culture-rich cities like dresden and weimar to small , historic towns like meissen and quedlinburg , we 've found much to recommend .
there is so much history to explore and we have found the local people extremely welcoming , very helpful and eager to provide an excellent service to visitors .
our only surprise has been the low numbers of other visitors -lrb- especially other western europeans -rrb- .
if you do n't go soon , then you 'll be missing something extraordinary precisely because it is a place in transition , yet still , in parts , clinging to its unique identity and culture .
this will go in time , as is the way in a globalized society , so make the most of it while you can ! - liz , great britain eurail is a great bargain !
if you can , buy a pass .
trains in germany make our amtrak look like the trash it is .
i also recommend public transport in german cities .
germany was smart when they kept trams in their cities .
dresden is a great art treasure and we plan to return soon .
i also recommend leipzig , especially if you enjoy baroque and classical music . - samuel r. ganczaruk , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : take a christmas cruise , recommended a reader we are a group of spaniards visiting frankfurt .
at the suggestion of one local we went yesterday to a typical frankfurt cider tavern called zur sonne .
people here told us not to go to sachsenhausen -lrb- trashy and touristy , full of irish pubs and caipirinha bars these days -rrb- but rather to the north end and bornheim district , which are very young and picturesque .
apple wine , as everyone warned us , takes some " getting used to " but after a few glasses it tastes almost like a good penedes !
-lrb- only a joke ! -rrb-
the atmosphere in these taverns - which during warm months have large gardens - is very friendly and convivial .
the food is wonderful -lrb- try the local specialty , green sauce -rrb- and prices are very fair . - ramiro ruiz , spain i 've visited germany twice .
it is really a very nice country to visit .
everything is well prepared .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 28.06.2007 opinion : a surprising choice , but not necessarily a bad one großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former british premier tony blair 's new appointment as mideast envoy is a strange choice but given his close ties with the us , he might just succeed , says dw 's peter philipp . a former scandinavian head of state or one from asia , africa or another small european country would have been better suited for the job than tony blair .
that would be a spontaneous reaction to blair 's appointment as middle east envoy .
actually , just about anyone who did n't have the colonial past of a briton in the middle east , had not driven the iraq war as a " lap dog " of the american president and not delayed a truce during the lebanon war last year as blair did would have been a better person for the job .
despite these facts , the mideast quartet - which comprises the us , the eu , the un and russia - chose the former british prime minister as the new mideast envoy .
the quartet did n't seem to have any serious reservations about the appointment .
even the russians did n't seem to have any doubts about blair 's skills as a trouble shooter despite being at loggerheads with him in the scandal involving the murder of a former russian agent .
but can the former british premier position himself as a neutral representative and mediator ?
you have to doubt it in light of his close alliance with the us and israel .
the question is whether blair will really mediate in the ongoing trouble in the middle east .
his responsibility largely lies in helping the palestinian parties lift themselves out of the crisis .
he is meant to help the palestinians build democratic institutions and in the course of that job he will naturally have to often report to washington to request specific american help .
given his excellent ties with the white house , that should be easy for blair as compared with honorable representatives from second-tier friendly nations .
there 's no disputing that less mistrust of the mideast envoy would make his job easier .
but in the past even american jews such as henry kissinger or dennis ross have successfully mediated in the middle east on behalf of the white house .
why should blair not have the same success on behalf of the mideast quartet ?
especially considering that it will be the quartet and not blair who will decide which direction to take .
that decision too will be limited since the direction is long well known ; it 's that path that negotiators ca n't agree on .
during his farewell speech to the house of commons , blair declared that the middle east must have place for two states - israel and palestine .
by now all sensible and right-minded individuals accept that formula and it also forms the core of the " roadmap " of the middle east aimed to resolve the conflict .
the arab league too is committed to the " two state " solution .
only radical groups continue to reject it .
but then again nobody would try to talk peace with them .
that 's why blair might succeed in moving things along .
and if he does n't then he would n't be the first to fail at the task .

that would be a spontaneous reaction to blair 's appointment as middle east envoy .
actually , just about anyone who did n't have the colonial past of a briton in the middle east , had not driven the iraq war as a " lap dog " of the american president and not delayed a truce during the lebanon war last year as blair did would have been a better person for the job .
despite these facts , the mideast quartet - which comprises the us , the eu , the un and russia - chose the former british prime minister as the new mideast envoy .
the quartet did n't seem to have any serious reservations about the appointment .
even the russians did n't seem to have any doubts about blair 's skills as a trouble shooter despite being at loggerheads with him in the scandal involving the murder of a former russian agent .
but can the former british premier position himself as a neutral representative and mediator ?
you have to doubt it in light of his close alliance with the us and israel .
the question is whether blair will really mediate in the ongoing trouble in the middle east .
his responsibility largely lies in helping the palestinian parties lift themselves out of the crisis .
he is meant to help the palestinians build democratic institutions and in the course of that job he will naturally have to often report to washington to request specific american help .
given his excellent ties with the white house , that should be easy for blair as compared with honorable representatives from second-tier friendly nations .
there 's no disputing that less mistrust of the mideast envoy would make his job easier .
but in the past even american jews such as henry kissinger or dennis ross have successfully mediated in the middle east on behalf of the white house .
why should blair not have the same success on behalf of the mideast quartet ?
especially considering that it will be the quartet and not blair who will decide which direction to take .
that decision too will be limited since the direction is long well known ; it 's that path that negotiators ca n't agree on .
during his farewell speech to the house of commons , blair declared that the middle east must have place for two states - israel and palestine .
by now all sensible and right-minded individuals accept that formula and it also forms the core of the " roadmap " of the middle east aimed to resolve the conflict .
the arab league too is committed to the " two state " solution .
only radical groups continue to reject it .
but then again nobody would try to talk peace with them .
that 's why blair might succeed in moving things along .
and if he does n't then he would n't be the first to fail at the task .

" anybody who tries to weigh up the dead of the second world war against votes in the -lrb- eu -rrb- council has to be rejected out of hand , " martin schulz , leader of the socialist group in the european parliament , told fellow lawmakers in brussels on wednesday to loud applause .
" the eu is an idea aimed at eliminating the specters of the past ...
we will not permit the few to bring up those specters , " he added .
schulz was referring to kacyznski 's remarks that poland deserved more voting power in the eu because its population would have been far larger if it had not been decimated during the nazi era .
the prime minister compounded matters on tuesday when he compared modern-day germany to the era that brought adolf hitler to power .

" for us our polish neighbor has the same importance as our french neighbor , " she said in a speech on wednesday in brussels .
she has not commented on a controversial caricature of her that appeared on the front cover of the conservative polish magazine wprost on monday .
entitled the " stepmother of europe , " the photomontage depicted the german chancellor breast-feeding the kaczynski twins .

but eckart von klaeden , the foreign policy spokesman for the conservative cdu / csu bloc , has also called for the matter to be approached in a more relaxed manner .
he told the hannoversche allgemeine zeitung that press freedom also protected things that people might regard as stupid or tasteless .
von klaeden also referred to a caricature that appeared in germany 's taz newspaper a year ago that compared the polish president as " poland 's new potato . "
at that time berlin responded to protests from warsaw by referring to the freedom of the press .
" exactly the same standards should apply with regards to the cover of a polish magazine , " he said .

" anybody who tries to weigh up the dead of the second world war against votes in the -lrb- eu -rrb- council has to be rejected out of hand , " martin schulz , leader of the socialist group in the european parliament , told fellow lawmakers in brussels on wednesday to loud applause .
" the eu is an idea aimed at eliminating the specters of the past ...
we will not permit the few to bring up those specters , " he added .
schulz was referring to kacyznski 's remarks that poland deserved more voting power in the eu because its population would have been far larger if it had not been decimated during the nazi era .
the prime minister compounded matters on tuesday when he compared modern-day germany to the era that brought adolf hitler to power .
" not representative " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bilateral relations have been strained since the kaczynski twins came to power marek siwiec , a polish member of the european parliament said that kaczynski 's comments and the polish blocking tactics at the eu summit did not represent the views of the polish people .
he praised germany for avoiding any kind of " demonstration of power " in its role as holder of the eu presidency vis-a-vis poland and other eu states and praised german chancellor angela merkel 's pleasant " new leadership style . "
poland eventually won concessions at the summit , notably a delay to the introduction of the new voting system which it opposed , but faced criticism for its negotiating manner .
the german chancellor continues to seek to play down the dispute with poland .
" for us our polish neighbor has the same importance as our french neighbor , " she said in a speech on wednesday in brussels .
she has not commented on a controversial caricature of her that appeared on the front cover of the conservative polish magazine wprost on monday .
entitled the " stepmother of europe , " the photomontage depicted the german chancellor breast-feeding the kaczynski twins .
outrage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this controversial caricature has also provoked a storm of outrage a number of german politicians expressed outrage on tuesday about the caricature that accompanied an article written by mariusz muszynski , the polish foreign minister 's commissioner for german-polish relations .
but eckart von klaeden , the foreign policy spokesman for the conservative cdu / csu bloc , has also called for the matter to be approached in a more relaxed manner .
he told the hannoversche allgemeine zeitung that press freedom also protected things that people might regard as stupid or tasteless .
von klaeden also referred to a caricature that appeared in germany 's taz newspaper a year ago that compared the polish president as " poland 's new potato . "
at that time berlin responded to protests from warsaw by referring to the freedom of the press .
" exactly the same standards should apply with regards to the cover of a polish magazine , " he said .
von klaeden also expressed optimism that the tensions between germany and poland would soon settle .

" the political responsibility will remain as before on the shoulders of the quartet , " she added . on wednesday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier complained of a lack of consultation with members of the quartet before the appointment was made .
germany is the eu 's representative on the panel . washington got its choice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel , right , and french prime minister francois fillon , left , deliver press satatements supporting blair . blair held confidential discussions on the post with washington , which formally recommended him without prior consultation with the other quartet members , press reports said . the united nations announced blair 's appointment just hours after he stepped down as prime minister on wednesday .
the united states had pushed hard for blair - a close friend and ally of president george w. bush - to get the post .
reports said the announcement was apparently delayed because of russian reservations . merkel described blair as a man of great political experience , who could provide an important contribution to finding a solution to the mideast conflict . european media reports said the decision had been made solely between the us and blair behind closed doors .
the quartet was then informed of it later . blair 's power will be limited steinmeier said blair would receive a closely defined mandate .
his work would focus on " institution building in , and political strengthening of , the palestinian authority , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the quartet will keep control of the middle east peace process this limitation was due to the fact " that the quartet itself wants to keep the political task of shaping the middle east peace process in its own hands , " steinmeier said .
the minister did n't express any doubts about blair 's qualification for the post .
but at the same time , he did n't explicitly praise blair either . according to media reports , there are concerns in berlin that blair could seize the diplomatic process in the middle east and therefore harm the quartet 's work .
other eu member states fear that blair could weaken the position of eu foreign policy chief javier solana , who has been working on solutions to the arab-israeli conflict for years . " solana is a member of the quartet while blair will be working for the quartet , " steinmeier said .
" the difference is clear . " russia held back un spokeswoman michele montas said on wednesday that blair would " mobilize international assistance to the palestinians , working closely with donors and existing coordination bodies . "
his tasks included helping to identify and secure " appropriate international support in addressing the institutional governance needs of the palestinian state , " she said . blair 's work would be " in support of the agreed quartet objectives , " montas said . a small team of experts based in jerusalem will support blair , who will spend significant time in the region , montas added . russia had previously stalled blair 's appointment .
according to german officials , russia had held back its support because of the lack of consultation on the move .
only on tuesday did moscow give its assent . allies support blair 's appointment although he is well respected in israel , the arab world has sharply criticized blair for britain 's role in the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq , as well as his support of israel 's war in lebanon last summer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana is a key architect of the roadmap for peace in the middle east but blair won backing from his allies for his new role . " tony will help palestinians develop the political and economic institutions they will need for a democratic , sovereign state able to provide for its people and live in peace and security with israel , " bush said . palestinian president mahmud abbas and israel also expressed their approval .
israeli prime minister ehud olmert " believes that blair can have a favorable impact , in particular by helping the palestinians develop solid governmental structures , " his spokeswoman miri eisin said . but the hamas movement controlling the gaza strip said the appointment " is not acceptable to hamas nor to the palestinians . " the middle east quartet has tried to implement a " roadmap " for israeli-palestinian peace since 2003 .
but the three-stage blueprint that should have led to the creation of a palestinian state living side by side in peace with israel by 2005 has since decayed . the post of quartet representative had been vacant since former world bank chairman james wolfensohn resigned in frustration in may 2006 . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the us says they are key in its war against terrorism but europeans worry the measures erode civil liberties . eu officials said wednesday that the eu and the us had reached a deal following a meeting between franco frattini , the eu justice and home affairs commissioner , michael chertoff , the us secretary for homeland security and wolfgang schäuble , the interior minister of germany which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
" a political agreement in principle was reached , " said roscam abbing , a spokesman for frattini .
data privacy a thorny issue data privacy has been a sticking point between the eu and the us ever since washington intensified anti-terrorism efforts after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks .
following the attacks on new york and washington , the eu and the us signed an agreement under which the eu agreed to grant us authorities access to up to 34 categories of information on passengers on all flights to the us taking off from eu member states .
these included names , addresses , phone numbers and credit card numbers of travelers .
that agreement , which is set to expire on july 31 , had stirred unease among eu lawmakers amid mounting concerns that civil liberties were being eroded in the fight against global terrorism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flying to the us is usually a security hassle for passengers in a letter this month to interior and justice ministers of portugal , which takes over the eu presidency from germany next month , the european data protection supervisor , peter hustinx said eu governments were sacrificing too much of their citizens ' privacy in the fight against terrorism . " i fear that messages such as ' no right to privacy until life and security are guaranteed ' are developing into a mantra suggesting that fundamental rights and freedoms are a luxury that security can not afford , " hustinx wrote . last may , the air travel data deal was annulled by the european court of justice in luxembourg and the two sides reached an interim agreement .
the eu had warned that airlines would be vulnerable to privacy complaints if no replacement deal had been reached before the interim one expired .
though details of the accord reached this week have not been released , german interior minister schäuble told an eu parliamentary briefing in strasbourg that the aim was to reduce the number of stored data on passengers that the us currently receives from 34 to 20 .
it remains unclear what pieces of personal data will be left out from the new us list .
an eu diplomat said under the new arrangement the data would now be kept by the us for 15 years , up from 3 1/2 years in the interim agreement .
the european side also sought to end the us ability to directly access flight booking computers , arguing instead that airlines should send the data .
europeans are the biggest group of travelers to the us .
deal on access to bank data separately , the us and the eu also struck a deal setting conditions for the us treasury department to view records of the international banking network swift in anti-terrorism probes .
european civil liberties group watchdogs had complained that swift , which handles global financial transfers and is based in brussels , violated european privacy laws by allowing the us to secretly consult its records .
washington has argued that the access is essential for its drive to end funding to terror networks .
the us will now only use swift data for counter-terrorism purposes and store it for a maximum of five years , according to the terms of the new deal . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the us says they are key in its war against terrorism but europeans worry the measures erode civil liberties . eu officials said wednesday that the eu and the us had reached a deal following a meeting between franco frattini , the eu justice and home affairs commissioner , michael chertoff , the us secretary for homeland security and wolfgang schäuble , the interior minister of germany which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
" a political agreement in principle was reached , " said roscam abbing , a spokesman for frattini .
data privacy a thorny issue data privacy has been a sticking point between the eu and the us ever since washington intensified anti-terrorism efforts after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks .
following the attacks on new york and washington , the eu and the us signed an agreement under which the eu agreed to grant us authorities access to up to 34 categories of information on passengers on all flights to the us taking off from eu member states .
these included names , addresses , phone numbers and credit card numbers of travelers .
that agreement , which is set to expire on july 31 , had stirred unease among eu lawmakers amid mounting concerns that civil liberties were being eroded in the fight against global terrorism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flying to the us is usually a security hassle for passengers in a letter this month to interior and justice ministers of portugal , which takes over the eu presidency from germany next month , the european data protection supervisor , peter hustinx said eu governments were sacrificing too much of their citizens ' privacy in the fight against terrorism . " i fear that messages such as ' no right to privacy until life and security are guaranteed ' are developing into a mantra suggesting that fundamental rights and freedoms are a luxury that security can not afford , " hustinx wrote . last may , the air travel data deal was annulled by the european court of justice in luxembourg and the two sides reached an interim agreement .
the eu had warned that airlines would be vulnerable to privacy complaints if no replacement deal had been reached before the interim one expired .
though details of the accord reached this week have not been released , german interior minister schäuble told an eu parliamentary briefing in strasbourg that the aim was to reduce the number of stored data on passengers that the us currently receives from 34 to 20 .
it remains unclear what pieces of personal data will be left out from the new us list .
an eu diplomat said under the new arrangement the data would now be kept by the us for 15 years , up from 3 1/2 years in the interim agreement .
the european side also sought to end the us ability to directly access flight booking computers , arguing instead that airlines should send the data .
europeans are the biggest group of travelers to the us .
deal on access to bank data separately , the us and the eu also struck a deal setting conditions for the us treasury department to view records of the international banking network swift in anti-terrorism probes .
european civil liberties group watchdogs had complained that swift , which handles global financial transfers and is based in brussels , violated european privacy laws by allowing the us to secretly consult its records .
washington has argued that the access is essential for its drive to end funding to terror networks .
the us will now only use swift data for counter-terrorism purposes and store it for a maximum of five years , according to the terms of the new deal . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" anybody who tries to weigh up the dead of the second world war against votes in the -lrb- eu -rrb- council has to be rejected out of hand , " martin schulz , leader of the socialist group in the european parliament , told fellow lawmakers in brussels on wednesday to loud applause .
" the eu is an idea aimed at eliminating the specters of the past ...
we will not permit the few to bring up those specters , " he added .
schulz was referring to kacyznski 's remarks that poland deserved more voting power in the eu because its population would have been far larger if it had not been decimated during the nazi era .
the prime minister compounded matters on tuesday when he compared modern-day germany to the era that brought adolf hitler to power .
" not representative " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bilateral relations have been strained since the kaczynski twins came to power marek siwiec , a polish member of the european parliament said that kaczynski 's comments and the polish blocking tactics at the eu summit did not represent the views of the polish people .
he praised germany for avoiding any kind of " demonstration of power " in its role as holder of the eu presidency vis-a-vis poland and other eu states and praised german chancellor angela merkel 's pleasant " new leadership style . "
poland eventually won concessions at the summit , notably a delay to the introduction of the new voting system which it opposed , but faced criticism for its negotiating manner .
the german chancellor continues to seek to play down the dispute with poland .
" for us our polish neighbor has the same importance as our french neighbor , " she said in a speech on wednesday in brussels .
she has not commented on a controversial caricature of her that appeared on the front cover of the conservative polish magazine wprost on monday .
entitled the " stepmother of europe , " the photomontage depicted the german chancellor breast-feeding the kaczynski twins .
outrage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this controversial caricature has also provoked a storm of outrage a number of german politicians expressed outrage on tuesday about the caricature that accompanied an article written by mariusz muszynski , the polish foreign minister 's commissioner for german-polish relations .
but eckart von klaeden , the foreign policy spokesman for the conservative cdu / csu bloc , has also called for the matter to be approached in a more relaxed manner .
he told the hannoversche allgemeine zeitung that press freedom also protected things that people might regard as stupid or tasteless .
von klaeden also referred to a caricature that appeared in germany 's taz newspaper a year ago that compared the polish president as " poland 's new potato . "
at that time berlin responded to protests from warsaw by referring to the freedom of the press .
" exactly the same standards should apply with regards to the cover of a polish magazine , " he said .
von klaeden also expressed optimism that the tensions between germany and poland would soon settle .
" once all the momentary fuss has subsided , it will be possible to clearly see the success of the summit in brussels , " he said . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" anybody who tries to weigh up the dead of the second world war against votes in the -lrb- eu -rrb- council has to be rejected out of hand , " martin schulz , leader of the socialist group in the european parliament , told fellow lawmakers in brussels on wednesday to loud applause .
" the eu is an idea aimed at eliminating the specters of the past ...
we will not permit the few to bring up those specters , " he added .
schulz was referring to kacyznski 's remarks that poland deserved more voting power in the eu because its population would have been far larger if it had not been decimated during the nazi era .
the prime minister compounded matters on tuesday when he compared modern-day germany to the era that brought adolf hitler to power .
" not representative " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bilateral relations have been strained since the kaczynski twins came to power marek siwiec , a polish member of the european parliament said that kaczynski 's comments and the polish blocking tactics at the eu summit did not represent the views of the polish people .
he praised germany for avoiding any kind of " demonstration of power " in its role as holder of the eu presidency vis-a-vis poland and other eu states and praised german chancellor angela merkel 's pleasant " new leadership style . "

but eckart von klaeden , the foreign policy spokesman for the conservative cdu / csu bloc , has also called for the matter to be approached in a more relaxed manner .
he told the hannoversche allgemeine zeitung that press freedom also protected things that people might regard as stupid or tasteless .
von klaeden also referred to a caricature that appeared in germany 's taz newspaper a year ago that compared the polish president as " poland 's new potato . "
at that time berlin responded to protests from warsaw by referring to the freedom of the press .
" exactly the same standards should apply with regards to the cover of a polish magazine , " he said .

the procedure is a breakthrough in bio-technology and fuels hope of a cure for aids . the laboratory procedure removing the aids virus used an enzyme , said joachim hauber of the heinrich pette institute for experimental virology and immunology in hamburg . " we have rid the cells of the virus , " hauber said on thursday .
" no one else has done this before . "
he called it " a breakthrough in bio-technology . " hauber said it was his " cautious " hope that a cure for aids could be found within 10 years . current therapies can only limit the spread of the human immunodeficiency virus -lrb- hiv -rrb- and not remove it from the body .
hiv is a retrovirus that nests in the dna or key genetic material of infected cells . the max planck institute for molecular cell biology and genetics in dresden was the partner in the research , which will be reported in friday 's issue of the scientific journal science . cutting dna and recombining it three years of experiments on mice were planned next , to be followed by tests on humans in hamburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the enzyme knows just where to cut the dna the scientists ' method used the ability of so-called recombinase enzymes to cut strands of dna at certain places like a pair of scissors and recombine the strands . the new enzyme , tre , always recognized the right spot to snip the dna where the hiv started .
the scientists said it recognized a characteristic hiv sequence that scarcely ever mutated . tre was adapted from an existing natural enzyme , cre , which recognized similar genetic sequences . stem cells necessary for therapy the laboratories artificially evolved cre into tre through more than 120 recombinase generations .
hauber said the cell then flushed out the snipped-away dna as waste . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists have been analyzing the hiv virus for years " after that , it is healthy , " hauber said . any therapy , though , would require stem cells to be obtained from a patient 's blood .
they would then be treated in the laboratory and re-injected to regenerate a healthy immune system , hauber said . " it 's high-tech medicine , " hauber said .

dw-world.de " the lack of a global response to aids is a catastrophe " at the 2005 g8 summit in gleneagles , the attending leaders made certain promises regarding funding in the fight against hiv / aids .
action aid 's aditi sharma spoke to dw-world.de about broken promises and time running out .
-lrb- 07.06.2007 -rrb- hiv infections at an all-time high in germany a report shows that germany now has the greatest number of registered new hiv infections since specific records began being kept in 1993 .

the us says they are key in its war against terrorism but europeans worry the measures erode civil liberties . eu officials said wednesday that the eu and the us had reached a deal following a meeting between franco frattini , the eu justice and home affairs commissioner , michael chertoff , the us secretary for homeland security and wolfgang schäuble , the interior minister of germany which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
" a political agreement in principle was reached , " said roscam abbing , a spokesman for frattini .
data privacy a thorny issue data privacy has been a sticking point between the eu and the us ever since washington intensified anti-terrorism efforts after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks .
following the attacks on new york and washington , the eu and the us signed an agreement under which the eu agreed to grant us authorities access to up to 34 categories of information on passengers on all flights to the us taking off from eu member states .
these included names , addresses , phone numbers and credit card numbers of travelers .
that agreement , which is set to expire on july 31 , had stirred unease among eu lawmakers amid mounting concerns that civil liberties were being eroded in the fight against global terrorism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flying to the us is usually a security hassle for passengers in a letter this month to interior and justice ministers of portugal , which takes over the eu presidency from germany next month , the european data protection supervisor , peter hustinx said eu governments were sacrificing too much of their citizens ' privacy in the fight against terrorism . " i fear that messages such as ' no right to privacy until life and security are guaranteed ' are developing into a mantra suggesting that fundamental rights and freedoms are a luxury that security can not afford , " hustinx wrote . last may , the air travel data deal was annulled by the european court of justice in luxembourg and the two sides reached an interim agreement .
the eu had warned that airlines would be vulnerable to privacy complaints if no replacement deal had been reached before the interim one expired .
though details of the accord reached this week have not been released , german interior minister schäuble told an eu parliamentary briefing in strasbourg that the aim was to reduce the number of stored data on passengers that the us currently receives from 34 to 20 .
it remains unclear what pieces of personal data will be left out from the new us list .
an eu diplomat said under the new arrangement the data would now be kept by the us for 15 years , up from 3 1/2 years in the interim agreement .
the european side also sought to end the us ability to directly access flight booking computers , arguing instead that airlines should send the data .
europeans are the biggest group of travelers to the us .
deal on access to bank data separately , the us and the eu also struck a deal setting conditions for the us treasury department to view records of the international banking network swift in anti-terrorism probes .
european civil liberties group watchdogs had complained that swift , which handles global financial transfers and is based in brussels , violated european privacy laws by allowing the us to secretly consult its records .
washington has argued that the access is essential for its drive to end funding to terror networks .
the us will now only use swift data for counter-terrorism purposes and store it for a maximum of five years , according to the terms of the new deal . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the future of the internet is now germans hesitant to look for love online " the synapses of a collective brain are growing " the internet and everyday life : the constant revolution the future is now internet -pipe- 28.06.2007 wikipedia founder : " great ideas come from different places " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikipedia founder jimmi wales its critics said it would n't last but the online encyclopaedia wikipedia has gone on to become one of the world 's most popular websites .
founder jimmy wales spoke to dw-world about the secret of its success . jimmy wales was born in alabama , usa , in 1966 .
he studied finance and worked as a research director at the chicago stock exchange .
in 2001 he founded wikipedia which is a multilingual , web-based , free content encyclopedia project .
it is written collaboratively by volunteers .
the vast majority of its articles can be edited by anyone with access to the internet .
from 2003 to 2006 , jimmy wales was headed the wikimedia foundation , wikipedia 's non-profit parent organization .
in 2004 , he founded the for-profit internet portal wikia , which is now supposed to carry on his newest project , the search engine wikia search .
jimmy wales lives in florida with his wife and his daughter . dw-world : a famous american magazine has chosen you as one of the 100 people who shape our world .
how does it feel to be a world shaper ?
jimmy wales : i thought that was sort of funny .
i enjoyed it of course , but tyra banks - the supermodel - was also on the list .
so i don ’ t know how meaningful it really is .
but i feel a real sense of responsibility that i am in a position where i can have some influence and i can say something people listen to .
i try not to say very much because of that .
because i want to make sure that what i do say is something that i can really believe in .
equality , unlimited faculty , no hierarchy : is that just the philosophy of wikipedia or is it your philosophy of life in general ?
that is pretty much my philosophy .
a lot of wikipedia reflects things that i believe in very strongly .
sometimes people think if you believe that everyone should participate then you think right and wrong don ‘ t matter and everybody ’ s opinion is as good as everyone else ’ s .
it may seem paradoxical to them , but , no , i think that some people are really not that smart and that they are not that useful .
but leaving open the possibility for participation means that we are able to get a lot of great ideas from lots of different places .
wikipedia owes its success to the community , to all the people who write articles every day without getting paid .
why do they do that for wikipedia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikipedia has 75,000 contributors in over 100 languages .
i think there are two reasons .
one reason is that the charity of our mission is inspiring a lot of people .
but i think that ’ s a fairly limited reason .
the main reason is that it ’ s fun .
the people just enjoy the process , they enjoy meeting other intellectual people , it ’ s a great hobby .
we know that intuitively if we think about people plying football on the weekends .
we don ’ t say : " gee , gosh , you 're going to play football and you don ’ t get paid for that ? ”
that ’ s silly , right ?
obviously people are doing it because they enjoy it and they have fun .
it is a similar thing with wikipedia .
some people earn a lot of money writing but others can do it just for fun .
you seem to do it just for fun too .
because although wikipedia is very successful you are not earning any money because it is a charitable project .
do you sometimes think that you did something wrong ?
i always joke that when i registered wikipedia as a non-profit organization , it was either the dumbest thing or the smartest thing i ever did .
the dumbest for the obvious reason that i get to hang out with billionaires but i don ’ t have any money .
the smartest , though , because i don ‘ t think it could have been nearly as successful as it is and also because i think it will be remembered in the future .
100 or 200 years from now people will point to wikipedia and say : that was a really good thing that did something beneficial for the world .
so that is something i am very proud of .
why wouldn ’ t it have worked out as a commercial organization ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new era of user generated content and social networking is often referred to as web 2.0 i think that for an encyclopedia that is really attempting this very grand ethical mission of sharing knowledge with everyone , being a non-profit organization is really the right approach .
it means that , as a community , we have the luxury of doing things the right way rather than doing things in a way that is dictated by current economic circumstances .
the internet video platform you tube was sold for $ 1.65 billion -lrb- 1.23 billion euros -rrb- .
how much would sell wikipedia for ?
i don ’ t know what it ’ s worth , it ’ s really interesting .
it has very low revenue .
but i guess you could slap ads all over it and make some money .
i think the wikimedia foundation - the owner of wikipedia - could in fact sell it .
nobody ’ s interested in doing that , but certainly if there was an offer of $ 3 billion , i think the foundation would have to seriously think about what could be done for the charitable purposes of the foundation in distributing free knowledge if we outsourced the community or something .
your new project , the search engine wikia search , which will launch at the end of this year , will be commercial .
why did you change your mind ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wales aims to challenge google 's dominance in the search engine market .
for some types of projects - if you think about running hospitals or the red cross - the charitable model works well .
people are willing to donate money , enough to make it last .
but for other things like running a chain of grocery stores , there have never been very successful charities that have done such things .
i think different kinds of work demands different kinds of organization .
there are so many search engines on the internet already .
why does the world actually need another one ?
the search engines we have right now are black boxes and not transparent .
they are not community controlled and the quality is ... well , it 's pretty good but it stagnated the last two or three years .
there are lots of ways in which searches have not improved as much as a lot of us would have liked .
i don ’ t know how to improve search beyond what already exists .
but i do think that a broad community of people and an open scientific dialogue about how to do that can probably make some progress .
anyway it ’ s fun .
i always do the most fun thing .
and what will be the next big thing coming up on the internet ?
i don ’ t know .
i always remind people that five years ago , i was just this guy sitting at home in my pajamas typing on the internet .
and now i get asked deep questions about the future .
the trend i see right now is that we are very much at the beginning of free licensing of culture .
and we are still very much at the beginning of the design of communities for producing good quality work .
so i think that there is still a lot of room in those areas . christine elsaesser interviewed jimmy wales send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the procedure is a breakthrough in bio-technology and fuels hope of a cure for aids . the laboratory procedure removing the aids virus used an enzyme , said joachim hauber of the heinrich pette institute for experimental virology and immunology in hamburg . " we have rid the cells of the virus , " hauber said on thursday .
" no one else has done this before . "
he called it " a breakthrough in bio-technology . " hauber said it was his " cautious " hope that a cure for aids could be found within 10 years . current therapies can only limit the spread of the human immunodeficiency virus -lrb- hiv -rrb- and not remove it from the body .
hiv is a retrovirus that nests in the dna or key genetic material of infected cells . the max planck institute for molecular cell biology and genetics in dresden was the partner in the research , which will be reported in friday 's issue of the scientific journal science . cutting dna and recombining it three years of experiments on mice were planned next , to be followed by tests on humans in hamburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the enzyme knows just where to cut the dna the scientists ' method used the ability of so-called recombinase enzymes to cut strands of dna at certain places like a pair of scissors and recombine the strands . the new enzyme , tre , always recognized the right spot to snip the dna where the hiv started .
the scientists said it recognized a characteristic hiv sequence that scarcely ever mutated . tre was adapted from an existing natural enzyme , cre , which recognized similar genetic sequences . stem cells necessary for therapy the laboratories artificially evolved cre into tre through more than 120 recombinase generations .
hauber said the cell then flushed out the snipped-away dna as waste . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists have been analyzing the hiv virus for years " after that , it is healthy , " hauber said . any therapy , though , would require stem cells to be obtained from a patient 's blood .
they would then be treated in the laboratory and re-injected to regenerate a healthy immune system , hauber said . " it 's high-tech medicine , " hauber said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 28.06.2007 opinion : a surprising choice , but not necessarily a bad one großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former british premier tony blair 's new appointment as mideast envoy is a strange choice but given his close ties with the us , he might just succeed , says dw 's peter philipp . a former scandinavian head of state or one from asia , africa or another small european country would have been better suited for the job than tony blair .
that would be a spontaneous reaction to blair 's appointment as middle east envoy .
actually , just about anyone who did n't have the colonial past of a briton in the middle east , had not driven the iraq war as a " lap dog " of the american president and not delayed a truce during the lebanon war last year as blair did would have been a better person for the job .
despite these facts , the mideast quartet - which comprises the us , the eu , the un and russia - chose the former british prime minister as the new mideast envoy .
the quartet did n't seem to have any serious reservations about the appointment .
even the russians did n't seem to have any doubts about blair 's skills as a trouble shooter despite being at loggerheads with him in the scandal involving the murder of a former russian agent .
but can the former british premier position himself as a neutral representative and mediator ?
you have to doubt it in light of his close alliance with the us and israel .
the question is whether blair will really mediate in the ongoing trouble in the middle east .
his responsibility largely lies in helping the palestinian parties lift themselves out of the crisis .
he is meant to help the palestinians build democratic institutions and in the course of that job he will naturally have to often report to washington to request specific american help .
given his excellent ties with the white house , that should be easy for blair as compared with honorable representatives from second-tier friendly nations .
there 's no disputing that less mistrust of the mideast envoy would make his job easier .
but in the past even american jews such as henry kissinger or dennis ross have successfully mediated in the middle east on behalf of the white house .
why should blair not have the same success on behalf of the mideast quartet ?
especially considering that it will be the quartet and not blair who will decide which direction to take .
that decision too will be limited since the direction is long well known ; it 's that path that negotiators ca n't agree on .
during his farewell speech to the house of commons , blair declared that the middle east must have place for two states - israel and palestine .
by now all sensible and right-minded individuals accept that formula and it also forms the core of the " roadmap " of the middle east aimed to resolve the conflict .
the arab league too is committed to the " two state " solution .
only radical groups continue to reject it .
but then again nobody would try to talk peace with them .
that 's why blair might succeed in moving things along .
and if he does n't then he would n't be the first to fail at the task .

actually , just about anyone who did n't have the colonial past of a briton in the middle east , had not driven the iraq war as a " lap dog " of the american president and not delayed a truce during the lebanon war last year as blair did would have been a better person for the job .
despite these facts , the mideast quartet - which comprises the us , the eu , the un and russia - chose the former british prime minister as the new mideast envoy .
the quartet did n't seem to have any serious reservations about the appointment .
even the russians did n't seem to have any doubts about blair 's skills as a trouble shooter despite being at loggerheads with him in the scandal involving the murder of a former russian agent .
but can the former british premier position himself as a neutral representative and mediator ?
you have to doubt it in light of his close alliance with the us and israel .
the question is whether blair will really mediate in the ongoing trouble in the middle east .
his responsibility largely lies in helping the palestinian parties lift themselves out of the crisis .
he is meant to help the palestinians build democratic institutions and in the course of that job he will naturally have to often report to washington to request specific american help .
given his excellent ties with the white house , that should be easy for blair as compared with honorable representatives from second-tier friendly nations .
there 's no disputing that less mistrust of the mideast envoy would make his job easier .
but in the past even american jews such as henry kissinger or dennis ross have successfully mediated in the middle east on behalf of the white house .
why should blair not have the same success on behalf of the mideast quartet ?
especially considering that it will be the quartet and not blair who will decide which direction to take .
that decision too will be limited since the direction is long well known ; it 's that path that negotiators ca n't agree on .
during his farewell speech to the house of commons , blair declared that the middle east must have place for two states - israel and palestine .
by now all sensible and right-minded individuals accept that formula and it also forms the core of the " roadmap " of the middle east aimed to resolve the conflict .
the arab league too is committed to the " two state " solution .
only radical groups continue to reject it .
but then again nobody would try to talk peace with them .
that 's why blair might succeed in moving things along .
and if he does n't then he would n't be the first to fail at the task .

we are unusual , as british people go , but for my husband and me , germany is probably our favorite holiday destination and one reason for that is the stunning variety on offer .
each state has its own culture , architecture and natural scenery .
looking for new places to explore and discover , we started going east a couple of years ago and we were not disappointed - far from it .
from large , culture-rich cities like dresden and weimar to small , historic towns like meissen and quedlinburg , we 've found much to recommend .
there is so much history to explore and we have found the local people extremely welcoming , very helpful and eager to provide an excellent service to visitors .
our only surprise has been the low numbers of other visitors -lrb- especially other western europeans -rrb- .
if you do n't go soon , then you 'll be missing something extraordinary precisely because it is a place in transition , yet still , in parts , clinging to its unique identity and culture .
this will go in time , as is the way in a globalized society , so make the most of it while you can ! - liz , great britain eurail is a great bargain !
if you can , buy a pass .
trains in germany make our amtrak look like the trash it is .
i also recommend public transport in german cities .
germany was smart when they kept trams in their cities .
dresden is a great art treasure and we plan to return soon .

at the suggestion of one local we went yesterday to a typical frankfurt cider tavern called zur sonne .
people here told us not to go to sachsenhausen -lrb- trashy and touristy , full of irish pubs and caipirinha bars these days -rrb- but rather to the north end and bornheim district , which are very young and picturesque .
apple wine , as everyone warned us , takes some " getting used to " but after a few glasses it tastes almost like a good penedes !
-lrb- only a joke ! -rrb-
the atmosphere in these taverns - which during warm months have large gardens - is very friendly and convivial .
the food is wonderful -lrb- try the local specialty , green sauce -rrb- and prices are very fair . - ramiro ruiz , spain i 've visited germany twice .

" the political responsibility will remain as before on the shoulders of the quartet , " she added . on wednesday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier complained of a lack of consultation with members of the quartet before the appointment was made .
germany is the eu 's representative on the panel . washington got its choice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel , right , and french prime minister francois fillon , left , deliver press satatements supporting blair . blair held confidential discussions on the post with washington , which formally recommended him without prior consultation with the other quartet members , press reports said . the united nations announced blair 's appointment just hours after he stepped down as prime minister on wednesday .
the united states had pushed hard for blair - a close friend and ally of president george w. bush - to get the post .
reports said the announcement was apparently delayed because of russian reservations . merkel described blair as a man of great political experience , who could provide an important contribution to finding a solution to the mideast conflict . european media reports said the decision had been made solely between the us and blair behind closed doors .
the quartet was then informed of it later . blair 's power will be limited steinmeier said blair would receive a closely defined mandate .
his work would focus on " institution building in , and political strengthening of , the palestinian authority , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the quartet will keep control of the middle east peace process this limitation was due to the fact " that the quartet itself wants to keep the political task of shaping the middle east peace process in its own hands , " steinmeier said .
the minister did n't express any doubts about blair 's qualification for the post .
but at the same time , he did n't explicitly praise blair either . according to media reports , there are concerns in berlin that blair could seize the diplomatic process in the middle east and therefore harm the quartet 's work .
other eu member states fear that blair could weaken the position of eu foreign policy chief javier solana , who has been working on solutions to the arab-israeli conflict for years . " solana is a member of the quartet while blair will be working for the quartet , " steinmeier said .
" the difference is clear . " russia held back un spokeswoman michele montas said on wednesday that blair would " mobilize international assistance to the palestinians , working closely with donors and existing coordination bodies . "
his tasks included helping to identify and secure " appropriate international support in addressing the institutional governance needs of the palestinian state , " she said . blair 's work would be " in support of the agreed quartet objectives , " montas said . a small team of experts based in jerusalem will support blair , who will spend significant time in the region , montas added . russia had previously stalled blair 's appointment .
according to german officials , russia had held back its support because of the lack of consultation on the move .
only on tuesday did moscow give its assent . allies support blair 's appointment although he is well respected in israel , the arab world has sharply criticized blair for britain 's role in the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq , as well as his support of israel 's war in lebanon last summer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana is a key architect of the roadmap for peace in the middle east but blair won backing from his allies for his new role . " tony will help palestinians develop the political and economic institutions they will need for a democratic , sovereign state able to provide for its people and live in peace and security with israel , " bush said . palestinian president mahmud abbas and israel also expressed their approval .
israeli prime minister ehud olmert " believes that blair can have a favorable impact , in particular by helping the palestinians develop solid governmental structures , " his spokeswoman miri eisin said . but the hamas movement controlling the gaza strip said the appointment " is not acceptable to hamas nor to the palestinians . " the middle east quartet has tried to implement a " roadmap " for israeli-palestinian peace since 2003 .
but the three-stage blueprint that should have led to the creation of a palestinian state living side by side in peace with israel by 2005 has since decayed . the post of quartet representative had been vacant since former world bank chairman james wolfensohn resigned in frustration in may 2006 . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the us says they are key in its war against terrorism but europeans worry the measures erode civil liberties . eu officials said wednesday that the eu and the us had reached a deal following a meeting between franco frattini , the eu justice and home affairs commissioner , michael chertoff , the us secretary for homeland security and wolfgang schäuble , the interior minister of germany which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
" a political agreement in principle was reached , " said roscam abbing , a spokesman for frattini .
data privacy a thorny issue data privacy has been a sticking point between the eu and the us ever since washington intensified anti-terrorism efforts after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks .
following the attacks on new york and washington , the eu and the us signed an agreement under which the eu agreed to grant us authorities access to up to 34 categories of information on passengers on all flights to the us taking off from eu member states .
these included names , addresses , phone numbers and credit card numbers of travelers .
that agreement , which is set to expire on july 31 , had stirred unease among eu lawmakers amid mounting concerns that civil liberties were being eroded in the fight against global terrorism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flying to the us is usually a security hassle for passengers in a letter this month to interior and justice ministers of portugal , which takes over the eu presidency from germany next month , the european data protection supervisor , peter hustinx said eu governments were sacrificing too much of their citizens ' privacy in the fight against terrorism . " i fear that messages such as ' no right to privacy until life and security are guaranteed ' are developing into a mantra suggesting that fundamental rights and freedoms are a luxury that security can not afford , " hustinx wrote . last may , the air travel data deal was annulled by the european court of justice in luxembourg and the two sides reached an interim agreement .
the eu had warned that airlines would be vulnerable to privacy complaints if no replacement deal had been reached before the interim one expired .
though details of the accord reached this week have not been released , german interior minister schäuble told an eu parliamentary briefing in strasbourg that the aim was to reduce the number of stored data on passengers that the us currently receives from 34 to 20 .
it remains unclear what pieces of personal data will be left out from the new us list .
an eu diplomat said under the new arrangement the data would now be kept by the us for 15 years , up from 3 1/2 years in the interim agreement .
the european side also sought to end the us ability to directly access flight booking computers , arguing instead that airlines should send the data .
europeans are the biggest group of travelers to the us .
deal on access to bank data separately , the us and the eu also struck a deal setting conditions for the us treasury department to view records of the international banking network swift in anti-terrorism probes .
european civil liberties group watchdogs had complained that swift , which handles global financial transfers and is based in brussels , violated european privacy laws by allowing the us to secretly consult its records .
washington has argued that the access is essential for its drive to end funding to terror networks .
the us will now only use swift data for counter-terrorism purposes and store it for a maximum of five years , according to the terms of the new deal . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

founder jimmy wales spoke to dw-world about the secret of its success . jimmy wales was born in alabama , usa , in 1966 .
he studied finance and worked as a research director at the chicago stock exchange .
in 2001 he founded wikipedia which is a multilingual , web-based , free content encyclopedia project .
it is written collaboratively by volunteers .
the vast majority of its articles can be edited by anyone with access to the internet .
from 2003 to 2006 , jimmy wales was headed the wikimedia foundation , wikipedia 's non-profit parent organization .
in 2004 , he founded the for-profit internet portal wikia , which is now supposed to carry on his newest project , the search engine wikia search .
jimmy wales lives in florida with his wife and his daughter . dw-world : a famous american magazine has chosen you as one of the 100 people who shape our world .
how does it feel to be a world shaper ?
jimmy wales : i thought that was sort of funny .
i enjoyed it of course , but tyra banks - the supermodel - was also on the list .
so i don ’ t know how meaningful it really is .
but i feel a real sense of responsibility that i am in a position where i can have some influence and i can say something people listen to .
i try not to say very much because of that .
because i want to make sure that what i do say is something that i can really believe in .
equality , unlimited faculty , no hierarchy : is that just the philosophy of wikipedia or is it your philosophy of life in general ?
that is pretty much my philosophy .
a lot of wikipedia reflects things that i believe in very strongly .
sometimes people think if you believe that everyone should participate then you think right and wrong don ‘ t matter and everybody ’ s opinion is as good as everyone else ’ s .
it may seem paradoxical to them , but , no , i think that some people are really not that smart and that they are not that useful .
but leaving open the possibility for participation means that we are able to get a lot of great ideas from lots of different places .
wikipedia owes its success to the community , to all the people who write articles every day without getting paid .
why do they do that for wikipedia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikipedia has 75,000 contributors in over 100 languages .
i think there are two reasons .
one reason is that the charity of our mission is inspiring a lot of people .
but i think that ’ s a fairly limited reason .
the main reason is that it ’ s fun .
the people just enjoy the process , they enjoy meeting other intellectual people , it ’ s a great hobby .
we know that intuitively if we think about people plying football on the weekends .
we don ’ t say : " gee , gosh , you 're going to play football and you don ’ t get paid for that ? ”
that ’ s silly , right ?
obviously people are doing it because they enjoy it and they have fun .
it is a similar thing with wikipedia .
some people earn a lot of money writing but others can do it just for fun .
you seem to do it just for fun too .
because although wikipedia is very successful you are not earning any money because it is a charitable project .
do you sometimes think that you did something wrong ?
i always joke that when i registered wikipedia as a non-profit organization , it was either the dumbest thing or the smartest thing i ever did .
the dumbest for the obvious reason that i get to hang out with billionaires but i don ’ t have any money .
the smartest , though , because i don ‘ t think it could have been nearly as successful as it is and also because i think it will be remembered in the future .
100 or 200 years from now people will point to wikipedia and say : that was a really good thing that did something beneficial for the world .
so that is something i am very proud of .
why wouldn ’ t it have worked out as a commercial organization ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new era of user generated content and social networking is often referred to as web 2.0 i think that for an encyclopedia that is really attempting this very grand ethical mission of sharing knowledge with everyone , being a non-profit organization is really the right approach .
it means that , as a community , we have the luxury of doing things the right way rather than doing things in a way that is dictated by current economic circumstances .
the internet video platform you tube was sold for $ 1.65 billion -lrb- 1.23 billion euros -rrb- .
how much would sell wikipedia for ?
i don ’ t know what it ’ s worth , it ’ s really interesting .
it has very low revenue .
but i guess you could slap ads all over it and make some money .
i think the wikimedia foundation - the owner of wikipedia - could in fact sell it .
nobody ’ s interested in doing that , but certainly if there was an offer of $ 3 billion , i think the foundation would have to seriously think about what could be done for the charitable purposes of the foundation in distributing free knowledge if we outsourced the community or something .
your new project , the search engine wikia search , which will launch at the end of this year , will be commercial .
why did you change your mind ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wales aims to challenge google 's dominance in the search engine market .
for some types of projects - if you think about running hospitals or the red cross - the charitable model works well .
people are willing to donate money , enough to make it last .
but for other things like running a chain of grocery stores , there have never been very successful charities that have done such things .
i think different kinds of work demands different kinds of organization .
there are so many search engines on the internet already .
why does the world actually need another one ?
the search engines we have right now are black boxes and not transparent .
they are not community controlled and the quality is ... well , it 's pretty good but it stagnated the last two or three years .
there are lots of ways in which searches have not improved as much as a lot of us would have liked .
i don ’ t know how to improve search beyond what already exists .
but i do think that a broad community of people and an open scientific dialogue about how to do that can probably make some progress .
anyway it ’ s fun .
i always do the most fun thing .
and what will be the next big thing coming up on the internet ?
i don ’ t know .
i always remind people that five years ago , i was just this guy sitting at home in my pajamas typing on the internet .
and now i get asked deep questions about the future .
the trend i see right now is that we are very much at the beginning of free licensing of culture .
and we are still very much at the beginning of the design of communities for producing good quality work .
so i think that there is still a lot of room in those areas . christine elsaesser interviewed jimmy wales send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the political responsibility will remain as before on the shoulders of the quartet , " she added . on wednesday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier complained of a lack of consultation with members of the quartet before the appointment was made .
germany is the eu 's representative on the panel . washington got its choice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel , right , and french prime minister francois fillon , left , deliver press satatements supporting blair . blair held confidential discussions on the post with washington , which formally recommended him without prior consultation with the other quartet members , press reports said . the united nations announced blair 's appointment just hours after he stepped down as prime minister on wednesday .
the united states had pushed hard for blair - a close friend and ally of president george w. bush - to get the post .
reports said the announcement was apparently delayed because of russian reservations . merkel described blair as a man of great political experience , who could provide an important contribution to finding a solution to the mideast conflict . european media reports said the decision had been made solely between the us and blair behind closed doors .
the quartet was then informed of it later . blair 's power will be limited steinmeier said blair would receive a closely defined mandate .
his work would focus on " institution building in , and political strengthening of , the palestinian authority , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the quartet will keep control of the middle east peace process this limitation was due to the fact " that the quartet itself wants to keep the political task of shaping the middle east peace process in its own hands , " steinmeier said .
the minister did n't express any doubts about blair 's qualification for the post .
but at the same time , he did n't explicitly praise blair either . according to media reports , there are concerns in berlin that blair could seize the diplomatic process in the middle east and therefore harm the quartet 's work .
other eu member states fear that blair could weaken the position of eu foreign policy chief javier solana , who has been working on solutions to the arab-israeli conflict for years . " solana is a member of the quartet while blair will be working for the quartet , " steinmeier said .
" the difference is clear . " russia held back un spokeswoman michele montas said on wednesday that blair would " mobilize international assistance to the palestinians , working closely with donors and existing coordination bodies . "
his tasks included helping to identify and secure " appropriate international support in addressing the institutional governance needs of the palestinian state , " she said . blair 's work would be " in support of the agreed quartet objectives , " montas said . a small team of experts based in jerusalem will support blair , who will spend significant time in the region , montas added . russia had previously stalled blair 's appointment .
according to german officials , russia had held back its support because of the lack of consultation on the move .
only on tuesday did moscow give its assent . allies support blair 's appointment although he is well respected in israel , the arab world has sharply criticized blair for britain 's role in the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq , as well as his support of israel 's war in lebanon last summer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana is a key architect of the roadmap for peace in the middle east but blair won backing from his allies for his new role . " tony will help palestinians develop the political and economic institutions they will need for a democratic , sovereign state able to provide for its people and live in peace and security with israel , " bush said . palestinian president mahmud abbas and israel also expressed their approval .
israeli prime minister ehud olmert " believes that blair can have a favorable impact , in particular by helping the palestinians develop solid governmental structures , " his spokeswoman miri eisin said . but the hamas movement controlling the gaza strip said the appointment " is not acceptable to hamas nor to the palestinians . " the middle east quartet has tried to implement a " roadmap " for israeli-palestinian peace since 2003 .
but the three-stage blueprint that should have led to the creation of a palestinian state living side by side in peace with israel by 2005 has since decayed . the post of quartet representative had been vacant since former world bank chairman james wolfensohn resigned in frustration in may 2006 . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the us says they are key in its war against terrorism but europeans worry the measures erode civil liberties . eu officials said wednesday that the eu and the us had reached a deal following a meeting between franco frattini , the eu justice and home affairs commissioner , michael chertoff , the us secretary for homeland security and wolfgang schäuble , the interior minister of germany which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .

following the attacks on new york and washington , the eu and the us signed an agreement under which the eu agreed to grant us authorities access to up to 34 categories of information on passengers on all flights to the us taking off from eu member states .

it remains unclear what pieces of personal data will be left out from the new us list .
an eu diplomat said under the new arrangement the data would now be kept by the us for 15 years , up from 3 1/2 years in the interim agreement .

the us says they are key in its war against terrorism but europeans worry the measures erode civil liberties . eu officials said wednesday that the eu and the us had reached a deal following a meeting between franco frattini , the eu justice and home affairs commissioner , michael chertoff , the us secretary for homeland security and wolfgang schäuble , the interior minister of germany which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
" a political agreement in principle was reached , " said roscam abbing , a spokesman for frattini .
data privacy a thorny issue data privacy has been a sticking point between the eu and the us ever since washington intensified anti-terrorism efforts after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks .
following the attacks on new york and washington , the eu and the us signed an agreement under which the eu agreed to grant us authorities access to up to 34 categories of information on passengers on all flights to the us taking off from eu member states .
these included names , addresses , phone numbers and credit card numbers of travelers .
that agreement , which is set to expire on july 31 , had stirred unease among eu lawmakers amid mounting concerns that civil liberties were being eroded in the fight against global terrorism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flying to the us is usually a security hassle for passengers in a letter this month to interior and justice ministers of portugal , which takes over the eu presidency from germany next month , the european data protection supervisor , peter hustinx said eu governments were sacrificing too much of their citizens ' privacy in the fight against terrorism . " i fear that messages such as ' no right to privacy until life and security are guaranteed ' are developing into a mantra suggesting that fundamental rights and freedoms are a luxury that security can not afford , " hustinx wrote . last may , the air travel data deal was annulled by the european court of justice in luxembourg and the two sides reached an interim agreement .
the eu had warned that airlines would be vulnerable to privacy complaints if no replacement deal had been reached before the interim one expired .
though details of the accord reached this week have not been released , german interior minister schäuble told an eu parliamentary briefing in strasbourg that the aim was to reduce the number of stored data on passengers that the us currently receives from 34 to 20 .
it remains unclear what pieces of personal data will be left out from the new us list .
an eu diplomat said under the new arrangement the data would now be kept by the us for 15 years , up from 3 1/2 years in the interim agreement .
the european side also sought to end the us ability to directly access flight booking computers , arguing instead that airlines should send the data .
europeans are the biggest group of travelers to the us .

founder jimmy wales spoke to dw-world about the secret of its success . jimmy wales was born in alabama , usa , in 1966 .
he studied finance and worked as a research director at the chicago stock exchange .
in 2001 he founded wikipedia which is a multilingual , web-based , free content encyclopedia project .
it is written collaboratively by volunteers .
the vast majority of its articles can be edited by anyone with access to the internet .
from 2003 to 2006 , jimmy wales was headed the wikimedia foundation , wikipedia 's non-profit parent organization .
in 2004 , he founded the for-profit internet portal wikia , which is now supposed to carry on his newest project , the search engine wikia search .
jimmy wales lives in florida with his wife and his daughter . dw-world : a famous american magazine has chosen you as one of the 100 people who shape our world .
how does it feel to be a world shaper ?
jimmy wales : i thought that was sort of funny .
i enjoyed it of course , but tyra banks - the supermodel - was also on the list .
so i don ’ t know how meaningful it really is .
but i feel a real sense of responsibility that i am in a position where i can have some influence and i can say something people listen to .
i try not to say very much because of that .
because i want to make sure that what i do say is something that i can really believe in .
equality , unlimited faculty , no hierarchy : is that just the philosophy of wikipedia or is it your philosophy of life in general ?
that is pretty much my philosophy .
a lot of wikipedia reflects things that i believe in very strongly .
sometimes people think if you believe that everyone should participate then you think right and wrong don ‘ t matter and everybody ’ s opinion is as good as everyone else ’ s .
it may seem paradoxical to them , but , no , i think that some people are really not that smart and that they are not that useful .
but leaving open the possibility for participation means that we are able to get a lot of great ideas from lots of different places .
wikipedia owes its success to the community , to all the people who write articles every day without getting paid .
why do they do that for wikipedia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikipedia has 75,000 contributors in over 100 languages .
i think there are two reasons .
one reason is that the charity of our mission is inspiring a lot of people .
but i think that ’ s a fairly limited reason .
the main reason is that it ’ s fun .
the people just enjoy the process , they enjoy meeting other intellectual people , it ’ s a great hobby .
we know that intuitively if we think about people plying football on the weekends .
we don ’ t say : " gee , gosh , you 're going to play football and you don ’ t get paid for that ? ”
that ’ s silly , right ?
obviously people are doing it because they enjoy it and they have fun .
it is a similar thing with wikipedia .
some people earn a lot of money writing but others can do it just for fun .
you seem to do it just for fun too .
because although wikipedia is very successful you are not earning any money because it is a charitable project .
do you sometimes think that you did something wrong ?
i always joke that when i registered wikipedia as a non-profit organization , it was either the dumbest thing or the smartest thing i ever did .
the dumbest for the obvious reason that i get to hang out with billionaires but i don ’ t have any money .
the smartest , though , because i don ‘ t think it could have been nearly as successful as it is and also because i think it will be remembered in the future .
100 or 200 years from now people will point to wikipedia and say : that was a really good thing that did something beneficial for the world .
so that is something i am very proud of .
why wouldn ’ t it have worked out as a commercial organization ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new era of user generated content and social networking is often referred to as web 2.0 i think that for an encyclopedia that is really attempting this very grand ethical mission of sharing knowledge with everyone , being a non-profit organization is really the right approach .
it means that , as a community , we have the luxury of doing things the right way rather than doing things in a way that is dictated by current economic circumstances .
the internet video platform you tube was sold for $ 1.65 billion -lrb- 1.23 billion euros -rrb- .
how much would sell wikipedia for ?
i don ’ t know what it ’ s worth , it ’ s really interesting .
it has very low revenue .
but i guess you could slap ads all over it and make some money .
i think the wikimedia foundation - the owner of wikipedia - could in fact sell it .
nobody ’ s interested in doing that , but certainly if there was an offer of $ 3 billion , i think the foundation would have to seriously think about what could be done for the charitable purposes of the foundation in distributing free knowledge if we outsourced the community or something .
your new project , the search engine wikia search , which will launch at the end of this year , will be commercial .
why did you change your mind ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wales aims to challenge google 's dominance in the search engine market .
for some types of projects - if you think about running hospitals or the red cross - the charitable model works well .
people are willing to donate money , enough to make it last .
but for other things like running a chain of grocery stores , there have never been very successful charities that have done such things .
i think different kinds of work demands different kinds of organization .
there are so many search engines on the internet already .
why does the world actually need another one ?
the search engines we have right now are black boxes and not transparent .
they are not community controlled and the quality is ... well , it 's pretty good but it stagnated the last two or three years .
there are lots of ways in which searches have not improved as much as a lot of us would have liked .
i don ’ t know how to improve search beyond what already exists .
but i do think that a broad community of people and an open scientific dialogue about how to do that can probably make some progress .
anyway it ’ s fun .
i always do the most fun thing .
and what will be the next big thing coming up on the internet ?
i don ’ t know .
i always remind people that five years ago , i was just this guy sitting at home in my pajamas typing on the internet .
and now i get asked deep questions about the future .
the trend i see right now is that we are very much at the beginning of free licensing of culture .
and we are still very much at the beginning of the design of communities for producing good quality work .
so i think that there is still a lot of room in those areas . christine elsaesser interviewed jimmy wales send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

analysts had forecast that seasonally adjusted unemployment would drop by 20,000 from may , when the jobless rate stood at 9.2 per cent .
" the driver is the good economic performance , " said alexander koch , an economist at the hypovereinsbank .
he added that employers were now complaining of growing labor shortages in key sectors of the economy .
consumer confidence gaining in strength job vacancies rose by 11.6 percent to 648,096 , thursday 's data showed as chancellor angela merkel 's government considers possible measures which could ease the way for skilled foreign workers to enter the german labor market to fill gaps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers are n't holding back falling unemployment has also helped to shore up consumer confidence in germany where stagnating household spending has been a drag on economic growth in recent years .
german consumer confidence is at a six-month high , a survey released this week showed .
predictions of higher wages in the nation are helping to fuel optimism among the nation 's consumers , the survey said .
the number of unemployed fell by 26,000 in the economically more important western part of the nation , the labor agency said , and by 11,000 in the nation 's former communist east .
growth could exceed 2.8 percent amid signs that the german economy has rebounded unexpectedly strongly from the hefty and unpopular hike in the nation 's value-added tax in january and this year 's us economic slowdown , economists have been revising upwards their 2007 growth forecasts for germany .
many economists now project german economic growth to match or possibly surpass last year 's perky 2.8 percent expansion rate .
but with two major economic sentiment surveys - the zew investor confidence report and the ifo business confidence index - recently pointing down , analysts also say that the nation 's economic expansion could be starting to plateau out .
indeed , germany 's retail traders ' association -lrb- hde -rrb- said on thursday it expected 2007 retail sales to fall in real terms after a difficult start to the year .
pollitically sensitive data in the meantime , thursday 's jobless figures showed the politically-sensitive unadjusted labor market data also fell in june , dropping by 25,000 from may to 3.687 million in june with the unemployment rate edging down 0.3 percentage points to 8.8 percent .
" the demand for workers has increased again , " said federal labor agency chief frank jürgen weise .
the june unadjusted unemployment figures represented a 712,000 decline compared to june 2006 , when the jobless rate stood at 10.5 percent .
this represents an average monthly fall of 60,000 over the last 12 months .
the fall in seasonally unadjusted or headline unemployment was also more than expected by analysts , who had forecast a month-on-month fall in june of about 75,000 .
while the economists see the seasonally adjusted data as pointing to trends in the labor market , the headline data has become more politically significant in germany . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

analysts had forecast that seasonally adjusted unemployment would drop by 20,000 from may , when the jobless rate stood at 9.2 per cent .
" the driver is the good economic performance , " said alexander koch , an economist at the hypovereinsbank .
he added that employers were now complaining of growing labor shortages in key sectors of the economy .
consumer confidence gaining in strength job vacancies rose by 11.6 percent to 648,096 , thursday 's data showed as chancellor angela merkel 's government considers possible measures which could ease the way for skilled foreign workers to enter the german labor market to fill gaps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers are n't holding back falling unemployment has also helped to shore up consumer confidence in germany where stagnating household spending has been a drag on economic growth in recent years .
german consumer confidence is at a six-month high , a survey released this week showed .
predictions of higher wages in the nation are helping to fuel optimism among the nation 's consumers , the survey said .
the number of unemployed fell by 26,000 in the economically more important western part of the nation , the labor agency said , and by 11,000 in the nation 's former communist east .
growth could exceed 2.8 percent amid signs that the german economy has rebounded unexpectedly strongly from the hefty and unpopular hike in the nation 's value-added tax in january and this year 's us economic slowdown , economists have been revising upwards their 2007 growth forecasts for germany .
many economists now project german economic growth to match or possibly surpass last year 's perky 2.8 percent expansion rate .
but with two major economic sentiment surveys - the zew investor confidence report and the ifo business confidence index - recently pointing down , analysts also say that the nation 's economic expansion could be starting to plateau out .
indeed , germany 's retail traders ' association -lrb- hde -rrb- said on thursday it expected 2007 retail sales to fall in real terms after a difficult start to the year .
pollitically sensitive data in the meantime , thursday 's jobless figures showed the politically-sensitive unadjusted labor market data also fell in june , dropping by 25,000 from may to 3.687 million in june with the unemployment rate edging down 0.3 percentage points to 8.8 percent .
" the demand for workers has increased again , " said federal labor agency chief frank jürgen weise .
the june unadjusted unemployment figures represented a 712,000 decline compared to june 2006 , when the jobless rate stood at 10.5 percent .
this represents an average monthly fall of 60,000 over the last 12 months .
the fall in seasonally unadjusted or headline unemployment was also more than expected by analysts , who had forecast a month-on-month fall in june of about 75,000 .
while the economists see the seasonally adjusted data as pointing to trends in the labor market , the headline data has become more politically significant in germany . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the political responsibility will remain as before on the shoulders of the quartet , " she added . on wednesday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier complained of a lack of consultation with members of the quartet before the appointment was made .
germany is the eu 's representative on the panel . washington got its choice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel , right , and french prime minister francois fillon , left , deliver press satatements supporting blair . blair held confidential discussions on the post with washington , which formally recommended him without prior consultation with the other quartet members , press reports said . the united nations announced blair 's appointment just hours after he stepped down as prime minister on wednesday .
the united states had pushed hard for blair - a close friend and ally of president george w. bush - to get the post .
reports said the announcement was apparently delayed because of russian reservations . merkel described blair as a man of great political experience , who could provide an important contribution to finding a solution to the mideast conflict . european media reports said the decision had been made solely between the us and blair behind closed doors .
the quartet was then informed of it later . blair 's power will be limited steinmeier said blair would receive a closely defined mandate .
his work would focus on " institution building in , and political strengthening of , the palestinian authority , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the quartet will keep control of the middle east peace process this limitation was due to the fact " that the quartet itself wants to keep the political task of shaping the middle east peace process in its own hands , " steinmeier said .
the minister did n't express any doubts about blair 's qualification for the post .
but at the same time , he did n't explicitly praise blair either . according to media reports , there are concerns in berlin that blair could seize the diplomatic process in the middle east and therefore harm the quartet 's work .
other eu member states fear that blair could weaken the position of eu foreign policy chief javier solana , who has been working on solutions to the arab-israeli conflict for years . " solana is a member of the quartet while blair will be working for the quartet , " steinmeier said .
" the difference is clear . " russia held back un spokeswoman michele montas said on wednesday that blair would " mobilize international assistance to the palestinians , working closely with donors and existing coordination bodies . "
his tasks included helping to identify and secure " appropriate international support in addressing the institutional governance needs of the palestinian state , " she said . blair 's work would be " in support of the agreed quartet objectives , " montas said . a small team of experts based in jerusalem will support blair , who will spend significant time in the region , montas added . russia had previously stalled blair 's appointment .
according to german officials , russia had held back its support because of the lack of consultation on the move .
only on tuesday did moscow give its assent . allies support blair 's appointment although he is well respected in israel , the arab world has sharply criticized blair for britain 's role in the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq , as well as his support of israel 's war in lebanon last summer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana is a key architect of the roadmap for peace in the middle east but blair won backing from his allies for his new role . " tony will help palestinians develop the political and economic institutions they will need for a democratic , sovereign state able to provide for its people and live in peace and security with israel , " bush said . palestinian president mahmud abbas and israel also expressed their approval .
israeli prime minister ehud olmert " believes that blair can have a favorable impact , in particular by helping the palestinians develop solid governmental structures , " his spokeswoman miri eisin said . but the hamas movement controlling the gaza strip said the appointment " is not acceptable to hamas nor to the palestinians . " the middle east quartet has tried to implement a " roadmap " for israeli-palestinian peace since 2003 .
but the three-stage blueprint that should have led to the creation of a palestinian state living side by side in peace with israel by 2005 has since decayed . the post of quartet representative had been vacant since former world bank chairman james wolfensohn resigned in frustration in may 2006 . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

founder jimmy wales spoke to dw-world about the secret of its success . jimmy wales was born in alabama , usa , in 1966 .
he studied finance and worked as a research director at the chicago stock exchange .
in 2001 he founded wikipedia which is a multilingual , web-based , free content encyclopedia project .
it is written collaboratively by volunteers .
the vast majority of its articles can be edited by anyone with access to the internet .
from 2003 to 2006 , jimmy wales was headed the wikimedia foundation , wikipedia 's non-profit parent organization .
in 2004 , he founded the for-profit internet portal wikia , which is now supposed to carry on his newest project , the search engine wikia search .
jimmy wales lives in florida with his wife and his daughter . dw-world : a famous american magazine has chosen you as one of the 100 people who shape our world .
how does it feel to be a world shaper ?
jimmy wales : i thought that was sort of funny .
i enjoyed it of course , but tyra banks - the supermodel - was also on the list .
so i don ’ t know how meaningful it really is .
but i feel a real sense of responsibility that i am in a position where i can have some influence and i can say something people listen to .
i try not to say very much because of that .
because i want to make sure that what i do say is something that i can really believe in .
equality , unlimited faculty , no hierarchy : is that just the philosophy of wikipedia or is it your philosophy of life in general ?
that is pretty much my philosophy .
a lot of wikipedia reflects things that i believe in very strongly .
sometimes people think if you believe that everyone should participate then you think right and wrong don ‘ t matter and everybody ’ s opinion is as good as everyone else ’ s .
it may seem paradoxical to them , but , no , i think that some people are really not that smart and that they are not that useful .
but leaving open the possibility for participation means that we are able to get a lot of great ideas from lots of different places .
wikipedia owes its success to the community , to all the people who write articles every day without getting paid .
why do they do that for wikipedia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikipedia has 75,000 contributors in over 100 languages .
i think there are two reasons .
one reason is that the charity of our mission is inspiring a lot of people .
but i think that ’ s a fairly limited reason .
the main reason is that it ’ s fun .
the people just enjoy the process , they enjoy meeting other intellectual people , it ’ s a great hobby .
we know that intuitively if we think about people plying football on the weekends .
we don ’ t say : " gee , gosh , you 're going to play football and you don ’ t get paid for that ? ”
that ’ s silly , right ?
obviously people are doing it because they enjoy it and they have fun .
it is a similar thing with wikipedia .
some people earn a lot of money writing but others can do it just for fun .
you seem to do it just for fun too .
because although wikipedia is very successful you are not earning any money because it is a charitable project .
do you sometimes think that you did something wrong ?
i always joke that when i registered wikipedia as a non-profit organization , it was either the dumbest thing or the smartest thing i ever did .
the dumbest for the obvious reason that i get to hang out with billionaires but i don ’ t have any money .
the smartest , though , because i don ‘ t think it could have been nearly as successful as it is and also because i think it will be remembered in the future .
100 or 200 years from now people will point to wikipedia and say : that was a really good thing that did something beneficial for the world .
so that is something i am very proud of .
why wouldn ’ t it have worked out as a commercial organization ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new era of user generated content and social networking is often referred to as web 2.0 i think that for an encyclopedia that is really attempting this very grand ethical mission of sharing knowledge with everyone , being a non-profit organization is really the right approach .
it means that , as a community , we have the luxury of doing things the right way rather than doing things in a way that is dictated by current economic circumstances .
the internet video platform you tube was sold for $ 1.65 billion -lrb- 1.23 billion euros -rrb- .
how much would sell wikipedia for ?
i don ’ t know what it ’ s worth , it ’ s really interesting .
it has very low revenue .
but i guess you could slap ads all over it and make some money .
i think the wikimedia foundation - the owner of wikipedia - could in fact sell it .
nobody ’ s interested in doing that , but certainly if there was an offer of $ 3 billion , i think the foundation would have to seriously think about what could be done for the charitable purposes of the foundation in distributing free knowledge if we outsourced the community or something .
your new project , the search engine wikia search , which will launch at the end of this year , will be commercial .
why did you change your mind ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wales aims to challenge google 's dominance in the search engine market .
for some types of projects - if you think about running hospitals or the red cross - the charitable model works well .
people are willing to donate money , enough to make it last .
but for other things like running a chain of grocery stores , there have never been very successful charities that have done such things .
i think different kinds of work demands different kinds of organization .
there are so many search engines on the internet already .
why does the world actually need another one ?
the search engines we have right now are black boxes and not transparent .
they are not community controlled and the quality is ... well , it 's pretty good but it stagnated the last two or three years .
there are lots of ways in which searches have not improved as much as a lot of us would have liked .
i don ’ t know how to improve search beyond what already exists .
but i do think that a broad community of people and an open scientific dialogue about how to do that can probably make some progress .
anyway it ’ s fun .
i always do the most fun thing .
and what will be the next big thing coming up on the internet ?
i don ’ t know .
i always remind people that five years ago , i was just this guy sitting at home in my pajamas typing on the internet .
and now i get asked deep questions about the future .
the trend i see right now is that we are very much at the beginning of free licensing of culture .
and we are still very much at the beginning of the design of communities for producing good quality work .
so i think that there is still a lot of room in those areas . christine elsaesser interviewed jimmy wales send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

brown also appointed the youngest foreign secretary in 30 years - rising star david miliband .
analysts regard the move to put 41-year-old miliband , a reported critic of the iraq war , in charge of external affairs as an attempt to signal a shift of tone in foreign policy .
" the opportunities and challenges of the modern world require , in my view , a diplomacy that is patient as well as purposeful , which listens as well as leads , " miliband said .
change on iraq bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's new foreign secretary is dubbed the boy wonder because of his youthful looks and his brains blair 's approach to the iraq war has proved extremely unpopular amongst british voters and brown clearly recognizes the need for a change .
miliband 's predecessor margaret beckett was dropped from the cabinet in the reshuffle .
britain has been reducing troop numbers in iraq and now has about 5,500 in the south of the country .
while brown has pledged to stick to britain 's commitments in iraq , there is speculation the withdrawal may speed up .
miliband , whose brother ed is also a member of the new brown government as cabinet office minister , was elected to parliament for the first time in 2001 and has held two cabinet posts since 2005 .
douglas alexander , a loyal brown supporter , was promoted to the department of international development , a key plank of brown 's foreign agenda .

brown 's campaign manager jack straw becomes justice minister .

hilary benn , formerly at international development , becomes environment secretary .
james purnell , a work and pensions minister , was promoted to secretary of state for culture , media and sport .
des browne remains in his post at defense .

analysts had forecast that seasonally adjusted unemployment would drop by 20,000 from may , when the jobless rate stood at 9.2 per cent .
" the driver is the good economic performance , " said alexander koch , an economist at the hypovereinsbank .
he added that employers were now complaining of growing labor shortages in key sectors of the economy .
consumer confidence gaining in strength job vacancies rose by 11.6 percent to 648,096 , thursday 's data showed as chancellor angela merkel 's government considers possible measures which could ease the way for skilled foreign workers to enter the german labor market to fill gaps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers are n't holding back falling unemployment has also helped to shore up consumer confidence in germany where stagnating household spending has been a drag on economic growth in recent years .
german consumer confidence is at a six-month high , a survey released this week showed .
predictions of higher wages in the nation are helping to fuel optimism among the nation 's consumers , the survey said .
the number of unemployed fell by 26,000 in the economically more important western part of the nation , the labor agency said , and by 11,000 in the nation 's former communist east .
growth could exceed 2.8 percent amid signs that the german economy has rebounded unexpectedly strongly from the hefty and unpopular hike in the nation 's value-added tax in january and this year 's us economic slowdown , economists have been revising upwards their 2007 growth forecasts for germany .
many economists now project german economic growth to match or possibly surpass last year 's perky 2.8 percent expansion rate .
but with two major economic sentiment surveys - the zew investor confidence report and the ifo business confidence index - recently pointing down , analysts also say that the nation 's economic expansion could be starting to plateau out .
indeed , germany 's retail traders ' association -lrb- hde -rrb- said on thursday it expected 2007 retail sales to fall in real terms after a difficult start to the year .
pollitically sensitive data in the meantime , thursday 's jobless figures showed the politically-sensitive unadjusted labor market data also fell in june , dropping by 25,000 from may to 3.687 million in june with the unemployment rate edging down 0.3 percentage points to 8.8 percent .
" the demand for workers has increased again , " said federal labor agency chief frank jürgen weise .
the june unadjusted unemployment figures represented a 712,000 decline compared to june 2006 , when the jobless rate stood at 10.5 percent .
this represents an average monthly fall of 60,000 over the last 12 months .
the fall in seasonally unadjusted or headline unemployment was also more than expected by analysts , who had forecast a month-on-month fall in june of about 75,000 .
while the economists see the seasonally adjusted data as pointing to trends in the labor market , the headline data has become more politically significant in germany . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

analysts had forecast that seasonally adjusted unemployment would drop by 20,000 from may , when the jobless rate stood at 9.2 per cent .
" the driver is the good economic performance , " said alexander koch , an economist at the hypovereinsbank .
he added that employers were now complaining of growing labor shortages in key sectors of the economy .
consumer confidence gaining in strength job vacancies rose by 11.6 percent to 648,096 , thursday 's data showed as chancellor angela merkel 's government considers possible measures which could ease the way for skilled foreign workers to enter the german labor market to fill gaps .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers are n't holding back falling unemployment has also helped to shore up consumer confidence in germany where stagnating household spending has been a drag on economic growth in recent years .
german consumer confidence is at a six-month high , a survey released this week showed .
predictions of higher wages in the nation are helping to fuel optimism among the nation 's consumers , the survey said .
the number of unemployed fell by 26,000 in the economically more important western part of the nation , the labor agency said , and by 11,000 in the nation 's former communist east .
growth could exceed 2.8 percent amid signs that the german economy has rebounded unexpectedly strongly from the hefty and unpopular hike in the nation 's value-added tax in january and this year 's us economic slowdown , economists have been revising upwards their 2007 growth forecasts for germany .
many economists now project german economic growth to match or possibly surpass last year 's perky 2.8 percent expansion rate .
but with two major economic sentiment surveys - the zew investor confidence report and the ifo business confidence index - recently pointing down , analysts also say that the nation 's economic expansion could be starting to plateau out .
indeed , germany 's retail traders ' association -lrb- hde -rrb- said on thursday it expected 2007 retail sales to fall in real terms after a difficult start to the year .
pollitically sensitive data in the meantime , thursday 's jobless figures showed the politically-sensitive unadjusted labor market data also fell in june , dropping by 25,000 from may to 3.687 million in june with the unemployment rate edging down 0.3 percentage points to 8.8 percent .
" the demand for workers has increased again , " said federal labor agency chief frank jürgen weise .
the june unadjusted unemployment figures represented a 712,000 decline compared to june 2006 , when the jobless rate stood at 10.5 percent .
this represents an average monthly fall of 60,000 over the last 12 months .
the fall in seasonally unadjusted or headline unemployment was also more than expected by analysts , who had forecast a month-on-month fall in june of about 75,000 .
while the economists see the seasonally adjusted data as pointing to trends in the labor market , the headline data has become more politically significant in germany . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

founder jimmy wales spoke to dw-world about the secret of its success . jimmy wales was born in alabama , usa , in 1966 .
he studied finance and worked as a research director at the chicago stock exchange .
in 2001 he founded wikipedia which is a multilingual , web-based , free content encyclopedia project .
it is written collaboratively by volunteers .
the vast majority of its articles can be edited by anyone with access to the internet .
from 2003 to 2006 , jimmy wales was headed the wikimedia foundation , wikipedia 's non-profit parent organization .
in 2004 , he founded the for-profit internet portal wikia , which is now supposed to carry on his newest project , the search engine wikia search .
jimmy wales lives in florida with his wife and his daughter . dw-world : a famous american magazine has chosen you as one of the 100 people who shape our world .
how does it feel to be a world shaper ?
jimmy wales : i thought that was sort of funny .
i enjoyed it of course , but tyra banks - the supermodel - was also on the list .
so i don ’ t know how meaningful it really is .
but i feel a real sense of responsibility that i am in a position where i can have some influence and i can say something people listen to .
i try not to say very much because of that .
because i want to make sure that what i do say is something that i can really believe in .
equality , unlimited faculty , no hierarchy : is that just the philosophy of wikipedia or is it your philosophy of life in general ?
that is pretty much my philosophy .
a lot of wikipedia reflects things that i believe in very strongly .
sometimes people think if you believe that everyone should participate then you think right and wrong don ‘ t matter and everybody ’ s opinion is as good as everyone else ’ s .
it may seem paradoxical to them , but , no , i think that some people are really not that smart and that they are not that useful .
but leaving open the possibility for participation means that we are able to get a lot of great ideas from lots of different places .
wikipedia owes its success to the community , to all the people who write articles every day without getting paid .
why do they do that for wikipedia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikipedia has 75,000 contributors in over 100 languages .
i think there are two reasons .
one reason is that the charity of our mission is inspiring a lot of people .
but i think that ’ s a fairly limited reason .
the main reason is that it ’ s fun .
the people just enjoy the process , they enjoy meeting other intellectual people , it ’ s a great hobby .
we know that intuitively if we think about people plying football on the weekends .
we don ’ t say : " gee , gosh , you 're going to play football and you don ’ t get paid for that ? ”
that ’ s silly , right ?
obviously people are doing it because they enjoy it and they have fun .
it is a similar thing with wikipedia .
some people earn a lot of money writing but others can do it just for fun .
you seem to do it just for fun too .
because although wikipedia is very successful you are not earning any money because it is a charitable project .
do you sometimes think that you did something wrong ?
i always joke that when i registered wikipedia as a non-profit organization , it was either the dumbest thing or the smartest thing i ever did .
the dumbest for the obvious reason that i get to hang out with billionaires but i don ’ t have any money .
the smartest , though , because i don ‘ t think it could have been nearly as successful as it is and also because i think it will be remembered in the future .
100 or 200 years from now people will point to wikipedia and say : that was a really good thing that did something beneficial for the world .
so that is something i am very proud of .
why wouldn ’ t it have worked out as a commercial organization ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new era of user generated content and social networking is often referred to as web 2.0 i think that for an encyclopedia that is really attempting this very grand ethical mission of sharing knowledge with everyone , being a non-profit organization is really the right approach .
it means that , as a community , we have the luxury of doing things the right way rather than doing things in a way that is dictated by current economic circumstances .
the internet video platform you tube was sold for $ 1.65 billion -lrb- 1.23 billion euros -rrb- .
how much would sell wikipedia for ?
i don ’ t know what it ’ s worth , it ’ s really interesting .
it has very low revenue .
but i guess you could slap ads all over it and make some money .
i think the wikimedia foundation - the owner of wikipedia - could in fact sell it .
nobody ’ s interested in doing that , but certainly if there was an offer of $ 3 billion , i think the foundation would have to seriously think about what could be done for the charitable purposes of the foundation in distributing free knowledge if we outsourced the community or something .
your new project , the search engine wikia search , which will launch at the end of this year , will be commercial .
why did you change your mind ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wales aims to challenge google 's dominance in the search engine market .
for some types of projects - if you think about running hospitals or the red cross - the charitable model works well .
people are willing to donate money , enough to make it last .
but for other things like running a chain of grocery stores , there have never been very successful charities that have done such things .
i think different kinds of work demands different kinds of organization .
there are so many search engines on the internet already .
why does the world actually need another one ?
the search engines we have right now are black boxes and not transparent .
they are not community controlled and the quality is ... well , it 's pretty good but it stagnated the last two or three years .
there are lots of ways in which searches have not improved as much as a lot of us would have liked .
i don ’ t know how to improve search beyond what already exists .
but i do think that a broad community of people and an open scientific dialogue about how to do that can probably make some progress .
anyway it ’ s fun .
i always do the most fun thing .
and what will be the next big thing coming up on the internet ?
i don ’ t know .
i always remind people that five years ago , i was just this guy sitting at home in my pajamas typing on the internet .
and now i get asked deep questions about the future .
the trend i see right now is that we are very much at the beginning of free licensing of culture .
and we are still very much at the beginning of the design of communities for producing good quality work .
so i think that there is still a lot of room in those areas . christine elsaesser interviewed jimmy wales send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the political responsibility will remain as before on the shoulders of the quartet , " she added . on wednesday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier complained of a lack of consultation with members of the quartet before the appointment was made .
germany is the eu 's representative on the panel . washington got its choice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel , right , and french prime minister francois fillon , left , deliver press satatements supporting blair . blair held confidential discussions on the post with washington , which formally recommended him without prior consultation with the other quartet members , press reports said . the united nations announced blair 's appointment just hours after he stepped down as prime minister on wednesday .
the united states had pushed hard for blair - a close friend and ally of president george w. bush - to get the post .
reports said the announcement was apparently delayed because of russian reservations . merkel described blair as a man of great political experience , who could provide an important contribution to finding a solution to the mideast conflict . european media reports said the decision had been made solely between the us and blair behind closed doors .
the quartet was then informed of it later . blair 's power will be limited steinmeier said blair would receive a closely defined mandate .
his work would focus on " institution building in , and political strengthening of , the palestinian authority , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the quartet will keep control of the middle east peace process this limitation was due to the fact " that the quartet itself wants to keep the political task of shaping the middle east peace process in its own hands , " steinmeier said .
the minister did n't express any doubts about blair 's qualification for the post .
but at the same time , he did n't explicitly praise blair either . according to media reports , there are concerns in berlin that blair could seize the diplomatic process in the middle east and therefore harm the quartet 's work .
other eu member states fear that blair could weaken the position of eu foreign policy chief javier solana , who has been working on solutions to the arab-israeli conflict for years . " solana is a member of the quartet while blair will be working for the quartet , " steinmeier said .
" the difference is clear . " russia held back un spokeswoman michele montas said on wednesday that blair would " mobilize international assistance to the palestinians , working closely with donors and existing coordination bodies . "
his tasks included helping to identify and secure " appropriate international support in addressing the institutional governance needs of the palestinian state , " she said . blair 's work would be " in support of the agreed quartet objectives , " montas said . a small team of experts based in jerusalem will support blair , who will spend significant time in the region , montas added . russia had previously stalled blair 's appointment .
according to german officials , russia had held back its support because of the lack of consultation on the move .
only on tuesday did moscow give its assent . allies support blair 's appointment although he is well respected in israel , the arab world has sharply criticized blair for britain 's role in the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq , as well as his support of israel 's war in lebanon last summer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana is a key architect of the roadmap for peace in the middle east but blair won backing from his allies for his new role . " tony will help palestinians develop the political and economic institutions they will need for a democratic , sovereign state able to provide for its people and live in peace and security with israel , " bush said . palestinian president mahmud abbas and israel also expressed their approval .
israeli prime minister ehud olmert " believes that blair can have a favorable impact , in particular by helping the palestinians develop solid governmental structures , " his spokeswoman miri eisin said . but the hamas movement controlling the gaza strip said the appointment " is not acceptable to hamas nor to the palestinians . " the middle east quartet has tried to implement a " roadmap " for israeli-palestinian peace since 2003 .
but the three-stage blueprint that should have led to the creation of a palestinian state living side by side in peace with israel by 2005 has since decayed . the post of quartet representative had been vacant since former world bank chairman james wolfensohn resigned in frustration in may 2006 . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the political responsibility will remain as before on the shoulders of the quartet , " she added . on wednesday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier complained of a lack of consultation with members of the quartet before the appointment was made .
germany is the eu 's representative on the panel . washington got its choice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel , right , and french prime minister francois fillon , left , deliver press satatements supporting blair . blair held confidential discussions on the post with washington , which formally recommended him without prior consultation with the other quartet members , press reports said . the united nations announced blair 's appointment just hours after he stepped down as prime minister on wednesday .
the united states had pushed hard for blair - a close friend and ally of president george w. bush - to get the post .
reports said the announcement was apparently delayed because of russian reservations . merkel described blair as a man of great political experience , who could provide an important contribution to finding a solution to the mideast conflict . european media reports said the decision had been made solely between the us and blair behind closed doors .
the quartet was then informed of it later . blair 's power will be limited steinmeier said blair would receive a closely defined mandate .
his work would focus on " institution building in , and political strengthening of , the palestinian authority , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the quartet will keep control of the middle east peace process this limitation was due to the fact " that the quartet itself wants to keep the political task of shaping the middle east peace process in its own hands , " steinmeier said .
the minister did n't express any doubts about blair 's qualification for the post .
but at the same time , he did n't explicitly praise blair either . according to media reports , there are concerns in berlin that blair could seize the diplomatic process in the middle east and therefore harm the quartet 's work .
other eu member states fear that blair could weaken the position of eu foreign policy chief javier solana , who has been working on solutions to the arab-israeli conflict for years . " solana is a member of the quartet while blair will be working for the quartet , " steinmeier said .
" the difference is clear . " russia held back un spokeswoman michele montas said on wednesday that blair would " mobilize international assistance to the palestinians , working closely with donors and existing coordination bodies . "
his tasks included helping to identify and secure " appropriate international support in addressing the institutional governance needs of the palestinian state , " she said . blair 's work would be " in support of the agreed quartet objectives , " montas said . a small team of experts based in jerusalem will support blair , who will spend significant time in the region , montas added . russia had previously stalled blair 's appointment .
according to german officials , russia had held back its support because of the lack of consultation on the move .
only on tuesday did moscow give its assent . allies support blair 's appointment although he is well respected in israel , the arab world has sharply criticized blair for britain 's role in the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq , as well as his support of israel 's war in lebanon last summer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana is a key architect of the roadmap for peace in the middle east but blair won backing from his allies for his new role . " tony will help palestinians develop the political and economic institutions they will need for a democratic , sovereign state able to provide for its people and live in peace and security with israel , " bush said . palestinian president mahmud abbas and israel also expressed their approval .
israeli prime minister ehud olmert " believes that blair can have a favorable impact , in particular by helping the palestinians develop solid governmental structures , " his spokeswoman miri eisin said . but the hamas movement controlling the gaza strip said the appointment " is not acceptable to hamas nor to the palestinians . " the middle east quartet has tried to implement a " roadmap " for israeli-palestinian peace since 2003 .
but the three-stage blueprint that should have led to the creation of a palestinian state living side by side in peace with israel by 2005 has since decayed . the post of quartet representative had been vacant since former world bank chairman james wolfensohn resigned in frustration in may 2006 . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" anybody who tries to weigh up the dead of the second world war against votes in the -lrb- eu -rrb- council has to be rejected out of hand , " martin schulz , leader of the socialist group in the european parliament , told fellow lawmakers in brussels on wednesday to loud applause .
" the eu is an idea aimed at eliminating the specters of the past ...
we will not permit the few to bring up those specters , " he added .
schulz was referring to kacyznski 's remarks that poland deserved more voting power in the eu because its population would have been far larger if it had not been decimated during the nazi era .
the prime minister compounded matters on tuesday when he compared modern-day germany to the era that brought adolf hitler to power .
" not representative " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bilateral relations have been strained since the kaczynski twins came to power marek siwiec , a polish member of the european parliament said that kaczynski 's comments and the polish blocking tactics at the eu summit did not represent the views of the polish people .
he praised germany for avoiding any kind of " demonstration of power " in its role as holder of the eu presidency vis-a-vis poland and other eu states and praised german chancellor angela merkel 's pleasant " new leadership style . "
poland eventually won concessions at the summit , notably a delay to the introduction of the new voting system which it opposed , but faced criticism for its negotiating manner .
the german chancellor continues to seek to play down the dispute with poland .
" for us our polish neighbor has the same importance as our french neighbor , " she said in a speech on wednesday in brussels .
she has not commented on a controversial caricature of her that appeared on the front cover of the conservative polish magazine wprost on monday .
entitled the " stepmother of europe , " the photomontage depicted the german chancellor breast-feeding the kaczynski twins .
outrage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this controversial caricature has also provoked a storm of outrage a number of german politicians expressed outrage on tuesday about the caricature that accompanied an article written by mariusz muszynski , the polish foreign minister 's commissioner for german-polish relations .
but eckart von klaeden , the foreign policy spokesman for the conservative cdu / csu bloc , has also called for the matter to be approached in a more relaxed manner .
he told the hannoversche allgemeine zeitung that press freedom also protected things that people might regard as stupid or tasteless .
von klaeden also referred to a caricature that appeared in germany 's taz newspaper a year ago that compared the polish president as " poland 's new potato . "
at that time berlin responded to protests from warsaw by referring to the freedom of the press .
" exactly the same standards should apply with regards to the cover of a polish magazine , " he said .
von klaeden also expressed optimism that the tensions between germany and poland would soon settle .
" once all the momentary fuss has subsided , it will be possible to clearly see the success of the summit in brussels , " he said . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the us says they are key in its war against terrorism but europeans worry the measures erode civil liberties . eu officials said wednesday that the eu and the us had reached a deal following a meeting between franco frattini , the eu justice and home affairs commissioner , michael chertoff , the us secretary for homeland security and wolfgang schäuble , the interior minister of germany which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .

data privacy a thorny issue data privacy has been a sticking point between the eu and the us ever since washington intensified anti-terrorism efforts after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks .
following the attacks on new york and washington , the eu and the us signed an agreement under which the eu agreed to grant us authorities access to up to 34 categories of information on passengers on all flights to the us taking off from eu member states .
these included names , addresses , phone numbers and credit card numbers of travelers .
that agreement , which is set to expire on july 31 , had stirred unease among eu lawmakers amid mounting concerns that civil liberties were being eroded in the fight against global terrorism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flying to the us is usually a security hassle for passengers in a letter this month to interior and justice ministers of portugal , which takes over the eu presidency from germany next month , the european data protection supervisor , peter hustinx said eu governments were sacrificing too much of their citizens ' privacy in the fight against terrorism .

the eu had warned that airlines would be vulnerable to privacy complaints if no replacement deal had been reached before the interim one expired .
though details of the accord reached this week have not been released , german interior minister schäuble told an eu parliamentary briefing in strasbourg that the aim was to reduce the number of stored data on passengers that the us currently receives from 34 to 20 .
it remains unclear what pieces of personal data will be left out from the new us list .
an eu diplomat said under the new arrangement the data would now be kept by the us for 15 years , up from 3 1/2 years in the interim agreement .
the european side also sought to end the us ability to directly access flight booking computers , arguing instead that airlines should send the data .
europeans are the biggest group of travelers to the us .

european civil liberties group watchdogs had complained that swift , which handles global financial transfers and is based in brussels , violated european privacy laws by allowing the us to secretly consult its records .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the future of the internet is now dw-world : germans hesitant to look for love online dw-world : " the synapses of a collective brain are growing " dw-world : the internet and everyday life : the constant revolution dw-world : the future is now internet -pipe- 28.06.2007 wikipedia founder : " great ideas come from different places " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikipedia founder jimmi wales its critics said it would n't last but the online encyclopaedia wikipedia has gone on to become one of the world 's most popular websites .
founder jimmy wales spoke to dw-world about the secret of its success . jimmy wales was born in alabama , usa , in 1966 .
he studied finance and worked as a research director at the chicago stock exchange .
in 2001 he founded wikipedia which is a multilingual , web-based , free content encyclopedia project .
it is written collaboratively by volunteers .
the vast majority of its articles can be edited by anyone with access to the internet .
from 2003 to 2006 , jimmy wales was headed the wikimedia foundation , wikipedia 's non-profit parent organization .
in 2004 , he founded the for-profit internet portal wikia , which is now supposed to carry on his newest project , the search engine wikia search .
jimmy wales lives in florida with his wife and his daughter . dw-world : a famous american magazine has chosen you as one of the 100 people who shape our world .
how does it feel to be a world shaper ?
jimmy wales : i thought that was sort of funny .
i enjoyed it of course , but tyra banks - the supermodel - was also on the list .
so i don ’ t know how meaningful it really is .
but i feel a real sense of responsibility that i am in a position where i can have some influence and i can say something people listen to .
i try not to say very much because of that .
because i want to make sure that what i do say is something that i can really believe in .
equality , unlimited faculty , no hierarchy : is that just the philosophy of wikipedia or is it your philosophy of life in general ?
that is pretty much my philosophy .
a lot of wikipedia reflects things that i believe in very strongly .
sometimes people think if you believe that everyone should participate then you think right and wrong don ‘ t matter and everybody ’ s opinion is as good as everyone else ’ s .
it may seem paradoxical to them , but , no , i think that some people are really not that smart and that they are not that useful .
but leaving open the possibility for participation means that we are able to get a lot of great ideas from lots of different places .
wikipedia owes its success to the community , to all the people who write articles every day without getting paid .
why do they do that for wikipedia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikipedia has 75,000 contributors in over 100 languages .
i think there are two reasons .
one reason is that the charity of our mission is inspiring a lot of people .
but i think that ’ s a fairly limited reason .
the main reason is that it ’ s fun .
the people just enjoy the process , they enjoy meeting other intellectual people , it ’ s a great hobby .
we know that intuitively if we think about people plying football on the weekends .
we don ’ t say : " gee , gosh , you 're going to play football and you don ’ t get paid for that ? ”
that ’ s silly , right ?
obviously people are doing it because they enjoy it and they have fun .
it is a similar thing with wikipedia .
some people earn a lot of money writing but others can do it just for fun .
you seem to do it just for fun too .
because although wikipedia is very successful you are not earning any money because it is a charitable project .
do you sometimes think that you did something wrong ?
i always joke that when i registered wikipedia as a non-profit organization , it was either the dumbest thing or the smartest thing i ever did .
the dumbest for the obvious reason that i get to hang out with billionaires but i don ’ t have any money .
the smartest , though , because i don ‘ t think it could have been nearly as successful as it is and also because i think it will be remembered in the future .
100 or 200 years from now people will point to wikipedia and say : that was a really good thing that did something beneficial for the world .
so that is something i am very proud of .
why wouldn ’ t it have worked out as a commercial organization ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new era of user generated content and social networking is often referred to as web 2.0 i think that for an encyclopedia that is really attempting this very grand ethical mission of sharing knowledge with everyone , being a non-profit organization is really the right approach .
it means that , as a community , we have the luxury of doing things the right way rather than doing things in a way that is dictated by current economic circumstances .
the internet video platform you tube was sold for $ 1.65 billion -lrb- 1.23 billion euros -rrb- .
how much would sell wikipedia for ?
i don ’ t know what it ’ s worth , it ’ s really interesting .
it has very low revenue .
but i guess you could slap ads all over it and make some money .
i think the wikimedia foundation - the owner of wikipedia - could in fact sell it .
nobody ’ s interested in doing that , but certainly if there was an offer of $ 3 billion , i think the foundation would have to seriously think about what could be done for the charitable purposes of the foundation in distributing free knowledge if we outsourced the community or something .
your new project , the search engine wikia search , which will launch at the end of this year , will be commercial .
why did you change your mind ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wales aims to challenge google 's dominance in the search engine market .
for some types of projects - if you think about running hospitals or the red cross - the charitable model works well .
people are willing to donate money , enough to make it last .
but for other things like running a chain of grocery stores , there have never been very successful charities that have done such things .
i think different kinds of work demands different kinds of organization .
there are so many search engines on the internet already .
why does the world actually need another one ?
the search engines we have right now are black boxes and not transparent .
they are not community controlled and the quality is ... well , it 's pretty good but it stagnated the last two or three years .
there are lots of ways in which searches have not improved as much as a lot of us would have liked .
i don ’ t know how to improve search beyond what already exists .
but i do think that a broad community of people and an open scientific dialogue about how to do that can probably make some progress .
anyway it ’ s fun .
i always do the most fun thing .
and what will be the next big thing coming up on the internet ?
i don ’ t know .
i always remind people that five years ago , i was just this guy sitting at home in my pajamas typing on the internet .
and now i get asked deep questions about the future .
the trend i see right now is that we are very much at the beginning of free licensing of culture .
and we are still very much at the beginning of the design of communities for producing good quality work .
so i think that there is still a lot of room in those areas . christine elsaesser interviewed jimmy wales send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de architecture -pipe- 28.06.2007 british architect unveils new plans to revamp berlin museums großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chipperfield 's reworked design has also met with some scepticism british architect david chipperfield has unveiled his revised plans for a structure intended to link all five major musuems in berlin 's museum island complex , but not everyone is happy . chipperfield has abandoned his earlier glass and bronze design that provoked a storm of protests in 2001 from conservationists , architectural experts and many berliners .
these plans , which won the second competition staged to find a design for the building , were attacked for being insensitive and even dubbed a " toilet block " by one critic .
the winner of the first competition giorgio grassi had also seen his design blocked - an occurrence not unusual in a country where passions about architecture run high .
" half-hearted " bildunterschrift : only time will tell if chipperfield 's new plans get implemented the new blueprint echoes elements of the existing ensemble with an open staircase and colonnades .
but a number of german newspapers have criticized the revamped architecture .
the süddeutsche zeitung praised some aspects of the design , but described it essentially as being " half-hearted " and " undecided , " while the berliner morgenpost also said it did not form a " convincing whole . "
chipperfield 's building will complete the renovation of the museum island in the spree river , a large museum complex which was damaged in world war ii and and fell into neglect during the communist era .
final touch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bust of the egyptian queen nefertiti is the most famous exhibit in the complex the new building will be called the james simon gallery after a jewish patron of the arts , and will be attached to the pergamon museum , one of berlin 's biggest tourist attractions .
the architect said it would cost about 73 million euros -lrb- $ 98 million -rrb- and be completed in 2012 .
he said the gallery would blend in with the architectural design of the museums and house a conference center and shops .
the architect is also overseeing renovations at the pergamon to restore the facade to its pre-war glory and modernize the museum 's interior .

the value of the planned purchase has not been disclosed , but there have been reports that ews could be sold for as much as £ 250m -lrb- 371m euros -rrb- .
ews said more details of the tie-up would be revealed at a press conference in frankfurt on thursday .
a merger would allow deutsche bahn to expand its european freight business .
the volume of goods carried by rail in the uk has grown by 60 % in the past 11 years .
growth drive " the announcement will mark the conclusion of talks between deutsche bahn and ews about developing a stronger european rail freight network , " ews said in a statement .
" the acquisition will help deutsche bahn and ews increase the amount of rail freight hauled in britain and mainland europe , " the firm added .
ews said it also expected that deutsche bahn will announce on thursday the purchase of a stake in spain 's transfesa , a spanish road and rail logistics provider specialising in transporting cars .
the state-owned german rail giant 's drive for international growth comes as the final details of its partial privatisation are hammered out with the government .
ews , which is based in doncaster and employs 5,000 people , took over british rail 's rail freight business in 1996 .
it controls two-thirds of the cargo sent by train in the uk and has an annual turnover of £ 500m .
it operates more than 1,000 freight trains a day across britain and into continental europe through the channel tunnel , recently expanding into france with a rail freight company called euro cargo rail .
earlier this year , drivers of the firm 's class 66 locomotive , which form the backbone of its fleet , threatened to boycott the trains over " unsafe and unhealthy " condition .

since 1998 , the homeward route of the orange parade has been blocked by the security forces , following a determination by the parades commission .
the parade has been marked by serious violence in the past , but it has passed off peacefully in the last three years .
' keep church open ' mr pickering said he had viewed drumcree as " a cameo of northern ireland 's difficulties and divisions " .
" i was able to tell from an early stage that this was going to come to a head - these things always come to a head , " he told the bbc news website .
" that 's what really happened here in 1995 - it was the visible manifestation of the divisions over many years . "
in 1999 , the minister decided to keep the church doors open to the orangemen despite a church of ireland motion decreeing the doors should be closed .
parades at drumcree have been peaceful for the past three years he said the political progress achieved with the restoration of devolution augured well for drumcree .
" how can you have what is happening at the assembly , and have the situation at drumcree - the two do not go together . "
however , he said he believed there could have been a peaceful resolution to the dispute .
" it is something that should not have happened at all , but the way difficulties and divisions were going , there was going to be some sort of visible manifestation - but it should not have turned out to be violent .
" violence only holds up resolution . "
mr pickering , who is 66 , said he had decided to retire from the church of ireland parish after his wife olive died at easter last year .
" we were a team in the parish for 22 years and i will miss her an awful lot , " he said .

a " rampant housing market " and a lack of affordable and suitable housing were key factors in homelessness , a report by the charity has found .
it wants the assembly government to build 3,500 affordable homes a year by 2011 to clear the " backlog of need " .
housing minister andrew davies said he was committed to spending £ 450m over four years on affordable homes .
but according to the charity , building homes is not enough in itself , and people who want to get onto the first rung of the property ladder should also be helped .
among the recommendations of the report were for the welsh assembly government to increase public investment in affordable housing , and to find new ways to bring in more private funding .

the year-long investigation into homelessness and poor housing in wales took its eight-strong panel to six locations in wales , where more than 160 people , including the homeless and those living in poor conditions , gave evidence .
shelter cymru 's director john puzey , said the early indications were that the new assembly government was making housing a national priority .
" it is our job to make sure it stays there , " he said .
there are electrical , heating and damp issues in mr white 's home the shelter cymru report comes less than a week after two housing bodies warned of a 40,000 shortage of affordable homes in wales .
the home builders federation and the chartered institute of housing cymru said fewer new homes were being built in wales than at any time since world war ii .
mr davies said affordable housing was one of the assembly government 's most important priorities .
" we are working with the uk government , we are working with local authorities and the private voluntary sector to address this issue , " he said .

police discovered the device in 2005 and suspected jamie fawcett of trying to listen in on conversations between kidman 's security guards .
mr fawcett said he felt that as a paparazzi photographer he had been unfairly targeted .
he had once been subject to a restraining order brought by kidman .
speaking outside court on thursday , mr fawcett said : " it was a very narrow investigation that once again targeted the photographers at a scene and i felt that was perhaps unfair . "
he added : " i am often asked about the feud between miss kidman and myself .
in fact , i do n't have any opinion whatsoever about miss kidman , other than to wish her all the best . "
out-of-court settlement the new south wales state department of public prosecutions -lrb- dpp -rrb- gave no reasons in court for withdrawing the charges .
kidman 's australian agent , wendy day , said the actress had no comment to make on the case because she had not been involved with it .
" it has nothing to do with nicole , " she said .
" that was something to do between the dpp and jamie fawcett . "
in 2005 , kidman won a temporary restraining order against mr fawcett and another paparazzi photographer , ben mcdonald , who she said made her feel like a prisoner in her own home .
the parties eventually came to an out-of-court agreement that the photographers would stay 500 metres away from her property , but could take pictures of her elsewhere .

bbc news -pipe- middle east -pipe- an uphill task for blair ?

by paul reynolds world affairs correspondent , bbc news website tony blair faces a real struggle to make progress in his new and startling role as a middle east envoy .
he faces a struggle because the issues are so intractable .
the appointment is startling because his decision to join the american invasion of iraq and to support israel in its war against hezbollah last summer pits great swathes of arab opinion against him .
he is seen in israel as a " friend " .
this gives him credibility with the israeli government , without which nothing can be done .
he has the ear of mr bush .
that will carry weight in a region where power often outbids everything else .
but it could also be a drawback if he is seen as being too close to mr bush .
his proven skills as a negotiator over northern ireland give him a track record of success by any reckoning .
the question of hamas one major issue is whether he will seek to engage with hamas , which controls gaza after its violent takeover .
hamas has been excluded from talks because it does not recognise israel and has not committed itself to non-violence and existing agreements .
a hamas spokesman said that " the experience of our people with blair was bad . "
his main point of contact with the palestinians will be president mahmoud abbas and the new government formed without hamas , which won the elections last year .
palestinians of the abbas grouping welcome the appointment .
the veteran palestinian negotiator saeb erekat said : " president abbas welcomes the nomination of mr blair as envoy of the quartet ... -lrb- and -rrb- has given the assurance that he will work with -lrb- him -rrb- to arrive at a peaceful solution on the basis of two states . "
the israeli prime minister ehud olmert 's office said that mr olmert " believes that mr blair can have a favourable impact , in particular by helping the palestinians develop solid governmental structures . "
mr blair himself might see in this task the chance of balancing the criticism he has suffered over the invasion of iraq with praise for trying to tackle this confrontation .
the quartet mr blair will report to the so-called quartet - the us , the un , the eu and russia , whose 2003 road map to peace has been overtaken by events .
russia was not hugely enthusiastic at this appointment but is going along with it .
his mandate is , initially at least , to concentrate on helping the palestinians , but it includes the right to " liaise with other countries ... in support of the agreed quartet objectives " .
these include an overall settlement .
during his last appearance in parliament , he spoke in ambitious terms about his hopes .
" the only way of bringing stability and peace to the middle east is the two-state solution , which means a state of israel that is secure and confident of its security , and a palestinian state that is not merely viable in terms of its territory , but in terms of its institutions and governance , " he said .
' rarefied atmosphere ' it is not hard to find sceptics about this appointment .
" i am flabbergasted , " said rosemary hollis of the think-tank chatham house in london , who is writing a book about mr blair and the middle east . "
there might be an element of giving him the job simply because he wants it so badly but beyond that , the game plan , if there is one , might be to try to out-manoeuvre hamas and build up president abbas " rosemary hollis chatham house " it beggars belief on so many levels .

by paul reynolds world affairs correspondent , bbc news website mr blair : seeking a two-state solution tony blair faces a real struggle to make progress in his new and startling role as a middle east envoy .
he faces a struggle because the issues are so intractable .
the appointment is startling because his decision to join the american invasion of iraq and to support israel in its war against hezbollah last summer pits great swathes of arab opinion against him .
he is seen in israel as a " friend " .
this gives him credibility with the israeli government , without which nothing can be done .
he has the ear of mr bush .
that will carry weight in a region where power often outbids everything else .
but it could also be a drawback if he is seen as being too close to mr bush .
his proven skills as a negotiator over northern ireland give him a track record of success by any reckoning .
the question of hamas one major issue is whether he will seek to engage with hamas , which controls gaza after its violent takeover .
hamas has been excluded from talks because it does not recognise israel and has not committed itself to non-violence and existing agreements .
a hamas spokesman said that " the experience of our people with blair was bad . "
his main point of contact with the palestinians will be president mahmoud abbas and the new government formed without hamas , which won the elections last year .

by paul reynolds world affairs correspondent , bbc news website mr blair : seeking a two-state solution tony blair faces a real struggle to make progress in his new and startling role as a middle east envoy .
he faces a struggle because the issues are so intractable .
the appointment is startling because his decision to join the american invasion of iraq and to support israel in its war against hezbollah last summer pits great swathes of arab opinion against him .
he is seen in israel as a " friend " .
this gives him credibility with the israeli government , without which nothing can be done .
he has the ear of mr bush .
that will carry weight in a region where power often outbids everything else .
but it could also be a drawback if he is seen as being too close to mr bush .
his proven skills as a negotiator over northern ireland give him a track record of success by any reckoning .
the question of hamas one major issue is whether he will seek to engage with hamas , which controls gaza after its violent takeover .
hamas has been excluded from talks because it does not recognise israel and has not committed itself to non-violence and existing agreements .
a hamas spokesman said that " the experience of our people with blair was bad . "
his main point of contact with the palestinians will be president mahmoud abbas and the new government formed without hamas , which won the elections last year .
palestinians of the abbas grouping welcome the appointment .
the veteran palestinian negotiator saeb erekat said : " president abbas welcomes the nomination of mr blair as envoy of the quartet ... -lrb- and -rrb- has given the assurance that he will work with -lrb- him -rrb- to arrive at a peaceful solution on the basis of two states . "
the israeli prime minister ehud olmert 's office said that mr olmert " believes that mr blair can have a favourable impact , in particular by helping the palestinians develop solid governmental structures . "
mr blair himself might see in this task the chance of balancing the criticism he has suffered over the invasion of iraq with praise for trying to tackle this confrontation .
the quartet mr blair will report to the so-called quartet - the us , the un , the eu and russia , whose 2003 road map to peace has been overtaken by events .
russia was not hugely enthusiastic at this appointment but is going along with it .
his mandate is , initially at least , to concentrate on helping the palestinians , but it includes the right to " liaise with other countries ... in support of the agreed quartet objectives " .
these include an overall settlement .
during his last appearance in parliament , he spoke in ambitious terms about his hopes .
" the only way of bringing stability and peace to the middle east is the two-state solution , which means a state of israel that is secure and confident of its security , and a palestinian state that is not merely viable in terms of its territory , but in terms of its institutions and governance , " he said .
' rarefied atmosphere ' it is not hard to find sceptics about this appointment .
" i am flabbergasted , " said rosemary hollis of the think-tank chatham house in london , who is writing a book about mr blair and the middle east .
there might be an element of giving him the job simply because he wants it so badly but beyond that , the game plan , if there is one , might be to try to out-manoeuvre hamas and build up president abbas rosemary hollis chatham house " it beggars belief on so many levels .
it shows how the people behind this live in a rarefied atmosphere and have no concept of what is happening on the ground .
" it is not just the question of iraq .
there is a whole combination of factors .
he had little enough influence as prime minister .
how can he have more now ?
hamas says its experience of mr blair was " bad " " there might be an element of giving him the job simply because he wants it so badly but beyond that , the game plan , if there is one , might be to try to out-manoeuvre hamas and build up president abbas . "
mixed record the history of middle east envoys and campaigners is a chequered one .
the great negotiator henry kissinger invented the concept of shuttle diplomacy when he calmed the region down after the 1973 war .
president carter was also successful and his efforts culminated in the camp david accords between egypt and israel in 1978 .
others have not been so fortunate .
president clinton thought he came close , also at camp david , in 2000 with yasser arafat and ehud barak , but his efforts fizzled out .

by paul reynolds world affairs correspondent , bbc news website mr blair : seeking a two-state solution tony blair faces a real struggle to make progress in his new and startling role as a middle east envoy .
he faces a struggle because the issues are so intractable .
the appointment is startling because his decision to join the american invasion of iraq and to support israel in its war against hezbollah last summer pits great swathes of arab opinion against him .
he is seen in israel as a " friend " .
this gives him credibility with the israeli government , without which nothing can be done .
he has the ear of mr bush .
that will carry weight in a region where power often outbids everything else .
but it could also be a drawback if he is seen as being too close to mr bush .
his proven skills as a negotiator over northern ireland give him a track record of success by any reckoning .
the question of hamas one major issue is whether he will seek to engage with hamas , which controls gaza after its violent takeover .
hamas has been excluded from talks because it does not recognise israel and has not committed itself to non-violence and existing agreements .
a hamas spokesman said that " the experience of our people with blair was bad . "
his main point of contact with the palestinians will be president mahmoud abbas and the new government formed without hamas , which won the elections last year .
palestinians of the abbas grouping welcome the appointment .
the veteran palestinian negotiator saeb erekat said : " president abbas welcomes the nomination of mr blair as envoy of the quartet ... -lrb- and -rrb- has given the assurance that he will work with -lrb- him -rrb- to arrive at a peaceful solution on the basis of two states . "
the israeli prime minister ehud olmert 's office said that mr olmert " believes that mr blair can have a favourable impact , in particular by helping the palestinians develop solid governmental structures . "
mr blair himself might see in this task the chance of balancing the criticism he has suffered over the invasion of iraq with praise for trying to tackle this confrontation .
the quartet mr blair will report to the so-called quartet - the us , the un , the eu and russia , whose 2003 road map to peace has been overtaken by events .
russia was not hugely enthusiastic at this appointment but is going along with it .
his mandate is , initially at least , to concentrate on helping the palestinians , but it includes the right to " liaise with other countries ... in support of the agreed quartet objectives " .
these include an overall settlement .
during his last appearance in parliament , he spoke in ambitious terms about his hopes .
" the only way of bringing stability and peace to the middle east is the two-state solution , which means a state of israel that is secure and confident of its security , and a palestinian state that is not merely viable in terms of its territory , but in terms of its institutions and governance , " he said .
' rarefied atmosphere ' it is not hard to find sceptics about this appointment .
" i am flabbergasted , " said rosemary hollis of the think-tank chatham house in london , who is writing a book about mr blair and the middle east .
there might be an element of giving him the job simply because he wants it so badly but beyond that , the game plan , if there is one , might be to try to out-manoeuvre hamas and build up president abbas rosemary hollis chatham house " it beggars belief on so many levels .
it shows how the people behind this live in a rarefied atmosphere and have no concept of what is happening on the ground .
" it is not just the question of iraq .
there is a whole combination of factors .
he had little enough influence as prime minister .
how can he have more now ?
hamas says its experience of mr blair was " bad " " there might be an element of giving him the job simply because he wants it so badly but beyond that , the game plan , if there is one , might be to try to out-manoeuvre hamas and build up president abbas . "
mixed record the history of middle east envoys and campaigners is a chequered one .
the great negotiator henry kissinger invented the concept of shuttle diplomacy when he calmed the region down after the 1973 war .
president carter was also successful and his efforts culminated in the camp david accords between egypt and israel in 1978 .
others have not been so fortunate .
president clinton thought he came close , also at camp david , in 2000 with yasser arafat and ehud barak , but his efforts fizzled out .
more recently , the peruvian diplomat alvaro de soto ended his time as the un 's own middle east envoy -lrb- a post that , like that of the eu middle east envoy , few people know exists -rrb- with a bitter and disappointed final report dismissing the quartet as irrelevant and castigating the united states for bowing to israeli pressure .
mr blair will not want to suffer the fate of the previous quartet representative , the former head of the world bank james wolfensohn , who left in frustration in 2006 after only a year .

the most common complaint from teens was about private information being shared rather than direct threats .
girls were more likely than boys to be targets and teens who share their identities online are the most vulnerable , the survey found .
but teenagers still think that the majority of bullying happens offline .
social networks some 32 % of teenagers questioned had experienced one of more of the following : having a private e-mail , im or text messaging forwarded or posted where others could see it , the victim of an aggressive email , im or text message , having a rumour spread about them online or having an embarrassing photograph posted online without permission .
as more and more young people join social networking sites such as myspace and facebook , so they are opening themselves and their personal information up to more people .
the survey found that 39 % of social network users had been cyber-bullied in some way , compared to 22 % of online teens who do not use social networks .
the sites themselves offer new avenues for bullies , the survey found .
one 16-year-old girl said : " there 's this boy in my anatomy class who everybody hates and some girl started up this i hate -lsb- name -rsb- myspace thing .
so everybody in school goes on it to say bad things about this boy . "
sites such as myspace and bebo employ security and safety officers to trawl the site for inappropriate content .
" e-thugs " the survey attempted to find out why teenagers go online to bully .
" bullying has entered the digital age .
the impulses behind it are the same , but the effect is magnified .
in the past , the materials of bullying would have been whispered , shouted or passed around .
" now , with a few clicks , a photo , video or a conversation can be shared with hundreds via e-mail or millions through a website , online profile or blog posting , " concluded report author amanda lenhart .
some teens felt that the insulating nature of the web was distancing bullies from their actions .
" people think they are a million times stronger because they can hide behind their computer monitor , " one teenage boy said in his response to why teens bully online .
describing those indulging in cyber-bullying as " e-thugs " he followed old-fashioned advice to avoid getting involved .
" basically i just ignored the person and went along with my own civilised business . "
government guidelines .
in the uk , schools such as helston community school in cornwall , have experienced cyber-bullying first-hand .
it fought a battle to have offensive comments about pupils and a teacher removed from uk social networking site bebo .
bebo said that it froze accounts that were used inappropriately but the school felt it did n't act quickly enough and banned the site from school computers .
last year the uk government issued guidelines to help parents and pupils deal with the issue of cyber-bullying after the anti-bullying alliance found that one in five uk schoolchildren had been the victim of some form of online and mobile abuse .
its recommended that schools included cyber-bullying in their anti-bullying policies and undertook regular monitoring of communication technology used in schools .
it advised youngsters not to give out personal contact details or post photographs of themselves online .

lieutenant general romeo tolentino said yasser igasan was chosen to head the militants at a meeting of commanders two or three weeks ago .
however , other military figures say they are still trying to confirm the appointment .
abu sayyaf is the smallest of four muslim rebel groups in the philippines , with about 400 members .
it is blamed for kidnappings and bombings , including an attack on a ferry in 2004 that killed more than 100 people .
rebel hideouts lt gen tolentino said mr igasan was among the group 's founders .
he is thought to have studied in the middle east in the mid-1990s .
a senior police officer told the reuters news agency that mr isagan lacked military training , and could become the group 's spiritual leader , while a more experienced commander could take over the military side .
the us has listed abu sayyaf as a terrorist organisation and says it has links to al-qaeda .
former leader khadaffy janjalani and senior figure abu sulaiman , were killed by philippine troops in september and january .
the philippine authorities have been trying to flush abu sayyaf rebels from hideouts in jolo , backed by us military surveillance and other non-combat assistance .
' dirty war ' meanwhile , human rights watch has accused the philippine military of carrying out the extra-judicial killing of hundreds of left-wing activists and journalists in recent years .
the report by the us-based group described the military action as a " dirty war " and called on the philippine authorities to take responsibility for their failure to prosecute anyone for the killings .
