she will make her case at an upcoming eu summit . in the run-up to her first summit as president of the european union , the german chancellor told munich-based daily süddeutsche zeitung on sunday that european leaders " are going to ratify an action plan for climate protection and energy policy that is more concrete than ever before in the history of the european union . " but central proposals of the action plan are bound to cause contentious debate at the summit on thursday and friday .
the plan includes a commitment to supply 20 percent of europe 's energy needs from renewable sources such as wind power , a leading industry in germany . after an early round of informal talks in brussels on monday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier admitted that " the obligation of the 20 percent goal will still need to be negotiated at the summit . "
france and finland , for example , have signalled their reluctance to accept the binding goal for fear that it could jeopardize their national energy mix . chancellor merkel also plans to push for a europe-wide reduction of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , the man-made greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming .
the proposed plan would require the european states to reduce their overall co2-output by 20 percent below 1990-levels .
the 27 eu member states have agreed in principle to set this goal for 2020 , but will have to ratify the plan at the summit in order for it to become binding . member states have already agreed on a 10 percent increase of bio-fuels - such as ethanol gained from corn crops - over the next three years , assuming sufficient amounts of bio-fuel can be produced to meet the demand . europe becoming global role model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bio-fuels and modern engines significantly reduce the amount of co2 emissions from vehicles germany has assumed a lead role in pushing the environmental envelope and has already achieved a near-20 percent national reduction of co2 emissions below the levels of 1990 .
if the eu action plan is ratified , germany could reduce its overall co2 output by as much as 40 percent .
but not all member states will be held up to this high standard ; lower goals will be set for economically weaker eu countries . the action plan would also propel europe to the forefront of the global movement to mitigate the effects of global warming .
chancellor merkel spoke of a " paradigm shift " in sunday 's interview with the german daily : " so far , european nations made their own energy policy , " but " all that is now up for negotiation . " the german presidency of this year 's g8 summit will also allow merkel to talk to developing nations about alternative energy policies .
referring to the g8 summit , which will take place in june in the northern german resort town of heiligendamm , merkel specifically mentioned china , india , mexico , brazil and south africa . indeed , china appeared to hop on the green bandwagon prematurely on monday , as chinese premier wen jiabao vowed in his annual state of the nation address to curb " inefficient " economic growth and " excessive energy consumption . " merkel also told the süddeutsche zeitung that a rethinking of environmental policies was taking place in the united states .
she described " remarkable " progress there in the development of bio-fuels , but also said governments needed to " set the proper parameters " for the agricultural shifts this technology will likely bring about .
" once they identify a problem , " merkel said of the americans , " they develop a strong ambition to solve it .

" i hope our film contributes to young and old people talking to each other about the worst chapter of german history , " said actress maria furtwängler , who plays the countess lena . director kai wessel , however , said he did not think attention would focus so closely on where guilt lays or vengeance , adding that he had only wanted to create a personal film that stayed true to the victims ' perspective . bildunterschrift : just over 13 percent of germans are estimated to have seen the series ' first installment german suffering long a taboo topic germans have long shied away from discussing their 14 million countrymen who fled the soviet army or were expelled after the allies allowed their eviction from poland , hungary and czechoslovakia .
historians estimate that some 2 million people died or were killed in the flight that began when the fall of the nazi regime became clear in 1944 . culture minister bernd neumann was among the germans lauding the film , which also shows soviet troops shooting children and raping women , as a cinematic achievement that brought the plight of german expellees to light . " no one wants to offset one side 's suffering against the other , " margot kässmann , a german protestant church leader , told the bild am sonntag newspaper as a debate erupted over why germans have long been silent . " but reconciliation will only be possible when those guilty acknowledge their crimes and victims get a chance to tell their stories , " added kässmann , whose family was among the refugees . latest in chain of tv dramas afraid it could be misconstrued as lessening the atrocities committed by the nazis during world war ii , other political leaders have avoided the issue of german suffering .
a similar debate over whether germans could be portrayed as victims ensued last year when " dresden , " a tv series on the firebombing of the eastern german city , earned high ratings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " dresden " centered on the city 's firebombing and an english-german love story " it was a national trauma and 60 years later , it was time to make a film seen from the victims ' point of view , " said jan mojto , a slovak national and head of munich-based eos film , which co-produced the nine-million-euro -lrb- $ 11.7-million -rrb- project . a berlin museum about the expelled germans that opened last year also sparked controversy .
polish leaders said it was an attempt by germans to portray themselves as victims of a war they started . " the problem in our view is not that the issue is being discussed , but how , " marek cichocki , foreign policy adviser to polish president lech kaczynski , told a german tv talk show on sunday .
" it focuses on individuals but blots out the bigger picture .
it 's disturbing that so much emphasis is on individual -lrb- suffering -rrb- , not the broader history . " the welt am sonntag newspaper said the drama was careful not to take sides . " germans are treated as both criminals and victims , " it wrote .
" it does n't pass judgment but rather depicts all the horrors .
that 's a prudent approach because there are no obvious answers .

she will make her case at an upcoming eu summit . in the run-up to her first summit as president of the european union , the german chancellor told munich-based daily süddeutsche zeitung on sunday that european leaders " are going to ratify an action plan for climate protection and energy policy that is more concrete than ever before in the history of the european union . " but central proposals of the action plan are bound to cause contentious debate at the summit on thursday and friday .
the plan includes a commitment to supply 20 percent of europe 's energy needs from renewable sources such as wind power , a leading industry in germany . after an early round of informal talks in brussels on monday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier admitted that " the obligation of the 20 percent goal will still need to be negotiated at the summit . "
france and finland , for example , have signalled their reluctance to accept the binding goal for fear that it could jeopardize their national energy mix . chancellor merkel also plans to push for a europe-wide reduction of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , the man-made greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming .
the proposed plan would require the european states to reduce their overall co2-output by 20 percent below 1990-levels .
the 27 eu member states have agreed in principle to set this goal for 2020 , but will have to ratify the plan at the summit in order for it to become binding . member states have already agreed on a 10 percent increase of bio-fuels - such as ethanol gained from corn crops - over the next three years , assuming sufficient amounts of bio-fuel can be produced to meet the demand . europe becoming global role model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bio-fuels and modern engines significantly reduce the amount of co2 emissions from vehicles germany has assumed a lead role in pushing the environmental envelope and has already achieved a near-20 percent national reduction of co2 emissions below the levels of 1990 .
if the eu action plan is ratified , germany could reduce its overall co2 output by as much as 40 percent .
but not all member states will be held up to this high standard ; lower goals will be set for economically weaker eu countries . the action plan would also propel europe to the forefront of the global movement to mitigate the effects of global warming .
chancellor merkel spoke of a " paradigm shift " in sunday 's interview with the german daily : " so far , european nations made their own energy policy , " but " all that is now up for negotiation . " the german presidency of this year 's g8 summit will also allow merkel to talk to developing nations about alternative energy policies .
referring to the g8 summit , which will take place in june in the northern german resort town of heiligendamm , merkel specifically mentioned china , india , mexico , brazil and south africa . indeed , china appeared to hop on the green bandwagon prematurely on monday , as chinese premier wen jiabao vowed in his annual state of the nation address to curb " inefficient " economic growth and " excessive energy consumption . " merkel also told the süddeutsche zeitung that a rethinking of environmental policies was taking place in the united states .
she described " remarkable " progress there in the development of bio-fuels , but also said governments needed to " set the proper parameters " for the agricultural shifts this technology will likely bring about .

workers wore face masks under their helmets to conceal their identities as an excavator slammed into the so-called " youth house , " a graffiti-sprayed brick building in the noerrebro district of the danish capital . the rioting started on march 1 when police anti-terror squad evicted long-term squatters from the building , triggering three nights of clashes with youth . at least 25 were injured as protesters hurled cobblestones at riot police and set fire to cars and trash bins in copenhagen 's worst riots in 14 years . some 647 people have been arrested - including 140 foreigners , mainly germans and scandinavians suspected of involvement in the disturbances .
another 227 have been taken into custody . countercultural hub sold the center has had a cult reputation in copenhagen since the 1980s when the city 's council gave punks and squatters permission to move in .

it would cost us a fortune to have it fixed . "
she declined to reveal the congregation 's plans for the site . the demolition crews were under police protection as they began the task that authorities hope will end the violent dispute .
however fears that the demolition could spark further protests led police to cordon off the building in advance . tears as the bulldozers go in crowds of young people gathered as demolition work began on the building , which was constructed at the end of the 19th century as a community center . " why , why ? " demanded sarah , a tearful 14-year-old , who had skipped school and came to the scene when she heard " the sad news on the radio . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young couple watch as the demolition gets started " they think the problem will disappear under the threat of the bulldozers .
they are wrong .

she said she was a regular visitor to the center " which offered cultural activities that you ca n't find anywhere else in denmark . " " i am not marginal .
i think that society should leave room for all types , and for alternative culture as well , for which youth house was a symbol , " she added . the politiken newspaper has put the cost of the riots , including smashed windows and torched vehicles and clean-up operations , at $ 2.4 million . dw staff / afp -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german left-wing agitators arrested in copenhagen raids police in copenhagen saturday raided numerous houses and arrested 90 suspects , german left-wing agitators among them , to prevent renewed outbreaks of violence after a third night of unrest in the danish capital .

le pen on the presidential campaign trail for over 30 years , jean-marie le pen has campaigned at the top of french politics .
while labeled an anti-semite and rascist by some , he still commands enough support to add a dark dimension to the presidential election . from the earliest steps on the campaign trail , the french presidential election has been viewed as a two-horse race .
despite the wily incumbent jacques chirac 's mischievous ambiguity over whether he would run again and the emergence of rising centrist francois bayrou , the majority of bets have been split between interior minister nicolas sarkozy of the ruling conservative party or socialist challenger segolene royal taking over at the elysee palace . but in the current campaign , as has been the case in the last four presidential elections , there is a dark horse stalking the main candidates .
while sarkozy 's and royal 's people are busy putting out the fires from gaffes and scandals , a man who is no stranger to controversy in once again making a play for the top job in french politics . jean-marie le pen is back . the national front leader recently launched the fifth presidential election bid of his long career with the hope that he can go one better than in the 2002 campaign when he made it to the second-round run-off .
by becoming the one alternative to chirac in that election , the first in which he made it that far , le pen shocked the french political establishment , sent tremors through europe and ended the political career of socialist prime minister lionel jospin on the way .
it was the fear of seeing le pen in the elysee which drove voters on left and right to re-elect chirac by 82 percent . anti-immigration , nationalist bandwagon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : le pen plays on the fears of urban violence in france now it seems that after five more years of chirac , france has forgotten that fear .
le pen is in the mix again , and while his current campaign is less assured in the preliminary stages as it was in 2002 , the far-right stalwart is beginning to work up a head of steam with a populist manifesto built on promises to end immigration , pull france out of nato and slash taxes for the french only . the fact that le pen is once again contesting the presidency is a testament to his tenacity .
a street fighter in his youth - he lost an eye in one scuffle - and a former paratrooper and foreign legionnaire who saw active service in indochina and algeria , le pen is used to battles . in some ways , he is the epitome of the political survivor .
he is a man who has been convicted several times for remarks about jews or the holocaust , calling the nazi gas chambers " a detail of history " and describing the german occupation of france as " relatively humane . "
he dismissed the attacks on the twin towers on september 11 , 2001 , as an " incident , " and complained before the 1998 world cup that the french soccer team was not white enough .
and yet , despite his behavior and stance , le pen and his national front party still enjoy widespread support . greatest support in years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a third of french people find le pen unacceptable recent poll results published in the french newspaper le monde showed support for le pen at its highest levels in years , even better than in the run-up to the 2002 election where he polled 18.9 per cent , nearly 5.5 million voters .
in 1997 nearly half of french people saw le pen 's ideas as unacceptable ; now only a third think so . that a man with such extremist views can still compete at the top of french politics says much about the continued disillusionment with the political leadership within french society . le pen rose to prominence in the early 1970 's with a populist mix of anti-immigrant , pro-employment , and law-and-order promises .
and in the 30 years or more since he founded the national front , more immigrants have arrived in france , unemployment has become more of a problem and crime and unrest more prominent .
le pen has continually revamped his core policies to play to the fears of what he calls " france 's silent majority , " the grassroots voters who struggle to be heard above the nation 's " technocratic elite . " " le pen has enjoyed a shift in his voter base from urban to rural areas and from the young to elderly , " nonna mayer , an expert on french far-right politics from the research center for political science in paris , told dw-world.de.
" he has succeeded in extending and diversifying his social base .
this is one reason why he remains so relevant even in modern france . " appeal to disgruntled workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french farmers regularly protest against the government just as in the 2002 election , le pen is campaigning on a strong anti-immigration platform , blaming the " invasion " of foreigners for france 's rising unemployment , urban violence and what he calls " general impoverishment . "
he is also relying on the " humble workers " vote as he did five years ago , pandering to the discontent of blue-collar employees and farmers . the state of france 's agricultural sector has given le pen a new , powerful voting pool . " voting for the extreme right is developing in rural areas , " says mayer .
" in 1988 , voters in the large cities were most likely to vote for le pen .
in 1995 , his influence extended to middle-sized conurbations .
in 2002 , he was attracting voters in small towns of less than 2000 inhabitants . " mayer believes that this shows that le pen has maintained his political longevity by pinpointing issues that effect the diverse sections of french society ; urban crime for big city dwellers , loss of french identity through immigration for middle-class citizens , and loss of jobs and threat to industry for the working classes .
how ever distasteful his approach , he is seen by many as being the only candidate to address the issues that matter to them . le pen has also won support throughout his career due to the general disaffection the populace has with its leaders .
before the 2002 vote , 83 percent of voters polled said that " politicians do not care what people like us think " and 58 percent said that french politicians were " somewhat corrupt . " wake-up call bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all those who vote for him want le pen as president " the conditions were ideal for a protest vote in favor of le pen , " mayer said .
" it was a protest vote because although they agree massively with his ideas on immigration and law-and-order , most voters do n't want him to implement them .
only 41 percent of those who voted for le pen in 2002 actually wanted him to be elected . " votes for le pen , it seems , are used as a wake-up call for france to deal with the real problems in the society .
however , the need for him to continue to run shows that these calls are far from being heeded . this year , it is still unclear whether le pen will even make it into the presidential election race .
he is struggling to gain the backing of 500 elected officials needed to register formally by march 16 .

" we count on russia being a reliable partner , " she said in an interview with the daily süddeutsche zeitung on monday .
" i therefore agree in principle to russia getting economically involved in europe .
but good economic relations between russia and the eu can only be based on reciprocity . " equally , we have an interest in acquiring the ownership rights to russian gas fields , " the chancellor said . eads not ready for more investors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the designer of the eurocopter , eads should stay in european hands , merkel said franco-german aerospace venture eads , however , is one company merkel said should not be open to russian investment . " at the moment , we should n't admit another stakeholder into the shareholder pact , " she said .
" but i support closer cooperation in aircraft construction , as eads has already begun to do . " the european aeronautic defense and space company is controlled jointly by france and germany , with the delicate balance of power resting on a complex construction of multiple shareholdings , both public and private . last summer , however , the russian state bought a stake of between 5 percent and 7 percent via state-controlled bank vneshtorgbank -lrb- vtb -rrb- and russia is believed to be eager to gain a greater say in eads . nevertheless , moscow has been keen to calm european concerns on the matter , with president vladimir putin insisting recently that russia wanted " cooperation " with eads , and had no plans for a " hostile takeover . " united response to russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus employees have taken to the street to protest a restructuring program shares in eads dropped by 8.6 percent last week after the announcement that its subsidiary aircraft manufacturer airbus would cut 10,000 jobs over four years , streamline its production facilities and reorganize the distribution of work between factories across europe . merkel also said it was important for the eu to act in a unified manner when dealing with russia , no easy task as eastern european countries often have a different opinion on moscow 's policies than western european nations . poland , for example , delayed talks on an eu-russia energy partnership pact last year because warsaw opposed a trade embargo russia placed on polish meat products . rockets raise additional questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the us missile shield is already being set up in japan tensions in russia were also heightened last month after the us announced plans for a missile defense shield , portions of which would be located in poland and the czech republic .
the two eu member states have expressed their acceptance of the us plans while putin said the shield posed a threat to moscow and could potentially start a new arms race . germany 's merkel backed the american proposal , saying the missile shield was a " purely defensive system " that would not be aimed at russia and an issue that needed to be discussed in talks between russia and nato . " i think it is appropriate to think about how to arm oneself against possible rockets coming from regions we did not really have to have our eye on during the cold war , " merkel said .

-lrb- constitutional regulations , laws against xenophobia etc . -rrb- wippermann : the main difference lies not in the political system , but concerns the people involved .
extremist organizations need strong leaders to be successful .
but le pen , while a charismatic leader in the past , is now too old for anyone to consider him powerful .
however , the german equivalent , gerhard frey , still pales into insignificance beside him .
and that is one reason why it is unlikely that frey would ever be able to reach a similar level .
strong german fascism is inconceivable without a " führer . " that is not to say that there is no danger of this happening in germany again .
while there are laws that prevent the glorification of the third reich and forbid anti-semitism , there is still a burgeoning far-right movement in germany , in particular in the former east german states where there are even " no-go areas " controlled by extremists which present a great risk to foreigners should they enter them .
also , recent research shows that at least 20 percent of germans profess hatred towards foreigners while 40 percent admit to anti-semitic feelings and even more , 64-68 percent holds grudges against roma and gypsies . are there any laws and structures in place in germany to prevent a radical right-wing leader from rising to power ? while there are rules in place which protect the constitution in germany , most have been installed to prevent a repeat of germany 's history but are out-dated when dealing with modern fascism . what are the social differences between france and germany which allow le pen to have such support ? le pen taps into the anti-democratic and napoleonic tradition of fascism in france .
there is the heightened fear of the foreigner , especially arab muslim immigrants who are blamed for all the sins in france , mainly unemployment and crime .
the issue of unemployment for the native citizens is one which is also a hot topic in germany .
turkish immigrants in germany are seen in the very same way as north african immigrants are in france .
but in france , there is a very strong movement for " france for the french , " something which the germans would not allow due to their history of nationalism . le pen is seen as a man of the people who has struggled and felt the pain of the common man in dealing with the hardships which have been brought on france allegedly by the foreigner .
germany has no connection like that with its far-right movement . is it possible that a social change could happen in modern germany where a figure like le pen achieves credibility and support within the electorate ? yes and no .
the germans from today are , according to my appraisals after teaching history for 30 years , better at learning from their fascist past than the french and are better at appraising the present dangers .
however , it can not be said that democracy is anchored in germany more firmly than it is in france .
both france and germany have had to learn the lessons of the past and must look to each other for guidance on dealing with the future . nick amies interviewed wolfgang wippermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel at fault for right-wing rise , opposition says the head of a german opposition political party accused the current government of fuelling right-wing unrest with its policies .

-lrb- constitutional regulations , laws against xenophobia etc . -rrb- wippermann : the main difference lies not in the political system , but concerns the people involved .
extremist organizations need strong leaders to be successful .
but le pen , while a charismatic leader in the past , is now too old for anyone to consider him powerful .
however , the german equivalent , gerhard frey , still pales into insignificance beside him .
and that is one reason why it is unlikely that frey would ever be able to reach a similar level .
strong german fascism is inconceivable without a " führer . " that is not to say that there is no danger of this happening in germany again .
while there are laws that prevent the glorification of the third reich and forbid anti-semitism , there is still a burgeoning far-right movement in germany , in particular in the former east german states where there are even " no-go areas " controlled by extremists which present a great risk to foreigners should they enter them .
also , recent research shows that at least 20 percent of germans profess hatred towards foreigners while 40 percent admit to anti-semitic feelings and even more , 64-68 percent holds grudges against roma and gypsies . are there any laws and structures in place in germany to prevent a radical right-wing leader from rising to power ? while there are rules in place which protect the constitution in germany , most have been installed to prevent a repeat of germany 's history but are out-dated when dealing with modern fascism . what are the social differences between france and germany which allow le pen to have such support ? le pen taps into the anti-democratic and napoleonic tradition of fascism in france .

the issue of unemployment for the native citizens is one which is also a hot topic in germany .
turkish immigrants in germany are seen in the very same way as north african immigrants are in france .
but in france , there is a very strong movement for " france for the french , " something which the germans would not allow due to their history of nationalism . le pen is seen as a man of the people who has struggled and felt the pain of the common man in dealing with the hardships which have been brought on france allegedly by the foreigner .
germany has no connection like that with its far-right movement . is it possible that a social change could happen in modern germany where a figure like le pen achieves credibility and support within the electorate ? yes and no .

le pen on the presidential campaign trail for over 30 years , jean-marie le pen has campaigned at the top of french politics .
while labeled an anti-semite and rascist by some , he still commands enough support to add a dark dimension to the presidential election . from the earliest steps on the campaign trail , the french presidential election has been viewed as a two-horse race .
despite the wily incumbent jacques chirac 's mischievous ambiguity over whether he would run again and the emergence of rising centrist francois bayrou , the majority of bets have been split between interior minister nicolas sarkozy of the ruling conservative party or socialist challenger segolene royal taking over at the elysee palace . but in the current campaign , as has been the case in the last four presidential elections , there is a dark horse stalking the main candidates .
while sarkozy 's and royal 's people are busy putting out the fires from gaffes and scandals , a man who is no stranger to controversy in once again making a play for the top job in french politics . jean-marie le pen is back . the national front leader recently launched the fifth presidential election bid of his long career with the hope that he can go one better than in the 2002 campaign when he made it to the second-round run-off .
by becoming the one alternative to chirac in that election , the first in which he made it that far , le pen shocked the french political establishment , sent tremors through europe and ended the political career of socialist prime minister lionel jospin on the way .
it was the fear of seeing le pen in the elysee which drove voters on left and right to re-elect chirac by 82 percent . anti-immigration , nationalist bandwagon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : le pen plays on the fears of urban violence in france now it seems that after five more years of chirac , france has forgotten that fear .
le pen is in the mix again , and while his current campaign is less assured in the preliminary stages as it was in 2002 , the far-right stalwart is beginning to work up a head of steam with a populist manifesto built on promises to end immigration , pull france out of nato and slash taxes for the french only . the fact that le pen is once again contesting the presidency is a testament to his tenacity .
a street fighter in his youth - he lost an eye in one scuffle - and a former paratrooper and foreign legionnaire who saw active service in indochina and algeria , le pen is used to battles . in some ways , he is the epitome of the political survivor .
he is a man who has been convicted several times for remarks about jews or the holocaust , calling the nazi gas chambers " a detail of history " and describing the german occupation of france as " relatively humane . "
he dismissed the attacks on the twin towers on september 11 , 2001 , as an " incident , " and complained before the 1998 world cup that the french soccer team was not white enough .
and yet , despite his behavior and stance , le pen and his national front party still enjoy widespread support . greatest support in years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a third of french people find le pen unacceptable recent poll results published in the french newspaper le monde showed support for le pen at its highest levels in years , even better than in the run-up to the 2002 election where he polled 18.9 per cent , nearly 5.5 million voters .
in 1997 nearly half of french people saw le pen 's ideas as unacceptable ; now only a third think so . that a man with such extremist views can still compete at the top of french politics says much about the continued disillusionment with the political leadership within french society . le pen rose to prominence in the early 1970 's with a populist mix of anti-immigrant , pro-employment , and law-and-order promises .
and in the 30 years or more since he founded the national front , more immigrants have arrived in france , unemployment has become more of a problem and crime and unrest more prominent .
le pen has continually revamped his core policies to play to the fears of what he calls " france 's silent majority , " the grassroots voters who struggle to be heard above the nation 's " technocratic elite . " " le pen has enjoyed a shift in his voter base from urban to rural areas and from the young to elderly , " nonna mayer , an expert on french far-right politics from the research center for political science in paris , told dw-world.de.
" he has succeeded in extending and diversifying his social base .
this is one reason why he remains so relevant even in modern france . " appeal to disgruntled workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french farmers regularly protest against the government just as in the 2002 election , le pen is campaigning on a strong anti-immigration platform , blaming the " invasion " of foreigners for france 's rising unemployment , urban violence and what he calls " general impoverishment . "
he is also relying on the " humble workers " vote as he did five years ago , pandering to the discontent of blue-collar employees and farmers . the state of france 's agricultural sector has given le pen a new , powerful voting pool . " voting for the extreme right is developing in rural areas , " says mayer .
" in 1988 , voters in the large cities were most likely to vote for le pen .
in 1995 , his influence extended to middle-sized conurbations .
in 2002 , he was attracting voters in small towns of less than 2000 inhabitants . " mayer believes that this shows that le pen has maintained his political longevity by pinpointing issues that effect the diverse sections of french society ; urban crime for big city dwellers , loss of french identity through immigration for middle-class citizens , and loss of jobs and threat to industry for the working classes .
how ever distasteful his approach , he is seen by many as being the only candidate to address the issues that matter to them . le pen has also won support throughout his career due to the general disaffection the populace has with its leaders .
before the 2002 vote , 83 percent of voters polled said that " politicians do not care what people like us think " and 58 percent said that french politicians were " somewhat corrupt . " wake-up call bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all those who vote for him want le pen as president " the conditions were ideal for a protest vote in favor of le pen , " mayer said .
" it was a protest vote because although they agree massively with his ideas on immigration and law-and-order , most voters do n't want him to implement them .
only 41 percent of those who voted for le pen in 2002 actually wanted him to be elected . " votes for le pen , it seems , are used as a wake-up call for france to deal with the real problems in the society .
however , the need for him to continue to run shows that these calls are far from being heeded . this year , it is still unclear whether le pen will even make it into the presidential election race .
he is struggling to gain the backing of 500 elected officials needed to register formally by march 16 .
but if he does make into the first round , no one can rule out that his true supporters , and those registering another protest vote , can push the far-right leader into another run-off for the elysee and cause another european political earthquake . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " strong german fascism is inconceivable without a führer " far-right expert prof. wolfgang wippermann spoke to dw-world.de about jean-marie le pen and the possibility of such a leader and a movement like his national front gaining similar prominence in germany .

le pen on the presidential campaign trail for over 30 years , jean-marie le pen has campaigned at the top of french politics .
while labeled an anti-semite and rascist by some , he still commands enough support to add a dark dimension to the presidential election . from the earliest steps on the campaign trail , the french presidential election has been viewed as a two-horse race .
despite the wily incumbent jacques chirac 's mischievous ambiguity over whether he would run again and the emergence of rising centrist francois bayrou , the majority of bets have been split between interior minister nicolas sarkozy of the ruling conservative party or socialist challenger segolene royal taking over at the elysee palace . but in the current campaign , as has been the case in the last four presidential elections , there is a dark horse stalking the main candidates .
while sarkozy 's and royal 's people are busy putting out the fires from gaffes and scandals , a man who is no stranger to controversy in once again making a play for the top job in french politics . jean-marie le pen is back . the national front leader recently launched the fifth presidential election bid of his long career with the hope that he can go one better than in the 2002 campaign when he made it to the second-round run-off .
by becoming the one alternative to chirac in that election , the first in which he made it that far , le pen shocked the french political establishment , sent tremors through europe and ended the political career of socialist prime minister lionel jospin on the way .
it was the fear of seeing le pen in the elysee which drove voters on left and right to re-elect chirac by 82 percent . anti-immigration , nationalist bandwagon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : le pen plays on the fears of urban violence in france now it seems that after five more years of chirac , france has forgotten that fear .
le pen is in the mix again , and while his current campaign is less assured in the preliminary stages as it was in 2002 , the far-right stalwart is beginning to work up a head of steam with a populist manifesto built on promises to end immigration , pull france out of nato and slash taxes for the french only . the fact that le pen is once again contesting the presidency is a testament to his tenacity .
a street fighter in his youth - he lost an eye in one scuffle - and a former paratrooper and foreign legionnaire who saw active service in indochina and algeria , le pen is used to battles . in some ways , he is the epitome of the political survivor .
he is a man who has been convicted several times for remarks about jews or the holocaust , calling the nazi gas chambers " a detail of history " and describing the german occupation of france as " relatively humane . "
he dismissed the attacks on the twin towers on september 11 , 2001 , as an " incident , " and complained before the 1998 world cup that the french soccer team was not white enough .
and yet , despite his behavior and stance , le pen and his national front party still enjoy widespread support . greatest support in years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a third of french people find le pen unacceptable recent poll results published in the french newspaper le monde showed support for le pen at its highest levels in years , even better than in the run-up to the 2002 election where he polled 18.9 per cent , nearly 5.5 million voters .
in 1997 nearly half of french people saw le pen 's ideas as unacceptable ; now only a third think so . that a man with such extremist views can still compete at the top of french politics says much about the continued disillusionment with the political leadership within french society . le pen rose to prominence in the early 1970 's with a populist mix of anti-immigrant , pro-employment , and law-and-order promises .
and in the 30 years or more since he founded the national front , more immigrants have arrived in france , unemployment has become more of a problem and crime and unrest more prominent .
le pen has continually revamped his core policies to play to the fears of what he calls " france 's silent majority , " the grassroots voters who struggle to be heard above the nation 's " technocratic elite . " " le pen has enjoyed a shift in his voter base from urban to rural areas and from the young to elderly , " nonna mayer , an expert on french far-right politics from the research center for political science in paris , told dw-world.de.
" he has succeeded in extending and diversifying his social base .
this is one reason why he remains so relevant even in modern france . " appeal to disgruntled workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french farmers regularly protest against the government just as in the 2002 election , le pen is campaigning on a strong anti-immigration platform , blaming the " invasion " of foreigners for france 's rising unemployment , urban violence and what he calls " general impoverishment . "
he is also relying on the " humble workers " vote as he did five years ago , pandering to the discontent of blue-collar employees and farmers . the state of france 's agricultural sector has given le pen a new , powerful voting pool . " voting for the extreme right is developing in rural areas , " says mayer .
" in 1988 , voters in the large cities were most likely to vote for le pen .
in 1995 , his influence extended to middle-sized conurbations .
in 2002 , he was attracting voters in small towns of less than 2000 inhabitants . " mayer believes that this shows that le pen has maintained his political longevity by pinpointing issues that effect the diverse sections of french society ; urban crime for big city dwellers , loss of french identity through immigration for middle-class citizens , and loss of jobs and threat to industry for the working classes .
how ever distasteful his approach , he is seen by many as being the only candidate to address the issues that matter to them . le pen has also won support throughout his career due to the general disaffection the populace has with its leaders .
before the 2002 vote , 83 percent of voters polled said that " politicians do not care what people like us think " and 58 percent said that french politicians were " somewhat corrupt . " wake-up call bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all those who vote for him want le pen as president " the conditions were ideal for a protest vote in favor of le pen , " mayer said .
" it was a protest vote because although they agree massively with his ideas on immigration and law-and-order , most voters do n't want him to implement them .
only 41 percent of those who voted for le pen in 2002 actually wanted him to be elected . " votes for le pen , it seems , are used as a wake-up call for france to deal with the real problems in the society .
however , the need for him to continue to run shows that these calls are far from being heeded . this year , it is still unclear whether le pen will even make it into the presidential election race .
he is struggling to gain the backing of 500 elected officials needed to register formally by march 16 .
but if he does make into the first round , no one can rule out that his true supporters , and those registering another protest vote , can push the far-right leader into another run-off for the elysee and cause another european political earthquake . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " strong german fascism is inconceivable without a führer " far-right expert prof. wolfgang wippermann spoke to dw-world.de about jean-marie le pen and the possibility of such a leader and a movement like his national front gaining similar prominence in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 05.03.2007 merkel sets ambitious green agenda ahead of eu summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants the eu in the forefront of climate protection and energy policy german chancellor angela merkel is advocating an eu action plan that would position europe as the global frontrunner for renewable energy and greenhouse gas reductions .
she will make her case at an upcoming eu summit . in the run-up to her first summit as president of the european union , the german chancellor told munich-based daily süddeutsche zeitung on sunday that european leaders " are going to ratify an action plan for climate protection and energy policy that is more concrete than ever before in the history of the european union . " but central proposals of the action plan are bound to cause contentious debate at the summit on thursday and friday .
the plan includes a commitment to supply 20 percent of europe 's energy needs from renewable sources such as wind power , a leading industry in germany . after an early round of informal talks in brussels on monday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier admitted that " the obligation of the 20 percent goal will still need to be negotiated at the summit . "
france and finland , for example , have signalled their reluctance to accept the binding goal for fear that it could jeopardize their national energy mix . chancellor merkel also plans to push for a europe-wide reduction of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , the man-made greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming .
the proposed plan would require the european states to reduce their overall co2-output by 20 percent below 1990-levels .
the 27 eu member states have agreed in principle to set this goal for 2020 , but will have to ratify the plan at the summit in order for it to become binding . member states have already agreed on a 10 percent increase of bio-fuels - such as ethanol gained from corn crops - over the next three years , assuming sufficient amounts of bio-fuel can be produced to meet the demand . europe becoming global role model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bio-fuels and modern engines significantly reduce the amount of co2 emissions from vehicles germany has assumed a lead role in pushing the environmental envelope and has already achieved a near-20 percent national reduction of co2 emissions below the levels of 1990 .
if the eu action plan is ratified , germany could reduce its overall co2 output by as much as 40 percent .
but not all member states will be held up to this high standard ; lower goals will be set for economically weaker eu countries . the action plan would also propel europe to the forefront of the global movement to mitigate the effects of global warming .
chancellor merkel spoke of a " paradigm shift " in sunday 's interview with the german daily : " so far , european nations made their own energy policy , " but " all that is now up for negotiation . " the german presidency of this year 's g8 summit will also allow merkel to talk to developing nations about alternative energy policies .
referring to the g8 summit , which will take place in june in the northern german resort town of heiligendamm , merkel specifically mentioned china , india , mexico , brazil and south africa . indeed , china appeared to hop on the green bandwagon prematurely on monday , as chinese premier wen jiabao vowed in his annual state of the nation address to curb " inefficient " economic growth and " excessive energy consumption . " merkel also told the süddeutsche zeitung that a rethinking of environmental policies was taking place in the united states .
she described " remarkable " progress there in the development of bio-fuels , but also said governments needed to " set the proper parameters " for the agricultural shifts this technology will likely bring about .
" once they identify a problem , " merkel said of the americans , " they develop a strong ambition to solve it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 05.03.2007 " strong german fascism is inconceivable without a führer " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chances of a leader like le pen rising to power is unlikely , says prof. wippermann far-right expert prof. wolfgang wippermann spoke to dw-world.de about jean-marie le pen and the possibility of such a leader and a movement like his national front gaining similar prominence in germany . professor wolfgang wippermann is a lecturer of modern politics and the free university in berlin and an author of works on far-right extremism , the third reich and the holocaust . dw-world.de : what are the differences between the french political system and the german one which allow a right-wing extremist like jean-marie le pen to campaign and operate at the highest level in france ?
-lrb- constitutional regulations , laws against xenophobia etc . -rrb- wippermann : the main difference lies not in the political system , but concerns the people involved .
extremist organizations need strong leaders to be successful .
but le pen , while a charismatic leader in the past , is now too old for anyone to consider him powerful .
however , the german equivalent , gerhard frey , still pales into insignificance beside him .
and that is one reason why it is unlikely that frey would ever be able to reach a similar level .
strong german fascism is inconceivable without a " führer . " that is not to say that there is no danger of this happening in germany again .
while there are laws that prevent the glorification of the third reich and forbid anti-semitism , there is still a burgeoning far-right movement in germany , in particular in the former east german states where there are even " no-go areas " controlled by extremists which present a great risk to foreigners should they enter them .
also , recent research shows that at least 20 percent of germans profess hatred towards foreigners while 40 percent admit to anti-semitic feelings and even more , 64-68 percent holds grudges against roma and gypsies . are there any laws and structures in place in germany to prevent a radical right-wing leader from rising to power ? while there are rules in place which protect the constitution in germany , most have been installed to prevent a repeat of germany 's history but are out-dated when dealing with modern fascism . what are the social differences between france and germany which allow le pen to have such support ? le pen taps into the anti-democratic and napoleonic tradition of fascism in france .
there is the heightened fear of the foreigner , especially arab muslim immigrants who are blamed for all the sins in france , mainly unemployment and crime .
the issue of unemployment for the native citizens is one which is also a hot topic in germany .
turkish immigrants in germany are seen in the very same way as north african immigrants are in france .
but in france , there is a very strong movement for " france for the french , " something which the germans would not allow due to their history of nationalism . le pen is seen as a man of the people who has struggled and felt the pain of the common man in dealing with the hardships which have been brought on france allegedly by the foreigner .
germany has no connection like that with its far-right movement . is it possible that a social change could happen in modern germany where a figure like le pen achieves credibility and support within the electorate ? yes and no .
the germans from today are , according to my appraisals after teaching history for 30 years , better at learning from their fascist past than the french and are better at appraising the present dangers .
however , it can not be said that democracy is anchored in germany more firmly than it is in france .
both france and germany have had to learn the lessons of the past and must look to each other for guidance on dealing with the future . nick amies interviewed wolfgang wippermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel at fault for right-wing rise , opposition says the head of a german opposition political party accused the current government of fuelling right-wing unrest with its policies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 05.03.2007 germans encouraged to holiday at home for environment 's sake großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " why should i travel when it 's so beautiful here in germany ? "
an intense debate has begun in germany on the kind of lifestyle changes needed to cut greenhouse gas emissions , days before eu leaders hold a summit on energy and climate change .
holidaying at home is one suggestion . the call from green party parliamentary leader renate kunast for spending vacations in germany to become fashionable once more was predictable , but the support she received from other parts of the political spectrum was less so . werner schnappauf , environment minister for bavaria 's conservative christian social party , said germans should change their lifestyles .
" learn to value the qualities close to where you live , " was his contribution to an increasingly lively debate . the deputy parliamentary leader of the social democrats , ulrich kelber , called for germans to avoid flights as far as possible as their own " private contribution " to halting climate change .
holidays in germany and neighboring countries could be " lovely , " kelber said , extolling the virtues of train travel . ever since germany 's postwar boom , the so-called wirtschaftswunder -lrb- economic miracle -rrb- , germans have been avid travelers . german tourists first to travel en masse far and wide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tourists bring good business to holiday destinations the mediterranean came first as the trendy holiday destination .
east africa , latin america , the caribbean and the far east soon followed . trinket shops in every corner of the world - at least every sunny corner - have for decades posted the sign : " man spricht deutsch " -lrb- german spoken here -rrb- in their windows in the hope of earning solid deutsche marks or euros . but now " sylt not the seychelles , " is the holidaying slogan , in reference to the island just off the baltic coast where germany 's beautiful people have long spent weekends . the tourist industry is ready to take the change in its stride , well aware that margins on the long-haul flights are now minimal compared with what can be earned from up-market destinations closer to home . " in many circles it will no longer be chic in a couple of years to pollute the environment with tons of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- while on holiday , " said martin buck , director of berlin 's international tourist bourse , which opens wednesday . cheap flights and package tours in danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap holiday ?
walk this way buck predicted that companies offering the traditional package tour were about to face serious problems . the figures are convincing .
according to andreas tröge , head of germany 's federal environment agency , a return flight to thailand " costs " six tons of co2 , while a return train journey from berlin to the baltic weighs in at just 35 kilograms -lrb- 77 pounds -rrb- . federal environment minister sigmar gabriel has demanded that airlines offer customers the option of paying a supplement to fund projects to compensate for the co2 consumed on the flight . national flag carrier lufthansa has said it is looking for a business partner to launch a scheme of this kind . as many commentators have pointed out , the cheap flights era has led to market absurdities .
taxi ride to airports in most european cities now cost considerably more than flights to mallorca , rimini , corfu or adana . change in lifestyle greenpeace germany 's head , brigitte behrens , voiced the opinion of many when she told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper : " cheap flights should be banned . " that call is likely to fall on deaf ears when the eu leaders gather in brussels on thursday . but as a survey published last week showed , the german public is way ahead of its political leaders when it comes to the lifestyle changes needed to counter environmental damage . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : global warming could devastate ski resorts after a record warm november delayed snowfall in the alps , a new oecd report has warned that climate change poses " serious risks " to snow reliability in ski areas and could dramatically impact their economies .

-lrb- constitutional regulations , laws against xenophobia etc . -rrb- wippermann : the main difference lies not in the political system , but concerns the people involved .
extremist organizations need strong leaders to be successful .
but le pen , while a charismatic leader in the past , is now too old for anyone to consider him powerful .
however , the german equivalent , gerhard frey , still pales into insignificance beside him .
and that is one reason why it is unlikely that frey would ever be able to reach a similar level .
strong german fascism is inconceivable without a " führer . " that is not to say that there is no danger of this happening in germany again .
while there are laws that prevent the glorification of the third reich and forbid anti-semitism , there is still a burgeoning far-right movement in germany , in particular in the former east german states where there are even " no-go areas " controlled by extremists which present a great risk to foreigners should they enter them .
also , recent research shows that at least 20 percent of germans profess hatred towards foreigners while 40 percent admit to anti-semitic feelings and even more , 64-68 percent holds grudges against roma and gypsies . are there any laws and structures in place in germany to prevent a radical right-wing leader from rising to power ? while there are rules in place which protect the constitution in germany , most have been installed to prevent a repeat of germany 's history but are out-dated when dealing with modern fascism . what are the social differences between france and germany which allow le pen to have such support ? le pen taps into the anti-democratic and napoleonic tradition of fascism in france .
there is the heightened fear of the foreigner , especially arab muslim immigrants who are blamed for all the sins in france , mainly unemployment and crime .
the issue of unemployment for the native citizens is one which is also a hot topic in germany .
turkish immigrants in germany are seen in the very same way as north african immigrants are in france .
but in france , there is a very strong movement for " france for the french , " something which the germans would not allow due to their history of nationalism . le pen is seen as a man of the people who has struggled and felt the pain of the common man in dealing with the hardships which have been brought on france allegedly by the foreigner .
germany has no connection like that with its far-right movement . is it possible that a social change could happen in modern germany where a figure like le pen achieves credibility and support within the electorate ? yes and no .
the germans from today are , according to my appraisals after teaching history for 30 years , better at learning from their fascist past than the french and are better at appraising the present dangers .
however , it can not be said that democracy is anchored in germany more firmly than it is in france .
both france and germany have had to learn the lessons of the past and must look to each other for guidance on dealing with the future . nick amies interviewed wolfgang wippermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel at fault for right-wing rise , opposition says the head of a german opposition political party accused the current government of fuelling right-wing unrest with its policies .
-lrb- 15.11.2006 -rrb- experts : banning german neo-nazi party is counterproductive leading german politicians have again called for a ban on germany 's national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , but neither this nor financial problems are likely to hurt the country 's far right , experts say .
-lrb- 13.11.2006 -rrb- germany 's far-right wants to expand west encouraged by their successes at polls in the economically sagging eastern germany , far-right political parties are now trying to appeal to disgruntled voters in the western part of the country .

"
an intense debate has begun in germany on the kind of lifestyle changes needed to cut greenhouse gas emissions , days before eu leaders hold a summit on energy and climate change .
holidaying at home is one suggestion . the call from green party parliamentary leader renate kunast for spending vacations in germany to become fashionable once more was predictable , but the support she received from other parts of the political spectrum was less so . werner schnappauf , environment minister for bavaria 's conservative christian social party , said germans should change their lifestyles .
" learn to value the qualities close to where you live , " was his contribution to an increasingly lively debate . the deputy parliamentary leader of the social democrats , ulrich kelber , called for germans to avoid flights as far as possible as their own " private contribution " to halting climate change .
holidays in germany and neighboring countries could be " lovely , " kelber said , extolling the virtues of train travel . ever since germany 's postwar boom , the so-called wirtschaftswunder -lrb- economic miracle -rrb- , germans have been avid travelers . german tourists first to travel en masse far and wide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tourists bring good business to holiday destinations the mediterranean came first as the trendy holiday destination .

" in many circles it will no longer be chic in a couple of years to pollute the environment with tons of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- while on holiday , " said martin buck , director of berlin 's international tourist bourse , which opens wednesday . cheap flights and package tours in danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap holiday ?
walk this way buck predicted that companies offering the traditional package tour were about to face serious problems . the figures are convincing .
according to andreas tröge , head of germany 's federal environment agency , a return flight to thailand " costs " six tons of co2 , while a return train journey from berlin to the baltic weighs in at just 35 kilograms -lrb- 77 pounds -rrb- . federal environment minister sigmar gabriel has demanded that airlines offer customers the option of paying a supplement to fund projects to compensate for the co2 consumed on the flight . national flag carrier lufthansa has said it is looking for a business partner to launch a scheme of this kind . as many commentators have pointed out , the cheap flights era has led to market absurdities .
taxi ride to airports in most european cities now cost considerably more than flights to mallorca , rimini , corfu or adana . change in lifestyle greenpeace germany 's head , brigitte behrens , voiced the opinion of many when she told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper : " cheap flights should be banned . " that call is likely to fall on deaf ears when the eu leaders gather in brussels on thursday . but as a survey published last week showed , the german public is way ahead of its political leaders when it comes to the lifestyle changes needed to counter environmental damage . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : global warming could devastate ski resorts after a record warm november delayed snowfall in the alps , a new oecd report has warned that climate change poses " serious risks " to snow reliability in ski areas and could dramatically impact their economies .

"
an intense debate has begun in germany on the kind of lifestyle changes needed to cut greenhouse gas emissions , days before eu leaders hold a summit on energy and climate change .
holidaying at home is one suggestion . the call from green party parliamentary leader renate kunast for spending vacations in germany to become fashionable once more was predictable , but the support she received from other parts of the political spectrum was less so . werner schnappauf , environment minister for bavaria 's conservative christian social party , said germans should change their lifestyles .
" learn to value the qualities close to where you live , " was his contribution to an increasingly lively debate . the deputy parliamentary leader of the social democrats , ulrich kelber , called for germans to avoid flights as far as possible as their own " private contribution " to halting climate change .
holidays in germany and neighboring countries could be " lovely , " kelber said , extolling the virtues of train travel . ever since germany 's postwar boom , the so-called wirtschaftswunder -lrb- economic miracle -rrb- , germans have been avid travelers . german tourists first to travel en masse far and wide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tourists bring good business to holiday destinations the mediterranean came first as the trendy holiday destination .
east africa , latin america , the caribbean and the far east soon followed . trinket shops in every corner of the world - at least every sunny corner - have for decades posted the sign : " man spricht deutsch " -lrb- german spoken here -rrb- in their windows in the hope of earning solid deutsche marks or euros . but now " sylt not the seychelles , " is the holidaying slogan , in reference to the island just off the baltic coast where germany 's beautiful people have long spent weekends . the tourist industry is ready to take the change in its stride , well aware that margins on the long-haul flights are now minimal compared with what can be earned from up-market destinations closer to home . " in many circles it will no longer be chic in a couple of years to pollute the environment with tons of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- while on holiday , " said martin buck , director of berlin 's international tourist bourse , which opens wednesday . cheap flights and package tours in danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap holiday ?
walk this way buck predicted that companies offering the traditional package tour were about to face serious problems . the figures are convincing .
according to andreas tröge , head of germany 's federal environment agency , a return flight to thailand " costs " six tons of co2 , while a return train journey from berlin to the baltic weighs in at just 35 kilograms -lrb- 77 pounds -rrb- . federal environment minister sigmar gabriel has demanded that airlines offer customers the option of paying a supplement to fund projects to compensate for the co2 consumed on the flight . national flag carrier lufthansa has said it is looking for a business partner to launch a scheme of this kind . as many commentators have pointed out , the cheap flights era has led to market absurdities .
taxi ride to airports in most european cities now cost considerably more than flights to mallorca , rimini , corfu or adana . change in lifestyle greenpeace germany 's head , brigitte behrens , voiced the opinion of many when she told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper : " cheap flights should be banned . " that call is likely to fall on deaf ears when the eu leaders gather in brussels on thursday . but as a survey published last week showed , the german public is way ahead of its political leaders when it comes to the lifestyle changes needed to counter environmental damage . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : global warming could devastate ski resorts after a record warm november delayed snowfall in the alps , a new oecd report has warned that climate change poses " serious risks " to snow reliability in ski areas and could dramatically impact their economies .
-lrb- 13.12.2006 -rrb- germany up in arms over minister 's holiday comments germany 's finance minister has sparked outrage by suggesting germans should spend less on their annual holidays and instead put money aside for their old age .

the details of the offer have not been made public . the 5.5-billion-euro -lrb- $ 7.2-billion -rrb- bridge across a strait between the islands of fehmarn and lolland would replace a train-and-car ferry which runs every 30 minutes , and avoid a road detour via a bridge to the jutland peninsula . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : transnet is unhappy with berlin 's direction job losses could be permanent transnet said a new bridge would put up to 2,000 ferry workers and staff at contractors out of jobs .

the governments would have to provide the financing which could not be raised by tolls .
the project has been under discussion for 15 years , and one german chancellor after another has found a way to avoid it .
now , however , it 's starting to look serious , and wrangling over jobs and funding is escalating . officials have said the bridge could open in 2017 if parliaments approved the necessary guarantees for private investors who would try to recover most of the construction cost by charging a toll .

his new album and upcoming tour have generated huge excitement in german-speaking countries and little interest anywhere else . grönemeyer 's new album " 12 " is already muscling its way onto the german music charts . at 50 , grönemeyer is one of germany 's biggest celebrities while remaining virtually unknown in europe or the united states .
one of the reasons might be that his playful , poetic german lyrics do n't translate that well . yet the language barrier has n't stopped the singer from selling millions of albums and becoming one of the best-known and well-loved of germany 's pop rock stars .
a new grönemeyer release usually generates glowing reviews and sold-out concerts . so it 's no surprise that german critics have heaped praise on grönemeyer 's latest release , which was released friday . the album 's energetic single " ein stück von himmel , " or " a piece of heaven , " has already topped the charts and gone into rotation on german mtv . berlinonline calls it " intoxicating and simply grandiose .

his performance in the successful film made grönemeyer one of germany 's most well-known stars . in 1998 , grönemeyer suffered a double tragedy : he lost both his wife and brother to cancer .
in the wake of those deaths , he almost entirely disappeared from public .
but four years later , he returned with the album " mensch , " or " human , " which sold more than three million copies . a spring tour supporting his has already sold 800,000 tickets , making grönemeyer one of the few pop music artists who can claim to sell out a venue without selling out . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german ngos urge government to keep g8 promises an alliance of german ngos represented by singer and activist herbert grönemeyer has called on the government to devote more resources to fighting poverty and to live up to its aid promises ahead of the next g8 summit .

his new album and upcoming tour have generated huge excitement in german-speaking countries and little interest anywhere else . grönemeyer 's new album " 12 " is already muscling its way onto the german music charts . at 50 , grönemeyer is one of germany 's biggest celebrities while remaining virtually unknown in europe or the united states .
one of the reasons might be that his playful , poetic german lyrics do n't translate that well . yet the language barrier has n't stopped the singer from selling millions of albums and becoming one of the best-known and well-loved of germany 's pop rock stars .

he has been outspoken opponent of nuclear power and racism and makes frequent calls for tolerance and peace .
he continues to be involved with efforts to end poverty in africa . grönemeyer began his singing career in the early 1980s in his hometown of bochum .

-lrb- constitutional regulations , laws against xenophobia etc . -rrb- wippermann : the main difference lies not in the political system , but concerns the people involved .
extremist organizations need strong leaders to be successful .
but le pen , while a charismatic leader in the past , is now too old for anyone to consider him powerful .
however , the german equivalent , gerhard frey , still pales into insignificance beside him .
and that is one reason why it is unlikely that frey would ever be able to reach a similar level .
strong german fascism is inconceivable without a " führer . " that is not to say that there is no danger of this happening in germany again .
while there are laws that prevent the glorification of the third reich and forbid anti-semitism , there is still a burgeoning far-right movement in germany , in particular in the former east german states where there are even " no-go areas " controlled by extremists which present a great risk to foreigners should they enter them .
also , recent research shows that at least 20 percent of germans profess hatred towards foreigners while 40 percent admit to anti-semitic feelings and even more , 64-68 percent holds grudges against roma and gypsies . are there any laws and structures in place in germany to prevent a radical right-wing leader from rising to power ? while there are rules in place which protect the constitution in germany , most have been installed to prevent a repeat of germany 's history but are out-dated when dealing with modern fascism . what are the social differences between france and germany which allow le pen to have such support ? le pen taps into the anti-democratic and napoleonic tradition of fascism in france .
there is the heightened fear of the foreigner , especially arab muslim immigrants who are blamed for all the sins in france , mainly unemployment and crime .
the issue of unemployment for the native citizens is one which is also a hot topic in germany .
turkish immigrants in germany are seen in the very same way as north african immigrants are in france .
but in france , there is a very strong movement for " france for the french , " something which the germans would not allow due to their history of nationalism . le pen is seen as a man of the people who has struggled and felt the pain of the common man in dealing with the hardships which have been brought on france allegedly by the foreigner .
germany has no connection like that with its far-right movement . is it possible that a social change could happen in modern germany where a figure like le pen achieves credibility and support within the electorate ? yes and no .
the germans from today are , according to my appraisals after teaching history for 30 years , better at learning from their fascist past than the french and are better at appraising the present dangers .
however , it can not be said that democracy is anchored in germany more firmly than it is in france .
both france and germany have had to learn the lessons of the past and must look to each other for guidance on dealing with the future . nick amies interviewed wolfgang wippermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel at fault for right-wing rise , opposition says the head of a german opposition political party accused the current government of fuelling right-wing unrest with its policies .

-lrb- constitutional regulations , laws against xenophobia etc . -rrb- wippermann : the main difference lies not in the political system , but concerns the people involved .
extremist organizations need strong leaders to be successful .
but le pen , while a charismatic leader in the past , is now too old for anyone to consider him powerful .
however , the german equivalent , gerhard frey , still pales into insignificance beside him .
and that is one reason why it is unlikely that frey would ever be able to reach a similar level .
strong german fascism is inconceivable without a " führer . " that is not to say that there is no danger of this happening in germany again .
while there are laws that prevent the glorification of the third reich and forbid anti-semitism , there is still a burgeoning far-right movement in germany , in particular in the former east german states where there are even " no-go areas " controlled by extremists which present a great risk to foreigners should they enter them .
also , recent research shows that at least 20 percent of germans profess hatred towards foreigners while 40 percent admit to anti-semitic feelings and even more , 64-68 percent holds grudges against roma and gypsies . are there any laws and structures in place in germany to prevent a radical right-wing leader from rising to power ? while there are rules in place which protect the constitution in germany , most have been installed to prevent a repeat of germany 's history but are out-dated when dealing with modern fascism . what are the social differences between france and germany which allow le pen to have such support ? le pen taps into the anti-democratic and napoleonic tradition of fascism in france .
there is the heightened fear of the foreigner , especially arab muslim immigrants who are blamed for all the sins in france , mainly unemployment and crime .
the issue of unemployment for the native citizens is one which is also a hot topic in germany .
turkish immigrants in germany are seen in the very same way as north african immigrants are in france .
but in france , there is a very strong movement for " france for the french , " something which the germans would not allow due to their history of nationalism . le pen is seen as a man of the people who has struggled and felt the pain of the common man in dealing with the hardships which have been brought on france allegedly by the foreigner .
germany has no connection like that with its far-right movement . is it possible that a social change could happen in modern germany where a figure like le pen achieves credibility and support within the electorate ? yes and no .
the germans from today are , according to my appraisals after teaching history for 30 years , better at learning from their fascist past than the french and are better at appraising the present dangers .
however , it can not be said that democracy is anchored in germany more firmly than it is in france .
both france and germany have had to learn the lessons of the past and must look to each other for guidance on dealing with the future . nick amies interviewed wolfgang wippermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel at fault for right-wing rise , opposition says the head of a german opposition political party accused the current government of fuelling right-wing unrest with its policies .

le pen on the presidential campaign trail for over 30 years , jean-marie le pen has campaigned at the top of french politics .
while labeled an anti-semite and rascist by some , he still commands enough support to add a dark dimension to the presidential election . from the earliest steps on the campaign trail , the french presidential election has been viewed as a two-horse race .
despite the wily incumbent jacques chirac 's mischievous ambiguity over whether he would run again and the emergence of rising centrist francois bayrou , the majority of bets have been split between interior minister nicolas sarkozy of the ruling conservative party or socialist challenger segolene royal taking over at the elysee palace . but in the current campaign , as has been the case in the last four presidential elections , there is a dark horse stalking the main candidates .
while sarkozy 's and royal 's people are busy putting out the fires from gaffes and scandals , a man who is no stranger to controversy in once again making a play for the top job in french politics . jean-marie le pen is back . the national front leader recently launched the fifth presidential election bid of his long career with the hope that he can go one better than in the 2002 campaign when he made it to the second-round run-off .
by becoming the one alternative to chirac in that election , the first in which he made it that far , le pen shocked the french political establishment , sent tremors through europe and ended the political career of socialist prime minister lionel jospin on the way .
it was the fear of seeing le pen in the elysee which drove voters on left and right to re-elect chirac by 82 percent . anti-immigration , nationalist bandwagon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : le pen plays on the fears of urban violence in france now it seems that after five more years of chirac , france has forgotten that fear .
le pen is in the mix again , and while his current campaign is less assured in the preliminary stages as it was in 2002 , the far-right stalwart is beginning to work up a head of steam with a populist manifesto built on promises to end immigration , pull france out of nato and slash taxes for the french only . the fact that le pen is once again contesting the presidency is a testament to his tenacity .
a street fighter in his youth - he lost an eye in one scuffle - and a former paratrooper and foreign legionnaire who saw active service in indochina and algeria , le pen is used to battles . in some ways , he is the epitome of the political survivor .
he is a man who has been convicted several times for remarks about jews or the holocaust , calling the nazi gas chambers " a detail of history " and describing the german occupation of france as " relatively humane . "
he dismissed the attacks on the twin towers on september 11 , 2001 , as an " incident , " and complained before the 1998 world cup that the french soccer team was not white enough .
and yet , despite his behavior and stance , le pen and his national front party still enjoy widespread support . greatest support in years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a third of french people find le pen unacceptable recent poll results published in the french newspaper le monde showed support for le pen at its highest levels in years , even better than in the run-up to the 2002 election where he polled 18.9 per cent , nearly 5.5 million voters .
in 1997 nearly half of french people saw le pen 's ideas as unacceptable ; now only a third think so . that a man with such extremist views can still compete at the top of french politics says much about the continued disillusionment with the political leadership within french society . le pen rose to prominence in the early 1970 's with a populist mix of anti-immigrant , pro-employment , and law-and-order promises .
and in the 30 years or more since he founded the national front , more immigrants have arrived in france , unemployment has become more of a problem and crime and unrest more prominent .
le pen has continually revamped his core policies to play to the fears of what he calls " france 's silent majority , " the grassroots voters who struggle to be heard above the nation 's " technocratic elite . " " le pen has enjoyed a shift in his voter base from urban to rural areas and from the young to elderly , " nonna mayer , an expert on french far-right politics from the research center for political science in paris , told dw-world.de.
" he has succeeded in extending and diversifying his social base .
this is one reason why he remains so relevant even in modern france . " appeal to disgruntled workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french farmers regularly protest against the government just as in the 2002 election , le pen is campaigning on a strong anti-immigration platform , blaming the " invasion " of foreigners for france 's rising unemployment , urban violence and what he calls " general impoverishment . "
he is also relying on the " humble workers " vote as he did five years ago , pandering to the discontent of blue-collar employees and farmers . the state of france 's agricultural sector has given le pen a new , powerful voting pool . " voting for the extreme right is developing in rural areas , " says mayer .
" in 1988 , voters in the large cities were most likely to vote for le pen .
in 1995 , his influence extended to middle-sized conurbations .
in 2002 , he was attracting voters in small towns of less than 2000 inhabitants . " mayer believes that this shows that le pen has maintained his political longevity by pinpointing issues that effect the diverse sections of french society ; urban crime for big city dwellers , loss of french identity through immigration for middle-class citizens , and loss of jobs and threat to industry for the working classes .
how ever distasteful his approach , he is seen by many as being the only candidate to address the issues that matter to them . le pen has also won support throughout his career due to the general disaffection the populace has with its leaders .
before the 2002 vote , 83 percent of voters polled said that " politicians do not care what people like us think " and 58 percent said that french politicians were " somewhat corrupt . " wake-up call bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all those who vote for him want le pen as president " the conditions were ideal for a protest vote in favor of le pen , " mayer said .
" it was a protest vote because although they agree massively with his ideas on immigration and law-and-order , most voters do n't want him to implement them .
only 41 percent of those who voted for le pen in 2002 actually wanted him to be elected . " votes for le pen , it seems , are used as a wake-up call for france to deal with the real problems in the society .
however , the need for him to continue to run shows that these calls are far from being heeded . this year , it is still unclear whether le pen will even make it into the presidential election race .
he is struggling to gain the backing of 500 elected officials needed to register formally by march 16 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : france 's next president : sarko vs. sego police , protesters battle after sarkozy win sarkozy favored as french elect new president conservative sarkozy is france 's next president as election nears , french duo fight to a draw in last debate elections -pipe- 05.03.2007 extremist le pen strikes chord in france , again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifth-time lucky ?
le pen on the presidential campaign trail for over 30 years , jean-marie le pen has campaigned at the top of french politics .
while labeled an anti-semite and rascist by some , he still commands enough support to add a dark dimension to the presidential election . from the earliest steps on the campaign trail , the french presidential election has been viewed as a two-horse race .
despite the wily incumbent jacques chirac 's mischievous ambiguity over whether he would run again and the emergence of rising centrist francois bayrou , the majority of bets have been split between interior minister nicolas sarkozy of the ruling conservative party or socialist challenger segolene royal taking over at the elysee palace . but in the current campaign , as has been the case in the last four presidential elections , there is a dark horse stalking the main candidates .
while sarkozy 's and royal 's people are busy putting out the fires from gaffes and scandals , a man who is no stranger to controversy in once again making a play for the top job in french politics . jean-marie le pen is back . the national front leader recently launched the fifth presidential election bid of his long career with the hope that he can go one better than in the 2002 campaign when he made it to the second-round run-off .
by becoming the one alternative to chirac in that election , the first in which he made it that far , le pen shocked the french political establishment , sent tremors through europe and ended the political career of socialist prime minister lionel jospin on the way .
it was the fear of seeing le pen in the elysee which drove voters on left and right to re-elect chirac by 82 percent . anti-immigration , nationalist bandwagon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : le pen plays on the fears of urban violence in france now it seems that after five more years of chirac , france has forgotten that fear .
le pen is in the mix again , and while his current campaign is less assured in the preliminary stages as it was in 2002 , the far-right stalwart is beginning to work up a head of steam with a populist manifesto built on promises to end immigration , pull france out of nato and slash taxes for the french only . the fact that le pen is once again contesting the presidency is a testament to his tenacity .
a street fighter in his youth - he lost an eye in one scuffle - and a former paratrooper and foreign legionnaire who saw active service in indochina and algeria , le pen is used to battles . in some ways , he is the epitome of the political survivor .
he is a man who has been convicted several times for remarks about jews or the holocaust , calling the nazi gas chambers " a detail of history " and describing the german occupation of france as " relatively humane . "
he dismissed the attacks on the twin towers on september 11 , 2001 , as an " incident , " and complained before the 1998 world cup that the french soccer team was not white enough .
and yet , despite his behavior and stance , le pen and his national front party still enjoy widespread support . greatest support in years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a third of french people find le pen unacceptable recent poll results published in the french newspaper le monde showed support for le pen at its highest levels in years , even better than in the run-up to the 2002 election where he polled 18.9 per cent , nearly 5.5 million voters .
in 1997 nearly half of french people saw le pen 's ideas as unacceptable ; now only a third think so . that a man with such extremist views can still compete at the top of french politics says much about the continued disillusionment with the political leadership within french society . le pen rose to prominence in the early 1970 's with a populist mix of anti-immigrant , pro-employment , and law-and-order promises .
and in the 30 years or more since he founded the national front , more immigrants have arrived in france , unemployment has become more of a problem and crime and unrest more prominent .
le pen has continually revamped his core policies to play to the fears of what he calls " france 's silent majority , " the grassroots voters who struggle to be heard above the nation 's " technocratic elite . " " le pen has enjoyed a shift in his voter base from urban to rural areas and from the young to elderly , " nonna mayer , an expert on french far-right politics from the research center for political science in paris , told dw-world.de.
" he has succeeded in extending and diversifying his social base .
this is one reason why he remains so relevant even in modern france . " appeal to disgruntled workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french farmers regularly protest against the government just as in the 2002 election , le pen is campaigning on a strong anti-immigration platform , blaming the " invasion " of foreigners for france 's rising unemployment , urban violence and what he calls " general impoverishment . "
he is also relying on the " humble workers " vote as he did five years ago , pandering to the discontent of blue-collar employees and farmers . the state of france 's agricultural sector has given le pen a new , powerful voting pool . " voting for the extreme right is developing in rural areas , " says mayer .
" in 1988 , voters in the large cities were most likely to vote for le pen .
in 1995 , his influence extended to middle-sized conurbations .
in 2002 , he was attracting voters in small towns of less than 2000 inhabitants . " mayer believes that this shows that le pen has maintained his political longevity by pinpointing issues that effect the diverse sections of french society ; urban crime for big city dwellers , loss of french identity through immigration for middle-class citizens , and loss of jobs and threat to industry for the working classes .
how ever distasteful his approach , he is seen by many as being the only candidate to address the issues that matter to them . le pen has also won support throughout his career due to the general disaffection the populace has with its leaders .
before the 2002 vote , 83 percent of voters polled said that " politicians do not care what people like us think " and 58 percent said that french politicians were " somewhat corrupt . " wake-up call bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all those who vote for him want le pen as president " the conditions were ideal for a protest vote in favor of le pen , " mayer said .
" it was a protest vote because although they agree massively with his ideas on immigration and law-and-order , most voters do n't want him to implement them .
only 41 percent of those who voted for le pen in 2002 actually wanted him to be elected . " votes for le pen , it seems , are used as a wake-up call for france to deal with the real problems in the society .
however , the need for him to continue to run shows that these calls are far from being heeded . this year , it is still unclear whether le pen will even make it into the presidential election race .
he is struggling to gain the backing of 500 elected officials needed to register formally by march 16 .
but if he does make into the first round , no one can rule out that his true supporters , and those registering another protest vote , can push the far-right leader into another run-off for the elysee and cause another european political earthquake . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " strong german fascism is inconceivable without a führer " far-right expert prof. wolfgang wippermann spoke to dw-world.de about jean-marie le pen and the possibility of such a leader and a movement like his national front gaining similar prominence in germany .

le pen on the presidential campaign trail for over 30 years , jean-marie le pen has campaigned at the top of french politics .
while labeled an anti-semite and rascist by some , he still commands enough support to add a dark dimension to the presidential election . from the earliest steps on the campaign trail , the french presidential election has been viewed as a two-horse race .
despite the wily incumbent jacques chirac 's mischievous ambiguity over whether he would run again and the emergence of rising centrist francois bayrou , the majority of bets have been split between interior minister nicolas sarkozy of the ruling conservative party or socialist challenger segolene royal taking over at the elysee palace . but in the current campaign , as has been the case in the last four presidential elections , there is a dark horse stalking the main candidates .
while sarkozy 's and royal 's people are busy putting out the fires from gaffes and scandals , a man who is no stranger to controversy in once again making a play for the top job in french politics . jean-marie le pen is back . the national front leader recently launched the fifth presidential election bid of his long career with the hope that he can go one better than in the 2002 campaign when he made it to the second-round run-off .
by becoming the one alternative to chirac in that election , the first in which he made it that far , le pen shocked the french political establishment , sent tremors through europe and ended the political career of socialist prime minister lionel jospin on the way .
it was the fear of seeing le pen in the elysee which drove voters on left and right to re-elect chirac by 82 percent . anti-immigration , nationalist bandwagon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : le pen plays on the fears of urban violence in france now it seems that after five more years of chirac , france has forgotten that fear .
le pen is in the mix again , and while his current campaign is less assured in the preliminary stages as it was in 2002 , the far-right stalwart is beginning to work up a head of steam with a populist manifesto built on promises to end immigration , pull france out of nato and slash taxes for the french only . the fact that le pen is once again contesting the presidency is a testament to his tenacity .
a street fighter in his youth - he lost an eye in one scuffle - and a former paratrooper and foreign legionnaire who saw active service in indochina and algeria , le pen is used to battles . in some ways , he is the epitome of the political survivor .
he is a man who has been convicted several times for remarks about jews or the holocaust , calling the nazi gas chambers " a detail of history " and describing the german occupation of france as " relatively humane . "
he dismissed the attacks on the twin towers on september 11 , 2001 , as an " incident , " and complained before the 1998 world cup that the french soccer team was not white enough .
and yet , despite his behavior and stance , le pen and his national front party still enjoy widespread support . greatest support in years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a third of french people find le pen unacceptable recent poll results published in the french newspaper le monde showed support for le pen at its highest levels in years , even better than in the run-up to the 2002 election where he polled 18.9 per cent , nearly 5.5 million voters .
in 1997 nearly half of french people saw le pen 's ideas as unacceptable ; now only a third think so . that a man with such extremist views can still compete at the top of french politics says much about the continued disillusionment with the political leadership within french society . le pen rose to prominence in the early 1970 's with a populist mix of anti-immigrant , pro-employment , and law-and-order promises .
and in the 30 years or more since he founded the national front , more immigrants have arrived in france , unemployment has become more of a problem and crime and unrest more prominent .
le pen has continually revamped his core policies to play to the fears of what he calls " france 's silent majority , " the grassroots voters who struggle to be heard above the nation 's " technocratic elite . " " le pen has enjoyed a shift in his voter base from urban to rural areas and from the young to elderly , " nonna mayer , an expert on french far-right politics from the research center for political science in paris , told dw-world.de.
" he has succeeded in extending and diversifying his social base .
this is one reason why he remains so relevant even in modern france . " appeal to disgruntled workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french farmers regularly protest against the government just as in the 2002 election , le pen is campaigning on a strong anti-immigration platform , blaming the " invasion " of foreigners for france 's rising unemployment , urban violence and what he calls " general impoverishment . "
he is also relying on the " humble workers " vote as he did five years ago , pandering to the discontent of blue-collar employees and farmers . the state of france 's agricultural sector has given le pen a new , powerful voting pool . " voting for the extreme right is developing in rural areas , " says mayer .
" in 1988 , voters in the large cities were most likely to vote for le pen .
in 1995 , his influence extended to middle-sized conurbations .
in 2002 , he was attracting voters in small towns of less than 2000 inhabitants . " mayer believes that this shows that le pen has maintained his political longevity by pinpointing issues that effect the diverse sections of french society ; urban crime for big city dwellers , loss of french identity through immigration for middle-class citizens , and loss of jobs and threat to industry for the working classes .
how ever distasteful his approach , he is seen by many as being the only candidate to address the issues that matter to them . le pen has also won support throughout his career due to the general disaffection the populace has with its leaders .
before the 2002 vote , 83 percent of voters polled said that " politicians do not care what people like us think " and 58 percent said that french politicians were " somewhat corrupt . " wake-up call bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all those who vote for him want le pen as president " the conditions were ideal for a protest vote in favor of le pen , " mayer said .
" it was a protest vote because although they agree massively with his ideas on immigration and law-and-order , most voters do n't want him to implement them .
only 41 percent of those who voted for le pen in 2002 actually wanted him to be elected . " votes for le pen , it seems , are used as a wake-up call for france to deal with the real problems in the society .
however , the need for him to continue to run shows that these calls are far from being heeded . this year , it is still unclear whether le pen will even make it into the presidential election race .
he is struggling to gain the backing of 500 elected officials needed to register formally by march 16 .
but if he does make into the first round , no one can rule out that his true supporters , and those registering another protest vote , can push the far-right leader into another run-off for the elysee and cause another european political earthquake . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " strong german fascism is inconceivable without a führer " far-right expert prof. wolfgang wippermann spoke to dw-world.de about jean-marie le pen and the possibility of such a leader and a movement like his national front gaining similar prominence in germany .

she will make her case at an upcoming eu summit . in the run-up to her first summit as president of the european union , the german chancellor told munich-based daily süddeutsche zeitung on sunday that european leaders " are going to ratify an action plan for climate protection and energy policy that is more concrete than ever before in the history of the european union . " but central proposals of the action plan are bound to cause contentious debate at the summit on thursday and friday .
the plan includes a commitment to supply 20 percent of europe 's energy needs from renewable sources such as wind power , a leading industry in germany . after an early round of informal talks in brussels on monday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier admitted that " the obligation of the 20 percent goal will still need to be negotiated at the summit . "
france and finland , for example , have signalled their reluctance to accept the binding goal for fear that it could jeopardize their national energy mix . chancellor merkel also plans to push for a europe-wide reduction of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , the man-made greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming .
the proposed plan would require the european states to reduce their overall co2-output by 20 percent below 1990-levels .
the 27 eu member states have agreed in principle to set this goal for 2020 , but will have to ratify the plan at the summit in order for it to become binding . member states have already agreed on a 10 percent increase of bio-fuels - such as ethanol gained from corn crops - over the next three years , assuming sufficient amounts of bio-fuel can be produced to meet the demand . europe becoming global role model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bio-fuels and modern engines significantly reduce the amount of co2 emissions from vehicles germany has assumed a lead role in pushing the environmental envelope and has already achieved a near-20 percent national reduction of co2 emissions below the levels of 1990 .
if the eu action plan is ratified , germany could reduce its overall co2 output by as much as 40 percent .
but not all member states will be held up to this high standard ; lower goals will be set for economically weaker eu countries . the action plan would also propel europe to the forefront of the global movement to mitigate the effects of global warming .
chancellor merkel spoke of a " paradigm shift " in sunday 's interview with the german daily : " so far , european nations made their own energy policy , " but " all that is now up for negotiation . " the german presidency of this year 's g8 summit will also allow merkel to talk to developing nations about alternative energy policies .
referring to the g8 summit , which will take place in june in the northern german resort town of heiligendamm , merkel specifically mentioned china , india , mexico , brazil and south africa . indeed , china appeared to hop on the green bandwagon prematurely on monday , as chinese premier wen jiabao vowed in his annual state of the nation address to curb " inefficient " economic growth and " excessive energy consumption . " merkel also told the süddeutsche zeitung that a rethinking of environmental policies was taking place in the united states .
she described " remarkable " progress there in the development of bio-fuels , but also said governments needed to " set the proper parameters " for the agricultural shifts this technology will likely bring about .

the new group would give a united voice to the more than three million muslims living in germany . muslim leaders want to form a new organization that can act as an advocate for all muslims living in germany , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper reported in its sunday edition .
currently , only a small number of the more than 3.2 million muslims in germany belong to an organized advocacy group .

divisions according to country of origin and theological differences have hindered past considerations about joining forces . muslims realize they would benefit from having one voice and are determined to develop an organization that would provide united representation , bekir alboga , leader of a turkish religious organization , told the newspaper . in september , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble hosted a " conference on islam . "
it was the first time federal authorities had launched a dialogue with the country 's muslim minority . at that conference , schäuble mentioned the idea of an umbrella organization .
the german government would like a negotiating partner who they could turn to for advice on issues such as islamic religion classes , ways to better integrate muslim immigrants into german society , and ideas for limiting the influence of islamist extremists . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bavarian constitutional court upholds headscarf ban the highest court in the southern german state of bavaria decided that the state did not overstep its authority by banning muslim teachers from wearing headscarves in the classroom .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 05.03.2007 germans encouraged to holiday at home for environment 's sake großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " why should i travel when it 's so beautiful here in germany ? "
an intense debate has begun in germany on the kind of lifestyle changes needed to cut greenhouse gas emissions , days before eu leaders hold a summit on energy and climate change .
holidaying at home is one suggestion . the call from green party parliamentary leader renate kunast for spending vacations in germany to become fashionable once more was predictable , but the support she received from other parts of the political spectrum was less so . werner schnappauf , environment minister for bavaria 's conservative christian social party , said germans should change their lifestyles .
" learn to value the qualities close to where you live , " was his contribution to an increasingly lively debate . the deputy parliamentary leader of the social democrats , ulrich kelber , called for germans to avoid flights as far as possible as their own " private contribution " to halting climate change .
holidays in germany and neighboring countries could be " lovely , " kelber said , extolling the virtues of train travel . ever since germany 's postwar boom , the so-called wirtschaftswunder -lrb- economic miracle -rrb- , germans have been avid travelers . german tourists first to travel en masse far and wide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tourists bring good business to holiday destinations the mediterranean came first as the trendy holiday destination .
east africa , latin america , the caribbean and the far east soon followed . trinket shops in every corner of the world - at least every sunny corner - have for decades posted the sign : " man spricht deutsch " -lrb- german spoken here -rrb- in their windows in the hope of earning solid deutsche marks or euros . but now " sylt not the seychelles , " is the holidaying slogan , in reference to the island just off the baltic coast where germany 's beautiful people have long spent weekends . the tourist industry is ready to take the change in its stride , well aware that margins on the long-haul flights are now minimal compared with what can be earned from up-market destinations closer to home . " in many circles it will no longer be chic in a couple of years to pollute the environment with tons of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- while on holiday , " said martin buck , director of berlin 's international tourist bourse , which opens wednesday . cheap flights and package tours in danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap holiday ?
walk this way buck predicted that companies offering the traditional package tour were about to face serious problems . the figures are convincing .
according to andreas tröge , head of germany 's federal environment agency , a return flight to thailand " costs " six tons of co2 , while a return train journey from berlin to the baltic weighs in at just 35 kilograms -lrb- 77 pounds -rrb- . federal environment minister sigmar gabriel has demanded that airlines offer customers the option of paying a supplement to fund projects to compensate for the co2 consumed on the flight . national flag carrier lufthansa has said it is looking for a business partner to launch a scheme of this kind . as many commentators have pointed out , the cheap flights era has led to market absurdities .
taxi ride to airports in most european cities now cost considerably more than flights to mallorca , rimini , corfu or adana . change in lifestyle greenpeace germany 's head , brigitte behrens , voiced the opinion of many when she told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper : " cheap flights should be banned . " that call is likely to fall on deaf ears when the eu leaders gather in brussels on thursday . but as a survey published last week showed , the german public is way ahead of its political leaders when it comes to the lifestyle changes needed to counter environmental damage . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : global warming could devastate ski resorts after a record warm november delayed snowfall in the alps , a new oecd report has warned that climate change poses " serious risks " to snow reliability in ski areas and could dramatically impact their economies .
-lrb- 13.12.2006 -rrb- germany up in arms over minister 's holiday comments germany 's finance minister has sparked outrage by suggesting germans should spend less on their annual holidays and instead put money aside for their old age .
the comments have sparked a lively debate about the economy .
-lrb- 20.08.2006 -rrb- luring tourists to a germany less traveled visits to germany 's more obscure destinations are rare by foreign tourists and even locals are often deterred .
in the country of autobahns , the latter might be partly to blame .

"
an intense debate has begun in germany on the kind of lifestyle changes needed to cut greenhouse gas emissions , days before eu leaders hold a summit on energy and climate change .
holidaying at home is one suggestion . the call from green party parliamentary leader renate kunast for spending vacations in germany to become fashionable once more was predictable , but the support she received from other parts of the political spectrum was less so . werner schnappauf , environment minister for bavaria 's conservative christian social party , said germans should change their lifestyles .
" learn to value the qualities close to where you live , " was his contribution to an increasingly lively debate . the deputy parliamentary leader of the social democrats , ulrich kelber , called for germans to avoid flights as far as possible as their own " private contribution " to halting climate change .
holidays in germany and neighboring countries could be " lovely , " kelber said , extolling the virtues of train travel . ever since germany 's postwar boom , the so-called wirtschaftswunder -lrb- economic miracle -rrb- , germans have been avid travelers . german tourists first to travel en masse far and wide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tourists bring good business to holiday destinations the mediterranean came first as the trendy holiday destination .
east africa , latin america , the caribbean and the far east soon followed . trinket shops in every corner of the world - at least every sunny corner - have for decades posted the sign : " man spricht deutsch " -lrb- german spoken here -rrb- in their windows in the hope of earning solid deutsche marks or euros . but now " sylt not the seychelles , " is the holidaying slogan , in reference to the island just off the baltic coast where germany 's beautiful people have long spent weekends . the tourist industry is ready to take the change in its stride , well aware that margins on the long-haul flights are now minimal compared with what can be earned from up-market destinations closer to home . " in many circles it will no longer be chic in a couple of years to pollute the environment with tons of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- while on holiday , " said martin buck , director of berlin 's international tourist bourse , which opens wednesday . cheap flights and package tours in danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap holiday ?
walk this way buck predicted that companies offering the traditional package tour were about to face serious problems . the figures are convincing .
according to andreas tröge , head of germany 's federal environment agency , a return flight to thailand " costs " six tons of co2 , while a return train journey from berlin to the baltic weighs in at just 35 kilograms -lrb- 77 pounds -rrb- . federal environment minister sigmar gabriel has demanded that airlines offer customers the option of paying a supplement to fund projects to compensate for the co2 consumed on the flight . national flag carrier lufthansa has said it is looking for a business partner to launch a scheme of this kind . as many commentators have pointed out , the cheap flights era has led to market absurdities .
taxi ride to airports in most european cities now cost considerably more than flights to mallorca , rimini , corfu or adana . change in lifestyle greenpeace germany 's head , brigitte behrens , voiced the opinion of many when she told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper : " cheap flights should be banned . " that call is likely to fall on deaf ears when the eu leaders gather in brussels on thursday . but as a survey published last week showed , the german public is way ahead of its political leaders when it comes to the lifestyle changes needed to counter environmental damage . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : global warming could devastate ski resorts after a record warm november delayed snowfall in the alps , a new oecd report has warned that climate change poses " serious risks " to snow reliability in ski areas and could dramatically impact their economies .

" we count on russia being a reliable partner , " she said in an interview with the daily süddeutsche zeitung on monday .
" i therefore agree in principle to russia getting economically involved in europe .
but good economic relations between russia and the eu can only be based on reciprocity . " equally , we have an interest in acquiring the ownership rights to russian gas fields , " the chancellor said . eads not ready for more investors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the designer of the eurocopter , eads should stay in european hands , merkel said franco-german aerospace venture eads , however , is one company merkel said should not be open to russian investment . " at the moment , we should n't admit another stakeholder into the shareholder pact , " she said .
" but i support closer cooperation in aircraft construction , as eads has already begun to do . " the european aeronautic defense and space company is controlled jointly by france and germany , with the delicate balance of power resting on a complex construction of multiple shareholdings , both public and private . last summer , however , the russian state bought a stake of between 5 percent and 7 percent via state-controlled bank vneshtorgbank -lrb- vtb -rrb- and russia is believed to be eager to gain a greater say in eads . nevertheless , moscow has been keen to calm european concerns on the matter , with president vladimir putin insisting recently that russia wanted " cooperation " with eads , and had no plans for a " hostile takeover . " united response to russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus employees have taken to the street to protest a restructuring program shares in eads dropped by 8.6 percent last week after the announcement that its subsidiary aircraft manufacturer airbus would cut 10,000 jobs over four years , streamline its production facilities and reorganize the distribution of work between factories across europe . merkel also said it was important for the eu to act in a unified manner when dealing with russia , no easy task as eastern european countries often have a different opinion on moscow 's policies than western european nations . poland , for example , delayed talks on an eu-russia energy partnership pact last year because warsaw opposed a trade embargo russia placed on polish meat products . rockets raise additional questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the us missile shield is already being set up in japan tensions in russia were also heightened last month after the us announced plans for a missile defense shield , portions of which would be located in poland and the czech republic .
the two eu member states have expressed their acceptance of the us plans while putin said the shield posed a threat to moscow and could potentially start a new arms race . germany 's merkel backed the american proposal , saying the missile shield was a " purely defensive system " that would not be aimed at russia and an issue that needed to be discussed in talks between russia and nato . " i think it is appropriate to think about how to arm oneself against possible rockets coming from regions we did not really have to have our eye on during the cold war , " merkel said .
" but we can and have to communicate more closely . " dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus chiefs criticize power sharing and government meddling the french and german joint chiefs of troubled european plane maker eads , manufacturer of the airbus , saturday criticized the way their company was run , saying the double presidency they share added to the problems .

" any attempt to revise the history of world war two needs to be watched carefully , " he told reporters on monday , saying such a revision posed a danger to poland and europe .
" i hope the process in germany will be stopped . " the film 's producers and actors said they intended for the film , whose second installment will be broadcast monday , to strike a chord with viewers . " i hope our film contributes to young and old people talking to each other about the worst chapter of german history , " said actress maria furtwängler , who plays the countess lena . director kai wessel , however , said he did not think attention would focus so closely on where guilt lays or vengeance , adding that he had only wanted to create a personal film that stayed true to the victims ' perspective . bildunterschrift : just over 13 percent of germans are estimated to have seen the series ' first installment german suffering long a taboo topic germans have long shied away from discussing their 14 million countrymen who fled the soviet army or were expelled after the allies allowed their eviction from poland , hungary and czechoslovakia .

le pen on the presidential campaign trail for over 30 years , jean-marie le pen has campaigned at the top of french politics .
while labeled an anti-semite and rascist by some , he still commands enough support to add a dark dimension to the presidential election . from the earliest steps on the campaign trail , the french presidential election has been viewed as a two-horse race .
despite the wily incumbent jacques chirac 's mischievous ambiguity over whether he would run again and the emergence of rising centrist francois bayrou , the majority of bets have been split between interior minister nicolas sarkozy of the ruling conservative party or socialist challenger segolene royal taking over at the elysee palace . but in the current campaign , as has been the case in the last four presidential elections , there is a dark horse stalking the main candidates .
while sarkozy 's and royal 's people are busy putting out the fires from gaffes and scandals , a man who is no stranger to controversy in once again making a play for the top job in french politics . jean-marie le pen is back . the national front leader recently launched the fifth presidential election bid of his long career with the hope that he can go one better than in the 2002 campaign when he made it to the second-round run-off .
by becoming the one alternative to chirac in that election , the first in which he made it that far , le pen shocked the french political establishment , sent tremors through europe and ended the political career of socialist prime minister lionel jospin on the way .
it was the fear of seeing le pen in the elysee which drove voters on left and right to re-elect chirac by 82 percent . anti-immigration , nationalist bandwagon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : le pen plays on the fears of urban violence in france now it seems that after five more years of chirac , france has forgotten that fear .
le pen is in the mix again , and while his current campaign is less assured in the preliminary stages as it was in 2002 , the far-right stalwart is beginning to work up a head of steam with a populist manifesto built on promises to end immigration , pull france out of nato and slash taxes for the french only . the fact that le pen is once again contesting the presidency is a testament to his tenacity .
a street fighter in his youth - he lost an eye in one scuffle - and a former paratrooper and foreign legionnaire who saw active service in indochina and algeria , le pen is used to battles . in some ways , he is the epitome of the political survivor .
he is a man who has been convicted several times for remarks about jews or the holocaust , calling the nazi gas chambers " a detail of history " and describing the german occupation of france as " relatively humane . "
he dismissed the attacks on the twin towers on september 11 , 2001 , as an " incident , " and complained before the 1998 world cup that the french soccer team was not white enough .
and yet , despite his behavior and stance , le pen and his national front party still enjoy widespread support . greatest support in years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a third of french people find le pen unacceptable recent poll results published in the french newspaper le monde showed support for le pen at its highest levels in years , even better than in the run-up to the 2002 election where he polled 18.9 per cent , nearly 5.5 million voters .
in 1997 nearly half of french people saw le pen 's ideas as unacceptable ; now only a third think so . that a man with such extremist views can still compete at the top of french politics says much about the continued disillusionment with the political leadership within french society . le pen rose to prominence in the early 1970 's with a populist mix of anti-immigrant , pro-employment , and law-and-order promises .
and in the 30 years or more since he founded the national front , more immigrants have arrived in france , unemployment has become more of a problem and crime and unrest more prominent .
le pen has continually revamped his core policies to play to the fears of what he calls " france 's silent majority , " the grassroots voters who struggle to be heard above the nation 's " technocratic elite . " " le pen has enjoyed a shift in his voter base from urban to rural areas and from the young to elderly , " nonna mayer , an expert on french far-right politics from the research center for political science in paris , told dw-world.de.
" he has succeeded in extending and diversifying his social base .
this is one reason why he remains so relevant even in modern france . " appeal to disgruntled workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french farmers regularly protest against the government just as in the 2002 election , le pen is campaigning on a strong anti-immigration platform , blaming the " invasion " of foreigners for france 's rising unemployment , urban violence and what he calls " general impoverishment . "
he is also relying on the " humble workers " vote as he did five years ago , pandering to the discontent of blue-collar employees and farmers . the state of france 's agricultural sector has given le pen a new , powerful voting pool . " voting for the extreme right is developing in rural areas , " says mayer .
" in 1988 , voters in the large cities were most likely to vote for le pen .
in 1995 , his influence extended to middle-sized conurbations .
in 2002 , he was attracting voters in small towns of less than 2000 inhabitants . " mayer believes that this shows that le pen has maintained his political longevity by pinpointing issues that effect the diverse sections of french society ; urban crime for big city dwellers , loss of french identity through immigration for middle-class citizens , and loss of jobs and threat to industry for the working classes .
how ever distasteful his approach , he is seen by many as being the only candidate to address the issues that matter to them . le pen has also won support throughout his career due to the general disaffection the populace has with its leaders .
before the 2002 vote , 83 percent of voters polled said that " politicians do not care what people like us think " and 58 percent said that french politicians were " somewhat corrupt . " wake-up call bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all those who vote for him want le pen as president " the conditions were ideal for a protest vote in favor of le pen , " mayer said .
" it was a protest vote because although they agree massively with his ideas on immigration and law-and-order , most voters do n't want him to implement them .
only 41 percent of those who voted for le pen in 2002 actually wanted him to be elected . " votes for le pen , it seems , are used as a wake-up call for france to deal with the real problems in the society .
however , the need for him to continue to run shows that these calls are far from being heeded . this year , it is still unclear whether le pen will even make it into the presidential election race .
he is struggling to gain the backing of 500 elected officials needed to register formally by march 16 .
but if he does make into the first round , no one can rule out that his true supporters , and those registering another protest vote , can push the far-right leader into another run-off for the elysee and cause another european political earthquake . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " strong german fascism is inconceivable without a führer " far-right expert prof. wolfgang wippermann spoke to dw-world.de about jean-marie le pen and the possibility of such a leader and a movement like his national front gaining similar prominence in germany .

le pen on the presidential campaign trail for over 30 years , jean-marie le pen has campaigned at the top of french politics .
while labeled an anti-semite and rascist by some , he still commands enough support to add a dark dimension to the presidential election . from the earliest steps on the campaign trail , the french presidential election has been viewed as a two-horse race .
despite the wily incumbent jacques chirac 's mischievous ambiguity over whether he would run again and the emergence of rising centrist francois bayrou , the majority of bets have been split between interior minister nicolas sarkozy of the ruling conservative party or socialist challenger segolene royal taking over at the elysee palace . but in the current campaign , as has been the case in the last four presidential elections , there is a dark horse stalking the main candidates .
while sarkozy 's and royal 's people are busy putting out the fires from gaffes and scandals , a man who is no stranger to controversy in once again making a play for the top job in french politics . jean-marie le pen is back . the national front leader recently launched the fifth presidential election bid of his long career with the hope that he can go one better than in the 2002 campaign when he made it to the second-round run-off .
by becoming the one alternative to chirac in that election , the first in which he made it that far , le pen shocked the french political establishment , sent tremors through europe and ended the political career of socialist prime minister lionel jospin on the way .
it was the fear of seeing le pen in the elysee which drove voters on left and right to re-elect chirac by 82 percent . anti-immigration , nationalist bandwagon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : le pen plays on the fears of urban violence in france now it seems that after five more years of chirac , france has forgotten that fear .
le pen is in the mix again , and while his current campaign is less assured in the preliminary stages as it was in 2002 , the far-right stalwart is beginning to work up a head of steam with a populist manifesto built on promises to end immigration , pull france out of nato and slash taxes for the french only . the fact that le pen is once again contesting the presidency is a testament to his tenacity .
a street fighter in his youth - he lost an eye in one scuffle - and a former paratrooper and foreign legionnaire who saw active service in indochina and algeria , le pen is used to battles . in some ways , he is the epitome of the political survivor .
he is a man who has been convicted several times for remarks about jews or the holocaust , calling the nazi gas chambers " a detail of history " and describing the german occupation of france as " relatively humane . "
he dismissed the attacks on the twin towers on september 11 , 2001 , as an " incident , " and complained before the 1998 world cup that the french soccer team was not white enough .
and yet , despite his behavior and stance , le pen and his national front party still enjoy widespread support . greatest support in years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a third of french people find le pen unacceptable recent poll results published in the french newspaper le monde showed support for le pen at its highest levels in years , even better than in the run-up to the 2002 election where he polled 18.9 per cent , nearly 5.5 million voters .
in 1997 nearly half of french people saw le pen 's ideas as unacceptable ; now only a third think so . that a man with such extremist views can still compete at the top of french politics says much about the continued disillusionment with the political leadership within french society . le pen rose to prominence in the early 1970 's with a populist mix of anti-immigrant , pro-employment , and law-and-order promises .
and in the 30 years or more since he founded the national front , more immigrants have arrived in france , unemployment has become more of a problem and crime and unrest more prominent .
le pen has continually revamped his core policies to play to the fears of what he calls " france 's silent majority , " the grassroots voters who struggle to be heard above the nation 's " technocratic elite . " " le pen has enjoyed a shift in his voter base from urban to rural areas and from the young to elderly , " nonna mayer , an expert on french far-right politics from the research center for political science in paris , told dw-world.de.
" he has succeeded in extending and diversifying his social base .
this is one reason why he remains so relevant even in modern france . " appeal to disgruntled workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french farmers regularly protest against the government just as in the 2002 election , le pen is campaigning on a strong anti-immigration platform , blaming the " invasion " of foreigners for france 's rising unemployment , urban violence and what he calls " general impoverishment . "
he is also relying on the " humble workers " vote as he did five years ago , pandering to the discontent of blue-collar employees and farmers . the state of france 's agricultural sector has given le pen a new , powerful voting pool . " voting for the extreme right is developing in rural areas , " says mayer .
" in 1988 , voters in the large cities were most likely to vote for le pen .
in 1995 , his influence extended to middle-sized conurbations .
in 2002 , he was attracting voters in small towns of less than 2000 inhabitants . " mayer believes that this shows that le pen has maintained his political longevity by pinpointing issues that effect the diverse sections of french society ; urban crime for big city dwellers , loss of french identity through immigration for middle-class citizens , and loss of jobs and threat to industry for the working classes .
how ever distasteful his approach , he is seen by many as being the only candidate to address the issues that matter to them . le pen has also won support throughout his career due to the general disaffection the populace has with its leaders .
before the 2002 vote , 83 percent of voters polled said that " politicians do not care what people like us think " and 58 percent said that french politicians were " somewhat corrupt . " wake-up call bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all those who vote for him want le pen as president " the conditions were ideal for a protest vote in favor of le pen , " mayer said .
" it was a protest vote because although they agree massively with his ideas on immigration and law-and-order , most voters do n't want him to implement them .
only 41 percent of those who voted for le pen in 2002 actually wanted him to be elected . " votes for le pen , it seems , are used as a wake-up call for france to deal with the real problems in the society .
however , the need for him to continue to run shows that these calls are far from being heeded . this year , it is still unclear whether le pen will even make it into the presidential election race .
he is struggling to gain the backing of 500 elected officials needed to register formally by march 16 .

le pen on the presidential campaign trail for over 30 years , jean-marie le pen has campaigned at the top of french politics .
while labeled an anti-semite and rascist by some , he still commands enough support to add a dark dimension to the presidential election . from the earliest steps on the campaign trail , the french presidential election has been viewed as a two-horse race .
despite the wily incumbent jacques chirac 's mischievous ambiguity over whether he would run again and the emergence of rising centrist francois bayrou , the majority of bets have been split between interior minister nicolas sarkozy of the ruling conservative party or socialist challenger segolene royal taking over at the elysee palace . but in the current campaign , as has been the case in the last four presidential elections , there is a dark horse stalking the main candidates .
while sarkozy 's and royal 's people are busy putting out the fires from gaffes and scandals , a man who is no stranger to controversy in once again making a play for the top job in french politics . jean-marie le pen is back . the national front leader recently launched the fifth presidential election bid of his long career with the hope that he can go one better than in the 2002 campaign when he made it to the second-round run-off .
by becoming the one alternative to chirac in that election , the first in which he made it that far , le pen shocked the french political establishment , sent tremors through europe and ended the political career of socialist prime minister lionel jospin on the way .
it was the fear of seeing le pen in the elysee which drove voters on left and right to re-elect chirac by 82 percent . anti-immigration , nationalist bandwagon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : le pen plays on the fears of urban violence in france now it seems that after five more years of chirac , france has forgotten that fear .
le pen is in the mix again , and while his current campaign is less assured in the preliminary stages as it was in 2002 , the far-right stalwart is beginning to work up a head of steam with a populist manifesto built on promises to end immigration , pull france out of nato and slash taxes for the french only . the fact that le pen is once again contesting the presidency is a testament to his tenacity .
a street fighter in his youth - he lost an eye in one scuffle - and a former paratrooper and foreign legionnaire who saw active service in indochina and algeria , le pen is used to battles . in some ways , he is the epitome of the political survivor .
he is a man who has been convicted several times for remarks about jews or the holocaust , calling the nazi gas chambers " a detail of history " and describing the german occupation of france as " relatively humane . "
he dismissed the attacks on the twin towers on september 11 , 2001 , as an " incident , " and complained before the 1998 world cup that the french soccer team was not white enough .
and yet , despite his behavior and stance , le pen and his national front party still enjoy widespread support . greatest support in years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a third of french people find le pen unacceptable recent poll results published in the french newspaper le monde showed support for le pen at its highest levels in years , even better than in the run-up to the 2002 election where he polled 18.9 per cent , nearly 5.5 million voters .
in 1997 nearly half of french people saw le pen 's ideas as unacceptable ; now only a third think so . that a man with such extremist views can still compete at the top of french politics says much about the continued disillusionment with the political leadership within french society . le pen rose to prominence in the early 1970 's with a populist mix of anti-immigrant , pro-employment , and law-and-order promises .
and in the 30 years or more since he founded the national front , more immigrants have arrived in france , unemployment has become more of a problem and crime and unrest more prominent .
le pen has continually revamped his core policies to play to the fears of what he calls " france 's silent majority , " the grassroots voters who struggle to be heard above the nation 's " technocratic elite . " " le pen has enjoyed a shift in his voter base from urban to rural areas and from the young to elderly , " nonna mayer , an expert on french far-right politics from the research center for political science in paris , told dw-world.de.
" he has succeeded in extending and diversifying his social base .
this is one reason why he remains so relevant even in modern france . " appeal to disgruntled workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french farmers regularly protest against the government just as in the 2002 election , le pen is campaigning on a strong anti-immigration platform , blaming the " invasion " of foreigners for france 's rising unemployment , urban violence and what he calls " general impoverishment . "
he is also relying on the " humble workers " vote as he did five years ago , pandering to the discontent of blue-collar employees and farmers . the state of france 's agricultural sector has given le pen a new , powerful voting pool . " voting for the extreme right is developing in rural areas , " says mayer .
" in 1988 , voters in the large cities were most likely to vote for le pen .
in 1995 , his influence extended to middle-sized conurbations .
in 2002 , he was attracting voters in small towns of less than 2000 inhabitants . " mayer believes that this shows that le pen has maintained his political longevity by pinpointing issues that effect the diverse sections of french society ; urban crime for big city dwellers , loss of french identity through immigration for middle-class citizens , and loss of jobs and threat to industry for the working classes .
how ever distasteful his approach , he is seen by many as being the only candidate to address the issues that matter to them . le pen has also won support throughout his career due to the general disaffection the populace has with its leaders .
before the 2002 vote , 83 percent of voters polled said that " politicians do not care what people like us think " and 58 percent said that french politicians were " somewhat corrupt . " wake-up call bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all those who vote for him want le pen as president " the conditions were ideal for a protest vote in favor of le pen , " mayer said .
" it was a protest vote because although they agree massively with his ideas on immigration and law-and-order , most voters do n't want him to implement them .
only 41 percent of those who voted for le pen in 2002 actually wanted him to be elected . " votes for le pen , it seems , are used as a wake-up call for france to deal with the real problems in the society .
however , the need for him to continue to run shows that these calls are far from being heeded . this year , it is still unclear whether le pen will even make it into the presidential election race .
he is struggling to gain the backing of 500 elected officials needed to register formally by march 16 .
but if he does make into the first round , no one can rule out that his true supporters , and those registering another protest vote , can push the far-right leader into another run-off for the elysee and cause another european political earthquake . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " strong german fascism is inconceivable without a führer " far-right expert prof. wolfgang wippermann spoke to dw-world.de about jean-marie le pen and the possibility of such a leader and a movement like his national front gaining similar prominence in germany .

"
an intense debate has begun in germany on the kind of lifestyle changes needed to cut greenhouse gas emissions , days before eu leaders hold a summit on energy and climate change .
holidaying at home is one suggestion . the call from green party parliamentary leader renate kunast for spending vacations in germany to become fashionable once more was predictable , but the support she received from other parts of the political spectrum was less so . werner schnappauf , environment minister for bavaria 's conservative christian social party , said germans should change their lifestyles .
" learn to value the qualities close to where you live , " was his contribution to an increasingly lively debate . the deputy parliamentary leader of the social democrats , ulrich kelber , called for germans to avoid flights as far as possible as their own " private contribution " to halting climate change .
holidays in germany and neighboring countries could be " lovely , " kelber said , extolling the virtues of train travel . ever since germany 's postwar boom , the so-called wirtschaftswunder -lrb- economic miracle -rrb- , germans have been avid travelers . german tourists first to travel en masse far and wide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tourists bring good business to holiday destinations the mediterranean came first as the trendy holiday destination .

according to andreas tröge , head of germany 's federal environment agency , a return flight to thailand " costs " six tons of co2 , while a return train journey from berlin to the baltic weighs in at just 35 kilograms -lrb- 77 pounds -rrb- . federal environment minister sigmar gabriel has demanded that airlines offer customers the option of paying a supplement to fund projects to compensate for the co2 consumed on the flight . national flag carrier lufthansa has said it is looking for a business partner to launch a scheme of this kind . as many commentators have pointed out , the cheap flights era has led to market absurdities .

" that call is likely to fall on deaf ears when the eu leaders gather in brussels on thursday . but as a survey published last week showed , the german public is way ahead of its political leaders when it comes to the lifestyle changes needed to counter environmental damage . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : global warming could devastate ski resorts after a record warm november delayed snowfall in the alps , a new oecd report has warned that climate change poses " serious risks " to snow reliability in ski areas and could dramatically impact their economies .

-lrb- constitutional regulations , laws against xenophobia etc . -rrb- wippermann : the main difference lies not in the political system , but concerns the people involved .
extremist organizations need strong leaders to be successful .
but le pen , while a charismatic leader in the past , is now too old for anyone to consider him powerful .
however , the german equivalent , gerhard frey , still pales into insignificance beside him .
and that is one reason why it is unlikely that frey would ever be able to reach a similar level .
strong german fascism is inconceivable without a " führer . " that is not to say that there is no danger of this happening in germany again .
while there are laws that prevent the glorification of the third reich and forbid anti-semitism , there is still a burgeoning far-right movement in germany , in particular in the former east german states where there are even " no-go areas " controlled by extremists which present a great risk to foreigners should they enter them .
also , recent research shows that at least 20 percent of germans profess hatred towards foreigners while 40 percent admit to anti-semitic feelings and even more , 64-68 percent holds grudges against roma and gypsies . are there any laws and structures in place in germany to prevent a radical right-wing leader from rising to power ? while there are rules in place which protect the constitution in germany , most have been installed to prevent a repeat of germany 's history but are out-dated when dealing with modern fascism . what are the social differences between france and germany which allow le pen to have such support ? le pen taps into the anti-democratic and napoleonic tradition of fascism in france .
there is the heightened fear of the foreigner , especially arab muslim immigrants who are blamed for all the sins in france , mainly unemployment and crime .
the issue of unemployment for the native citizens is one which is also a hot topic in germany .
turkish immigrants in germany are seen in the very same way as north african immigrants are in france .
but in france , there is a very strong movement for " france for the french , " something which the germans would not allow due to their history of nationalism . le pen is seen as a man of the people who has struggled and felt the pain of the common man in dealing with the hardships which have been brought on france allegedly by the foreigner .
germany has no connection like that with its far-right movement . is it possible that a social change could happen in modern germany where a figure like le pen achieves credibility and support within the electorate ? yes and no .
the germans from today are , according to my appraisals after teaching history for 30 years , better at learning from their fascist past than the french and are better at appraising the present dangers .
however , it can not be said that democracy is anchored in germany more firmly than it is in france .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 05.03.2007 " strong german fascism is inconceivable without a führer " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chances of a leader like le pen rising to power is unlikely , says prof. wippermann far-right expert prof. wolfgang wippermann spoke to dw-world.de about jean-marie le pen and the possibility of such a leader and a movement like his national front gaining similar prominence in germany . professor wolfgang wippermann is a lecturer of modern politics and the free university in berlin and an author of works on far-right extremism , the third reich and the holocaust . dw-world.de : what are the differences between the french political system and the german one which allow a right-wing extremist like jean-marie le pen to campaign and operate at the highest level in france ?
-lrb- constitutional regulations , laws against xenophobia etc . -rrb- wippermann : the main difference lies not in the political system , but concerns the people involved .
extremist organizations need strong leaders to be successful .
but le pen , while a charismatic leader in the past , is now too old for anyone to consider him powerful .
however , the german equivalent , gerhard frey , still pales into insignificance beside him .
and that is one reason why it is unlikely that frey would ever be able to reach a similar level .
strong german fascism is inconceivable without a " führer . " that is not to say that there is no danger of this happening in germany again .
while there are laws that prevent the glorification of the third reich and forbid anti-semitism , there is still a burgeoning far-right movement in germany , in particular in the former east german states where there are even " no-go areas " controlled by extremists which present a great risk to foreigners should they enter them .
also , recent research shows that at least 20 percent of germans profess hatred towards foreigners while 40 percent admit to anti-semitic feelings and even more , 64-68 percent holds grudges against roma and gypsies . are there any laws and structures in place in germany to prevent a radical right-wing leader from rising to power ? while there are rules in place which protect the constitution in germany , most have been installed to prevent a repeat of germany 's history but are out-dated when dealing with modern fascism . what are the social differences between france and germany which allow le pen to have such support ? le pen taps into the anti-democratic and napoleonic tradition of fascism in france .
there is the heightened fear of the foreigner , especially arab muslim immigrants who are blamed for all the sins in france , mainly unemployment and crime .
the issue of unemployment for the native citizens is one which is also a hot topic in germany .
turkish immigrants in germany are seen in the very same way as north african immigrants are in france .
but in france , there is a very strong movement for " france for the french , " something which the germans would not allow due to their history of nationalism . le pen is seen as a man of the people who has struggled and felt the pain of the common man in dealing with the hardships which have been brought on france allegedly by the foreigner .

his new album and upcoming tour have generated huge excitement in german-speaking countries and little interest anywhere else . grönemeyer 's new album " 12 " is already muscling its way onto the german music charts . at 50 , grönemeyer is one of germany 's biggest celebrities while remaining virtually unknown in europe or the united states .
one of the reasons might be that his playful , poetic german lyrics do n't translate that well . yet the language barrier has n't stopped the singer from selling millions of albums and becoming one of the best-known and well-loved of germany 's pop rock stars .

his breakthrough was the cult-song " männer " or " men . "
the album of the same name stayed on the charts for 79 weeks . he also did some acting , playing a war correspondent in the german film " das boot . "
his performance in the successful film made grönemeyer one of germany 's most well-known stars . in 1998 , grönemeyer suffered a double tragedy : he lost both his wife and brother to cancer .
in the wake of those deaths , he almost entirely disappeared from public .
but four years later , he returned with the album " mensch , " or " human , " which sold more than three million copies . a spring tour supporting his has already sold 800,000 tickets , making grönemeyer one of the few pop music artists who can claim to sell out a venue without selling out . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german ngos urge government to keep g8 promises an alliance of german ngos represented by singer and activist herbert grönemeyer has called on the government to devote more resources to fighting poverty and to live up to its aid promises ahead of the next g8 summit .

"
an intense debate has begun in germany on the kind of lifestyle changes needed to cut greenhouse gas emissions , days before eu leaders hold a summit on energy and climate change .
holidaying at home is one suggestion . the call from green party parliamentary leader renate kunast for spending vacations in germany to become fashionable once more was predictable , but the support she received from other parts of the political spectrum was less so . werner schnappauf , environment minister for bavaria 's conservative christian social party , said germans should change their lifestyles .
" learn to value the qualities close to where you live , " was his contribution to an increasingly lively debate . the deputy parliamentary leader of the social democrats , ulrich kelber , called for germans to avoid flights as far as possible as their own " private contribution " to halting climate change .
holidays in germany and neighboring countries could be " lovely , " kelber said , extolling the virtues of train travel . ever since germany 's postwar boom , the so-called wirtschaftswunder -lrb- economic miracle -rrb- , germans have been avid travelers . german tourists first to travel en masse far and wide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tourists bring good business to holiday destinations the mediterranean came first as the trendy holiday destination .
east africa , latin america , the caribbean and the far east soon followed . trinket shops in every corner of the world - at least every sunny corner - have for decades posted the sign : " man spricht deutsch " -lrb- german spoken here -rrb- in their windows in the hope of earning solid deutsche marks or euros . but now " sylt not the seychelles , " is the holidaying slogan , in reference to the island just off the baltic coast where germany 's beautiful people have long spent weekends . the tourist industry is ready to take the change in its stride , well aware that margins on the long-haul flights are now minimal compared with what can be earned from up-market destinations closer to home . " in many circles it will no longer be chic in a couple of years to pollute the environment with tons of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- while on holiday , " said martin buck , director of berlin 's international tourist bourse , which opens wednesday . cheap flights and package tours in danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap holiday ?
walk this way buck predicted that companies offering the traditional package tour were about to face serious problems . the figures are convincing .
according to andreas tröge , head of germany 's federal environment agency , a return flight to thailand " costs " six tons of co2 , while a return train journey from berlin to the baltic weighs in at just 35 kilograms -lrb- 77 pounds -rrb- . federal environment minister sigmar gabriel has demanded that airlines offer customers the option of paying a supplement to fund projects to compensate for the co2 consumed on the flight . national flag carrier lufthansa has said it is looking for a business partner to launch a scheme of this kind . as many commentators have pointed out , the cheap flights era has led to market absurdities .
taxi ride to airports in most european cities now cost considerably more than flights to mallorca , rimini , corfu or adana . change in lifestyle greenpeace germany 's head , brigitte behrens , voiced the opinion of many when she told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper : " cheap flights should be banned . " that call is likely to fall on deaf ears when the eu leaders gather in brussels on thursday . but as a survey published last week showed , the german public is way ahead of its political leaders when it comes to the lifestyle changes needed to counter environmental damage . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : global warming could devastate ski resorts after a record warm november delayed snowfall in the alps , a new oecd report has warned that climate change poses " serious risks " to snow reliability in ski areas and could dramatically impact their economies .
-lrb- 13.12.2006 -rrb- germany up in arms over minister 's holiday comments germany 's finance minister has sparked outrage by suggesting germans should spend less on their annual holidays and instead put money aside for their old age .
the comments have sparked a lively debate about the economy .

in the country of autobahns , the latter might be partly to blame .

" any attempt to revise the history of world war two needs to be watched carefully , " he told reporters on monday , saying such a revision posed a danger to poland and europe .
" i hope the process in germany will be stopped . " the film 's producers and actors said they intended for the film , whose second installment will be broadcast monday , to strike a chord with viewers . " i hope our film contributes to young and old people talking to each other about the worst chapter of german history , " said actress maria furtwängler , who plays the countess lena . director kai wessel , however , said he did not think attention would focus so closely on where guilt lays or vengeance , adding that he had only wanted to create a personal film that stayed true to the victims ' perspective . bildunterschrift : just over 13 percent of germans are estimated to have seen the series ' first installment german suffering long a taboo topic germans have long shied away from discussing their 14 million countrymen who fled the soviet army or were expelled after the allies allowed their eviction from poland , hungary and czechoslovakia .
historians estimate that some 2 million people died or were killed in the flight that began when the fall of the nazi regime became clear in 1944 . culture minister bernd neumann was among the germans lauding the film , which also shows soviet troops shooting children and raping women , as a cinematic achievement that brought the plight of german expellees to light . " no one wants to offset one side 's suffering against the other , " margot kässmann , a german protestant church leader , told the bild am sonntag newspaper as a debate erupted over why germans have long been silent . " but reconciliation will only be possible when those guilty acknowledge their crimes and victims get a chance to tell their stories , " added kässmann , whose family was among the refugees . latest in chain of tv dramas afraid it could be misconstrued as lessening the atrocities committed by the nazis during world war ii , other political leaders have avoided the issue of german suffering .
a similar debate over whether germans could be portrayed as victims ensued last year when " dresden , " a tv series on the firebombing of the eastern german city , earned high ratings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " dresden " centered on the city 's firebombing and an english-german love story " it was a national trauma and 60 years later , it was time to make a film seen from the victims ' point of view , " said jan mojto , a slovak national and head of munich-based eos film , which co-produced the nine-million-euro -lrb- $ 11.7-million -rrb- project . a berlin museum about the expelled germans that opened last year also sparked controversy .
polish leaders said it was an attempt by germans to portray themselves as victims of a war they started . " the problem in our view is not that the issue is being discussed , but how , " marek cichocki , foreign policy adviser to polish president lech kaczynski , told a german tv talk show on sunday .
" it focuses on individuals but blots out the bigger picture .
it 's disturbing that so much emphasis is on individual -lrb- suffering -rrb- , not the broader history . " the welt am sonntag newspaper said the drama was careful not to take sides . " germans are treated as both criminals and victims , " it wrote .
" it does n't pass judgment but rather depicts all the horrors .
that 's a prudent approach because there are no obvious answers .

divisions according to country of origin and theological differences have hindered past considerations about joining forces . muslims realize they would benefit from having one voice and are determined to develop an organization that would provide united representation , bekir alboga , leader of a turkish religious organization , told the newspaper . in september , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble hosted a " conference on islam .

it was the first time federal authorities had launched a dialogue with the country 's muslim minority . at that conference , schäuble mentioned the idea of an umbrella organization .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 05.03.2007 merkel sets ambitious green agenda ahead of eu summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants the eu in the forefront of climate protection and energy policy german chancellor angela merkel is advocating an eu action plan that would position europe as the global frontrunner for renewable energy and greenhouse gas reductions .
she will make her case at an upcoming eu summit . in the run-up to her first summit as president of the european union , the german chancellor told munich-based daily süddeutsche zeitung on sunday that european leaders " are going to ratify an action plan for climate protection and energy policy that is more concrete than ever before in the history of the european union . " but central proposals of the action plan are bound to cause contentious debate at the summit on thursday and friday .
the plan includes a commitment to supply 20 percent of europe 's energy needs from renewable sources such as wind power , a leading industry in germany . after an early round of informal talks in brussels on monday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier admitted that " the obligation of the 20 percent goal will still need to be negotiated at the summit . "
france and finland , for example , have signalled their reluctance to accept the binding goal for fear that it could jeopardize their national energy mix . chancellor merkel also plans to push for a europe-wide reduction of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , the man-made greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming .
the proposed plan would require the european states to reduce their overall co2-output by 20 percent below 1990-levels .
the 27 eu member states have agreed in principle to set this goal for 2020 , but will have to ratify the plan at the summit in order for it to become binding . member states have already agreed on a 10 percent increase of bio-fuels - such as ethanol gained from corn crops - over the next three years , assuming sufficient amounts of bio-fuel can be produced to meet the demand . europe becoming global role model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bio-fuels and modern engines significantly reduce the amount of co2 emissions from vehicles germany has assumed a lead role in pushing the environmental envelope and has already achieved a near-20 percent national reduction of co2 emissions below the levels of 1990 .
if the eu action plan is ratified , germany could reduce its overall co2 output by as much as 40 percent .
but not all member states will be held up to this high standard ; lower goals will be set for economically weaker eu countries . the action plan would also propel europe to the forefront of the global movement to mitigate the effects of global warming .
chancellor merkel spoke of a " paradigm shift " in sunday 's interview with the german daily : " so far , european nations made their own energy policy , " but " all that is now up for negotiation . " the german presidency of this year 's g8 summit will also allow merkel to talk to developing nations about alternative energy policies .
referring to the g8 summit , which will take place in june in the northern german resort town of heiligendamm , merkel specifically mentioned china , india , mexico , brazil and south africa . indeed , china appeared to hop on the green bandwagon prematurely on monday , as chinese premier wen jiabao vowed in his annual state of the nation address to curb " inefficient " economic growth and " excessive energy consumption . " merkel also told the süddeutsche zeitung that a rethinking of environmental policies was taking place in the united states .

she will make her case at an upcoming eu summit . in the run-up to her first summit as president of the european union , the german chancellor told munich-based daily süddeutsche zeitung on sunday that european leaders " are going to ratify an action plan for climate protection and energy policy that is more concrete than ever before in the history of the european union . " but central proposals of the action plan are bound to cause contentious debate at the summit on thursday and friday .
the plan includes a commitment to supply 20 percent of europe 's energy needs from renewable sources such as wind power , a leading industry in germany . after an early round of informal talks in brussels on monday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier admitted that " the obligation of the 20 percent goal will still need to be negotiated at the summit . "
france and finland , for example , have signalled their reluctance to accept the binding goal for fear that it could jeopardize their national energy mix . chancellor merkel also plans to push for a europe-wide reduction of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , the man-made greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming .
the proposed plan would require the european states to reduce their overall co2-output by 20 percent below 1990-levels .
the 27 eu member states have agreed in principle to set this goal for 2020 , but will have to ratify the plan at the summit in order for it to become binding . member states have already agreed on a 10 percent increase of bio-fuels - such as ethanol gained from corn crops - over the next three years , assuming sufficient amounts of bio-fuel can be produced to meet the demand . europe becoming global role model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bio-fuels and modern engines significantly reduce the amount of co2 emissions from vehicles germany has assumed a lead role in pushing the environmental envelope and has already achieved a near-20 percent national reduction of co2 emissions below the levels of 1990 .
if the eu action plan is ratified , germany could reduce its overall co2 output by as much as 40 percent .
but not all member states will be held up to this high standard ; lower goals will be set for economically weaker eu countries . the action plan would also propel europe to the forefront of the global movement to mitigate the effects of global warming .
chancellor merkel spoke of a " paradigm shift " in sunday 's interview with the german daily : " so far , european nations made their own energy policy , " but " all that is now up for negotiation . " the german presidency of this year 's g8 summit will also allow merkel to talk to developing nations about alternative energy policies .
referring to the g8 summit , which will take place in june in the northern german resort town of heiligendamm , merkel specifically mentioned china , india , mexico , brazil and south africa . indeed , china appeared to hop on the green bandwagon prematurely on monday , as chinese premier wen jiabao vowed in his annual state of the nation address to curb " inefficient " economic growth and " excessive energy consumption . " merkel also told the süddeutsche zeitung that a rethinking of environmental policies was taking place in the united states .
she described " remarkable " progress there in the development of bio-fuels , but also said governments needed to " set the proper parameters " for the agricultural shifts this technology will likely bring about .

she will make her case at an upcoming eu summit . in the run-up to her first summit as president of the european union , the german chancellor told munich-based daily süddeutsche zeitung on sunday that european leaders " are going to ratify an action plan for climate protection and energy policy that is more concrete than ever before in the history of the european union . " but central proposals of the action plan are bound to cause contentious debate at the summit on thursday and friday .
the plan includes a commitment to supply 20 percent of europe 's energy needs from renewable sources such as wind power , a leading industry in germany . after an early round of informal talks in brussels on monday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier admitted that " the obligation of the 20 percent goal will still need to be negotiated at the summit . "
france and finland , for example , have signalled their reluctance to accept the binding goal for fear that it could jeopardize their national energy mix . chancellor merkel also plans to push for a europe-wide reduction of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , the man-made greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming .
the proposed plan would require the european states to reduce their overall co2-output by 20 percent below 1990-levels .
the 27 eu member states have agreed in principle to set this goal for 2020 , but will have to ratify the plan at the summit in order for it to become binding . member states have already agreed on a 10 percent increase of bio-fuels - such as ethanol gained from corn crops - over the next three years , assuming sufficient amounts of bio-fuel can be produced to meet the demand . europe becoming global role model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bio-fuels and modern engines significantly reduce the amount of co2 emissions from vehicles germany has assumed a lead role in pushing the environmental envelope and has already achieved a near-20 percent national reduction of co2 emissions below the levels of 1990 .
if the eu action plan is ratified , germany could reduce its overall co2 output by as much as 40 percent .
but not all member states will be held up to this high standard ; lower goals will be set for economically weaker eu countries . the action plan would also propel europe to the forefront of the global movement to mitigate the effects of global warming .
chancellor merkel spoke of a " paradigm shift " in sunday 's interview with the german daily : " so far , european nations made their own energy policy , " but " all that is now up for negotiation . " the german presidency of this year 's g8 summit will also allow merkel to talk to developing nations about alternative energy policies .
referring to the g8 summit , which will take place in june in the northern german resort town of heiligendamm , merkel specifically mentioned china , india , mexico , brazil and south africa . indeed , china appeared to hop on the green bandwagon prematurely on monday , as chinese premier wen jiabao vowed in his annual state of the nation address to curb " inefficient " economic growth and " excessive energy consumption .

his new album and upcoming tour have generated huge excitement in german-speaking countries and little interest anywhere else . grönemeyer 's new album " 12 " is already muscling its way onto the german music charts . at 50 , grönemeyer is one of germany 's biggest celebrities while remaining virtually unknown in europe or the united states .
one of the reasons might be that his playful , poetic german lyrics do n't translate that well . yet the language barrier has n't stopped the singer from selling millions of albums and becoming one of the best-known and well-loved of germany 's pop rock stars .
a new grönemeyer release usually generates glowing reviews and sold-out concerts . so it 's no surprise that german critics have heaped praise on grönemeyer 's latest release , which was released friday . the album 's energetic single " ein stück von himmel , " or " a piece of heaven , " has already topped the charts and gone into rotation on german mtv . berlinonline calls it " intoxicating and simply grandiose . " the german bono bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics love grönemeyer 's new album " 12 " many of grönemeyer 's lyrics deal with political issues .
he has been outspoken opponent of nuclear power and racism and makes frequent calls for tolerance and peace .
he continues to be involved with efforts to end poverty in africa . grönemeyer began his singing career in the early 1980s in his hometown of bochum .
his breakthrough was the cult-song " männer " or " men . "
the album of the same name stayed on the charts for 79 weeks . he also did some acting , playing a war correspondent in the german film " das boot . "
his performance in the successful film made grönemeyer one of germany 's most well-known stars . in 1998 , grönemeyer suffered a double tragedy : he lost both his wife and brother to cancer .
in the wake of those deaths , he almost entirely disappeared from public .
but four years later , he returned with the album " mensch , " or " human , " which sold more than three million copies . a spring tour supporting his has already sold 800,000 tickets , making grönemeyer one of the few pop music artists who can claim to sell out a venue without selling out . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german ngos urge government to keep g8 promises an alliance of german ngos represented by singer and activist herbert grönemeyer has called on the government to devote more resources to fighting poverty and to live up to its aid promises ahead of the next g8 summit .

le pen on the presidential campaign trail for over 30 years , jean-marie le pen has campaigned at the top of french politics .
while labeled an anti-semite and rascist by some , he still commands enough support to add a dark dimension to the presidential election . from the earliest steps on the campaign trail , the french presidential election has been viewed as a two-horse race .
despite the wily incumbent jacques chirac 's mischievous ambiguity over whether he would run again and the emergence of rising centrist francois bayrou , the majority of bets have been split between interior minister nicolas sarkozy of the ruling conservative party or socialist challenger segolene royal taking over at the elysee palace . but in the current campaign , as has been the case in the last four presidential elections , there is a dark horse stalking the main candidates .
while sarkozy 's and royal 's people are busy putting out the fires from gaffes and scandals , a man who is no stranger to controversy in once again making a play for the top job in french politics . jean-marie le pen is back . the national front leader recently launched the fifth presidential election bid of his long career with the hope that he can go one better than in the 2002 campaign when he made it to the second-round run-off .
by becoming the one alternative to chirac in that election , the first in which he made it that far , le pen shocked the french political establishment , sent tremors through europe and ended the political career of socialist prime minister lionel jospin on the way .
it was the fear of seeing le pen in the elysee which drove voters on left and right to re-elect chirac by 82 percent . anti-immigration , nationalist bandwagon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : le pen plays on the fears of urban violence in france now it seems that after five more years of chirac , france has forgotten that fear .
le pen is in the mix again , and while his current campaign is less assured in the preliminary stages as it was in 2002 , the far-right stalwart is beginning to work up a head of steam with a populist manifesto built on promises to end immigration , pull france out of nato and slash taxes for the french only . the fact that le pen is once again contesting the presidency is a testament to his tenacity .
a street fighter in his youth - he lost an eye in one scuffle - and a former paratrooper and foreign legionnaire who saw active service in indochina and algeria , le pen is used to battles . in some ways , he is the epitome of the political survivor .
he is a man who has been convicted several times for remarks about jews or the holocaust , calling the nazi gas chambers " a detail of history " and describing the german occupation of france as " relatively humane . "
he dismissed the attacks on the twin towers on september 11 , 2001 , as an " incident , " and complained before the 1998 world cup that the french soccer team was not white enough .
and yet , despite his behavior and stance , le pen and his national front party still enjoy widespread support . greatest support in years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a third of french people find le pen unacceptable recent poll results published in the french newspaper le monde showed support for le pen at its highest levels in years , even better than in the run-up to the 2002 election where he polled 18.9 per cent , nearly 5.5 million voters .
in 1997 nearly half of french people saw le pen 's ideas as unacceptable ; now only a third think so . that a man with such extremist views can still compete at the top of french politics says much about the continued disillusionment with the political leadership within french society . le pen rose to prominence in the early 1970 's with a populist mix of anti-immigrant , pro-employment , and law-and-order promises .
and in the 30 years or more since he founded the national front , more immigrants have arrived in france , unemployment has become more of a problem and crime and unrest more prominent .
le pen has continually revamped his core policies to play to the fears of what he calls " france 's silent majority , " the grassroots voters who struggle to be heard above the nation 's " technocratic elite . " " le pen has enjoyed a shift in his voter base from urban to rural areas and from the young to elderly , " nonna mayer , an expert on french far-right politics from the research center for political science in paris , told dw-world.de.
" he has succeeded in extending and diversifying his social base .
this is one reason why he remains so relevant even in modern france . " appeal to disgruntled workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french farmers regularly protest against the government just as in the 2002 election , le pen is campaigning on a strong anti-immigration platform , blaming the " invasion " of foreigners for france 's rising unemployment , urban violence and what he calls " general impoverishment . "
he is also relying on the " humble workers " vote as he did five years ago , pandering to the discontent of blue-collar employees and farmers . the state of france 's agricultural sector has given le pen a new , powerful voting pool . " voting for the extreme right is developing in rural areas , " says mayer .
" in 1988 , voters in the large cities were most likely to vote for le pen .
in 1995 , his influence extended to middle-sized conurbations .
in 2002 , he was attracting voters in small towns of less than 2000 inhabitants . " mayer believes that this shows that le pen has maintained his political longevity by pinpointing issues that effect the diverse sections of french society ; urban crime for big city dwellers , loss of french identity through immigration for middle-class citizens , and loss of jobs and threat to industry for the working classes .
how ever distasteful his approach , he is seen by many as being the only candidate to address the issues that matter to them . le pen has also won support throughout his career due to the general disaffection the populace has with its leaders .
before the 2002 vote , 83 percent of voters polled said that " politicians do not care what people like us think " and 58 percent said that french politicians were " somewhat corrupt . " wake-up call bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all those who vote for him want le pen as president " the conditions were ideal for a protest vote in favor of le pen , " mayer said .
" it was a protest vote because although they agree massively with his ideas on immigration and law-and-order , most voters do n't want him to implement them .
only 41 percent of those who voted for le pen in 2002 actually wanted him to be elected . " votes for le pen , it seems , are used as a wake-up call for france to deal with the real problems in the society .
however , the need for him to continue to run shows that these calls are far from being heeded . this year , it is still unclear whether le pen will even make it into the presidential election race .
he is struggling to gain the backing of 500 elected officials needed to register formally by march 16 .
but if he does make into the first round , no one can rule out that his true supporters , and those registering another protest vote , can push the far-right leader into another run-off for the elysee and cause another european political earthquake . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " strong german fascism is inconceivable without a führer " far-right expert prof. wolfgang wippermann spoke to dw-world.de about jean-marie le pen and the possibility of such a leader and a movement like his national front gaining similar prominence in germany .

how ever distasteful his approach , he is seen by many as being the only candidate to address the issues that matter to them . le pen has also won support throughout his career due to the general disaffection the populace has with its leaders .
before the 2002 vote , 83 percent of voters polled said that " politicians do not care what people like us think " and 58 percent said that french politicians were " somewhat corrupt . " wake-up call bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all those who vote for him want le pen as president " the conditions were ideal for a protest vote in favor of le pen , " mayer said .
" it was a protest vote because although they agree massively with his ideas on immigration and law-and-order , most voters do n't want him to implement them .
only 41 percent of those who voted for le pen in 2002 actually wanted him to be elected . " votes for le pen , it seems , are used as a wake-up call for france to deal with the real problems in the society .
however , the need for him to continue to run shows that these calls are far from being heeded . this year , it is still unclear whether le pen will even make it into the presidential election race .
he is struggling to gain the backing of 500 elected officials needed to register formally by march 16 .
but if he does make into the first round , no one can rule out that his true supporters , and those registering another protest vote , can push the far-right leader into another run-off for the elysee and cause another european political earthquake . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " strong german fascism is inconceivable without a führer " far-right expert prof. wolfgang wippermann spoke to dw-world.de about jean-marie le pen and the possibility of such a leader and a movement like his national front gaining similar prominence in germany .

"
an intense debate has begun in germany on the kind of lifestyle changes needed to cut greenhouse gas emissions , days before eu leaders hold a summit on energy and climate change .
holidaying at home is one suggestion . the call from green party parliamentary leader renate kunast for spending vacations in germany to become fashionable once more was predictable , but the support she received from other parts of the political spectrum was less so . werner schnappauf , environment minister for bavaria 's conservative christian social party , said germans should change their lifestyles .
" learn to value the qualities close to where you live , " was his contribution to an increasingly lively debate . the deputy parliamentary leader of the social democrats , ulrich kelber , called for germans to avoid flights as far as possible as their own " private contribution " to halting climate change .
holidays in germany and neighboring countries could be " lovely , " kelber said , extolling the virtues of train travel . ever since germany 's postwar boom , the so-called wirtschaftswunder -lrb- economic miracle -rrb- , germans have been avid travelers . german tourists first to travel en masse far and wide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tourists bring good business to holiday destinations the mediterranean came first as the trendy holiday destination .
east africa , latin america , the caribbean and the far east soon followed . trinket shops in every corner of the world - at least every sunny corner - have for decades posted the sign : " man spricht deutsch " -lrb- german spoken here -rrb- in their windows in the hope of earning solid deutsche marks or euros . but now " sylt not the seychelles , " is the holidaying slogan , in reference to the island just off the baltic coast where germany 's beautiful people have long spent weekends . the tourist industry is ready to take the change in its stride , well aware that margins on the long-haul flights are now minimal compared with what can be earned from up-market destinations closer to home . " in many circles it will no longer be chic in a couple of years to pollute the environment with tons of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- while on holiday , " said martin buck , director of berlin 's international tourist bourse , which opens wednesday . cheap flights and package tours in danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap holiday ?
walk this way buck predicted that companies offering the traditional package tour were about to face serious problems . the figures are convincing .
according to andreas tröge , head of germany 's federal environment agency , a return flight to thailand " costs " six tons of co2 , while a return train journey from berlin to the baltic weighs in at just 35 kilograms -lrb- 77 pounds -rrb- . federal environment minister sigmar gabriel has demanded that airlines offer customers the option of paying a supplement to fund projects to compensate for the co2 consumed on the flight . national flag carrier lufthansa has said it is looking for a business partner to launch a scheme of this kind . as many commentators have pointed out , the cheap flights era has led to market absurdities .
taxi ride to airports in most european cities now cost considerably more than flights to mallorca , rimini , corfu or adana . change in lifestyle greenpeace germany 's head , brigitte behrens , voiced the opinion of many when she told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper : " cheap flights should be banned . " that call is likely to fall on deaf ears when the eu leaders gather in brussels on thursday . but as a survey published last week showed , the german public is way ahead of its political leaders when it comes to the lifestyle changes needed to counter environmental damage . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : global warming could devastate ski resorts after a record warm november delayed snowfall in the alps , a new oecd report has warned that climate change poses " serious risks " to snow reliability in ski areas and could dramatically impact their economies .
-lrb- 13.12.2006 -rrb- germany up in arms over minister 's holiday comments germany 's finance minister has sparked outrage by suggesting germans should spend less on their annual holidays and instead put money aside for their old age .
the comments have sparked a lively debate about the economy .
-lrb- 20.08.2006 -rrb- luring tourists to a germany less traveled visits to germany 's more obscure destinations are rare by foreign tourists and even locals are often deterred .
in the country of autobahns , the latter might be partly to blame .

she said she was a regular visitor to the center " which offered cultural activities that you ca n't find anywhere else in denmark . " " i am not marginal .
i think that society should leave room for all types , and for alternative culture as well , for which youth house was a symbol , " she added . the politiken newspaper has put the cost of the riots , including smashed windows and torched vehicles and clean-up operations , at $ 2.4 million . dw staff / afp -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german left-wing agitators arrested in copenhagen raids police in copenhagen saturday raided numerous houses and arrested 90 suspects , german left-wing agitators among them , to prevent renewed outbreaks of violence after a third night of unrest in the danish capital .

workers wore face masks under their helmets to conceal their identities as an excavator slammed into the so-called " youth house , " a graffiti-sprayed brick building in the noerrebro district of the danish capital . the rioting started on march 1 when police anti-terror squad evicted long-term squatters from the building , triggering three nights of clashes with youth . at least 25 were injured as protesters hurled cobblestones at riot police and set fire to cars and trash bins in copenhagen 's worst riots in 14 years . some 647 people have been arrested - including 140 foreigners , mainly germans and scandinavians suspected of involvement in the disturbances .
another 227 have been taken into custody . countercultural hub sold the center has had a cult reputation in copenhagen since the 1980s when the city 's council gave punks and squatters permission to move in .
in 2001 the building was sold to a christian group , which applied to have the squatters evicted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dozens fought the eviction on march 1 , which sparked the riots according to ruth evenson , leader of the small christian congregation that bought the house in 2001 , the four-story structure was a " a total wreck .
it would cost us a fortune to have it fixed . "
she declined to reveal the congregation 's plans for the site . the demolition crews were under police protection as they began the task that authorities hope will end the violent dispute .
however fears that the demolition could spark further protests led police to cordon off the building in advance . tears as the bulldozers go in crowds of young people gathered as demolition work began on the building , which was constructed at the end of the 19th century as a community center . " why , why ? " demanded sarah , a tearful 14-year-old , who had skipped school and came to the scene when she heard " the sad news on the radio . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young couple watch as the demolition gets started " they think the problem will disappear under the threat of the bulldozers .
they are wrong .
they ca n't kill the spirit of this house , " she said . on sunday , one group laid flowers , lit candles and left farewell messages some 100 metres -lrb- 330 feet -rrb- from the building . a space for society 's fringe " i cried with sadness , and anger , " said marie , an 18-year-old student .
she said she was a regular visitor to the center " which offered cultural activities that you ca n't find anywhere else in denmark . " " i am not marginal .
i think that society should leave room for all types , and for alternative culture as well , for which youth house was a symbol , " she added . the politiken newspaper has put the cost of the riots , including smashed windows and torched vehicles and clean-up operations , at $ 2.4 million . dw staff / afp -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german left-wing agitators arrested in copenhagen raids police in copenhagen saturday raided numerous houses and arrested 90 suspects , german left-wing agitators among them , to prevent renewed outbreaks of violence after a third night of unrest in the danish capital .

le pen on the presidential campaign trail for over 30 years , jean-marie le pen has campaigned at the top of french politics .
while labeled an anti-semite and rascist by some , he still commands enough support to add a dark dimension to the presidential election . from the earliest steps on the campaign trail , the french presidential election has been viewed as a two-horse race .
despite the wily incumbent jacques chirac 's mischievous ambiguity over whether he would run again and the emergence of rising centrist francois bayrou , the majority of bets have been split between interior minister nicolas sarkozy of the ruling conservative party or socialist challenger segolene royal taking over at the elysee palace . but in the current campaign , as has been the case in the last four presidential elections , there is a dark horse stalking the main candidates .
while sarkozy 's and royal 's people are busy putting out the fires from gaffes and scandals , a man who is no stranger to controversy in once again making a play for the top job in french politics . jean-marie le pen is back . the national front leader recently launched the fifth presidential election bid of his long career with the hope that he can go one better than in the 2002 campaign when he made it to the second-round run-off .
by becoming the one alternative to chirac in that election , the first in which he made it that far , le pen shocked the french political establishment , sent tremors through europe and ended the political career of socialist prime minister lionel jospin on the way .
it was the fear of seeing le pen in the elysee which drove voters on left and right to re-elect chirac by 82 percent . anti-immigration , nationalist bandwagon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : le pen plays on the fears of urban violence in france now it seems that after five more years of chirac , france has forgotten that fear .
le pen is in the mix again , and while his current campaign is less assured in the preliminary stages as it was in 2002 , the far-right stalwart is beginning to work up a head of steam with a populist manifesto built on promises to end immigration , pull france out of nato and slash taxes for the french only . the fact that le pen is once again contesting the presidency is a testament to his tenacity .
a street fighter in his youth - he lost an eye in one scuffle - and a former paratrooper and foreign legionnaire who saw active service in indochina and algeria , le pen is used to battles . in some ways , he is the epitome of the political survivor .
he is a man who has been convicted several times for remarks about jews or the holocaust , calling the nazi gas chambers " a detail of history " and describing the german occupation of france as " relatively humane . "
he dismissed the attacks on the twin towers on september 11 , 2001 , as an " incident , " and complained before the 1998 world cup that the french soccer team was not white enough .
and yet , despite his behavior and stance , le pen and his national front party still enjoy widespread support . greatest support in years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a third of french people find le pen unacceptable recent poll results published in the french newspaper le monde showed support for le pen at its highest levels in years , even better than in the run-up to the 2002 election where he polled 18.9 per cent , nearly 5.5 million voters .
in 1997 nearly half of french people saw le pen 's ideas as unacceptable ; now only a third think so . that a man with such extremist views can still compete at the top of french politics says much about the continued disillusionment with the political leadership within french society . le pen rose to prominence in the early 1970 's with a populist mix of anti-immigrant , pro-employment , and law-and-order promises .
and in the 30 years or more since he founded the national front , more immigrants have arrived in france , unemployment has become more of a problem and crime and unrest more prominent .
le pen has continually revamped his core policies to play to the fears of what he calls " france 's silent majority , " the grassroots voters who struggle to be heard above the nation 's " technocratic elite . " " le pen has enjoyed a shift in his voter base from urban to rural areas and from the young to elderly , " nonna mayer , an expert on french far-right politics from the research center for political science in paris , told dw-world.de.
" he has succeeded in extending and diversifying his social base .
this is one reason why he remains so relevant even in modern france . " appeal to disgruntled workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french farmers regularly protest against the government just as in the 2002 election , le pen is campaigning on a strong anti-immigration platform , blaming the " invasion " of foreigners for france 's rising unemployment , urban violence and what he calls " general impoverishment . "
he is also relying on the " humble workers " vote as he did five years ago , pandering to the discontent of blue-collar employees and farmers . the state of france 's agricultural sector has given le pen a new , powerful voting pool . " voting for the extreme right is developing in rural areas , " says mayer .
" in 1988 , voters in the large cities were most likely to vote for le pen .
in 1995 , his influence extended to middle-sized conurbations .
in 2002 , he was attracting voters in small towns of less than 2000 inhabitants . " mayer believes that this shows that le pen has maintained his political longevity by pinpointing issues that effect the diverse sections of french society ; urban crime for big city dwellers , loss of french identity through immigration for middle-class citizens , and loss of jobs and threat to industry for the working classes .
how ever distasteful his approach , he is seen by many as being the only candidate to address the issues that matter to them . le pen has also won support throughout his career due to the general disaffection the populace has with its leaders .
before the 2002 vote , 83 percent of voters polled said that " politicians do not care what people like us think " and 58 percent said that french politicians were " somewhat corrupt . " wake-up call bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all those who vote for him want le pen as president " the conditions were ideal for a protest vote in favor of le pen , " mayer said .
" it was a protest vote because although they agree massively with his ideas on immigration and law-and-order , most voters do n't want him to implement them .
only 41 percent of those who voted for le pen in 2002 actually wanted him to be elected . " votes for le pen , it seems , are used as a wake-up call for france to deal with the real problems in the society .
however , the need for him to continue to run shows that these calls are far from being heeded . this year , it is still unclear whether le pen will even make it into the presidential election race .
he is struggling to gain the backing of 500 elected officials needed to register formally by march 16 .
but if he does make into the first round , no one can rule out that his true supporters , and those registering another protest vote , can push the far-right leader into another run-off for the elysee and cause another european political earthquake . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " strong german fascism is inconceivable without a führer " far-right expert prof. wolfgang wippermann spoke to dw-world.de about jean-marie le pen and the possibility of such a leader and a movement like his national front gaining similar prominence in germany .

he dismissed the attacks on the twin towers on september 11 , 2001 , as an " incident , " and complained before the 1998 world cup that the french soccer team was not white enough .
and yet , despite his behavior and stance , le pen and his national front party still enjoy widespread support . greatest support in years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a third of french people find le pen unacceptable recent poll results published in the french newspaper le monde showed support for le pen at its highest levels in years , even better than in the run-up to the 2002 election where he polled 18.9 per cent , nearly 5.5 million voters .
in 1997 nearly half of french people saw le pen 's ideas as unacceptable ; now only a third think so . that a man with such extremist views can still compete at the top of french politics says much about the continued disillusionment with the political leadership within french society . le pen rose to prominence in the early 1970 's with a populist mix of anti-immigrant , pro-employment , and law-and-order promises .
and in the 30 years or more since he founded the national front , more immigrants have arrived in france , unemployment has become more of a problem and crime and unrest more prominent .
le pen has continually revamped his core policies to play to the fears of what he calls " france 's silent majority , " the grassroots voters who struggle to be heard above the nation 's " technocratic elite . " " le pen has enjoyed a shift in his voter base from urban to rural areas and from the young to elderly , " nonna mayer , an expert on french far-right politics from the research center for political science in paris , told dw-world.de.
" he has succeeded in extending and diversifying his social base .
this is one reason why he remains so relevant even in modern france . " appeal to disgruntled workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french farmers regularly protest against the government just as in the 2002 election , le pen is campaigning on a strong anti-immigration platform , blaming the " invasion " of foreigners for france 's rising unemployment , urban violence and what he calls " general impoverishment . "
he is also relying on the " humble workers " vote as he did five years ago , pandering to the discontent of blue-collar employees and farmers . the state of france 's agricultural sector has given le pen a new , powerful voting pool .

" in 1988 , voters in the large cities were most likely to vote for le pen .
in 1995 , his influence extended to middle-sized conurbations .

" mayer believes that this shows that le pen has maintained his political longevity by pinpointing issues that effect the diverse sections of french society ; urban crime for big city dwellers , loss of french identity through immigration for middle-class citizens , and loss of jobs and threat to industry for the working classes .
how ever distasteful his approach , he is seen by many as being the only candidate to address the issues that matter to them . le pen has also won support throughout his career due to the general disaffection the populace has with its leaders .

le pen on the presidential campaign trail for over 30 years , jean-marie le pen has campaigned at the top of french politics .
while labeled an anti-semite and rascist by some , he still commands enough support to add a dark dimension to the presidential election . from the earliest steps on the campaign trail , the french presidential election has been viewed as a two-horse race .
despite the wily incumbent jacques chirac 's mischievous ambiguity over whether he would run again and the emergence of rising centrist francois bayrou , the majority of bets have been split between interior minister nicolas sarkozy of the ruling conservative party or socialist challenger segolene royal taking over at the elysee palace . but in the current campaign , as has been the case in the last four presidential elections , there is a dark horse stalking the main candidates .
while sarkozy 's and royal 's people are busy putting out the fires from gaffes and scandals , a man who is no stranger to controversy in once again making a play for the top job in french politics . jean-marie le pen is back . the national front leader recently launched the fifth presidential election bid of his long career with the hope that he can go one better than in the 2002 campaign when he made it to the second-round run-off .
by becoming the one alternative to chirac in that election , the first in which he made it that far , le pen shocked the french political establishment , sent tremors through europe and ended the political career of socialist prime minister lionel jospin on the way .
it was the fear of seeing le pen in the elysee which drove voters on left and right to re-elect chirac by 82 percent . anti-immigration , nationalist bandwagon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : le pen plays on the fears of urban violence in france now it seems that after five more years of chirac , france has forgotten that fear .
le pen is in the mix again , and while his current campaign is less assured in the preliminary stages as it was in 2002 , the far-right stalwart is beginning to work up a head of steam with a populist manifesto built on promises to end immigration , pull france out of nato and slash taxes for the french only . the fact that le pen is once again contesting the presidency is a testament to his tenacity .
a street fighter in his youth - he lost an eye in one scuffle - and a former paratrooper and foreign legionnaire who saw active service in indochina and algeria , le pen is used to battles . in some ways , he is the epitome of the political survivor .
he is a man who has been convicted several times for remarks about jews or the holocaust , calling the nazi gas chambers " a detail of history " and describing the german occupation of france as " relatively humane . "

"
an intense debate has begun in germany on the kind of lifestyle changes needed to cut greenhouse gas emissions , days before eu leaders hold a summit on energy and climate change .
holidaying at home is one suggestion . the call from green party parliamentary leader renate kunast for spending vacations in germany to become fashionable once more was predictable , but the support she received from other parts of the political spectrum was less so . werner schnappauf , environment minister for bavaria 's conservative christian social party , said germans should change their lifestyles .
" learn to value the qualities close to where you live , " was his contribution to an increasingly lively debate . the deputy parliamentary leader of the social democrats , ulrich kelber , called for germans to avoid flights as far as possible as their own " private contribution " to halting climate change .
holidays in germany and neighboring countries could be " lovely , " kelber said , extolling the virtues of train travel . ever since germany 's postwar boom , the so-called wirtschaftswunder -lrb- economic miracle -rrb- , germans have been avid travelers . german tourists first to travel en masse far and wide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tourists bring good business to holiday destinations the mediterranean came first as the trendy holiday destination .
east africa , latin america , the caribbean and the far east soon followed . trinket shops in every corner of the world - at least every sunny corner - have for decades posted the sign : " man spricht deutsch " -lrb- german spoken here -rrb- in their windows in the hope of earning solid deutsche marks or euros . but now " sylt not the seychelles , " is the holidaying slogan , in reference to the island just off the baltic coast where germany 's beautiful people have long spent weekends . the tourist industry is ready to take the change in its stride , well aware that margins on the long-haul flights are now minimal compared with what can be earned from up-market destinations closer to home . " in many circles it will no longer be chic in a couple of years to pollute the environment with tons of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- while on holiday , " said martin buck , director of berlin 's international tourist bourse , which opens wednesday . cheap flights and package tours in danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap holiday ?
walk this way buck predicted that companies offering the traditional package tour were about to face serious problems . the figures are convincing .
according to andreas tröge , head of germany 's federal environment agency , a return flight to thailand " costs " six tons of co2 , while a return train journey from berlin to the baltic weighs in at just 35 kilograms -lrb- 77 pounds -rrb- . federal environment minister sigmar gabriel has demanded that airlines offer customers the option of paying a supplement to fund projects to compensate for the co2 consumed on the flight . national flag carrier lufthansa has said it is looking for a business partner to launch a scheme of this kind . as many commentators have pointed out , the cheap flights era has led to market absurdities .
taxi ride to airports in most european cities now cost considerably more than flights to mallorca , rimini , corfu or adana . change in lifestyle greenpeace germany 's head , brigitte behrens , voiced the opinion of many when she told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper : " cheap flights should be banned . " that call is likely to fall on deaf ears when the eu leaders gather in brussels on thursday . but as a survey published last week showed , the german public is way ahead of its political leaders when it comes to the lifestyle changes needed to counter environmental damage . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : global warming could devastate ski resorts after a record warm november delayed snowfall in the alps , a new oecd report has warned that climate change poses " serious risks " to snow reliability in ski areas and could dramatically impact their economies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 05.03.2007 merkel sets ambitious green agenda ahead of eu summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants the eu in the forefront of climate protection and energy policy german chancellor angela merkel is advocating an eu action plan that would position europe as the global frontrunner for renewable energy and greenhouse gas reductions .
she will make her case at an upcoming eu summit . in the run-up to her first summit as president of the european union , the german chancellor told munich-based daily süddeutsche zeitung on sunday that european leaders " are going to ratify an action plan for climate protection and energy policy that is more concrete than ever before in the history of the european union . " but central proposals of the action plan are bound to cause contentious debate at the summit on thursday and friday .
the plan includes a commitment to supply 20 percent of europe 's energy needs from renewable sources such as wind power , a leading industry in germany . after an early round of informal talks in brussels on monday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier admitted that " the obligation of the 20 percent goal will still need to be negotiated at the summit . "
france and finland , for example , have signalled their reluctance to accept the binding goal for fear that it could jeopardize their national energy mix . chancellor merkel also plans to push for a europe-wide reduction of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , the man-made greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming .
the proposed plan would require the european states to reduce their overall co2-output by 20 percent below 1990-levels .
the 27 eu member states have agreed in principle to set this goal for 2020 , but will have to ratify the plan at the summit in order for it to become binding . member states have already agreed on a 10 percent increase of bio-fuels - such as ethanol gained from corn crops - over the next three years , assuming sufficient amounts of bio-fuel can be produced to meet the demand . europe becoming global role model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bio-fuels and modern engines significantly reduce the amount of co2 emissions from vehicles germany has assumed a lead role in pushing the environmental envelope and has already achieved a near-20 percent national reduction of co2 emissions below the levels of 1990 .
if the eu action plan is ratified , germany could reduce its overall co2 output by as much as 40 percent .
but not all member states will be held up to this high standard ; lower goals will be set for economically weaker eu countries . the action plan would also propel europe to the forefront of the global movement to mitigate the effects of global warming .
chancellor merkel spoke of a " paradigm shift " in sunday 's interview with the german daily : " so far , european nations made their own energy policy , " but " all that is now up for negotiation . " the german presidency of this year 's g8 summit will also allow merkel to talk to developing nations about alternative energy policies .
referring to the g8 summit , which will take place in june in the northern german resort town of heiligendamm , merkel specifically mentioned china , india , mexico , brazil and south africa . indeed , china appeared to hop on the green bandwagon prematurely on monday , as chinese premier wen jiabao vowed in his annual state of the nation address to curb " inefficient " economic growth and " excessive energy consumption . " merkel also told the süddeutsche zeitung that a rethinking of environmental policies was taking place in the united states .
she described " remarkable " progress there in the development of bio-fuels , but also said governments needed to " set the proper parameters " for the agricultural shifts this technology will likely bring about .
" once they identify a problem , " merkel said of the americans , " they develop a strong ambition to solve it .

"
an intense debate has begun in germany on the kind of lifestyle changes needed to cut greenhouse gas emissions , days before eu leaders hold a summit on energy and climate change .
holidaying at home is one suggestion . the call from green party parliamentary leader renate kunast for spending vacations in germany to become fashionable once more was predictable , but the support she received from other parts of the political spectrum was less so . werner schnappauf , environment minister for bavaria 's conservative christian social party , said germans should change their lifestyles .
" learn to value the qualities close to where you live , " was his contribution to an increasingly lively debate . the deputy parliamentary leader of the social democrats , ulrich kelber , called for germans to avoid flights as far as possible as their own " private contribution " to halting climate change .
holidays in germany and neighboring countries could be " lovely , " kelber said , extolling the virtues of train travel . ever since germany 's postwar boom , the so-called wirtschaftswunder -lrb- economic miracle -rrb- , germans have been avid travelers . german tourists first to travel en masse far and wide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tourists bring good business to holiday destinations the mediterranean came first as the trendy holiday destination .
east africa , latin america , the caribbean and the far east soon followed . trinket shops in every corner of the world - at least every sunny corner - have for decades posted the sign : " man spricht deutsch " -lrb- german spoken here -rrb- in their windows in the hope of earning solid deutsche marks or euros . but now " sylt not the seychelles , " is the holidaying slogan , in reference to the island just off the baltic coast where germany 's beautiful people have long spent weekends . the tourist industry is ready to take the change in its stride , well aware that margins on the long-haul flights are now minimal compared with what can be earned from up-market destinations closer to home . " in many circles it will no longer be chic in a couple of years to pollute the environment with tons of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- while on holiday , " said martin buck , director of berlin 's international tourist bourse , which opens wednesday . cheap flights and package tours in danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap holiday ?
walk this way buck predicted that companies offering the traditional package tour were about to face serious problems . the figures are convincing .
according to andreas tröge , head of germany 's federal environment agency , a return flight to thailand " costs " six tons of co2 , while a return train journey from berlin to the baltic weighs in at just 35 kilograms -lrb- 77 pounds -rrb- . federal environment minister sigmar gabriel has demanded that airlines offer customers the option of paying a supplement to fund projects to compensate for the co2 consumed on the flight . national flag carrier lufthansa has said it is looking for a business partner to launch a scheme of this kind . as many commentators have pointed out , the cheap flights era has led to market absurdities .
taxi ride to airports in most european cities now cost considerably more than flights to mallorca , rimini , corfu or adana . change in lifestyle greenpeace germany 's head , brigitte behrens , voiced the opinion of many when she told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper : " cheap flights should be banned . " that call is likely to fall on deaf ears when the eu leaders gather in brussels on thursday . but as a survey published last week showed , the german public is way ahead of its political leaders when it comes to the lifestyle changes needed to counter environmental damage . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : global warming could devastate ski resorts after a record warm november delayed snowfall in the alps , a new oecd report has warned that climate change poses " serious risks " to snow reliability in ski areas and could dramatically impact their economies .
-lrb- 13.12.2006 -rrb- germany up in arms over minister 's holiday comments germany 's finance minister has sparked outrage by suggesting germans should spend less on their annual holidays and instead put money aside for their old age .
the comments have sparked a lively debate about the economy .
-lrb- 20.08.2006 -rrb- luring tourists to a germany less traveled visits to germany 's more obscure destinations are rare by foreign tourists and even locals are often deterred .
in the country of autobahns , the latter might be partly to blame .

" in many circles it will no longer be chic in a couple of years to pollute the environment with tons of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- while on holiday , " said martin buck , director of berlin 's international tourist bourse , which opens wednesday . cheap flights and package tours in danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap holiday ?
walk this way buck predicted that companies offering the traditional package tour were about to face serious problems . the figures are convincing .
according to andreas tröge , head of germany 's federal environment agency , a return flight to thailand " costs " six tons of co2 , while a return train journey from berlin to the baltic weighs in at just 35 kilograms -lrb- 77 pounds -rrb- . federal environment minister sigmar gabriel has demanded that airlines offer customers the option of paying a supplement to fund projects to compensate for the co2 consumed on the flight . national flag carrier lufthansa has said it is looking for a business partner to launch a scheme of this kind . as many commentators have pointed out , the cheap flights era has led to market absurdities .
taxi ride to airports in most european cities now cost considerably more than flights to mallorca , rimini , corfu or adana . change in lifestyle greenpeace germany 's head , brigitte behrens , voiced the opinion of many when she told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper : " cheap flights should be banned . " that call is likely to fall on deaf ears when the eu leaders gather in brussels on thursday . but as a survey published last week showed , the german public is way ahead of its political leaders when it comes to the lifestyle changes needed to counter environmental damage . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : global warming could devastate ski resorts after a record warm november delayed snowfall in the alps , a new oecd report has warned that climate change poses " serious risks " to snow reliability in ski areas and could dramatically impact their economies .

" we count on russia being a reliable partner , " she said in an interview with the daily süddeutsche zeitung on monday .
" i therefore agree in principle to russia getting economically involved in europe .
but good economic relations between russia and the eu can only be based on reciprocity . " equally , we have an interest in acquiring the ownership rights to russian gas fields , " the chancellor said . eads not ready for more investors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the designer of the eurocopter , eads should stay in european hands , merkel said franco-german aerospace venture eads , however , is one company merkel said should not be open to russian investment . " at the moment , we should n't admit another stakeholder into the shareholder pact , " she said .
" but i support closer cooperation in aircraft construction , as eads has already begun to do . " the european aeronautic defense and space company is controlled jointly by france and germany , with the delicate balance of power resting on a complex construction of multiple shareholdings , both public and private . last summer , however , the russian state bought a stake of between 5 percent and 7 percent via state-controlled bank vneshtorgbank -lrb- vtb -rrb- and russia is believed to be eager to gain a greater say in eads . nevertheless , moscow has been keen to calm european concerns on the matter , with president vladimir putin insisting recently that russia wanted " cooperation " with eads , and had no plans for a " hostile takeover . " united response to russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus employees have taken to the street to protest a restructuring program shares in eads dropped by 8.6 percent last week after the announcement that its subsidiary aircraft manufacturer airbus would cut 10,000 jobs over four years , streamline its production facilities and reorganize the distribution of work between factories across europe . merkel also said it was important for the eu to act in a unified manner when dealing with russia , no easy task as eastern european countries often have a different opinion on moscow 's policies than western european nations . poland , for example , delayed talks on an eu-russia energy partnership pact last year because warsaw opposed a trade embargo russia placed on polish meat products . rockets raise additional questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the us missile shield is already being set up in japan tensions in russia were also heightened last month after the us announced plans for a missile defense shield , portions of which would be located in poland and the czech republic .
the two eu member states have expressed their acceptance of the us plans while putin said the shield posed a threat to moscow and could potentially start a new arms race . germany 's merkel backed the american proposal , saying the missile shield was a " purely defensive system " that would not be aimed at russia and an issue that needed to be discussed in talks between russia and nato . " i think it is appropriate to think about how to arm oneself against possible rockets coming from regions we did not really have to have our eye on during the cold war , " merkel said .

workers wore face masks under their helmets to conceal their identities as an excavator slammed into the so-called " youth house , " a graffiti-sprayed brick building in the noerrebro district of the danish capital . the rioting started on march 1 when police anti-terror squad evicted long-term squatters from the building , triggering three nights of clashes with youth . at least 25 were injured as protesters hurled cobblestones at riot police and set fire to cars and trash bins in copenhagen 's worst riots in 14 years . some 647 people have been arrested - including 140 foreigners , mainly germans and scandinavians suspected of involvement in the disturbances .
another 227 have been taken into custody . countercultural hub sold the center has had a cult reputation in copenhagen since the 1980s when the city 's council gave punks and squatters permission to move in .
in 2001 the building was sold to a christian group , which applied to have the squatters evicted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dozens fought the eviction on march 1 , which sparked the riots according to ruth evenson , leader of the small christian congregation that bought the house in 2001 , the four-story structure was a " a total wreck .
it would cost us a fortune to have it fixed . "
she declined to reveal the congregation 's plans for the site . the demolition crews were under police protection as they began the task that authorities hope will end the violent dispute .
however fears that the demolition could spark further protests led police to cordon off the building in advance . tears as the bulldozers go in crowds of young people gathered as demolition work began on the building , which was constructed at the end of the 19th century as a community center . " why , why ? " demanded sarah , a tearful 14-year-old , who had skipped school and came to the scene when she heard " the sad news on the radio . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young couple watch as the demolition gets started " they think the problem will disappear under the threat of the bulldozers .
they are wrong .
they ca n't kill the spirit of this house , " she said . on sunday , one group laid flowers , lit candles and left farewell messages some 100 metres -lrb- 330 feet -rrb- from the building . a space for society 's fringe " i cried with sadness , and anger , " said marie , an 18-year-old student .
she said she was a regular visitor to the center " which offered cultural activities that you ca n't find anywhere else in denmark . " " i am not marginal .
i think that society should leave room for all types , and for alternative culture as well , for which youth house was a symbol , " she added . the politiken newspaper has put the cost of the riots , including smashed windows and torched vehicles and clean-up operations , at $ 2.4 million . dw staff / afp -lrb- emw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german left-wing agitators arrested in copenhagen raids police in copenhagen saturday raided numerous houses and arrested 90 suspects , german left-wing agitators among them , to prevent renewed outbreaks of violence after a third night of unrest in the danish capital .

she will make her case at an upcoming eu summit . in the run-up to her first summit as president of the european union , the german chancellor told munich-based daily süddeutsche zeitung on sunday that european leaders " are going to ratify an action plan for climate protection and energy policy that is more concrete than ever before in the history of the european union . " but central proposals of the action plan are bound to cause contentious debate at the summit on thursday and friday .
the plan includes a commitment to supply 20 percent of europe 's energy needs from renewable sources such as wind power , a leading industry in germany . after an early round of informal talks in brussels on monday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier admitted that " the obligation of the 20 percent goal will still need to be negotiated at the summit . "
france and finland , for example , have signalled their reluctance to accept the binding goal for fear that it could jeopardize their national energy mix . chancellor merkel also plans to push for a europe-wide reduction of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , the man-made greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming .
the proposed plan would require the european states to reduce their overall co2-output by 20 percent below 1990-levels .
the 27 eu member states have agreed in principle to set this goal for 2020 , but will have to ratify the plan at the summit in order for it to become binding . member states have already agreed on a 10 percent increase of bio-fuels - such as ethanol gained from corn crops - over the next three years , assuming sufficient amounts of bio-fuel can be produced to meet the demand . europe becoming global role model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bio-fuels and modern engines significantly reduce the amount of co2 emissions from vehicles germany has assumed a lead role in pushing the environmental envelope and has already achieved a near-20 percent national reduction of co2 emissions below the levels of 1990 .
if the eu action plan is ratified , germany could reduce its overall co2 output by as much as 40 percent .
but not all member states will be held up to this high standard ; lower goals will be set for economically weaker eu countries . the action plan would also propel europe to the forefront of the global movement to mitigate the effects of global warming .
chancellor merkel spoke of a " paradigm shift " in sunday 's interview with the german daily : " so far , european nations made their own energy policy , " but " all that is now up for negotiation . " the german presidency of this year 's g8 summit will also allow merkel to talk to developing nations about alternative energy policies .
referring to the g8 summit , which will take place in june in the northern german resort town of heiligendamm , merkel specifically mentioned china , india , mexico , brazil and south africa . indeed , china appeared to hop on the green bandwagon prematurely on monday , as chinese premier wen jiabao vowed in his annual state of the nation address to curb " inefficient " economic growth and " excessive energy consumption . " merkel also told the süddeutsche zeitung that a rethinking of environmental policies was taking place in the united states .
she described " remarkable " progress there in the development of bio-fuels , but also said governments needed to " set the proper parameters " for the agricultural shifts this technology will likely bring about .

" but central proposals of the action plan are bound to cause contentious debate at the summit on thursday and friday .
the plan includes a commitment to supply 20 percent of europe 's energy needs from renewable sources such as wind power , a leading industry in germany . after an early round of informal talks in brussels on monday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier admitted that " the obligation of the 20 percent goal will still need to be negotiated at the summit . "
france and finland , for example , have signalled their reluctance to accept the binding goal for fear that it could jeopardize their national energy mix . chancellor merkel also plans to push for a europe-wide reduction of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , the man-made greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming .
the proposed plan would require the european states to reduce their overall co2-output by 20 percent below 1990-levels .
the 27 eu member states have agreed in principle to set this goal for 2020 , but will have to ratify the plan at the summit in order for it to become binding . member states have already agreed on a 10 percent increase of bio-fuels - such as ethanol gained from corn crops - over the next three years , assuming sufficient amounts of bio-fuel can be produced to meet the demand . europe becoming global role model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bio-fuels and modern engines significantly reduce the amount of co2 emissions from vehicles germany has assumed a lead role in pushing the environmental envelope and has already achieved a near-20 percent national reduction of co2 emissions below the levels of 1990 .
if the eu action plan is ratified , germany could reduce its overall co2 output by as much as 40 percent .
but not all member states will be held up to this high standard ; lower goals will be set for economically weaker eu countries . the action plan would also propel europe to the forefront of the global movement to mitigate the effects of global warming .
chancellor merkel spoke of a " paradigm shift " in sunday 's interview with the german daily : " so far , european nations made their own energy policy , " but " all that is now up for negotiation . " the german presidency of this year 's g8 summit will also allow merkel to talk to developing nations about alternative energy policies .
referring to the g8 summit , which will take place in june in the northern german resort town of heiligendamm , merkel specifically mentioned china , india , mexico , brazil and south africa . indeed , china appeared to hop on the green bandwagon prematurely on monday , as chinese premier wen jiabao vowed in his annual state of the nation address to curb " inefficient " economic growth and " excessive energy consumption . " merkel also told the süddeutsche zeitung that a rethinking of environmental policies was taking place in the united states .
she described " remarkable " progress there in the development of bio-fuels , but also said governments needed to " set the proper parameters " for the agricultural shifts this technology will likely bring about .

" we count on russia being a reliable partner , " she said in an interview with the daily süddeutsche zeitung on monday .
" i therefore agree in principle to russia getting economically involved in europe .
but good economic relations between russia and the eu can only be based on reciprocity . " equally , we have an interest in acquiring the ownership rights to russian gas fields , " the chancellor said . eads not ready for more investors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the designer of the eurocopter , eads should stay in european hands , merkel said franco-german aerospace venture eads , however , is one company merkel said should not be open to russian investment . " at the moment , we should n't admit another stakeholder into the shareholder pact , " she said .
" but i support closer cooperation in aircraft construction , as eads has already begun to do . " the european aeronautic defense and space company is controlled jointly by france and germany , with the delicate balance of power resting on a complex construction of multiple shareholdings , both public and private . last summer , however , the russian state bought a stake of between 5 percent and 7 percent via state-controlled bank vneshtorgbank -lrb- vtb -rrb- and russia is believed to be eager to gain a greater say in eads . nevertheless , moscow has been keen to calm european concerns on the matter , with president vladimir putin insisting recently that russia wanted " cooperation " with eads , and had no plans for a " hostile takeover . " united response to russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus employees have taken to the street to protest a restructuring program shares in eads dropped by 8.6 percent last week after the announcement that its subsidiary aircraft manufacturer airbus would cut 10,000 jobs over four years , streamline its production facilities and reorganize the distribution of work between factories across europe . merkel also said it was important for the eu to act in a unified manner when dealing with russia , no easy task as eastern european countries often have a different opinion on moscow 's policies than western european nations . poland , for example , delayed talks on an eu-russia energy partnership pact last year because warsaw opposed a trade embargo russia placed on polish meat products . rockets raise additional questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the us missile shield is already being set up in japan tensions in russia were also heightened last month after the us announced plans for a missile defense shield , portions of which would be located in poland and the czech republic .
the two eu member states have expressed their acceptance of the us plans while putin said the shield posed a threat to moscow and could potentially start a new arms race . germany 's merkel backed the american proposal , saying the missile shield was a " purely defensive system " that would not be aimed at russia and an issue that needed to be discussed in talks between russia and nato . " i think it is appropriate to think about how to arm oneself against possible rockets coming from regions we did not really have to have our eye on during the cold war , " merkel said .

"
an intense debate has begun in germany on the kind of lifestyle changes needed to cut greenhouse gas emissions , days before eu leaders hold a summit on energy and climate change .
holidaying at home is one suggestion . the call from green party parliamentary leader renate kunast for spending vacations in germany to become fashionable once more was predictable , but the support she received from other parts of the political spectrum was less so . werner schnappauf , environment minister for bavaria 's conservative christian social party , said germans should change their lifestyles .

"
an intense debate has begun in germany on the kind of lifestyle changes needed to cut greenhouse gas emissions , days before eu leaders hold a summit on energy and climate change .
holidaying at home is one suggestion . the call from green party parliamentary leader renate kunast for spending vacations in germany to become fashionable once more was predictable , but the support she received from other parts of the political spectrum was less so . werner schnappauf , environment minister for bavaria 's conservative christian social party , said germans should change their lifestyles .

" we count on russia being a reliable partner , " she said in an interview with the daily süddeutsche zeitung on monday .
" i therefore agree in principle to russia getting economically involved in europe .
but good economic relations between russia and the eu can only be based on reciprocity . " equally , we have an interest in acquiring the ownership rights to russian gas fields , " the chancellor said . eads not ready for more investors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the designer of the eurocopter , eads should stay in european hands , merkel said franco-german aerospace venture eads , however , is one company merkel said should not be open to russian investment . " at the moment , we should n't admit another stakeholder into the shareholder pact , " she said .
" but i support closer cooperation in aircraft construction , as eads has already begun to do . " the european aeronautic defense and space company is controlled jointly by france and germany , with the delicate balance of power resting on a complex construction of multiple shareholdings , both public and private . last summer , however , the russian state bought a stake of between 5 percent and 7 percent via state-controlled bank vneshtorgbank -lrb- vtb -rrb- and russia is believed to be eager to gain a greater say in eads . nevertheless , moscow has been keen to calm european concerns on the matter , with president vladimir putin insisting recently that russia wanted " cooperation " with eads , and had no plans for a " hostile takeover . " united response to russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus employees have taken to the street to protest a restructuring program shares in eads dropped by 8.6 percent last week after the announcement that its subsidiary aircraft manufacturer airbus would cut 10,000 jobs over four years , streamline its production facilities and reorganize the distribution of work between factories across europe . merkel also said it was important for the eu to act in a unified manner when dealing with russia , no easy task as eastern european countries often have a different opinion on moscow 's policies than western european nations . poland , for example , delayed talks on an eu-russia energy partnership pact last year because warsaw opposed a trade embargo russia placed on polish meat products . rockets raise additional questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the us missile shield is already being set up in japan tensions in russia were also heightened last month after the us announced plans for a missile defense shield , portions of which would be located in poland and the czech republic .
the two eu member states have expressed their acceptance of the us plans while putin said the shield posed a threat to moscow and could potentially start a new arms race . germany 's merkel backed the american proposal , saying the missile shield was a " purely defensive system " that would not be aimed at russia and an issue that needed to be discussed in talks between russia and nato . " i think it is appropriate to think about how to arm oneself against possible rockets coming from regions we did not really have to have our eye on during the cold war , " merkel said .

currently , only a small number of the more than 3.2 million muslims in germany belong to an organized advocacy group .

divisions according to country of origin and theological differences have hindered past considerations about joining forces . muslims realize they would benefit from having one voice and are determined to develop an organization that would provide united representation , bekir alboga , leader of a turkish religious organization , told the newspaper . in september , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble hosted a " conference on islam . "
it was the first time federal authorities had launched a dialogue with the country 's muslim minority . at that conference , schäuble mentioned the idea of an umbrella organization .
the german government would like a negotiating partner who they could turn to for advice on issues such as islamic religion classes , ways to better integrate muslim immigrants into german society , and ideas for limiting the influence of islamist extremists . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bavarian constitutional court upholds headscarf ban the highest court in the southern german state of bavaria decided that the state did not overstep its authority by banning muslim teachers from wearing headscarves in the classroom .

workers wore face masks under their helmets to conceal their identities as an excavator slammed into the so-called " youth house , " a graffiti-sprayed brick building in the noerrebro district of the danish capital . the rioting started on march 1 when police anti-terror squad evicted long-term squatters from the building , triggering three nights of clashes with youth . at least 25 were injured as protesters hurled cobblestones at riot police and set fire to cars and trash bins in copenhagen 's worst riots in 14 years . some 647 people have been arrested - including 140 foreigners , mainly germans and scandinavians suspected of involvement in the disturbances .
another 227 have been taken into custody . countercultural hub sold the center has had a cult reputation in copenhagen since the 1980s when the city 's council gave punks and squatters permission to move in .
in 2001 the building was sold to a christian group , which applied to have the squatters evicted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dozens fought the eviction on march 1 , which sparked the riots according to ruth evenson , leader of the small christian congregation that bought the house in 2001 , the four-story structure was a " a total wreck .

his new album and upcoming tour have generated huge excitement in german-speaking countries and little interest anywhere else . grönemeyer 's new album " 12 " is already muscling its way onto the german music charts . at 50 , grönemeyer is one of germany 's biggest celebrities while remaining virtually unknown in europe or the united states .
one of the reasons might be that his playful , poetic german lyrics do n't translate that well . yet the language barrier has n't stopped the singer from selling millions of albums and becoming one of the best-known and well-loved of germany 's pop rock stars .
a new grönemeyer release usually generates glowing reviews and sold-out concerts . so it 's no surprise that german critics have heaped praise on grönemeyer 's latest release , which was released friday . the album 's energetic single " ein stück von himmel , " or " a piece of heaven , " has already topped the charts and gone into rotation on german mtv . berlinonline calls it " intoxicating and simply grandiose . " the german bono bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics love grönemeyer 's new album " 12 " many of grönemeyer 's lyrics deal with political issues .
he has been outspoken opponent of nuclear power and racism and makes frequent calls for tolerance and peace .
he continues to be involved with efforts to end poverty in africa . grönemeyer began his singing career in the early 1980s in his hometown of bochum .
his breakthrough was the cult-song " männer " or " men . "
the album of the same name stayed on the charts for 79 weeks . he also did some acting , playing a war correspondent in the german film " das boot . "
his performance in the successful film made grönemeyer one of germany 's most well-known stars . in 1998 , grönemeyer suffered a double tragedy : he lost both his wife and brother to cancer .
in the wake of those deaths , he almost entirely disappeared from public .
but four years later , he returned with the album " mensch , " or " human , " which sold more than three million copies . a spring tour supporting his has already sold 800,000 tickets , making grönemeyer one of the few pop music artists who can claim to sell out a venue without selling out . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german ngos urge government to keep g8 promises an alliance of german ngos represented by singer and activist herbert grönemeyer has called on the government to devote more resources to fighting poverty and to live up to its aid promises ahead of the next g8 summit .

-lrb- constitutional regulations , laws against xenophobia etc . -rrb- wippermann : the main difference lies not in the political system , but concerns the people involved .
extremist organizations need strong leaders to be successful .
but le pen , while a charismatic leader in the past , is now too old for anyone to consider him powerful .
however , the german equivalent , gerhard frey , still pales into insignificance beside him .
and that is one reason why it is unlikely that frey would ever be able to reach a similar level .
strong german fascism is inconceivable without a " führer . " that is not to say that there is no danger of this happening in germany again .
while there are laws that prevent the glorification of the third reich and forbid anti-semitism , there is still a burgeoning far-right movement in germany , in particular in the former east german states where there are even " no-go areas " controlled by extremists which present a great risk to foreigners should they enter them .
also , recent research shows that at least 20 percent of germans profess hatred towards foreigners while 40 percent admit to anti-semitic feelings and even more , 64-68 percent holds grudges against roma and gypsies . are there any laws and structures in place in germany to prevent a radical right-wing leader from rising to power ? while there are rules in place which protect the constitution in germany , most have been installed to prevent a repeat of germany 's history but are out-dated when dealing with modern fascism . what are the social differences between france and germany which allow le pen to have such support ? le pen taps into the anti-democratic and napoleonic tradition of fascism in france .
there is the heightened fear of the foreigner , especially arab muslim immigrants who are blamed for all the sins in france , mainly unemployment and crime .
the issue of unemployment for the native citizens is one which is also a hot topic in germany .
turkish immigrants in germany are seen in the very same way as north african immigrants are in france .
but in france , there is a very strong movement for " france for the french , " something which the germans would not allow due to their history of nationalism . le pen is seen as a man of the people who has struggled and felt the pain of the common man in dealing with the hardships which have been brought on france allegedly by the foreigner .
germany has no connection like that with its far-right movement . is it possible that a social change could happen in modern germany where a figure like le pen achieves credibility and support within the electorate ? yes and no .
the germans from today are , according to my appraisals after teaching history for 30 years , better at learning from their fascist past than the french and are better at appraising the present dangers .
however , it can not be said that democracy is anchored in germany more firmly than it is in france .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 05.03.2007 " strong german fascism is inconceivable without a führer " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chances of a leader like le pen rising to power is unlikely , says prof. wippermann far-right expert prof. wolfgang wippermann spoke to dw-world.de about jean-marie le pen and the possibility of such a leader and a movement like his national front gaining similar prominence in germany . professor wolfgang wippermann is a lecturer of modern politics and the free university in berlin and an author of works on far-right extremism , the third reich and the holocaust . dw-world.de : what are the differences between the french political system and the german one which allow a right-wing extremist like jean-marie le pen to campaign and operate at the highest level in france ?
-lrb- constitutional regulations , laws against xenophobia etc . -rrb- wippermann : the main difference lies not in the political system , but concerns the people involved .
extremist organizations need strong leaders to be successful .
but le pen , while a charismatic leader in the past , is now too old for anyone to consider him powerful .
however , the german equivalent , gerhard frey , still pales into insignificance beside him .
and that is one reason why it is unlikely that frey would ever be able to reach a similar level .
strong german fascism is inconceivable without a " führer . " that is not to say that there is no danger of this happening in germany again .
while there are laws that prevent the glorification of the third reich and forbid anti-semitism , there is still a burgeoning far-right movement in germany , in particular in the former east german states where there are even " no-go areas " controlled by extremists which present a great risk to foreigners should they enter them .
also , recent research shows that at least 20 percent of germans profess hatred towards foreigners while 40 percent admit to anti-semitic feelings and even more , 64-68 percent holds grudges against roma and gypsies . are there any laws and structures in place in germany to prevent a radical right-wing leader from rising to power ? while there are rules in place which protect the constitution in germany , most have been installed to prevent a repeat of germany 's history but are out-dated when dealing with modern fascism . what are the social differences between france and germany which allow le pen to have such support ? le pen taps into the anti-democratic and napoleonic tradition of fascism in france .
there is the heightened fear of the foreigner , especially arab muslim immigrants who are blamed for all the sins in france , mainly unemployment and crime .
the issue of unemployment for the native citizens is one which is also a hot topic in germany .
turkish immigrants in germany are seen in the very same way as north african immigrants are in france .
but in france , there is a very strong movement for " france for the french , " something which the germans would not allow due to their history of nationalism . le pen is seen as a man of the people who has struggled and felt the pain of the common man in dealing with the hardships which have been brought on france allegedly by the foreigner .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de television -pipe- 05.03.2007 debate ensues after wwii drama shows germans as victims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tv series focuses on the suffering of countess lena of mahlenberg the latest chapter in a series of taboo-breaking television dramas , a two-part series shows germans as victims of violence at the end of world war ii and sparks controversy among polish and german political leaders . some 11 million germans tuned in to the first of a two-part series on public broadcaster ard sunday night to watch a tv drama showing germans as victims of violence as they fled eastern europe at the end of world war ii . the first part of " die flucht " -lrb- " march of millions " -rrb- garnered the best ratings of the year and ard 's best in 10 years on sunday night , and while german officials praised the film as a key milestone in dealing with the country 's past . the drama begin in 1944 and centers on a fictional countess lena of mahlenberg who leaves berlin for her home in east prussia to care for her father and the family 's manor as the soviet army approaches . just before the front reaches her home , lena , like thousands of other mainly women and children , flees for southern germany , enduring a bitter winter and soviet bombs . concerns over dramatizing history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some two million civilians died while fleeing the world war ii front conservative polish prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , however , expressed concern about the dramatization of history . " any attempt to revise the history of world war two needs to be watched carefully , " he told reporters on monday , saying such a revision posed a danger to poland and europe .
" i hope the process in germany will be stopped . " the film 's producers and actors said they intended for the film , whose second installment will be broadcast monday , to strike a chord with viewers . " i hope our film contributes to young and old people talking to each other about the worst chapter of german history , " said actress maria furtwängler , who plays the countess lena . director kai wessel , however , said he did not think attention would focus so closely on where guilt lays or vengeance , adding that he had only wanted to create a personal film that stayed true to the victims ' perspective . bildunterschrift : just over 13 percent of germans are estimated to have seen the series ' first installment german suffering long a taboo topic germans have long shied away from discussing their 14 million countrymen who fled the soviet army or were expelled after the allies allowed their eviction from poland , hungary and czechoslovakia .
historians estimate that some 2 million people died or were killed in the flight that began when the fall of the nazi regime became clear in 1944 . culture minister bernd neumann was among the germans lauding the film , which also shows soviet troops shooting children and raping women , as a cinematic achievement that brought the plight of german expellees to light . " no one wants to offset one side 's suffering against the other , " margot kässmann , a german protestant church leader , told the bild am sonntag newspaper as a debate erupted over why germans have long been silent . " but reconciliation will only be possible when those guilty acknowledge their crimes and victims get a chance to tell their stories , " added kässmann , whose family was among the refugees . latest in chain of tv dramas afraid it could be misconstrued as lessening the atrocities committed by the nazis during world war ii , other political leaders have avoided the issue of german suffering .
a similar debate over whether germans could be portrayed as victims ensued last year when " dresden , " a tv series on the firebombing of the eastern german city , earned high ratings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " dresden " centered on the city 's firebombing and an english-german love story " it was a national trauma and 60 years later , it was time to make a film seen from the victims ' point of view , " said jan mojto , a slovak national and head of munich-based eos film , which co-produced the nine-million-euro -lrb- $ 11.7-million -rrb- project . a berlin museum about the expelled germans that opened last year also sparked controversy .
polish leaders said it was an attempt by germans to portray themselves as victims of a war they started . " the problem in our view is not that the issue is being discussed , but how , " marek cichocki , foreign policy adviser to polish president lech kaczynski , told a german tv talk show on sunday .
" it focuses on individuals but blots out the bigger picture .
it 's disturbing that so much emphasis is on individual -lrb- suffering -rrb- , not the broader history . " the welt am sonntag newspaper said the drama was careful not to take sides . " germans are treated as both criminals and victims , " it wrote .
" it does n't pass judgment but rather depicts all the horrors .
that 's a prudent approach because there are no obvious answers .

" any attempt to revise the history of world war two needs to be watched carefully , " he told reporters on monday , saying such a revision posed a danger to poland and europe .
" i hope the process in germany will be stopped . " the film 's producers and actors said they intended for the film , whose second installment will be broadcast monday , to strike a chord with viewers . " i hope our film contributes to young and old people talking to each other about the worst chapter of german history , " said actress maria furtwängler , who plays the countess lena . director kai wessel , however , said he did not think attention would focus so closely on where guilt lays or vengeance , adding that he had only wanted to create a personal film that stayed true to the victims ' perspective . bildunterschrift : just over 13 percent of germans are estimated to have seen the series ' first installment german suffering long a taboo topic germans have long shied away from discussing their 14 million countrymen who fled the soviet army or were expelled after the allies allowed their eviction from poland , hungary and czechoslovakia .
historians estimate that some 2 million people died or were killed in the flight that began when the fall of the nazi regime became clear in 1944 . culture minister bernd neumann was among the germans lauding the film , which also shows soviet troops shooting children and raping women , as a cinematic achievement that brought the plight of german expellees to light . " no one wants to offset one side 's suffering against the other , " margot kässmann , a german protestant church leader , told the bild am sonntag newspaper as a debate erupted over why germans have long been silent . " but reconciliation will only be possible when those guilty acknowledge their crimes and victims get a chance to tell their stories , " added kässmann , whose family was among the refugees . latest in chain of tv dramas afraid it could be misconstrued as lessening the atrocities committed by the nazis during world war ii , other political leaders have avoided the issue of german suffering .
a similar debate over whether germans could be portrayed as victims ensued last year when " dresden , " a tv series on the firebombing of the eastern german city , earned high ratings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " dresden " centered on the city 's firebombing and an english-german love story " it was a national trauma and 60 years later , it was time to make a film seen from the victims ' point of view , " said jan mojto , a slovak national and head of munich-based eos film , which co-produced the nine-million-euro -lrb- $ 11.7-million -rrb- project . a berlin museum about the expelled germans that opened last year also sparked controversy .
polish leaders said it was an attempt by germans to portray themselves as victims of a war they started . " the problem in our view is not that the issue is being discussed , but how , " marek cichocki , foreign policy adviser to polish president lech kaczynski , told a german tv talk show on sunday .
" it focuses on individuals but blots out the bigger picture .
it 's disturbing that so much emphasis is on individual -lrb- suffering -rrb- , not the broader history . " the welt am sonntag newspaper said the drama was careful not to take sides . " germans are treated as both criminals and victims , " it wrote .
" it does n't pass judgment but rather depicts all the horrors .
that 's a prudent approach because there are no obvious answers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 05.03.2007 " strong german fascism is inconceivable without a führer " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chances of a leader like le pen rising to power is unlikely , says prof. wippermann far-right expert prof. wolfgang wippermann spoke to dw-world.de about jean-marie le pen and the possibility of such a leader and a movement like his national front gaining similar prominence in germany . professor wolfgang wippermann is a lecturer of modern politics and the free university in berlin and an author of works on far-right extremism , the third reich and the holocaust . dw-world.de : what are the differences between the french political system and the german one which allow a right-wing extremist like jean-marie le pen to campaign and operate at the highest level in france ?
-lrb- constitutional regulations , laws against xenophobia etc . -rrb- wippermann : the main difference lies not in the political system , but concerns the people involved .
extremist organizations need strong leaders to be successful .
but le pen , while a charismatic leader in the past , is now too old for anyone to consider him powerful .
however , the german equivalent , gerhard frey , still pales into insignificance beside him .
and that is one reason why it is unlikely that frey would ever be able to reach a similar level .
strong german fascism is inconceivable without a " führer . " that is not to say that there is no danger of this happening in germany again .
while there are laws that prevent the glorification of the third reich and forbid anti-semitism , there is still a burgeoning far-right movement in germany , in particular in the former east german states where there are even " no-go areas " controlled by extremists which present a great risk to foreigners should they enter them .
also , recent research shows that at least 20 percent of germans profess hatred towards foreigners while 40 percent admit to anti-semitic feelings and even more , 64-68 percent holds grudges against roma and gypsies . are there any laws and structures in place in germany to prevent a radical right-wing leader from rising to power ? while there are rules in place which protect the constitution in germany , most have been installed to prevent a repeat of germany 's history but are out-dated when dealing with modern fascism . what are the social differences between france and germany which allow le pen to have such support ? le pen taps into the anti-democratic and napoleonic tradition of fascism in france .
there is the heightened fear of the foreigner , especially arab muslim immigrants who are blamed for all the sins in france , mainly unemployment and crime .
the issue of unemployment for the native citizens is one which is also a hot topic in germany .
turkish immigrants in germany are seen in the very same way as north african immigrants are in france .
but in france , there is a very strong movement for " france for the french , " something which the germans would not allow due to their history of nationalism . le pen is seen as a man of the people who has struggled and felt the pain of the common man in dealing with the hardships which have been brought on france allegedly by the foreigner .
germany has no connection like that with its far-right movement . is it possible that a social change could happen in modern germany where a figure like le pen achieves credibility and support within the electorate ? yes and no .
the germans from today are , according to my appraisals after teaching history for 30 years , better at learning from their fascist past than the french and are better at appraising the present dangers .
however , it can not be said that democracy is anchored in germany more firmly than it is in france .
both france and germany have had to learn the lessons of the past and must look to each other for guidance on dealing with the future . nick amies interviewed wolfgang wippermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel at fault for right-wing rise , opposition says the head of a german opposition political party accused the current government of fuelling right-wing unrest with its policies .
-lrb- 15.11.2006 -rrb- experts : banning german neo-nazi party is counterproductive leading german politicians have again called for a ban on germany 's national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , but neither this nor financial problems are likely to hurt the country 's far right , experts say .
-lrb- 13.11.2006 -rrb- germany 's far-right wants to expand west encouraged by their successes at polls in the economically sagging eastern germany , far-right political parties are now trying to appeal to disgruntled voters in the western part of the country .

" we count on russia being a reliable partner , " she said in an interview with the daily süddeutsche zeitung on monday .
" i therefore agree in principle to russia getting economically involved in europe .
but good economic relations between russia and the eu can only be based on reciprocity . " equally , we have an interest in acquiring the ownership rights to russian gas fields , " the chancellor said . eads not ready for more investors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the designer of the eurocopter , eads should stay in european hands , merkel said franco-german aerospace venture eads , however , is one company merkel said should not be open to russian investment . " at the moment , we should n't admit another stakeholder into the shareholder pact , " she said .
" but i support closer cooperation in aircraft construction , as eads has already begun to do . " the european aeronautic defense and space company is controlled jointly by france and germany , with the delicate balance of power resting on a complex construction of multiple shareholdings , both public and private . last summer , however , the russian state bought a stake of between 5 percent and 7 percent via state-controlled bank vneshtorgbank -lrb- vtb -rrb- and russia is believed to be eager to gain a greater say in eads . nevertheless , moscow has been keen to calm european concerns on the matter , with president vladimir putin insisting recently that russia wanted " cooperation " with eads , and had no plans for a " hostile takeover . " united response to russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus employees have taken to the street to protest a restructuring program shares in eads dropped by 8.6 percent last week after the announcement that its subsidiary aircraft manufacturer airbus would cut 10,000 jobs over four years , streamline its production facilities and reorganize the distribution of work between factories across europe . merkel also said it was important for the eu to act in a unified manner when dealing with russia , no easy task as eastern european countries often have a different opinion on moscow 's policies than western european nations . poland , for example , delayed talks on an eu-russia energy partnership pact last year because warsaw opposed a trade embargo russia placed on polish meat products . rockets raise additional questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the us missile shield is already being set up in japan tensions in russia were also heightened last month after the us announced plans for a missile defense shield , portions of which would be located in poland and the czech republic .
the two eu member states have expressed their acceptance of the us plans while putin said the shield posed a threat to moscow and could potentially start a new arms race . germany 's merkel backed the american proposal , saying the missile shield was a " purely defensive system " that would not be aimed at russia and an issue that needed to be discussed in talks between russia and nato . " i think it is appropriate to think about how to arm oneself against possible rockets coming from regions we did not really have to have our eye on during the cold war , " merkel said .
" but we can and have to communicate more closely .

his new album and upcoming tour have generated huge excitement in german-speaking countries and little interest anywhere else . grönemeyer 's new album " 12 " is already muscling its way onto the german music charts . at 50 , grönemeyer is one of germany 's biggest celebrities while remaining virtually unknown in europe or the united states .
one of the reasons might be that his playful , poetic german lyrics do n't translate that well . yet the language barrier has n't stopped the singer from selling millions of albums and becoming one of the best-known and well-loved of germany 's pop rock stars .
a new grönemeyer release usually generates glowing reviews and sold-out concerts . so it 's no surprise that german critics have heaped praise on grönemeyer 's latest release , which was released friday . the album 's energetic single " ein stück von himmel , " or " a piece of heaven , " has already topped the charts and gone into rotation on german mtv . berlinonline calls it " intoxicating and simply grandiose .

he continues to be involved with efforts to end poverty in africa . grönemeyer began his singing career in the early 1980s in his hometown of bochum .
his breakthrough was the cult-song " männer " or " men . "
the album of the same name stayed on the charts for 79 weeks . he also did some acting , playing a war correspondent in the german film " das boot . "
his performance in the successful film made grönemeyer one of germany 's most well-known stars . in 1998 , grönemeyer suffered a double tragedy : he lost both his wife and brother to cancer .
in the wake of those deaths , he almost entirely disappeared from public .
but four years later , he returned with the album " mensch , " or " human , " which sold more than three million copies . a spring tour supporting his has already sold 800,000 tickets , making grönemeyer one of the few pop music artists who can claim to sell out a venue without selling out . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german ngos urge government to keep g8 promises an alliance of german ngos represented by singer and activist herbert grönemeyer has called on the government to devote more resources to fighting poverty and to live up to its aid promises ahead of the next g8 summit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 05.03.2007 merkel sets ambitious green agenda ahead of eu summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants the eu in the forefront of climate protection and energy policy german chancellor angela merkel is advocating an eu action plan that would position europe as the global frontrunner for renewable energy and greenhouse gas reductions .
she will make her case at an upcoming eu summit . in the run-up to her first summit as president of the european union , the german chancellor told munich-based daily süddeutsche zeitung on sunday that european leaders " are going to ratify an action plan for climate protection and energy policy that is more concrete than ever before in the history of the european union . " but central proposals of the action plan are bound to cause contentious debate at the summit on thursday and friday .
the plan includes a commitment to supply 20 percent of europe 's energy needs from renewable sources such as wind power , a leading industry in germany . after an early round of informal talks in brussels on monday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier admitted that " the obligation of the 20 percent goal will still need to be negotiated at the summit . "
france and finland , for example , have signalled their reluctance to accept the binding goal for fear that it could jeopardize their national energy mix . chancellor merkel also plans to push for a europe-wide reduction of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , the man-made greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming .
the proposed plan would require the european states to reduce their overall co2-output by 20 percent below 1990-levels .
the 27 eu member states have agreed in principle to set this goal for 2020 , but will have to ratify the plan at the summit in order for it to become binding . member states have already agreed on a 10 percent increase of bio-fuels - such as ethanol gained from corn crops - over the next three years , assuming sufficient amounts of bio-fuel can be produced to meet the demand . europe becoming global role model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bio-fuels and modern engines significantly reduce the amount of co2 emissions from vehicles germany has assumed a lead role in pushing the environmental envelope and has already achieved a near-20 percent national reduction of co2 emissions below the levels of 1990 .
if the eu action plan is ratified , germany could reduce its overall co2 output by as much as 40 percent .
but not all member states will be held up to this high standard ; lower goals will be set for economically weaker eu countries . the action plan would also propel europe to the forefront of the global movement to mitigate the effects of global warming .
chancellor merkel spoke of a " paradigm shift " in sunday 's interview with the german daily : " so far , european nations made their own energy policy , " but " all that is now up for negotiation . " the german presidency of this year 's g8 summit will also allow merkel to talk to developing nations about alternative energy policies .
referring to the g8 summit , which will take place in june in the northern german resort town of heiligendamm , merkel specifically mentioned china , india , mexico , brazil and south africa . indeed , china appeared to hop on the green bandwagon prematurely on monday , as chinese premier wen jiabao vowed in his annual state of the nation address to curb " inefficient " economic growth and " excessive energy consumption . " merkel also told the süddeutsche zeitung that a rethinking of environmental policies was taking place in the united states .
she described " remarkable " progress there in the development of bio-fuels , but also said governments needed to " set the proper parameters " for the agricultural shifts this technology will likely bring about .
" once they identify a problem , " merkel said of the americans , " they develop a strong ambition to solve it .

his new album and upcoming tour have generated huge excitement in german-speaking countries and little interest anywhere else . grönemeyer 's new album " 12 " is already muscling its way onto the german music charts . at 50 , grönemeyer is one of germany 's biggest celebrities while remaining virtually unknown in europe or the united states .
one of the reasons might be that his playful , poetic german lyrics do n't translate that well . yet the language barrier has n't stopped the singer from selling millions of albums and becoming one of the best-known and well-loved of germany 's pop rock stars .
a new grönemeyer release usually generates glowing reviews and sold-out concerts . so it 's no surprise that german critics have heaped praise on grönemeyer 's latest release , which was released friday . the album 's energetic single " ein stück von himmel , " or " a piece of heaven , " has already topped the charts and gone into rotation on german mtv . berlinonline calls it " intoxicating and simply grandiose .

in the wake of those deaths , he almost entirely disappeared from public .

the details of the offer have not been made public . the 5.5-billion-euro -lrb- $ 7.2-billion -rrb- bridge across a strait between the islands of fehmarn and lolland would replace a train-and-car ferry which runs every 30 minutes , and avoid a road detour via a bridge to the jutland peninsula . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : transnet is unhappy with berlin 's direction job losses could be permanent transnet said a new bridge would put up to 2,000 ferry workers and staff at contractors out of jobs .

the governments would have to provide the financing which could not be raised by tolls .
the project has been under discussion for 15 years , and one german chancellor after another has found a way to avoid it .

"
an intense debate has begun in germany on the kind of lifestyle changes needed to cut greenhouse gas emissions , days before eu leaders hold a summit on energy and climate change .
holidaying at home is one suggestion . the call from green party parliamentary leader renate kunast for spending vacations in germany to become fashionable once more was predictable , but the support she received from other parts of the political spectrum was less so . werner schnappauf , environment minister for bavaria 's conservative christian social party , said germans should change their lifestyles .
" learn to value the qualities close to where you live , " was his contribution to an increasingly lively debate . the deputy parliamentary leader of the social democrats , ulrich kelber , called for germans to avoid flights as far as possible as their own " private contribution " to halting climate change .
holidays in germany and neighboring countries could be " lovely , " kelber said , extolling the virtues of train travel . ever since germany 's postwar boom , the so-called wirtschaftswunder -lrb- economic miracle -rrb- , germans have been avid travelers . german tourists first to travel en masse far and wide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tourists bring good business to holiday destinations the mediterranean came first as the trendy holiday destination .
east africa , latin america , the caribbean and the far east soon followed . trinket shops in every corner of the world - at least every sunny corner - have for decades posted the sign : " man spricht deutsch " -lrb- german spoken here -rrb- in their windows in the hope of earning solid deutsche marks or euros . but now " sylt not the seychelles , " is the holidaying slogan , in reference to the island just off the baltic coast where germany 's beautiful people have long spent weekends . the tourist industry is ready to take the change in its stride , well aware that margins on the long-haul flights are now minimal compared with what can be earned from up-market destinations closer to home . " in many circles it will no longer be chic in a couple of years to pollute the environment with tons of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- while on holiday , " said martin buck , director of berlin 's international tourist bourse , which opens wednesday . cheap flights and package tours in danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap holiday ?
walk this way buck predicted that companies offering the traditional package tour were about to face serious problems . the figures are convincing .
according to andreas tröge , head of germany 's federal environment agency , a return flight to thailand " costs " six tons of co2 , while a return train journey from berlin to the baltic weighs in at just 35 kilograms -lrb- 77 pounds -rrb- . federal environment minister sigmar gabriel has demanded that airlines offer customers the option of paying a supplement to fund projects to compensate for the co2 consumed on the flight . national flag carrier lufthansa has said it is looking for a business partner to launch a scheme of this kind . as many commentators have pointed out , the cheap flights era has led to market absurdities .
taxi ride to airports in most european cities now cost considerably more than flights to mallorca , rimini , corfu or adana . change in lifestyle greenpeace germany 's head , brigitte behrens , voiced the opinion of many when she told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper : " cheap flights should be banned . " that call is likely to fall on deaf ears when the eu leaders gather in brussels on thursday . but as a survey published last week showed , the german public is way ahead of its political leaders when it comes to the lifestyle changes needed to counter environmental damage . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : global warming could devastate ski resorts after a record warm november delayed snowfall in the alps , a new oecd report has warned that climate change poses " serious risks " to snow reliability in ski areas and could dramatically impact their economies .
-lrb- 13.12.2006 -rrb- germany up in arms over minister 's holiday comments germany 's finance minister has sparked outrage by suggesting germans should spend less on their annual holidays and instead put money aside for their old age .
the comments have sparked a lively debate about the economy .
-lrb- 20.08.2006 -rrb- luring tourists to a germany less traveled visits to germany 's more obscure destinations are rare by foreign tourists and even locals are often deterred .
in the country of autobahns , the latter might be partly to blame .

le pen on the presidential campaign trail for over 30 years , jean-marie le pen has campaigned at the top of french politics .
while labeled an anti-semite and rascist by some , he still commands enough support to add a dark dimension to the presidential election . from the earliest steps on the campaign trail , the french presidential election has been viewed as a two-horse race .
despite the wily incumbent jacques chirac 's mischievous ambiguity over whether he would run again and the emergence of rising centrist francois bayrou , the majority of bets have been split between interior minister nicolas sarkozy of the ruling conservative party or socialist challenger segolene royal taking over at the elysee palace . but in the current campaign , as has been the case in the last four presidential elections , there is a dark horse stalking the main candidates .
while sarkozy 's and royal 's people are busy putting out the fires from gaffes and scandals , a man who is no stranger to controversy in once again making a play for the top job in french politics . jean-marie le pen is back . the national front leader recently launched the fifth presidential election bid of his long career with the hope that he can go one better than in the 2002 campaign when he made it to the second-round run-off .
by becoming the one alternative to chirac in that election , the first in which he made it that far , le pen shocked the french political establishment , sent tremors through europe and ended the political career of socialist prime minister lionel jospin on the way .
it was the fear of seeing le pen in the elysee which drove voters on left and right to re-elect chirac by 82 percent . anti-immigration , nationalist bandwagon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : le pen plays on the fears of urban violence in france now it seems that after five more years of chirac , france has forgotten that fear .
le pen is in the mix again , and while his current campaign is less assured in the preliminary stages as it was in 2002 , the far-right stalwart is beginning to work up a head of steam with a populist manifesto built on promises to end immigration , pull france out of nato and slash taxes for the french only . the fact that le pen is once again contesting the presidency is a testament to his tenacity .
a street fighter in his youth - he lost an eye in one scuffle - and a former paratrooper and foreign legionnaire who saw active service in indochina and algeria , le pen is used to battles . in some ways , he is the epitome of the political survivor .
he is a man who has been convicted several times for remarks about jews or the holocaust , calling the nazi gas chambers " a detail of history " and describing the german occupation of france as " relatively humane . "
he dismissed the attacks on the twin towers on september 11 , 2001 , as an " incident , " and complained before the 1998 world cup that the french soccer team was not white enough .
and yet , despite his behavior and stance , le pen and his national front party still enjoy widespread support . greatest support in years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a third of french people find le pen unacceptable recent poll results published in the french newspaper le monde showed support for le pen at its highest levels in years , even better than in the run-up to the 2002 election where he polled 18.9 per cent , nearly 5.5 million voters .
in 1997 nearly half of french people saw le pen 's ideas as unacceptable ; now only a third think so . that a man with such extremist views can still compete at the top of french politics says much about the continued disillusionment with the political leadership within french society . le pen rose to prominence in the early 1970 's with a populist mix of anti-immigrant , pro-employment , and law-and-order promises .
and in the 30 years or more since he founded the national front , more immigrants have arrived in france , unemployment has become more of a problem and crime and unrest more prominent .
le pen has continually revamped his core policies to play to the fears of what he calls " france 's silent majority , " the grassroots voters who struggle to be heard above the nation 's " technocratic elite . " " le pen has enjoyed a shift in his voter base from urban to rural areas and from the young to elderly , " nonna mayer , an expert on french far-right politics from the research center for political science in paris , told dw-world.de.
" he has succeeded in extending and diversifying his social base .
this is one reason why he remains so relevant even in modern france . " appeal to disgruntled workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french farmers regularly protest against the government just as in the 2002 election , le pen is campaigning on a strong anti-immigration platform , blaming the " invasion " of foreigners for france 's rising unemployment , urban violence and what he calls " general impoverishment . "
he is also relying on the " humble workers " vote as he did five years ago , pandering to the discontent of blue-collar employees and farmers . the state of france 's agricultural sector has given le pen a new , powerful voting pool . " voting for the extreme right is developing in rural areas , " says mayer .
" in 1988 , voters in the large cities were most likely to vote for le pen .
in 1995 , his influence extended to middle-sized conurbations .
in 2002 , he was attracting voters in small towns of less than 2000 inhabitants . " mayer believes that this shows that le pen has maintained his political longevity by pinpointing issues that effect the diverse sections of french society ; urban crime for big city dwellers , loss of french identity through immigration for middle-class citizens , and loss of jobs and threat to industry for the working classes .
how ever distasteful his approach , he is seen by many as being the only candidate to address the issues that matter to them . le pen has also won support throughout his career due to the general disaffection the populace has with its leaders .
before the 2002 vote , 83 percent of voters polled said that " politicians do not care what people like us think " and 58 percent said that french politicians were " somewhat corrupt . " wake-up call bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all those who vote for him want le pen as president " the conditions were ideal for a protest vote in favor of le pen , " mayer said .
" it was a protest vote because although they agree massively with his ideas on immigration and law-and-order , most voters do n't want him to implement them .
only 41 percent of those who voted for le pen in 2002 actually wanted him to be elected . " votes for le pen , it seems , are used as a wake-up call for france to deal with the real problems in the society .
however , the need for him to continue to run shows that these calls are far from being heeded . this year , it is still unclear whether le pen will even make it into the presidential election race .
he is struggling to gain the backing of 500 elected officials needed to register formally by march 16 .
but if he does make into the first round , no one can rule out that his true supporters , and those registering another protest vote , can push the far-right leader into another run-off for the elysee and cause another european political earthquake . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " strong german fascism is inconceivable without a führer " far-right expert prof. wolfgang wippermann spoke to dw-world.de about jean-marie le pen and the possibility of such a leader and a movement like his national front gaining similar prominence in germany .

and yet , despite his behavior and stance , le pen and his national front party still enjoy widespread support . greatest support in years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a third of french people find le pen unacceptable recent poll results published in the french newspaper le monde showed support for le pen at its highest levels in years , even better than in the run-up to the 2002 election where he polled 18.9 per cent , nearly 5.5 million voters .
in 1997 nearly half of french people saw le pen 's ideas as unacceptable ; now only a third think so . that a man with such extremist views can still compete at the top of french politics says much about the continued disillusionment with the political leadership within french society . le pen rose to prominence in the early 1970 's with a populist mix of anti-immigrant , pro-employment , and law-and-order promises .
and in the 30 years or more since he founded the national front , more immigrants have arrived in france , unemployment has become more of a problem and crime and unrest more prominent .
le pen has continually revamped his core policies to play to the fears of what he calls " france 's silent majority , " the grassroots voters who struggle to be heard above the nation 's " technocratic elite . " " le pen has enjoyed a shift in his voter base from urban to rural areas and from the young to elderly , " nonna mayer , an expert on french far-right politics from the research center for political science in paris , told dw-world.de.
" he has succeeded in extending and diversifying his social base .
this is one reason why he remains so relevant even in modern france . " appeal to disgruntled workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french farmers regularly protest against the government just as in the 2002 election , le pen is campaigning on a strong anti-immigration platform , blaming the " invasion " of foreigners for france 's rising unemployment , urban violence and what he calls " general impoverishment . "
he is also relying on the " humble workers " vote as he did five years ago , pandering to the discontent of blue-collar employees and farmers . the state of france 's agricultural sector has given le pen a new , powerful voting pool . " voting for the extreme right is developing in rural areas , " says mayer .
" in 1988 , voters in the large cities were most likely to vote for le pen .
in 1995 , his influence extended to middle-sized conurbations .
in 2002 , he was attracting voters in small towns of less than 2000 inhabitants . " mayer believes that this shows that le pen has maintained his political longevity by pinpointing issues that effect the diverse sections of french society ; urban crime for big city dwellers , loss of french identity through immigration for middle-class citizens , and loss of jobs and threat to industry for the working classes .
how ever distasteful his approach , he is seen by many as being the only candidate to address the issues that matter to them . le pen has also won support throughout his career due to the general disaffection the populace has with its leaders .
before the 2002 vote , 83 percent of voters polled said that " politicians do not care what people like us think " and 58 percent said that french politicians were " somewhat corrupt . " wake-up call bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all those who vote for him want le pen as president " the conditions were ideal for a protest vote in favor of le pen , " mayer said .
" it was a protest vote because although they agree massively with his ideas on immigration and law-and-order , most voters do n't want him to implement them .
only 41 percent of those who voted for le pen in 2002 actually wanted him to be elected . " votes for le pen , it seems , are used as a wake-up call for france to deal with the real problems in the society .
however , the need for him to continue to run shows that these calls are far from being heeded . this year , it is still unclear whether le pen will even make it into the presidential election race .
he is struggling to gain the backing of 500 elected officials needed to register formally by march 16 .
but if he does make into the first round , no one can rule out that his true supporters , and those registering another protest vote , can push the far-right leader into another run-off for the elysee and cause another european political earthquake . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " strong german fascism is inconceivable without a führer " far-right expert prof. wolfgang wippermann spoke to dw-world.de about jean-marie le pen and the possibility of such a leader and a movement like his national front gaining similar prominence in germany .

-lrb- constitutional regulations , laws against xenophobia etc . -rrb- wippermann : the main difference lies not in the political system , but concerns the people involved .
extremist organizations need strong leaders to be successful .
but le pen , while a charismatic leader in the past , is now too old for anyone to consider him powerful .
however , the german equivalent , gerhard frey , still pales into insignificance beside him .
and that is one reason why it is unlikely that frey would ever be able to reach a similar level .
strong german fascism is inconceivable without a " führer . " that is not to say that there is no danger of this happening in germany again .
while there are laws that prevent the glorification of the third reich and forbid anti-semitism , there is still a burgeoning far-right movement in germany , in particular in the former east german states where there are even " no-go areas " controlled by extremists which present a great risk to foreigners should they enter them .
also , recent research shows that at least 20 percent of germans profess hatred towards foreigners while 40 percent admit to anti-semitic feelings and even more , 64-68 percent holds grudges against roma and gypsies . are there any laws and structures in place in germany to prevent a radical right-wing leader from rising to power ? while there are rules in place which protect the constitution in germany , most have been installed to prevent a repeat of germany 's history but are out-dated when dealing with modern fascism . what are the social differences between france and germany which allow le pen to have such support ? le pen taps into the anti-democratic and napoleonic tradition of fascism in france .
there is the heightened fear of the foreigner , especially arab muslim immigrants who are blamed for all the sins in france , mainly unemployment and crime .
the issue of unemployment for the native citizens is one which is also a hot topic in germany .
turkish immigrants in germany are seen in the very same way as north african immigrants are in france .
but in france , there is a very strong movement for " france for the french , " something which the germans would not allow due to their history of nationalism . le pen is seen as a man of the people who has struggled and felt the pain of the common man in dealing with the hardships which have been brought on france allegedly by the foreigner .
germany has no connection like that with its far-right movement . is it possible that a social change could happen in modern germany where a figure like le pen achieves credibility and support within the electorate ? yes and no .
the germans from today are , according to my appraisals after teaching history for 30 years , better at learning from their fascist past than the french and are better at appraising the present dangers .

-lrb- constitutional regulations , laws against xenophobia etc . -rrb- wippermann : the main difference lies not in the political system , but concerns the people involved .
extremist organizations need strong leaders to be successful .
but le pen , while a charismatic leader in the past , is now too old for anyone to consider him powerful .
however , the german equivalent , gerhard frey , still pales into insignificance beside him .
and that is one reason why it is unlikely that frey would ever be able to reach a similar level .
strong german fascism is inconceivable without a " führer . " that is not to say that there is no danger of this happening in germany again .
while there are laws that prevent the glorification of the third reich and forbid anti-semitism , there is still a burgeoning far-right movement in germany , in particular in the former east german states where there are even " no-go areas " controlled by extremists which present a great risk to foreigners should they enter them .

there is the heightened fear of the foreigner , especially arab muslim immigrants who are blamed for all the sins in france , mainly unemployment and crime .
the issue of unemployment for the native citizens is one which is also a hot topic in germany .
turkish immigrants in germany are seen in the very same way as north african immigrants are in france .
but in france , there is a very strong movement for " france for the french , " something which the germans would not allow due to their history of nationalism . le pen is seen as a man of the people who has struggled and felt the pain of the common man in dealing with the hardships which have been brought on france allegedly by the foreigner .
germany has no connection like that with its far-right movement . is it possible that a social change could happen in modern germany where a figure like le pen achieves credibility and support within the electorate ? yes and no .

le pen on the presidential campaign trail for over 30 years , jean-marie le pen has campaigned at the top of french politics .
while labeled an anti-semite and rascist by some , he still commands enough support to add a dark dimension to the presidential election . from the earliest steps on the campaign trail , the french presidential election has been viewed as a two-horse race .
despite the wily incumbent jacques chirac 's mischievous ambiguity over whether he would run again and the emergence of rising centrist francois bayrou , the majority of bets have been split between interior minister nicolas sarkozy of the ruling conservative party or socialist challenger segolene royal taking over at the elysee palace . but in the current campaign , as has been the case in the last four presidential elections , there is a dark horse stalking the main candidates .
while sarkozy 's and royal 's people are busy putting out the fires from gaffes and scandals , a man who is no stranger to controversy in once again making a play for the top job in french politics . jean-marie le pen is back . the national front leader recently launched the fifth presidential election bid of his long career with the hope that he can go one better than in the 2002 campaign when he made it to the second-round run-off .
by becoming the one alternative to chirac in that election , the first in which he made it that far , le pen shocked the french political establishment , sent tremors through europe and ended the political career of socialist prime minister lionel jospin on the way .
it was the fear of seeing le pen in the elysee which drove voters on left and right to re-elect chirac by 82 percent . anti-immigration , nationalist bandwagon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : le pen plays on the fears of urban violence in france now it seems that after five more years of chirac , france has forgotten that fear .
le pen is in the mix again , and while his current campaign is less assured in the preliminary stages as it was in 2002 , the far-right stalwart is beginning to work up a head of steam with a populist manifesto built on promises to end immigration , pull france out of nato and slash taxes for the french only . the fact that le pen is once again contesting the presidency is a testament to his tenacity .
a street fighter in his youth - he lost an eye in one scuffle - and a former paratrooper and foreign legionnaire who saw active service in indochina and algeria , le pen is used to battles . in some ways , he is the epitome of the political survivor .
he is a man who has been convicted several times for remarks about jews or the holocaust , calling the nazi gas chambers " a detail of history " and describing the german occupation of france as " relatively humane . "
he dismissed the attacks on the twin towers on september 11 , 2001 , as an " incident , " and complained before the 1998 world cup that the french soccer team was not white enough .
and yet , despite his behavior and stance , le pen and his national front party still enjoy widespread support . greatest support in years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a third of french people find le pen unacceptable recent poll results published in the french newspaper le monde showed support for le pen at its highest levels in years , even better than in the run-up to the 2002 election where he polled 18.9 per cent , nearly 5.5 million voters .
in 1997 nearly half of french people saw le pen 's ideas as unacceptable ; now only a third think so . that a man with such extremist views can still compete at the top of french politics says much about the continued disillusionment with the political leadership within french society . le pen rose to prominence in the early 1970 's with a populist mix of anti-immigrant , pro-employment , and law-and-order promises .
and in the 30 years or more since he founded the national front , more immigrants have arrived in france , unemployment has become more of a problem and crime and unrest more prominent .
le pen has continually revamped his core policies to play to the fears of what he calls " france 's silent majority , " the grassroots voters who struggle to be heard above the nation 's " technocratic elite . " " le pen has enjoyed a shift in his voter base from urban to rural areas and from the young to elderly , " nonna mayer , an expert on french far-right politics from the research center for political science in paris , told dw-world.de.
" he has succeeded in extending and diversifying his social base .
this is one reason why he remains so relevant even in modern france . " appeal to disgruntled workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french farmers regularly protest against the government just as in the 2002 election , le pen is campaigning on a strong anti-immigration platform , blaming the " invasion " of foreigners for france 's rising unemployment , urban violence and what he calls " general impoverishment . "
he is also relying on the " humble workers " vote as he did five years ago , pandering to the discontent of blue-collar employees and farmers . the state of france 's agricultural sector has given le pen a new , powerful voting pool . " voting for the extreme right is developing in rural areas , " says mayer .
" in 1988 , voters in the large cities were most likely to vote for le pen .
in 1995 , his influence extended to middle-sized conurbations .
in 2002 , he was attracting voters in small towns of less than 2000 inhabitants . " mayer believes that this shows that le pen has maintained his political longevity by pinpointing issues that effect the diverse sections of french society ; urban crime for big city dwellers , loss of french identity through immigration for middle-class citizens , and loss of jobs and threat to industry for the working classes .
how ever distasteful his approach , he is seen by many as being the only candidate to address the issues that matter to them . le pen has also won support throughout his career due to the general disaffection the populace has with its leaders .
before the 2002 vote , 83 percent of voters polled said that " politicians do not care what people like us think " and 58 percent said that french politicians were " somewhat corrupt . " wake-up call bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all those who vote for him want le pen as president " the conditions were ideal for a protest vote in favor of le pen , " mayer said .
" it was a protest vote because although they agree massively with his ideas on immigration and law-and-order , most voters do n't want him to implement them .
only 41 percent of those who voted for le pen in 2002 actually wanted him to be elected . " votes for le pen , it seems , are used as a wake-up call for france to deal with the real problems in the society .
however , the need for him to continue to run shows that these calls are far from being heeded . this year , it is still unclear whether le pen will even make it into the presidential election race .
he is struggling to gain the backing of 500 elected officials needed to register formally by march 16 .
but if he does make into the first round , no one can rule out that his true supporters , and those registering another protest vote , can push the far-right leader into another run-off for the elysee and cause another european political earthquake . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " strong german fascism is inconceivable without a führer " far-right expert prof. wolfgang wippermann spoke to dw-world.de about jean-marie le pen and the possibility of such a leader and a movement like his national front gaining similar prominence in germany .

"
an intense debate has begun in germany on the kind of lifestyle changes needed to cut greenhouse gas emissions , days before eu leaders hold a summit on energy and climate change .
holidaying at home is one suggestion . the call from green party parliamentary leader renate kunast for spending vacations in germany to become fashionable once more was predictable , but the support she received from other parts of the political spectrum was less so . werner schnappauf , environment minister for bavaria 's conservative christian social party , said germans should change their lifestyles .

an intense debate has begun in germany on the kind of lifestyle changes needed to cut greenhouse gas emissions , days before eu leaders hold a summit on energy and climate change .
holidaying at home is one suggestion . the call from green party parliamentary leader renate kunast for spending vacations in germany to become fashionable once more was predictable , but the support she received from other parts of the political spectrum was less so . werner schnappauf , environment minister for bavaria 's conservative christian social party , said germans should change their lifestyles .
" learn to value the qualities close to where you live , " was his contribution to an increasingly lively debate . the deputy parliamentary leader of the social democrats , ulrich kelber , called for germans to avoid flights as far as possible as their own " private contribution " to halting climate change .

his new album and upcoming tour have generated huge excitement in german-speaking countries and little interest anywhere else . grönemeyer 's new album " 12 " is already muscling its way onto the german music charts . at 50 , grönemeyer is one of germany 's biggest celebrities while remaining virtually unknown in europe or the united states .
one of the reasons might be that his playful , poetic german lyrics do n't translate that well . yet the language barrier has n't stopped the singer from selling millions of albums and becoming one of the best-known and well-loved of germany 's pop rock stars .
a new grönemeyer release usually generates glowing reviews and sold-out concerts . so it 's no surprise that german critics have heaped praise on grönemeyer 's latest release , which was released friday . the album 's energetic single " ein stück von himmel , " or " a piece of heaven , " has already topped the charts and gone into rotation on german mtv . berlinonline calls it " intoxicating and simply grandiose . " the german bono bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics love grönemeyer 's new album " 12 " many of grönemeyer 's lyrics deal with political issues .
he has been outspoken opponent of nuclear power and racism and makes frequent calls for tolerance and peace .
he continues to be involved with efforts to end poverty in africa . grönemeyer began his singing career in the early 1980s in his hometown of bochum .
his breakthrough was the cult-song " männer " or " men . "
the album of the same name stayed on the charts for 79 weeks . he also did some acting , playing a war correspondent in the german film " das boot . "
his performance in the successful film made grönemeyer one of germany 's most well-known stars . in 1998 , grönemeyer suffered a double tragedy : he lost both his wife and brother to cancer .
in the wake of those deaths , he almost entirely disappeared from public .
but four years later , he returned with the album " mensch , " or " human , " which sold more than three million copies . a spring tour supporting his has already sold 800,000 tickets , making grönemeyer one of the few pop music artists who can claim to sell out a venue without selling out . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german ngos urge government to keep g8 promises an alliance of german ngos represented by singer and activist herbert grönemeyer has called on the government to devote more resources to fighting poverty and to live up to its aid promises ahead of the next g8 summit .

" we count on russia being a reliable partner , " she said in an interview with the daily süddeutsche zeitung on monday .
" i therefore agree in principle to russia getting economically involved in europe .
but good economic relations between russia and the eu can only be based on reciprocity . " equally , we have an interest in acquiring the ownership rights to russian gas fields , " the chancellor said . eads not ready for more investors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the designer of the eurocopter , eads should stay in european hands , merkel said franco-german aerospace venture eads , however , is one company merkel said should not be open to russian investment . " at the moment , we should n't admit another stakeholder into the shareholder pact , " she said .
" but i support closer cooperation in aircraft construction , as eads has already begun to do . " the european aeronautic defense and space company is controlled jointly by france and germany , with the delicate balance of power resting on a complex construction of multiple shareholdings , both public and private . last summer , however , the russian state bought a stake of between 5 percent and 7 percent via state-controlled bank vneshtorgbank -lrb- vtb -rrb- and russia is believed to be eager to gain a greater say in eads . nevertheless , moscow has been keen to calm european concerns on the matter , with president vladimir putin insisting recently that russia wanted " cooperation " with eads , and had no plans for a " hostile takeover . " united response to russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus employees have taken to the street to protest a restructuring program shares in eads dropped by 8.6 percent last week after the announcement that its subsidiary aircraft manufacturer airbus would cut 10,000 jobs over four years , streamline its production facilities and reorganize the distribution of work between factories across europe . merkel also said it was important for the eu to act in a unified manner when dealing with russia , no easy task as eastern european countries often have a different opinion on moscow 's policies than western european nations . poland , for example , delayed talks on an eu-russia energy partnership pact last year because warsaw opposed a trade embargo russia placed on polish meat products . rockets raise additional questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the us missile shield is already being set up in japan tensions in russia were also heightened last month after the us announced plans for a missile defense shield , portions of which would be located in poland and the czech republic .
the two eu member states have expressed their acceptance of the us plans while putin said the shield posed a threat to moscow and could potentially start a new arms race . germany 's merkel backed the american proposal , saying the missile shield was a " purely defensive system " that would not be aimed at russia and an issue that needed to be discussed in talks between russia and nato . " i think it is appropriate to think about how to arm oneself against possible rockets coming from regions we did not really have to have our eye on during the cold war , " merkel said .

" we count on russia being a reliable partner , " she said in an interview with the daily süddeutsche zeitung on monday .
" i therefore agree in principle to russia getting economically involved in europe .
but good economic relations between russia and the eu can only be based on reciprocity . " equally , we have an interest in acquiring the ownership rights to russian gas fields , " the chancellor said . eads not ready for more investors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the designer of the eurocopter , eads should stay in european hands , merkel said franco-german aerospace venture eads , however , is one company merkel said should not be open to russian investment . " at the moment , we should n't admit another stakeholder into the shareholder pact , " she said .
" but i support closer cooperation in aircraft construction , as eads has already begun to do . " the european aeronautic defense and space company is controlled jointly by france and germany , with the delicate balance of power resting on a complex construction of multiple shareholdings , both public and private . last summer , however , the russian state bought a stake of between 5 percent and 7 percent via state-controlled bank vneshtorgbank -lrb- vtb -rrb- and russia is believed to be eager to gain a greater say in eads . nevertheless , moscow has been keen to calm european concerns on the matter , with president vladimir putin insisting recently that russia wanted " cooperation " with eads , and had no plans for a " hostile takeover . " united response to russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus employees have taken to the street to protest a restructuring program shares in eads dropped by 8.6 percent last week after the announcement that its subsidiary aircraft manufacturer airbus would cut 10,000 jobs over four years , streamline its production facilities and reorganize the distribution of work between factories across europe . merkel also said it was important for the eu to act in a unified manner when dealing with russia , no easy task as eastern european countries often have a different opinion on moscow 's policies than western european nations . poland , for example , delayed talks on an eu-russia energy partnership pact last year because warsaw opposed a trade embargo russia placed on polish meat products . rockets raise additional questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the us missile shield is already being set up in japan tensions in russia were also heightened last month after the us announced plans for a missile defense shield , portions of which would be located in poland and the czech republic .
the two eu member states have expressed their acceptance of the us plans while putin said the shield posed a threat to moscow and could potentially start a new arms race . germany 's merkel backed the american proposal , saying the missile shield was a " purely defensive system " that would not be aimed at russia and an issue that needed to be discussed in talks between russia and nato .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : france 's next president : sarko vs. sego police , protesters battle after sarkozy win sarkozy favored as french elect new president conservative sarkozy is france 's next president as election nears , french duo fight to a draw in last debate elections -pipe- 05.03.2007 extremist le pen strikes chord in france , again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifth-time lucky ?
le pen on the presidential campaign trail for over 30 years , jean-marie le pen has campaigned at the top of french politics .
while labeled an anti-semite and rascist by some , he still commands enough support to add a dark dimension to the presidential election . from the earliest steps on the campaign trail , the french presidential election has been viewed as a two-horse race .
despite the wily incumbent jacques chirac 's mischievous ambiguity over whether he would run again and the emergence of rising centrist francois bayrou , the majority of bets have been split between interior minister nicolas sarkozy of the ruling conservative party or socialist challenger segolene royal taking over at the elysee palace . but in the current campaign , as has been the case in the last four presidential elections , there is a dark horse stalking the main candidates .
while sarkozy 's and royal 's people are busy putting out the fires from gaffes and scandals , a man who is no stranger to controversy in once again making a play for the top job in french politics . jean-marie le pen is back . the national front leader recently launched the fifth presidential election bid of his long career with the hope that he can go one better than in the 2002 campaign when he made it to the second-round run-off .
by becoming the one alternative to chirac in that election , the first in which he made it that far , le pen shocked the french political establishment , sent tremors through europe and ended the political career of socialist prime minister lionel jospin on the way .
it was the fear of seeing le pen in the elysee which drove voters on left and right to re-elect chirac by 82 percent . anti-immigration , nationalist bandwagon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : le pen plays on the fears of urban violence in france now it seems that after five more years of chirac , france has forgotten that fear .
le pen is in the mix again , and while his current campaign is less assured in the preliminary stages as it was in 2002 , the far-right stalwart is beginning to work up a head of steam with a populist manifesto built on promises to end immigration , pull france out of nato and slash taxes for the french only . the fact that le pen is once again contesting the presidency is a testament to his tenacity .
a street fighter in his youth - he lost an eye in one scuffle - and a former paratrooper and foreign legionnaire who saw active service in indochina and algeria , le pen is used to battles . in some ways , he is the epitome of the political survivor .
he is a man who has been convicted several times for remarks about jews or the holocaust , calling the nazi gas chambers " a detail of history " and describing the german occupation of france as " relatively humane . "
he dismissed the attacks on the twin towers on september 11 , 2001 , as an " incident , " and complained before the 1998 world cup that the french soccer team was not white enough .
and yet , despite his behavior and stance , le pen and his national front party still enjoy widespread support . greatest support in years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a third of french people find le pen unacceptable recent poll results published in the french newspaper le monde showed support for le pen at its highest levels in years , even better than in the run-up to the 2002 election where he polled 18.9 per cent , nearly 5.5 million voters .
in 1997 nearly half of french people saw le pen 's ideas as unacceptable ; now only a third think so . that a man with such extremist views can still compete at the top of french politics says much about the continued disillusionment with the political leadership within french society . le pen rose to prominence in the early 1970 's with a populist mix of anti-immigrant , pro-employment , and law-and-order promises .
and in the 30 years or more since he founded the national front , more immigrants have arrived in france , unemployment has become more of a problem and crime and unrest more prominent .
le pen has continually revamped his core policies to play to the fears of what he calls " france 's silent majority , " the grassroots voters who struggle to be heard above the nation 's " technocratic elite . " " le pen has enjoyed a shift in his voter base from urban to rural areas and from the young to elderly , " nonna mayer , an expert on french far-right politics from the research center for political science in paris , told dw-world.de.
" he has succeeded in extending and diversifying his social base .
this is one reason why he remains so relevant even in modern france . " appeal to disgruntled workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french farmers regularly protest against the government just as in the 2002 election , le pen is campaigning on a strong anti-immigration platform , blaming the " invasion " of foreigners for france 's rising unemployment , urban violence and what he calls " general impoverishment . "
he is also relying on the " humble workers " vote as he did five years ago , pandering to the discontent of blue-collar employees and farmers . the state of france 's agricultural sector has given le pen a new , powerful voting pool . " voting for the extreme right is developing in rural areas , " says mayer .
" in 1988 , voters in the large cities were most likely to vote for le pen .
in 1995 , his influence extended to middle-sized conurbations .
in 2002 , he was attracting voters in small towns of less than 2000 inhabitants . " mayer believes that this shows that le pen has maintained his political longevity by pinpointing issues that effect the diverse sections of french society ; urban crime for big city dwellers , loss of french identity through immigration for middle-class citizens , and loss of jobs and threat to industry for the working classes .
how ever distasteful his approach , he is seen by many as being the only candidate to address the issues that matter to them . le pen has also won support throughout his career due to the general disaffection the populace has with its leaders .
before the 2002 vote , 83 percent of voters polled said that " politicians do not care what people like us think " and 58 percent said that french politicians were " somewhat corrupt . " wake-up call bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all those who vote for him want le pen as president " the conditions were ideal for a protest vote in favor of le pen , " mayer said .
" it was a protest vote because although they agree massively with his ideas on immigration and law-and-order , most voters do n't want him to implement them .
only 41 percent of those who voted for le pen in 2002 actually wanted him to be elected . " votes for le pen , it seems , are used as a wake-up call for france to deal with the real problems in the society .
however , the need for him to continue to run shows that these calls are far from being heeded . this year , it is still unclear whether le pen will even make it into the presidential election race .
he is struggling to gain the backing of 500 elected officials needed to register formally by march 16 .
but if he does make into the first round , no one can rule out that his true supporters , and those registering another protest vote , can push the far-right leader into another run-off for the elysee and cause another european political earthquake . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " strong german fascism is inconceivable without a führer " far-right expert prof. wolfgang wippermann spoke to dw-world.de about jean-marie le pen and the possibility of such a leader and a movement like his national front gaining similar prominence in germany .

she will make her case at an upcoming eu summit . in the run-up to her first summit as president of the european union , the german chancellor told munich-based daily süddeutsche zeitung on sunday that european leaders " are going to ratify an action plan for climate protection and energy policy that is more concrete than ever before in the history of the european union . " but central proposals of the action plan are bound to cause contentious debate at the summit on thursday and friday .
the plan includes a commitment to supply 20 percent of europe 's energy needs from renewable sources such as wind power , a leading industry in germany . after an early round of informal talks in brussels on monday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier admitted that " the obligation of the 20 percent goal will still need to be negotiated at the summit . "
france and finland , for example , have signalled their reluctance to accept the binding goal for fear that it could jeopardize their national energy mix . chancellor merkel also plans to push for a europe-wide reduction of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , the man-made greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming .
the proposed plan would require the european states to reduce their overall co2-output by 20 percent below 1990-levels .
the 27 eu member states have agreed in principle to set this goal for 2020 , but will have to ratify the plan at the summit in order for it to become binding . member states have already agreed on a 10 percent increase of bio-fuels - such as ethanol gained from corn crops - over the next three years , assuming sufficient amounts of bio-fuel can be produced to meet the demand . europe becoming global role model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bio-fuels and modern engines significantly reduce the amount of co2 emissions from vehicles germany has assumed a lead role in pushing the environmental envelope and has already achieved a near-20 percent national reduction of co2 emissions below the levels of 1990 .
if the eu action plan is ratified , germany could reduce its overall co2 output by as much as 40 percent .
but not all member states will be held up to this high standard ; lower goals will be set for economically weaker eu countries . the action plan would also propel europe to the forefront of the global movement to mitigate the effects of global warming .
chancellor merkel spoke of a " paradigm shift " in sunday 's interview with the german daily : " so far , european nations made their own energy policy , " but " all that is now up for negotiation . " the german presidency of this year 's g8 summit will also allow merkel to talk to developing nations about alternative energy policies .
referring to the g8 summit , which will take place in june in the northern german resort town of heiligendamm , merkel specifically mentioned china , india , mexico , brazil and south africa . indeed , china appeared to hop on the green bandwagon prematurely on monday , as chinese premier wen jiabao vowed in his annual state of the nation address to curb " inefficient " economic growth and " excessive energy consumption . " merkel also told the süddeutsche zeitung that a rethinking of environmental policies was taking place in the united states .
she described " remarkable " progress there in the development of bio-fuels , but also said governments needed to " set the proper parameters " for the agricultural shifts this technology will likely bring about .
" once they identify a problem , " merkel said of the americans , " they develop a strong ambition to solve it .

france and finland , for example , have signalled their reluctance to accept the binding goal for fear that it could jeopardize their national energy mix . chancellor merkel also plans to push for a europe-wide reduction of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , the man-made greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming .
the proposed plan would require the european states to reduce their overall co2-output by 20 percent below 1990-levels .
the 27 eu member states have agreed in principle to set this goal for 2020 , but will have to ratify the plan at the summit in order for it to become binding . member states have already agreed on a 10 percent increase of bio-fuels - such as ethanol gained from corn crops - over the next three years , assuming sufficient amounts of bio-fuel can be produced to meet the demand . europe becoming global role model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bio-fuels and modern engines significantly reduce the amount of co2 emissions from vehicles germany has assumed a lead role in pushing the environmental envelope and has already achieved a near-20 percent national reduction of co2 emissions below the levels of 1990 .
if the eu action plan is ratified , germany could reduce its overall co2 output by as much as 40 percent .
but not all member states will be held up to this high standard ; lower goals will be set for economically weaker eu countries . the action plan would also propel europe to the forefront of the global movement to mitigate the effects of global warming .
chancellor merkel spoke of a " paradigm shift " in sunday 's interview with the german daily : " so far , european nations made their own energy policy , " but " all that is now up for negotiation . " the german presidency of this year 's g8 summit will also allow merkel to talk to developing nations about alternative energy policies .
referring to the g8 summit , which will take place in june in the northern german resort town of heiligendamm , merkel specifically mentioned china , india , mexico , brazil and south africa . indeed , china appeared to hop on the green bandwagon prematurely on monday , as chinese premier wen jiabao vowed in his annual state of the nation address to curb " inefficient " economic growth and " excessive energy consumption . " merkel also told the süddeutsche zeitung that a rethinking of environmental policies was taking place in the united states .
she described " remarkable " progress there in the development of bio-fuels , but also said governments needed to " set the proper parameters " for the agricultural shifts this technology will likely bring about .

le pen on the presidential campaign trail for over 30 years , jean-marie le pen has campaigned at the top of french politics .
while labeled an anti-semite and rascist by some , he still commands enough support to add a dark dimension to the presidential election . from the earliest steps on the campaign trail , the french presidential election has been viewed as a two-horse race .
despite the wily incumbent jacques chirac 's mischievous ambiguity over whether he would run again and the emergence of rising centrist francois bayrou , the majority of bets have been split between interior minister nicolas sarkozy of the ruling conservative party or socialist challenger segolene royal taking over at the elysee palace . but in the current campaign , as has been the case in the last four presidential elections , there is a dark horse stalking the main candidates .
while sarkozy 's and royal 's people are busy putting out the fires from gaffes and scandals , a man who is no stranger to controversy in once again making a play for the top job in french politics . jean-marie le pen is back . the national front leader recently launched the fifth presidential election bid of his long career with the hope that he can go one better than in the 2002 campaign when he made it to the second-round run-off .
by becoming the one alternative to chirac in that election , the first in which he made it that far , le pen shocked the french political establishment , sent tremors through europe and ended the political career of socialist prime minister lionel jospin on the way .
it was the fear of seeing le pen in the elysee which drove voters on left and right to re-elect chirac by 82 percent . anti-immigration , nationalist bandwagon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : le pen plays on the fears of urban violence in france now it seems that after five more years of chirac , france has forgotten that fear .
le pen is in the mix again , and while his current campaign is less assured in the preliminary stages as it was in 2002 , the far-right stalwart is beginning to work up a head of steam with a populist manifesto built on promises to end immigration , pull france out of nato and slash taxes for the french only . the fact that le pen is once again contesting the presidency is a testament to his tenacity .
a street fighter in his youth - he lost an eye in one scuffle - and a former paratrooper and foreign legionnaire who saw active service in indochina and algeria , le pen is used to battles . in some ways , he is the epitome of the political survivor .
he is a man who has been convicted several times for remarks about jews or the holocaust , calling the nazi gas chambers " a detail of history " and describing the german occupation of france as " relatively humane . "
he dismissed the attacks on the twin towers on september 11 , 2001 , as an " incident , " and complained before the 1998 world cup that the french soccer team was not white enough .
and yet , despite his behavior and stance , le pen and his national front party still enjoy widespread support . greatest support in years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a third of french people find le pen unacceptable recent poll results published in the french newspaper le monde showed support for le pen at its highest levels in years , even better than in the run-up to the 2002 election where he polled 18.9 per cent , nearly 5.5 million voters .
in 1997 nearly half of french people saw le pen 's ideas as unacceptable ; now only a third think so . that a man with such extremist views can still compete at the top of french politics says much about the continued disillusionment with the political leadership within french society . le pen rose to prominence in the early 1970 's with a populist mix of anti-immigrant , pro-employment , and law-and-order promises .
and in the 30 years or more since he founded the national front , more immigrants have arrived in france , unemployment has become more of a problem and crime and unrest more prominent .
le pen has continually revamped his core policies to play to the fears of what he calls " france 's silent majority , " the grassroots voters who struggle to be heard above the nation 's " technocratic elite . " " le pen has enjoyed a shift in his voter base from urban to rural areas and from the young to elderly , " nonna mayer , an expert on french far-right politics from the research center for political science in paris , told dw-world.de.
" he has succeeded in extending and diversifying his social base .
this is one reason why he remains so relevant even in modern france . " appeal to disgruntled workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french farmers regularly protest against the government just as in the 2002 election , le pen is campaigning on a strong anti-immigration platform , blaming the " invasion " of foreigners for france 's rising unemployment , urban violence and what he calls " general impoverishment . "
he is also relying on the " humble workers " vote as he did five years ago , pandering to the discontent of blue-collar employees and farmers . the state of france 's agricultural sector has given le pen a new , powerful voting pool . " voting for the extreme right is developing in rural areas , " says mayer .
" in 1988 , voters in the large cities were most likely to vote for le pen .
in 1995 , his influence extended to middle-sized conurbations .
in 2002 , he was attracting voters in small towns of less than 2000 inhabitants . " mayer believes that this shows that le pen has maintained his political longevity by pinpointing issues that effect the diverse sections of french society ; urban crime for big city dwellers , loss of french identity through immigration for middle-class citizens , and loss of jobs and threat to industry for the working classes .
how ever distasteful his approach , he is seen by many as being the only candidate to address the issues that matter to them . le pen has also won support throughout his career due to the general disaffection the populace has with its leaders .
before the 2002 vote , 83 percent of voters polled said that " politicians do not care what people like us think " and 58 percent said that french politicians were " somewhat corrupt . " wake-up call bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all those who vote for him want le pen as president " the conditions were ideal for a protest vote in favor of le pen , " mayer said .
" it was a protest vote because although they agree massively with his ideas on immigration and law-and-order , most voters do n't want him to implement them .
only 41 percent of those who voted for le pen in 2002 actually wanted him to be elected . " votes for le pen , it seems , are used as a wake-up call for france to deal with the real problems in the society .
however , the need for him to continue to run shows that these calls are far from being heeded . this year , it is still unclear whether le pen will even make it into the presidential election race .
he is struggling to gain the backing of 500 elected officials needed to register formally by march 16 .
but if he does make into the first round , no one can rule out that his true supporters , and those registering another protest vote , can push the far-right leader into another run-off for the elysee and cause another european political earthquake . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " strong german fascism is inconceivable without a führer " far-right expert prof. wolfgang wippermann spoke to dw-world.de about jean-marie le pen and the possibility of such a leader and a movement like his national front gaining similar prominence in germany .

" any attempt to revise the history of world war two needs to be watched carefully , " he told reporters on monday , saying such a revision posed a danger to poland and europe .
" i hope the process in germany will be stopped . " the film 's producers and actors said they intended for the film , whose second installment will be broadcast monday , to strike a chord with viewers . " i hope our film contributes to young and old people talking to each other about the worst chapter of german history , " said actress maria furtwängler , who plays the countess lena . director kai wessel , however , said he did not think attention would focus so closely on where guilt lays or vengeance , adding that he had only wanted to create a personal film that stayed true to the victims ' perspective . bildunterschrift : just over 13 percent of germans are estimated to have seen the series ' first installment german suffering long a taboo topic germans have long shied away from discussing their 14 million countrymen who fled the soviet army or were expelled after the allies allowed their eviction from poland , hungary and czechoslovakia .
historians estimate that some 2 million people died or were killed in the flight that began when the fall of the nazi regime became clear in 1944 . culture minister bernd neumann was among the germans lauding the film , which also shows soviet troops shooting children and raping women , as a cinematic achievement that brought the plight of german expellees to light . " no one wants to offset one side 's suffering against the other , " margot kässmann , a german protestant church leader , told the bild am sonntag newspaper as a debate erupted over why germans have long been silent . " but reconciliation will only be possible when those guilty acknowledge their crimes and victims get a chance to tell their stories , " added kässmann , whose family was among the refugees . latest in chain of tv dramas afraid it could be misconstrued as lessening the atrocities committed by the nazis during world war ii , other political leaders have avoided the issue of german suffering .
a similar debate over whether germans could be portrayed as victims ensued last year when " dresden , " a tv series on the firebombing of the eastern german city , earned high ratings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " dresden " centered on the city 's firebombing and an english-german love story " it was a national trauma and 60 years later , it was time to make a film seen from the victims ' point of view , " said jan mojto , a slovak national and head of munich-based eos film , which co-produced the nine-million-euro -lrb- $ 11.7-million -rrb- project . a berlin museum about the expelled germans that opened last year also sparked controversy .
polish leaders said it was an attempt by germans to portray themselves as victims of a war they started . " the problem in our view is not that the issue is being discussed , but how , " marek cichocki , foreign policy adviser to polish president lech kaczynski , told a german tv talk show on sunday .
" it focuses on individuals but blots out the bigger picture .
it 's disturbing that so much emphasis is on individual -lrb- suffering -rrb- , not the broader history . " the welt am sonntag newspaper said the drama was careful not to take sides . " germans are treated as both criminals and victims , " it wrote .
" it does n't pass judgment but rather depicts all the horrors .
that 's a prudent approach because there are no obvious answers .

" i hope our film contributes to young and old people talking to each other about the worst chapter of german history , " said actress maria furtwängler , who plays the countess lena . director kai wessel , however , said he did not think attention would focus so closely on where guilt lays or vengeance , adding that he had only wanted to create a personal film that stayed true to the victims ' perspective . bildunterschrift : just over 13 percent of germans are estimated to have seen the series ' first installment german suffering long a taboo topic germans have long shied away from discussing their 14 million countrymen who fled the soviet army or were expelled after the allies allowed their eviction from poland , hungary and czechoslovakia .
historians estimate that some 2 million people died or were killed in the flight that began when the fall of the nazi regime became clear in 1944 . culture minister bernd neumann was among the germans lauding the film , which also shows soviet troops shooting children and raping women , as a cinematic achievement that brought the plight of german expellees to light . " no one wants to offset one side 's suffering against the other , " margot kässmann , a german protestant church leader , told the bild am sonntag newspaper as a debate erupted over why germans have long been silent . " but reconciliation will only be possible when those guilty acknowledge their crimes and victims get a chance to tell their stories , " added kässmann , whose family was among the refugees . latest in chain of tv dramas afraid it could be misconstrued as lessening the atrocities committed by the nazis during world war ii , other political leaders have avoided the issue of german suffering .
a similar debate over whether germans could be portrayed as victims ensued last year when " dresden , " a tv series on the firebombing of the eastern german city , earned high ratings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " dresden " centered on the city 's firebombing and an english-german love story " it was a national trauma and 60 years later , it was time to make a film seen from the victims ' point of view , " said jan mojto , a slovak national and head of munich-based eos film , which co-produced the nine-million-euro -lrb- $ 11.7-million -rrb- project . a berlin museum about the expelled germans that opened last year also sparked controversy .
polish leaders said it was an attempt by germans to portray themselves as victims of a war they started . " the problem in our view is not that the issue is being discussed , but how , " marek cichocki , foreign policy adviser to polish president lech kaczynski , told a german tv talk show on sunday .
" it focuses on individuals but blots out the bigger picture .
it 's disturbing that so much emphasis is on individual -lrb- suffering -rrb- , not the broader history . " the welt am sonntag newspaper said the drama was careful not to take sides . " germans are treated as both criminals and victims , " it wrote .
" it does n't pass judgment but rather depicts all the horrors .
that 's a prudent approach because there are no obvious answers .

"
an intense debate has begun in germany on the kind of lifestyle changes needed to cut greenhouse gas emissions , days before eu leaders hold a summit on energy and climate change .
holidaying at home is one suggestion . the call from green party parliamentary leader renate kunast for spending vacations in germany to become fashionable once more was predictable , but the support she received from other parts of the political spectrum was less so . werner schnappauf , environment minister for bavaria 's conservative christian social party , said germans should change their lifestyles .
" learn to value the qualities close to where you live , " was his contribution to an increasingly lively debate . the deputy parliamentary leader of the social democrats , ulrich kelber , called for germans to avoid flights as far as possible as their own " private contribution " to halting climate change .
holidays in germany and neighboring countries could be " lovely , " kelber said , extolling the virtues of train travel . ever since germany 's postwar boom , the so-called wirtschaftswunder -lrb- economic miracle -rrb- , germans have been avid travelers . german tourists first to travel en masse far and wide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tourists bring good business to holiday destinations the mediterranean came first as the trendy holiday destination .
east africa , latin america , the caribbean and the far east soon followed . trinket shops in every corner of the world - at least every sunny corner - have for decades posted the sign : " man spricht deutsch " -lrb- german spoken here -rrb- in their windows in the hope of earning solid deutsche marks or euros . but now " sylt not the seychelles , " is the holidaying slogan , in reference to the island just off the baltic coast where germany 's beautiful people have long spent weekends . the tourist industry is ready to take the change in its stride , well aware that margins on the long-haul flights are now minimal compared with what can be earned from up-market destinations closer to home . " in many circles it will no longer be chic in a couple of years to pollute the environment with tons of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- while on holiday , " said martin buck , director of berlin 's international tourist bourse , which opens wednesday . cheap flights and package tours in danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap holiday ?
walk this way buck predicted that companies offering the traditional package tour were about to face serious problems . the figures are convincing .
according to andreas tröge , head of germany 's federal environment agency , a return flight to thailand " costs " six tons of co2 , while a return train journey from berlin to the baltic weighs in at just 35 kilograms -lrb- 77 pounds -rrb- . federal environment minister sigmar gabriel has demanded that airlines offer customers the option of paying a supplement to fund projects to compensate for the co2 consumed on the flight . national flag carrier lufthansa has said it is looking for a business partner to launch a scheme of this kind . as many commentators have pointed out , the cheap flights era has led to market absurdities .
taxi ride to airports in most european cities now cost considerably more than flights to mallorca , rimini , corfu or adana . change in lifestyle greenpeace germany 's head , brigitte behrens , voiced the opinion of many when she told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper : " cheap flights should be banned . " that call is likely to fall on deaf ears when the eu leaders gather in brussels on thursday . but as a survey published last week showed , the german public is way ahead of its political leaders when it comes to the lifestyle changes needed to counter environmental damage . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : global warming could devastate ski resorts after a record warm november delayed snowfall in the alps , a new oecd report has warned that climate change poses " serious risks " to snow reliability in ski areas and could dramatically impact their economies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 05.03.2007 germans encouraged to holiday at home for environment 's sake großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " why should i travel when it 's so beautiful here in germany ? "
an intense debate has begun in germany on the kind of lifestyle changes needed to cut greenhouse gas emissions , days before eu leaders hold a summit on energy and climate change .
holidaying at home is one suggestion . the call from green party parliamentary leader renate kunast for spending vacations in germany to become fashionable once more was predictable , but the support she received from other parts of the political spectrum was less so . werner schnappauf , environment minister for bavaria 's conservative christian social party , said germans should change their lifestyles .
" learn to value the qualities close to where you live , " was his contribution to an increasingly lively debate . the deputy parliamentary leader of the social democrats , ulrich kelber , called for germans to avoid flights as far as possible as their own " private contribution " to halting climate change .
holidays in germany and neighboring countries could be " lovely , " kelber said , extolling the virtues of train travel . ever since germany 's postwar boom , the so-called wirtschaftswunder -lrb- economic miracle -rrb- , germans have been avid travelers . german tourists first to travel en masse far and wide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tourists bring good business to holiday destinations the mediterranean came first as the trendy holiday destination .
east africa , latin america , the caribbean and the far east soon followed . trinket shops in every corner of the world - at least every sunny corner - have for decades posted the sign : " man spricht deutsch " -lrb- german spoken here -rrb- in their windows in the hope of earning solid deutsche marks or euros . but now " sylt not the seychelles , " is the holidaying slogan , in reference to the island just off the baltic coast where germany 's beautiful people have long spent weekends . the tourist industry is ready to take the change in its stride , well aware that margins on the long-haul flights are now minimal compared with what can be earned from up-market destinations closer to home . " in many circles it will no longer be chic in a couple of years to pollute the environment with tons of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- while on holiday , " said martin buck , director of berlin 's international tourist bourse , which opens wednesday . cheap flights and package tours in danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap holiday ?

"
an intense debate has begun in germany on the kind of lifestyle changes needed to cut greenhouse gas emissions , days before eu leaders hold a summit on energy and climate change .
holidaying at home is one suggestion . the call from green party parliamentary leader renate kunast for spending vacations in germany to become fashionable once more was predictable , but the support she received from other parts of the political spectrum was less so . werner schnappauf , environment minister for bavaria 's conservative christian social party , said germans should change their lifestyles .
" learn to value the qualities close to where you live , " was his contribution to an increasingly lively debate . the deputy parliamentary leader of the social democrats , ulrich kelber , called for germans to avoid flights as far as possible as their own " private contribution " to halting climate change .
holidays in germany and neighboring countries could be " lovely , " kelber said , extolling the virtues of train travel . ever since germany 's postwar boom , the so-called wirtschaftswunder -lrb- economic miracle -rrb- , germans have been avid travelers . german tourists first to travel en masse far and wide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tourists bring good business to holiday destinations the mediterranean came first as the trendy holiday destination .

" in many circles it will no longer be chic in a couple of years to pollute the environment with tons of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- while on holiday , " said martin buck , director of berlin 's international tourist bourse , which opens wednesday . cheap flights and package tours in danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap holiday ?

she will make her case at an upcoming eu summit . in the run-up to her first summit as president of the european union , the german chancellor told munich-based daily süddeutsche zeitung on sunday that european leaders " are going to ratify an action plan for climate protection and energy policy that is more concrete than ever before in the history of the european union . " but central proposals of the action plan are bound to cause contentious debate at the summit on thursday and friday .
the plan includes a commitment to supply 20 percent of europe 's energy needs from renewable sources such as wind power , a leading industry in germany . after an early round of informal talks in brussels on monday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier admitted that " the obligation of the 20 percent goal will still need to be negotiated at the summit . "
france and finland , for example , have signalled their reluctance to accept the binding goal for fear that it could jeopardize their national energy mix . chancellor merkel also plans to push for a europe-wide reduction of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- , the man-made greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming .
the proposed plan would require the european states to reduce their overall co2-output by 20 percent below 1990-levels .
the 27 eu member states have agreed in principle to set this goal for 2020 , but will have to ratify the plan at the summit in order for it to become binding . member states have already agreed on a 10 percent increase of bio-fuels - such as ethanol gained from corn crops - over the next three years , assuming sufficient amounts of bio-fuel can be produced to meet the demand . europe becoming global role model bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bio-fuels and modern engines significantly reduce the amount of co2 emissions from vehicles germany has assumed a lead role in pushing the environmental envelope and has already achieved a near-20 percent national reduction of co2 emissions below the levels of 1990 .
if the eu action plan is ratified , germany could reduce its overall co2 output by as much as 40 percent .
but not all member states will be held up to this high standard ; lower goals will be set for economically weaker eu countries . the action plan would also propel europe to the forefront of the global movement to mitigate the effects of global warming .
chancellor merkel spoke of a " paradigm shift " in sunday 's interview with the german daily : " so far , european nations made their own energy policy , " but " all that is now up for negotiation . " the german presidency of this year 's g8 summit will also allow merkel to talk to developing nations about alternative energy policies .
referring to the g8 summit , which will take place in june in the northern german resort town of heiligendamm , merkel specifically mentioned china , india , mexico , brazil and south africa . indeed , china appeared to hop on the green bandwagon prematurely on monday , as chinese premier wen jiabao vowed in his annual state of the nation address to curb " inefficient " economic growth and " excessive energy consumption . " merkel also told the süddeutsche zeitung that a rethinking of environmental policies was taking place in the united states .
she described " remarkable " progress there in the development of bio-fuels , but also said governments needed to " set the proper parameters " for the agricultural shifts this technology will likely bring about .
" once they identify a problem , " merkel said of the americans , " they develop a strong ambition to solve it .

if the eu action plan is ratified , germany could reduce its overall co2 output by as much as 40 percent .
but not all member states will be held up to this high standard ; lower goals will be set for economically weaker eu countries . the action plan would also propel europe to the forefront of the global movement to mitigate the effects of global warming .
chancellor merkel spoke of a " paradigm shift " in sunday 's interview with the german daily : " so far , european nations made their own energy policy , " but " all that is now up for negotiation . " the german presidency of this year 's g8 summit will also allow merkel to talk to developing nations about alternative energy policies .

" merkel also told the süddeutsche zeitung that a rethinking of environmental policies was taking place in the united states .
she described " remarkable " progress there in the development of bio-fuels , but also said governments needed to " set the proper parameters " for the agricultural shifts this technology will likely bring about .

despite the wily incumbent jacques chirac 's mischievous ambiguity over whether he would run again and the emergence of rising centrist francois bayrou , the majority of bets have been split between interior minister nicolas sarkozy of the ruling conservative party or socialist challenger segolene royal taking over at the elysee palace . but in the current campaign , as has been the case in the last four presidential elections , there is a dark horse stalking the main candidates .
while sarkozy 's and royal 's people are busy putting out the fires from gaffes and scandals , a man who is no stranger to controversy in once again making a play for the top job in french politics . jean-marie le pen is back . the national front leader recently launched the fifth presidential election bid of his long career with the hope that he can go one better than in the 2002 campaign when he made it to the second-round run-off .
by becoming the one alternative to chirac in that election , the first in which he made it that far , le pen shocked the french political establishment , sent tremors through europe and ended the political career of socialist prime minister lionel jospin on the way .
it was the fear of seeing le pen in the elysee which drove voters on left and right to re-elect chirac by 82 percent . anti-immigration , nationalist bandwagon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : le pen plays on the fears of urban violence in france now it seems that after five more years of chirac , france has forgotten that fear .
le pen is in the mix again , and while his current campaign is less assured in the preliminary stages as it was in 2002 , the far-right stalwart is beginning to work up a head of steam with a populist manifesto built on promises to end immigration , pull france out of nato and slash taxes for the french only . the fact that le pen is once again contesting the presidency is a testament to his tenacity .
a street fighter in his youth - he lost an eye in one scuffle - and a former paratrooper and foreign legionnaire who saw active service in indochina and algeria , le pen is used to battles . in some ways , he is the epitome of the political survivor .
he is a man who has been convicted several times for remarks about jews or the holocaust , calling the nazi gas chambers " a detail of history " and describing the german occupation of france as " relatively humane . "
he dismissed the attacks on the twin towers on september 11 , 2001 , as an " incident , " and complained before the 1998 world cup that the french soccer team was not white enough .
and yet , despite his behavior and stance , le pen and his national front party still enjoy widespread support . greatest support in years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a third of french people find le pen unacceptable recent poll results published in the french newspaper le monde showed support for le pen at its highest levels in years , even better than in the run-up to the 2002 election where he polled 18.9 per cent , nearly 5.5 million voters .
in 1997 nearly half of french people saw le pen 's ideas as unacceptable ; now only a third think so . that a man with such extremist views can still compete at the top of french politics says much about the continued disillusionment with the political leadership within french society . le pen rose to prominence in the early 1970 's with a populist mix of anti-immigrant , pro-employment , and law-and-order promises .
and in the 30 years or more since he founded the national front , more immigrants have arrived in france , unemployment has become more of a problem and crime and unrest more prominent .
le pen has continually revamped his core policies to play to the fears of what he calls " france 's silent majority , " the grassroots voters who struggle to be heard above the nation 's " technocratic elite . " " le pen has enjoyed a shift in his voter base from urban to rural areas and from the young to elderly , " nonna mayer , an expert on french far-right politics from the research center for political science in paris , told dw-world.de.
" he has succeeded in extending and diversifying his social base .
this is one reason why he remains so relevant even in modern france . " appeal to disgruntled workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french farmers regularly protest against the government just as in the 2002 election , le pen is campaigning on a strong anti-immigration platform , blaming the " invasion " of foreigners for france 's rising unemployment , urban violence and what he calls " general impoverishment . "
he is also relying on the " humble workers " vote as he did five years ago , pandering to the discontent of blue-collar employees and farmers . the state of france 's agricultural sector has given le pen a new , powerful voting pool . " voting for the extreme right is developing in rural areas , " says mayer .
" in 1988 , voters in the large cities were most likely to vote for le pen .
in 1995 , his influence extended to middle-sized conurbations .
in 2002 , he was attracting voters in small towns of less than 2000 inhabitants . " mayer believes that this shows that le pen has maintained his political longevity by pinpointing issues that effect the diverse sections of french society ; urban crime for big city dwellers , loss of french identity through immigration for middle-class citizens , and loss of jobs and threat to industry for the working classes .
how ever distasteful his approach , he is seen by many as being the only candidate to address the issues that matter to them . le pen has also won support throughout his career due to the general disaffection the populace has with its leaders .
before the 2002 vote , 83 percent of voters polled said that " politicians do not care what people like us think " and 58 percent said that french politicians were " somewhat corrupt . " wake-up call bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all those who vote for him want le pen as president " the conditions were ideal for a protest vote in favor of le pen , " mayer said .
" it was a protest vote because although they agree massively with his ideas on immigration and law-and-order , most voters do n't want him to implement them .
only 41 percent of those who voted for le pen in 2002 actually wanted him to be elected . " votes for le pen , it seems , are used as a wake-up call for france to deal with the real problems in the society .
however , the need for him to continue to run shows that these calls are far from being heeded . this year , it is still unclear whether le pen will even make it into the presidential election race .
he is struggling to gain the backing of 500 elected officials needed to register formally by march 16 .

le pen is in the mix again , and while his current campaign is less assured in the preliminary stages as it was in 2002 , the far-right stalwart is beginning to work up a head of steam with a populist manifesto built on promises to end immigration , pull france out of nato and slash taxes for the french only . the fact that le pen is once again contesting the presidency is a testament to his tenacity .
a street fighter in his youth - he lost an eye in one scuffle - and a former paratrooper and foreign legionnaire who saw active service in indochina and algeria , le pen is used to battles . in some ways , he is the epitome of the political survivor .
he is a man who has been convicted several times for remarks about jews or the holocaust , calling the nazi gas chambers " a detail of history " and describing the german occupation of france as " relatively humane . "
he dismissed the attacks on the twin towers on september 11 , 2001 , as an " incident , " and complained before the 1998 world cup that the french soccer team was not white enough .
and yet , despite his behavior and stance , le pen and his national front party still enjoy widespread support . greatest support in years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a third of french people find le pen unacceptable recent poll results published in the french newspaper le monde showed support for le pen at its highest levels in years , even better than in the run-up to the 2002 election where he polled 18.9 per cent , nearly 5.5 million voters .
in 1997 nearly half of french people saw le pen 's ideas as unacceptable ; now only a third think so . that a man with such extremist views can still compete at the top of french politics says much about the continued disillusionment with the political leadership within french society . le pen rose to prominence in the early 1970 's with a populist mix of anti-immigrant , pro-employment , and law-and-order promises .
and in the 30 years or more since he founded the national front , more immigrants have arrived in france , unemployment has become more of a problem and crime and unrest more prominent .
le pen has continually revamped his core policies to play to the fears of what he calls " france 's silent majority , " the grassroots voters who struggle to be heard above the nation 's " technocratic elite . " " le pen has enjoyed a shift in his voter base from urban to rural areas and from the young to elderly , " nonna mayer , an expert on french far-right politics from the research center for political science in paris , told dw-world.de.
" he has succeeded in extending and diversifying his social base .
this is one reason why he remains so relevant even in modern france . " appeal to disgruntled workers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french farmers regularly protest against the government just as in the 2002 election , le pen is campaigning on a strong anti-immigration platform , blaming the " invasion " of foreigners for france 's rising unemployment , urban violence and what he calls " general impoverishment . "
he is also relying on the " humble workers " vote as he did five years ago , pandering to the discontent of blue-collar employees and farmers . the state of france 's agricultural sector has given le pen a new , powerful voting pool . " voting for the extreme right is developing in rural areas , " says mayer .
" in 1988 , voters in the large cities were most likely to vote for le pen .
in 1995 , his influence extended to middle-sized conurbations .
in 2002 , he was attracting voters in small towns of less than 2000 inhabitants . " mayer believes that this shows that le pen has maintained his political longevity by pinpointing issues that effect the diverse sections of french society ; urban crime for big city dwellers , loss of french identity through immigration for middle-class citizens , and loss of jobs and threat to industry for the working classes .
how ever distasteful his approach , he is seen by many as being the only candidate to address the issues that matter to them . le pen has also won support throughout his career due to the general disaffection the populace has with its leaders .

" wake-up call bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all those who vote for him want le pen as president " the conditions were ideal for a protest vote in favor of le pen , " mayer said .
" it was a protest vote because although they agree massively with his ideas on immigration and law-and-order , most voters do n't want him to implement them .
only 41 percent of those who voted for le pen in 2002 actually wanted him to be elected . " votes for le pen , it seems , are used as a wake-up call for france to deal with the real problems in the society .

le pen on the presidential campaign trail for over 30 years , jean-marie le pen has campaigned at the top of french politics .
while labeled an anti-semite and rascist by some , he still commands enough support to add a dark dimension to the presidential election . from the earliest steps on the campaign trail , the french presidential election has been viewed as a two-horse race .
despite the wily incumbent jacques chirac 's mischievous ambiguity over whether he would run again and the emergence of rising centrist francois bayrou , the majority of bets have been split between interior minister nicolas sarkozy of the ruling conservative party or socialist challenger segolene royal taking over at the elysee palace . but in the current campaign , as has been the case in the last four presidential elections , there is a dark horse stalking the main candidates .
while sarkozy 's and royal 's people are busy putting out the fires from gaffes and scandals , a man who is no stranger to controversy in once again making a play for the top job in french politics . jean-marie le pen is back . the national front leader recently launched the fifth presidential election bid of his long career with the hope that he can go one better than in the 2002 campaign when he made it to the second-round run-off .
by becoming the one alternative to chirac in that election , the first in which he made it that far , le pen shocked the french political establishment , sent tremors through europe and ended the political career of socialist prime minister lionel jospin on the way .

-lrb- constitutional regulations , laws against xenophobia etc . -rrb- wippermann : the main difference lies not in the political system , but concerns the people involved .
extremist organizations need strong leaders to be successful .
but le pen , while a charismatic leader in the past , is now too old for anyone to consider him powerful .
however , the german equivalent , gerhard frey , still pales into insignificance beside him .
and that is one reason why it is unlikely that frey would ever be able to reach a similar level .
strong german fascism is inconceivable without a " führer . " that is not to say that there is no danger of this happening in germany again .
while there are laws that prevent the glorification of the third reich and forbid anti-semitism , there is still a burgeoning far-right movement in germany , in particular in the former east german states where there are even " no-go areas " controlled by extremists which present a great risk to foreigners should they enter them .
also , recent research shows that at least 20 percent of germans profess hatred towards foreigners while 40 percent admit to anti-semitic feelings and even more , 64-68 percent holds grudges against roma and gypsies . are there any laws and structures in place in germany to prevent a radical right-wing leader from rising to power ? while there are rules in place which protect the constitution in germany , most have been installed to prevent a repeat of germany 's history but are out-dated when dealing with modern fascism . what are the social differences between france and germany which allow le pen to have such support ? le pen taps into the anti-democratic and napoleonic tradition of fascism in france .
there is the heightened fear of the foreigner , especially arab muslim immigrants who are blamed for all the sins in france , mainly unemployment and crime .
the issue of unemployment for the native citizens is one which is also a hot topic in germany .
turkish immigrants in germany are seen in the very same way as north african immigrants are in france .
but in france , there is a very strong movement for " france for the french , " something which the germans would not allow due to their history of nationalism . le pen is seen as a man of the people who has struggled and felt the pain of the common man in dealing with the hardships which have been brought on france allegedly by the foreigner .
germany has no connection like that with its far-right movement . is it possible that a social change could happen in modern germany where a figure like le pen achieves credibility and support within the electorate ? yes and no .
the germans from today are , according to my appraisals after teaching history for 30 years , better at learning from their fascist past than the french and are better at appraising the present dangers .
however , it can not be said that democracy is anchored in germany more firmly than it is in france .

-lrb- constitutional regulations , laws against xenophobia etc . -rrb- wippermann : the main difference lies not in the political system , but concerns the people involved .
extremist organizations need strong leaders to be successful .
but le pen , while a charismatic leader in the past , is now too old for anyone to consider him powerful .
however , the german equivalent , gerhard frey , still pales into insignificance beside him .
and that is one reason why it is unlikely that frey would ever be able to reach a similar level .
strong german fascism is inconceivable without a " führer . " that is not to say that there is no danger of this happening in germany again .
while there are laws that prevent the glorification of the third reich and forbid anti-semitism , there is still a burgeoning far-right movement in germany , in particular in the former east german states where there are even " no-go areas " controlled by extremists which present a great risk to foreigners should they enter them .
also , recent research shows that at least 20 percent of germans profess hatred towards foreigners while 40 percent admit to anti-semitic feelings and even more , 64-68 percent holds grudges against roma and gypsies . are there any laws and structures in place in germany to prevent a radical right-wing leader from rising to power ? while there are rules in place which protect the constitution in germany , most have been installed to prevent a repeat of germany 's history but are out-dated when dealing with modern fascism . what are the social differences between france and germany which allow le pen to have such support ? le pen taps into the anti-democratic and napoleonic tradition of fascism in france .
there is the heightened fear of the foreigner , especially arab muslim immigrants who are blamed for all the sins in france , mainly unemployment and crime .
the issue of unemployment for the native citizens is one which is also a hot topic in germany .
turkish immigrants in germany are seen in the very same way as north african immigrants are in france .
but in france , there is a very strong movement for " france for the french , " something which the germans would not allow due to their history of nationalism . le pen is seen as a man of the people who has struggled and felt the pain of the common man in dealing with the hardships which have been brought on france allegedly by the foreigner .
germany has no connection like that with its far-right movement . is it possible that a social change could happen in modern germany where a figure like le pen achieves credibility and support within the electorate ? yes and no .
the germans from today are , according to my appraisals after teaching history for 30 years , better at learning from their fascist past than the french and are better at appraising the present dangers .
however , it can not be said that democracy is anchored in germany more firmly than it is in france .
both france and germany have had to learn the lessons of the past and must look to each other for guidance on dealing with the future . nick amies interviewed wolfgang wippermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel at fault for right-wing rise , opposition says the head of a german opposition political party accused the current government of fuelling right-wing unrest with its policies .

his new album and upcoming tour have generated huge excitement in german-speaking countries and little interest anywhere else . grönemeyer 's new album " 12 " is already muscling its way onto the german music charts . at 50 , grönemeyer is one of germany 's biggest celebrities while remaining virtually unknown in europe or the united states .
one of the reasons might be that his playful , poetic german lyrics do n't translate that well . yet the language barrier has n't stopped the singer from selling millions of albums and becoming one of the best-known and well-loved of germany 's pop rock stars .
a new grönemeyer release usually generates glowing reviews and sold-out concerts . so it 's no surprise that german critics have heaped praise on grönemeyer 's latest release , which was released friday . the album 's energetic single " ein stück von himmel , " or " a piece of heaven , " has already topped the charts and gone into rotation on german mtv . berlinonline calls it " intoxicating and simply grandiose . " the german bono bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics love grönemeyer 's new album " 12 " many of grönemeyer 's lyrics deal with political issues .
he has been outspoken opponent of nuclear power and racism and makes frequent calls for tolerance and peace .
he continues to be involved with efforts to end poverty in africa . grönemeyer began his singing career in the early 1980s in his hometown of bochum .
his breakthrough was the cult-song " männer " or " men . "
the album of the same name stayed on the charts for 79 weeks . he also did some acting , playing a war correspondent in the german film " das boot . "
his performance in the successful film made grönemeyer one of germany 's most well-known stars . in 1998 , grönemeyer suffered a double tragedy : he lost both his wife and brother to cancer .
in the wake of those deaths , he almost entirely disappeared from public .

" united response to russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus employees have taken to the street to protest a restructuring program shares in eads dropped by 8.6 percent last week after the announcement that its subsidiary aircraft manufacturer airbus would cut 10,000 jobs over four years , streamline its production facilities and reorganize the distribution of work between factories across europe . merkel also said it was important for the eu to act in a unified manner when dealing with russia , no easy task as eastern european countries often have a different opinion on moscow 's policies than western european nations . poland , for example , delayed talks on an eu-russia energy partnership pact last year because warsaw opposed a trade embargo russia placed on polish meat products . rockets raise additional questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the us missile shield is already being set up in japan tensions in russia were also heightened last month after the us announced plans for a missile defense shield , portions of which would be located in poland and the czech republic .
the two eu member states have expressed their acceptance of the us plans while putin said the shield posed a threat to moscow and could potentially start a new arms race . germany 's merkel backed the american proposal , saying the missile shield was a " purely defensive system " that would not be aimed at russia and an issue that needed to be discussed in talks between russia and nato .

"
an intense debate has begun in germany on the kind of lifestyle changes needed to cut greenhouse gas emissions , days before eu leaders hold a summit on energy and climate change .
holidaying at home is one suggestion . the call from green party parliamentary leader renate kunast for spending vacations in germany to become fashionable once more was predictable , but the support she received from other parts of the political spectrum was less so . werner schnappauf , environment minister for bavaria 's conservative christian social party , said germans should change their lifestyles .
" learn to value the qualities close to where you live , " was his contribution to an increasingly lively debate . the deputy parliamentary leader of the social democrats , ulrich kelber , called for germans to avoid flights as far as possible as their own " private contribution " to halting climate change .
holidays in germany and neighboring countries could be " lovely , " kelber said , extolling the virtues of train travel . ever since germany 's postwar boom , the so-called wirtschaftswunder -lrb- economic miracle -rrb- , germans have been avid travelers . german tourists first to travel en masse far and wide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tourists bring good business to holiday destinations the mediterranean came first as the trendy holiday destination .
east africa , latin america , the caribbean and the far east soon followed . trinket shops in every corner of the world - at least every sunny corner - have for decades posted the sign : " man spricht deutsch " -lrb- german spoken here -rrb- in their windows in the hope of earning solid deutsche marks or euros . but now " sylt not the seychelles , " is the holidaying slogan , in reference to the island just off the baltic coast where germany 's beautiful people have long spent weekends . the tourist industry is ready to take the change in its stride , well aware that margins on the long-haul flights are now minimal compared with what can be earned from up-market destinations closer to home . " in many circles it will no longer be chic in a couple of years to pollute the environment with tons of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- while on holiday , " said martin buck , director of berlin 's international tourist bourse , which opens wednesday . cheap flights and package tours in danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap holiday ?
walk this way buck predicted that companies offering the traditional package tour were about to face serious problems . the figures are convincing .
according to andreas tröge , head of germany 's federal environment agency , a return flight to thailand " costs " six tons of co2 , while a return train journey from berlin to the baltic weighs in at just 35 kilograms -lrb- 77 pounds -rrb- . federal environment minister sigmar gabriel has demanded that airlines offer customers the option of paying a supplement to fund projects to compensate for the co2 consumed on the flight . national flag carrier lufthansa has said it is looking for a business partner to launch a scheme of this kind . as many commentators have pointed out , the cheap flights era has led to market absurdities .
taxi ride to airports in most european cities now cost considerably more than flights to mallorca , rimini , corfu or adana . change in lifestyle greenpeace germany 's head , brigitte behrens , voiced the opinion of many when she told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper : " cheap flights should be banned . " that call is likely to fall on deaf ears when the eu leaders gather in brussels on thursday . but as a survey published last week showed , the german public is way ahead of its political leaders when it comes to the lifestyle changes needed to counter environmental damage . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : global warming could devastate ski resorts after a record warm november delayed snowfall in the alps , a new oecd report has warned that climate change poses " serious risks " to snow reliability in ski areas and could dramatically impact their economies .
-lrb- 13.12.2006 -rrb- germany up in arms over minister 's holiday comments germany 's finance minister has sparked outrage by suggesting germans should spend less on their annual holidays and instead put money aside for their old age .
the comments have sparked a lively debate about the economy .
-lrb- 20.08.2006 -rrb- luring tourists to a germany less traveled visits to germany 's more obscure destinations are rare by foreign tourists and even locals are often deterred .
in the country of autobahns , the latter might be partly to blame .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 05.03.2007 germans encouraged to holiday at home for environment 's sake großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " why should i travel when it 's so beautiful here in germany ? "
an intense debate has begun in germany on the kind of lifestyle changes needed to cut greenhouse gas emissions , days before eu leaders hold a summit on energy and climate change .
holidaying at home is one suggestion . the call from green party parliamentary leader renate kunast for spending vacations in germany to become fashionable once more was predictable , but the support she received from other parts of the political spectrum was less so . werner schnappauf , environment minister for bavaria 's conservative christian social party , said germans should change their lifestyles .
" learn to value the qualities close to where you live , " was his contribution to an increasingly lively debate . the deputy parliamentary leader of the social democrats , ulrich kelber , called for germans to avoid flights as far as possible as their own " private contribution " to halting climate change .
holidays in germany and neighboring countries could be " lovely , " kelber said , extolling the virtues of train travel . ever since germany 's postwar boom , the so-called wirtschaftswunder -lrb- economic miracle -rrb- , germans have been avid travelers . german tourists first to travel en masse far and wide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tourists bring good business to holiday destinations the mediterranean came first as the trendy holiday destination .
east africa , latin america , the caribbean and the far east soon followed . trinket shops in every corner of the world - at least every sunny corner - have for decades posted the sign : " man spricht deutsch " -lrb- german spoken here -rrb- in their windows in the hope of earning solid deutsche marks or euros . but now " sylt not the seychelles , " is the holidaying slogan , in reference to the island just off the baltic coast where germany 's beautiful people have long spent weekends . the tourist industry is ready to take the change in its stride , well aware that margins on the long-haul flights are now minimal compared with what can be earned from up-market destinations closer to home . " in many circles it will no longer be chic in a couple of years to pollute the environment with tons of carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- while on holiday , " said martin buck , director of berlin 's international tourist bourse , which opens wednesday . cheap flights and package tours in danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap holiday ?
walk this way buck predicted that companies offering the traditional package tour were about to face serious problems . the figures are convincing .
according to andreas tröge , head of germany 's federal environment agency , a return flight to thailand " costs " six tons of co2 , while a return train journey from berlin to the baltic weighs in at just 35 kilograms -lrb- 77 pounds -rrb- . federal environment minister sigmar gabriel has demanded that airlines offer customers the option of paying a supplement to fund projects to compensate for the co2 consumed on the flight . national flag carrier lufthansa has said it is looking for a business partner to launch a scheme of this kind . as many commentators have pointed out , the cheap flights era has led to market absurdities .
taxi ride to airports in most european cities now cost considerably more than flights to mallorca , rimini , corfu or adana . change in lifestyle greenpeace germany 's head , brigitte behrens , voiced the opinion of many when she told berlin 's tagesspiegel newspaper : " cheap flights should be banned . " that call is likely to fall on deaf ears when the eu leaders gather in brussels on thursday . but as a survey published last week showed , the german public is way ahead of its political leaders when it comes to the lifestyle changes needed to counter environmental damage . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : global warming could devastate ski resorts after a record warm november delayed snowfall in the alps , a new oecd report has warned that climate change poses " serious risks " to snow reliability in ski areas and could dramatically impact their economies .
-lrb- 13.12.2006 -rrb- germany up in arms over minister 's holiday comments germany 's finance minister has sparked outrage by suggesting germans should spend less on their annual holidays and instead put money aside for their old age .
the comments have sparked a lively debate about the economy .
-lrb- 20.08.2006 -rrb- luring tourists to a germany less traveled visits to germany 's more obscure destinations are rare by foreign tourists and even locals are often deterred .
in the country of autobahns , the latter might be partly to blame .

last week at talks in berlin , danish transport minister flemming hansen received an agreement " in principle " to limited funding .
the details of the offer have not been made public . the 5.5-billion-euro -lrb- $ 7.2-billion -rrb- bridge across a strait between the islands of fehmarn and lolland would replace a train-and-car ferry which runs every 30 minutes , and avoid a road detour via a bridge to the jutland peninsula . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : transnet is unhappy with berlin 's direction job losses could be permanent transnet said a new bridge would put up to 2,000 ferry workers and staff at contractors out of jobs .
" it would be a job-killer , " said wolfgang zell , adding that 600 workers at ferry company scandlines in the port of puttgarden would lose jobs , along with 300 working for contractors , while other ferry operators along the coast would suffer a loss of trade , too . he also said claims that a 20-kilometer -lrb- 12-mile -rrb- suspension bridge would create permanent jobs were incomprehensible . south side uninterested bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee -lrb- left -rrb- with his danish counterpart flemming hansen germans have shown only limited interest in the border bridge , since it would mainly benefit scandinavian economies by offering better access to continental markets .
the governments would have to provide the financing which could not be raised by tolls .
the project has been under discussion for 15 years , and one german chancellor after another has found a way to avoid it .
now , however , it 's starting to look serious , and wrangling over jobs and funding is escalating . officials have said the bridge could open in 2017 if parliaments approved the necessary guarantees for private investors who would try to recover most of the construction cost by charging a toll .

mr abe said none of the testimony in recent us congress hearings showed solid proof prostitutes were abused .
elaborating on comments he made last week , he said he would not go beyond a 1993 apology on the issue , even if washington asked for one .
many historians say japan compelled up to 200,000 women , mostly chinese and korean , to become sex slaves .
but some japanese scholars deny that force was used to round up the women , blaming private contractors for any abuses .
last thursday mr abe sided with these critics , saying there was " no evidence to prove there was coercion " .
south korean foreign minister song min-soon retaliated , saying mr abe 's remarks were " not helpful " and the truth must be faced .
on monday , mr abe again commented on the issue , saying while there was no evidence of coercion in the strict sense , there may be some evidence of independent brokers procuring women by force .
but " it was not as though military police broke into peoples ' homes and took them away like kidnappers , " he said .
us hearings the us house of representatives is currently considering a non-binding resolution calling on tokyo to " formally acknowledge , apologise and accept historical responsibility " for these so-called comfort women .
there were an estimated 200,000 comfort women the draft text was debated last week , and three former comfort women gave evidence , describing the rape and torture they endured at the hands of the japanese soldiers .
" i have to say that even if the resolution passes , that does n't mean we will apologise , " mr abe said on monday .
" there was no testimony that was based on any proof , " he added .
he said he stood by a 1993 japanese government apology , which acknowledged that the military set up and ran brothels for its troops during the war .
many former comfort women are still seeking compensation from the japanese government for their experiences .
tokyo did set up a compensation fund in 1995 , but it relies on private donations rather than government money .
the issue of the comfort women could harm a recent rapprochement between japan and its asian neighbours , china and south korea .
relations have been tense in recent years , in part because of disagreements over japan 's wartime past , but since taking office late last year mr abe has sought to improve ties .

but some japanese scholars deny that force was used to round up the women , blaming private contractors for any abuses .
last thursday mr abe sided with these critics , saying there was " no evidence to prove there was coercion " .
south korean foreign minister song min-soon retaliated , saying mr abe 's remarks were " not helpful " and the truth must be faced .
on monday , mr abe again commented on the issue , saying while there was no evidence of coercion in the strict sense , there may be some evidence of independent brokers procuring women by force .
but " it was not as though military police broke into peoples ' homes and took them away like kidnappers , " he said .
us hearings the us house of representatives is currently considering a non-binding resolution calling on tokyo to " formally acknowledge , apologise and accept historical responsibility " for these so-called comfort women .
there were an estimated 200,000 comfort women the draft text was debated last week , and three former comfort women gave evidence , describing the rape and torture they endured at the hands of the japanese soldiers .
" i have to say that even if the resolution passes , that does n't mean we will apologise , " mr abe said on monday .
" there was no testimony that was based on any proof , " he added .
he said he stood by a 1993 japanese government apology , which acknowledged that the military set up and ran brothels for its troops during the war .
many former comfort women are still seeking compensation from the japanese government for their experiences .
tokyo did set up a compensation fund in 1995 , but it relies on private donations rather than government money .
the issue of the comfort women could harm a recent rapprochement between japan and its asian neighbours , china and south korea .
relations have been tense in recent years , in part because of disagreements over japan 's wartime past , but since taking office late last year mr abe has sought to improve ties .

dr sharon blackford from singleton hospital in swansea , said she was treating people in their 30s for skin cancers more commonly found in the old .
the popularity of unregulated tanning salons , many of which are unstaffed , are being linked with the rise .
but a leading sun bed chain denied that under-age customers were using their coin operated salons .
dr blackford said she was seeing more people with the non melanoma types of skin cancer which used to be predominantly a problem in elderly people .
" we 're seeing people in their 30s which is definitely a bad sign , " she says on eye on wales , radio wales ' current affairs programme , broadcast on monday .
we have not found evidence of under age customers using consol studios and if we for a minute thought that was the case we would be sharing sian james ' concern sam kirby , consol suncenter " when you 've got skin cancer at that age then you are going to go on getting more and more of them unfortunately .
" i know certainly in swansea of teenagers as young as 13 and 14 year going on sun beds , now i think that is disgraceful . "
labour mp for swansea east , sian james , has put forward a commons early day motion calling for regulation of the unmanned section of the industry .
" i was shocked when i realised young people were accessing for very little money , coin operated salons and the nub of the problem is that there is no staff there , " she said .
consol suncenter , a european tanning chain with around 80 coin- operated salons in the uk , has refuted the claim that teenagers use their salons .
" having operated here for the last 10 years we have not found evidence of under age customers using consol studios and if we for a minute thought that was the case we would be sharing sian james ' concern , but we 'd like the evidence , " said spokesperson sam kirby .
closed down the uk 's sunbed association represents 20 % of the industry and believe that coin-operated salons should be closed down .
the association has no legal powers to enforce an under-16s rule amongst its members , who are currently self-regulating .
" they -lrb- consol suncenter -rrb- are not allowed membership of the sunbed association because they could not meet the requirements for the code of practice , one of which is that the sun bed 's have to be used under the supervision of appropriately trained staff , " said the association 's chief executive kathy banks .
the british medical association and cancer research uk called for a ban on under-16s using tanning salons in 2004 .
sunbed use is a very real and true risk and that 's what people need to understand actor andrew newton lee andrew newton lee , who starred in the teen soap hollyoaks , was a frequent sun bed user until he developed skin cancer .

mr wen said china would do more to cut pollution levels , and increase spending on health and education .
he also pledged to reduce the wealth gap between urban and rural areas .
mr wen 's speech goes to the heart of the government 's pledge to focus more on sustainable development than rapid economic growth at any cost .
but the bbc 's daniel griffiths in beijing says that china 's politicians have made similar promises in the past , without much success .
parliamentary agenda draft laws on tax and property new motions aimed at tackling government corruption school fee exemptions for some areas macro-economic controls how china is governed despite increasing international concern at the country 's expanding military , mr wen also used his speech to confirm that china would continue to strengthen its armed forces .
the chinese government announced over the weekend that the nation 's military budget would rise by 17.8 % in 2007 .
a greener china ?
the national people 's congress -lrb- npc -rrb- is a largely symbolic organisation which meets in full only once a year .
it mainly serves as a rubber stamp to endorse the policies of the ruling communist party .
in his two-hour opening address to nearly 3,000 delegates in the great hall of the people , mr wen delivered a report focused mainly on the government 's plans to fine-tune china 's economy .
he projected that gdp would grow by about 8 % in 2007 - slightly down from the double-digit growth of recent years .
the need to shun growth for growth 's sake and to make the nation 's economy greener was a recurring theme .
we must safeguard social fairness and justice , and ensure that all of the people share in the fruits of reform and development prime minister wen jiabao npc delegates gather " we should ... avoid seeking only faster growth and competing for faster growth , " mr wen said .
he also called for a greater effort to protect the environment , after china missed its targets to improve energy efficiency and pollution levels last year .
" the pattern of economic growth is inefficient .
this can be seen most clearly in excessive energy consumption and serious environmental pollution .
" we must attach greater importance to saving energy and resources , protecting the environment and using land intensively , " he said .
private property rights he also acknowledged that ordinary people , especially in poorer rural areas , were being sacrificed in the rush for riches .
" we must ... safeguard social fairness and justice , and ensure that all of the people share in the fruits of reform and development . "
mr wen said a law ending preferential tax rates for foreign companies would also be passed .
foreign companies have up until now paid an income tax rate of 15 % , compared with 33 % for local businesses .
under the new legislation , a tax rate of 25 % will apply to all companies .
another law expected to be passed , but not mentioned in mr wen 's speech , would give unprecedented protection for private property rights - an important step in the communist party 's transition to a market economy .
despite the fact that no actual policies are decided at the 12-day npc meeting , analysts say it does offer a rare chance to hear about the issues at the top of the government 's agenda .
this year 's meeting will also be followed closely because it comes before a major communist party gathering later in the year , when president hu jintao is expected to carry out a reshuffle to further strengthen his position .

he projected that gdp would grow by about 8 % in 2007 - slightly down from the double-digit growth of recent years .
the need to shun growth for growth 's sake and to make the nation 's economy greener was a recurring theme .
we must safeguard social fairness and justice , and ensure that all of the people share in the fruits of reform and development prime minister wen jiabao npc delegates gather " we should ... avoid seeking only faster growth and competing for faster growth , " mr wen said .
he also called for a greater effort to protect the environment , after china missed its targets to improve energy efficiency and pollution levels last year .
" the pattern of economic growth is inefficient .
this can be seen most clearly in excessive energy consumption and serious environmental pollution .
" we must attach greater importance to saving energy and resources , protecting the environment and using land intensively , " he said .
private property rights he also acknowledged that ordinary people , especially in poorer rural areas , were being sacrificed in the rush for riches .
" we must ... safeguard social fairness and justice , and ensure that all of the people share in the fruits of reform and development . "
mr wen said a law ending preferential tax rates for foreign companies would also be passed .
foreign companies have up until now paid an income tax rate of 15 % , compared with 33 % for local businesses .
under the new legislation , a tax rate of 25 % will apply to all companies .
another law expected to be passed , but not mentioned in mr wen 's speech , would give unprecedented protection for private property rights - an important step in the communist party 's transition to a market economy .
despite the fact that no actual policies are decided at the 12-day npc meeting , analysts say it does offer a rare chance to hear about the issues at the top of the government 's agenda .
this year 's meeting will also be followed closely because it comes before a major communist party gathering later in the year , when president hu jintao is expected to carry out a reshuffle to further strengthen his position .

jamil moledina , director of the game developers ' conference , said the walls between gaming areas were coming down .
" the dissolving of boundaries between silos is one of the key themes of this year , " he said .
more than 12,000 developers and designers are expected at the event in san francisco , in the us .
" overall the game industry is growing and we are seeing that the previously discreet silos of mainstream games , indie , casual and mobile games are starting to dissolve .
independent games " the obvious example of independent games is xbox live arcade but there is a lot of migration going on between mainstream development and mobile development given the capabilities of modern handsets .
tomorrow 's world blog " the variety of the types of games being created by the industry is growing as well as the opportunities . "
there are more than 300 different developer-focused sessions at the conference , including parallel events such as the independent games festival and a focus on serious games .
the games developers choice awards will also be held during the conference , with gears of war , okami , oblivion , zelda : twilight princess and wii sports nominated for best game .
they two key note speakers this year are sony 's phil harrison , head of worldwide studios , and legendary developer shigeru miyamoto .
brand developers mr moledina said developers were becoming well-known enough to drive games sales based on their " brand " alone . "
there are so many emerging , creative voices " jamil moledina " i am really glad to see it happen .
the sheer volume of celebrity developers is increasing too .
" previously we had a handful - miyamoto , cliffy b , peter molyneux , warren spector - folks like that .
" but now you are seeing people like tim schafer , andy schatz , jenova chen and others .
collegiate atmosphere " there are so many emerging creative voices .
and our awards are the only ones that recognise the developer , artist , writer , or audio engineer by name .
" we want them up on stage , being recognised . "
mr moledina said the conference was designed to have a collegiate atmosphere .
" it 's a forum for developers to come together , learn from one another , share ideas , inspire each other and network with each other .

jamil moledina , director of the game developers ' conference , said the walls between gaming areas were coming down .
" the dissolving of boundaries between silos is one of the key themes of this year , " he said .
more than 12,000 developers and designers are expected at the event in san francisco , in the us .
" overall the game industry is growing and we are seeing that the previously discreet silos of mainstream games , indie , casual and mobile games are starting to dissolve .
independent games " the obvious example of independent games is xbox live arcade but there is a lot of migration going on between mainstream development and mobile development given the capabilities of modern handsets .
tomorrow 's world blog follow our coverage of the conference in the blog a tour of the games " the variety of the types of games being created by the industry is growing as well as the opportunities . "
there are more than 300 different developer-focused sessions at the conference , including parallel events such as the independent games festival and a focus on serious games .
the games developers choice awards will also be held during the conference , with gears of war , okami , oblivion , zelda : twilight princess and wii sports nominated for best game .
they two key note speakers this year are sony 's phil harrison , head of worldwide studios , and legendary developer shigeru miyamoto .
brand developers mr moledina said developers were becoming well-known enough to drive games sales based on their " brand " alone .
there are so many emerging , creative voices jamil moledina " i am really glad to see it happen .
the sheer volume of celebrity developers is increasing too .
" previously we had a handful - miyamoto , cliffy b , peter molyneux , warren spector - folks like that .
" but now you are seeing people like tim schafer , andy schatz , jenova chen and others .
collegiate atmosphere " there are so many emerging creative voices .
and our awards are the only ones that recognise the developer , artist , writer , or audio engineer by name .
" we want them up on stage , being recognised . "
mr moledina said the conference was designed to have a collegiate atmosphere .
" it 's a forum for developers to come together , learn from one another , share ideas , inspire each other and network with each other .
shigeru miyamoto -lrb- r -rrb- is one of the most well-known developers " developers work in relative isolation they work within their companies .
" there are within walls , with ndas -lrb- non-disclosure agreements -rrb- wrapping them up .
" since games are an artform it 's important for the community to have a place where they can share ideas and have a collegiate atmosphere where you do have a 1960s free will attitude that pervades the show . "
one of the difficulties in organising the conference , he said , was dealing with ndas .
" there 's a lot of handholding that goes into situation that are under ndas .
" two years ago will wright debuted spore and that was heavily nda 'd up - we could n't advertise that in any way .
" the session description was deliberately bland .
we now have seven or eight sessions of reveals happening with funny vague descriptions this year . "
mr moledina said it was key that the conference did not make the same mistakes suffered by e3 , in los angeles , which has now been replaced by a smaller event .
the electronic entertainment expo grew into such a large event that few developers , publishers or journalists felt it warranted the effort of attending .
' cautionary tale ' " with the shrinking of e3 , the gdc is now the largest game industry event in the world with over 12,500 attendees last year .
games such as guitar hero are attracting new audiences " we will always focus on the conference ; we see that what happened at e3 as something of a cautionary tale .
" we are not going to change what gdc is . "
mr moledina said the second key trend of this year was the impact of the online world of gaming .
" we have all been hearing how broadband will change this industry .
but broadband adoption has been slow .
" there will be a couple of sessions that actually describe real implementations of how broadband is going to change things for games . "

it catapulted a select band of scientists into a world of celebrity never seen before or since ; and like its rock concert counterpart , the academic happening held the promise of changing the world .
the previous year , two of my ibm colleagues , georg bednorz and alex mueller , discovered a material which exhibited perfect conductivity at relatively warm temperatures .
although known about since 1911 , superconductivity had only ever been shown to work at temperatures close to absolute zero -lrb- 0 kelvin , -273c -rrb- , the theoretical state of zero heat energy .
raising the temperature of the effect , it was thought , would open up a world of wondrous applications , such as near-supersonic surface transportation , super-fast supercomputers , ultra-efficient electricity transmission and even exotic star wars weaponry .
the american physical society -lrb- aps -rrb- meeting of 1987 would see rose-tinted optimism about these developments replaced by a feeling that we were the generation that would make it happen .

it catapulted a select band of scientists into a world of celebrity never seen before or since ; and like its rock concert counterpart , the academic happening held the promise of changing the world .
the previous year , two of my ibm colleagues , georg bednorz and alex mueller , discovered a material which exhibited perfect conductivity at relatively warm temperatures .
although known about since 1911 , superconductivity had only ever been shown to work at temperatures close to absolute zero -lrb- 0 kelvin , -273c -rrb- , the theoretical state of zero heat energy .
raising the temperature of the effect , it was thought , would open up a world of wondrous applications , such as near-supersonic surface transportation , super-fast supercomputers , ultra-efficient electricity transmission and even exotic star wars weaponry .
the american physical society -lrb- aps -rrb- meeting of 1987 would see rose-tinted optimism about these developments replaced by a feeling that we were the generation that would make it happen .
cold rumours although bednorz and mueller 's discovery of a new family of ceramic superconductors , known as the copper oxide perovskites , had been made in 1986 , it had been largely overlooked .
but when further experiments by paul chu and his team at the universities of houston and alabama demonstrated superconductivity at 93k -lrb- -170c -rrb- , ripples spread throughout the physics community .
when i arrived with alex mueller the doors had already opened and pandemonium reigned inside .
paul grant superconductor 's " new age " their demonstration , 51 degrees higher than bednorz and mueller 's , broke through a critical barrier on the path to usable high temperature superconductors -lrb- htsc -rrb- - namely , the temperature of liquid nitrogen .
this fluid is a major industrial commodity , easy to handle , plentiful , non-polluting , and - importantly - cheap .
achieving superconductivity above liquid nitrogen temperatures was the holy grail of the field , and paul chu showed it could be grasped .
ever since rumours of a higher-than-liquid-nitrogen superconductor began to circulate , the intrigue and secrecy within the scientific community had rivalled that surrounding the double helix discovery three decades earlier .
researchers from around the world started trying to reproduce the results and work out the exact composition of chu 's material .
you 'll find only one " official " abstract on htsc in the programme of the 1987 aps general meeting .
but the flurry of research and the number of new results convinced the normally staid and conservative aps bureaucracy to allow the convening of a special session granting all who applied five minutes to deliver their most recent results .
marathon session the hall that had been assigned held maybe 1,000 people , but when i arrived with alex mueller the doors had already opened and pandemonium reigned inside .
there were perhaps 1,800 in the lecture hall and up to 2,000 outside , including some 50 journalists .
new york city fire marshals had been called in to clear the aisles .
alex mueller -lrb- left -rrb- and georg bednorz -lrb- right -rrb- in 1987 had i not tipped off the organisers to reserve spaces for the 51 speakers , alex and i would have been locked out .
in the end , the hotel had to arrange for tv monitors to be stationed throughout public areas of the hotel for those unable to get in .
what followed was a mammoth romp through the world of superconductivity , headlined by star attractions alex mueller and paul chu .
results were presented , challenged , questioned and occasionally hotly disputed .
at times the talk was deeply theoretical , but at others people speculated on the applications that could be just around the corner .
and the showmanship continued well into the night , eventually fizzling out around 3am when even the faithful began to tire .

and the euphoria persisted for many months .
scientific journals were flooded with manuscripts swamping the efforts of editors and reviewers to keep up .
ronald reagan even took time out to address us at the white house , and gave a surprisingly astute summary of superconductivity and its possible commercial implications .
as it turned out , he had been briefed by edward teller only 30 minutes before , and , of course , he was a professional actor .
congress subsequently stumped up for what grew to be a $ 40m annual programme to develop power applications based on the bednorz-mueller and chu discoveries , a programme which continues to this day .
in february 1988 , my group found a copper oxide variant that lost its resistance at 125k -lrb- -148c -rrb- , and in 1993 that record gave way to a slightly different compound created by a russian-swiss collaboration which worked at 134k -lrb- -139c -rrb- .
twenty years after woodstock , that 's where the record still stands .
physics reunion the two intervening decades have witnessed a remarkable and steady stream of advances in the science and application of high temperature superconductors .
the talks continued into the night hundreds of millions of dollars have been poured into trying to understand , examine and exploit the promise of woodstock .
in the united states alone , four companies have been created to develop and commercialise htsc wires and tapes for electric power and mobile phone applications .
the us department of energy has underwritten more than a dozen demonstration projects using superconducting magnets , cables and wires , all directed towards more efficient and compact generation and use of electricity .

there are still hurdles to be overcome , including understanding the mechanism of high temperature superconductivity in bednorz and mueller 's ceramics , which despite years of experiment still eludes us .

levitating high-speed trains , super-efficient power generators and ultra-powerful supercomputers would become commonplace thanks to a new breed of materials known as high temperature superconductors -lrb- htsc -rrb- .
" the breakthroughs in superconductivity bring us to the threshold of a new age , " said the president .
" it 's our task to herald in that new age with a rush . "
but 20 years on , the new world does not seem to have arrived .
so what happened ?
early promise superconductivity was first discovered in 1911 by researchers at the university of leiden who used solid mercury in their experiments .
superconductors have no electrical resistance , so unlike conventional conductors they allow an electric current to flow through without any loss .
drs mueller and bednorz were awarded the nobel prize in 1987 the ' woodstock of physics ' at the start , the phenomenon was only seen in materials cooled close to absolute zero , which according to theory is the state of zero heat energy .
three-quarters of a century later , the highest temperature achieved for the onset of superconductivity , the so-called transition temperature , was a frigid 23 kelvin -lrb- -250c -rrb- .
this allowed scientists to exploit the phenomenon in specialist applications such as magnetic resonance imaging -lrb- mri -rrb- scanners and high energy physics particle colliders , cooled by liquid helium .
but more day-to-day applications , such as replacing the electricity grid with superconducting wires , remained impossible without materials able to operate at higher temperatures .
closer to zero the breakthrough came in 1986 .
two ibm researchers , georg bednorz and alex mueller , discovered a new family of ceramic superconductors , known as the copper oxide perovskites , that operated at 35k -lrb- -238c -rrb- the work was rapidly followed up paul chu , of the university of houston , who discovered materials operating at 93k -lrb- -182c -rrb- the material was not as simple as we originally thought paul chu the discovery meant that superconductors had entered the temperature range of liquid nitrogen -lrb- 77k , -196c -rrb- , an abundant and well understood coolant .
" all of a sudden everything was different , " said professor chu .
" there was a euphoric feeling .
people in the field thought nothing was impossible . "
the discovery prompted a huge gathering of physicists in new york to discuss the breakthrough , a meeting later called the " woodstock of physics " .
precise structure but large-scale commercialisation of the technology would prove more difficult .
" the material was not as simple as we originally thought , " said professor chu .
one of the first commercial uses of superconductors was mri scanners despite an intensive two-decade search , the underlying mechanism of superconductivity in the ceramics is still disputed .
in addition , their exact structure , requiring ultra-thin layers of different elements stacked on top of each other , means they are very difficult and expensive to manufacture .
" atomically , you have to line them up very precisely in order for the supercurrent to flow , " explained professor chu .
this , coupled with the fact that ceramics are brittle and difficult to turn into flexible wires and films , meant that prospects for immediate exploitation were not good .
" i think the expectations were a little unrealistic , " said dr dennis newns of ibm .
" the typical time it takes from inventing a new concept to application is 20 years , " he said .
" and that is exactly what we have seen . "
cool running companies in japan , europe , china , south korea and the us are forging ahead with applications .
in the us , american superconductor has developed a way to " bend the unbendable " , creating htsc wires that can carry 150 times more electricity than the equivalent copper cables .
" twenty years ago you would see people making ceramic fibres and trying to bend them and it was like a dry stick of spaghetti , " said greg yurek , ceo and founder of the company .
hts wire is much more compact than its copper equivalent to get around this brittleness , the company embeds up to 85 tiny filaments of superconducting ceramic in a ribbon of metal 4.4mm -lrb- 0.17 inches -rrb- wide .
" think of optical fibres , " said dr yurek .
" if you have a rod of glass and you whack it on your desk it will shatter .
" drop down to a fine optical fibre and it becomes flexible - it 's the same principle here . "
the company also produces wires with a coating of the ceramic just one micron -lrb- millionth of a metre -rrb- thick on a metal alloy .
both are cooled by a sheath of liquid nitrogen .
short sections of the wires have already been installed in columbus , ohio , and a further half-mile of cable will soon be laid on long island , new york .
in the short term , longer stretches of the supercooled cable will be difficult to install , as it requires an infrastructure to pump liquid nitrogen around the grid .
but dr yurek believes that it will not be long before other firms start to offer utility companies these cryogenic services .
" this is the model they have used in the mri industry to guarantee the cold , " he said .
shrinking motors the company also promotes its htsc wires for other advanced applications .
central japan railways uses coils of it for their superconducting experimental magnetic levitation -lrb- maglev -rrb- train .
japan 's maglev set the world speed record for the technology american superconductor has also developed an electric motor using coils of superconducting wire for use in the next generation of us navy destroyers .
electric motors are used by most commercial cruise liners , but are typically very bulky .
using htsc technology dramatically shrinks their size and also increases their efficiency .
the company is just about to start testing its latest 36.5-megawatt engine that is cooled by off-the-shelf liquid helium refrigerators and weighs 75 tonnes .
by comparison , an engine based on copper wires would weigh 300 tonnes .
" that 's great for cruise ships and the navy , because they can use that space for other things like passenger cabins or munitions , " said dr yurek .
" new age " experimentally , things have also moved on .
new superconductors have been found .
for example , a new mercury-based compound has a transition temperature of 134k -lrb- -139c -rrb- " when we applied pressure we raised it up to 164k -lrb- -109c -rrb- - that 's a record , " said professor chu .
" of course from an application point of view , it 's hopeless . "
i think we 're on a launching pad here and we 're now ready to take off greg yurek however , other experimental work raises the possibility of discovering room temperature superconductors that would require no exotic cooling equipment .
a new theory , outlined in a paper in the journal nature physics by dr newns and his ibm colleague dr chang tsuei , seeks to explain the elusive mechanism of superconductivity in the class of ceramics discovered in 1986 .
" we do n't see any fundamental limits , " said dr tsuei .
" if someone discovered a room-temperature superconductor tomorrow that fits with what is outlined by our theory , we would n't be surprised at all , " added dr newns .
this kind of optimism , seen for the first time in the mid-1980s , now seems to be deserved .
there has been a crescendo of research , while at the same time the first commercial htsc products are rolling out of factories .
according to dr yurek , this is a sign that the new age promised by ronald reagan is finally here .
" i think we 're on a launching pad here and we 're now ready to take off , " he said .

short sections of the wires have already been installed in columbus , ohio , and a further half-mile of cable will soon be laid on long island , new york .
in the short term , longer stretches of the supercooled cable will be difficult to install , as it requires an infrastructure to pump liquid nitrogen around the grid .

a new theory , outlined in a paper in the journal nature physics by dr newns and his ibm colleague dr chang tsuei , seeks to explain the elusive mechanism of superconductivity in the class of ceramics discovered in 1986 .

levitating high-speed trains , super-efficient power generators and ultra-powerful supercomputers would become commonplace thanks to a new breed of materials known as high temperature superconductors -lrb- htsc -rrb- .
" the breakthroughs in superconductivity bring us to the threshold of a new age , " said the president .
" it 's our task to herald in that new age with a rush . "
but 20 years on , the new world does not seem to have arrived .
so what happened ?
early promise superconductivity was first discovered in 1911 by researchers at the university of leiden who used solid mercury in their experiments .
superconductors have no electrical resistance , so unlike conventional conductors they allow an electric current to flow through without any loss .
drs mueller and bednorz were awarded the nobel prize in 1987 the ' woodstock of physics ' at the start , the phenomenon was only seen in materials cooled close to absolute zero , which according to theory is the state of zero heat energy .
three-quarters of a century later , the highest temperature achieved for the onset of superconductivity , the so-called transition temperature , was a frigid 23 kelvin -lrb- -250c -rrb- .
this allowed scientists to exploit the phenomenon in specialist applications such as magnetic resonance imaging -lrb- mri -rrb- scanners and high energy physics particle colliders , cooled by liquid helium .
but more day-to-day applications , such as replacing the electricity grid with superconducting wires , remained impossible without materials able to operate at higher temperatures .
closer to zero the breakthrough came in 1986 .
two ibm researchers , georg bednorz and alex mueller , discovered a new family of ceramic superconductors , known as the copper oxide perovskites , that operated at 35k -lrb- -238c -rrb- the work was rapidly followed up paul chu , of the university of houston , who discovered materials operating at 93k -lrb- -182c -rrb- the material was not as simple as we originally thought paul chu the discovery meant that superconductors had entered the temperature range of liquid nitrogen -lrb- 77k , -196c -rrb- , an abundant and well understood coolant .
" all of a sudden everything was different , " said professor chu .
" there was a euphoric feeling .
people in the field thought nothing was impossible . "
the discovery prompted a huge gathering of physicists in new york to discuss the breakthrough , a meeting later called the " woodstock of physics " .
precise structure but large-scale commercialisation of the technology would prove more difficult .
" the material was not as simple as we originally thought , " said professor chu .
one of the first commercial uses of superconductors was mri scanners despite an intensive two-decade search , the underlying mechanism of superconductivity in the ceramics is still disputed .
in addition , their exact structure , requiring ultra-thin layers of different elements stacked on top of each other , means they are very difficult and expensive to manufacture .
" atomically , you have to line them up very precisely in order for the supercurrent to flow , " explained professor chu .
this , coupled with the fact that ceramics are brittle and difficult to turn into flexible wires and films , meant that prospects for immediate exploitation were not good .
" i think the expectations were a little unrealistic , " said dr dennis newns of ibm .
" the typical time it takes from inventing a new concept to application is 20 years , " he said .
" and that is exactly what we have seen . "
cool running companies in japan , europe , china , south korea and the us are forging ahead with applications .
in the us , american superconductor has developed a way to " bend the unbendable " , creating htsc wires that can carry 150 times more electricity than the equivalent copper cables .
" twenty years ago you would see people making ceramic fibres and trying to bend them and it was like a dry stick of spaghetti , " said greg yurek , ceo and founder of the company .
hts wire is much more compact than its copper equivalent to get around this brittleness , the company embeds up to 85 tiny filaments of superconducting ceramic in a ribbon of metal 4.4mm -lrb- 0.17 inches -rrb- wide .
" think of optical fibres , " said dr yurek .
" if you have a rod of glass and you whack it on your desk it will shatter .
" drop down to a fine optical fibre and it becomes flexible - it 's the same principle here . "
the company also produces wires with a coating of the ceramic just one micron -lrb- millionth of a metre -rrb- thick on a metal alloy .

levitating high-speed trains , super-efficient power generators and ultra-powerful supercomputers would become commonplace thanks to a new breed of materials known as high temperature superconductors -lrb- htsc -rrb- .
" the breakthroughs in superconductivity bring us to the threshold of a new age , " said the president .
" it 's our task to herald in that new age with a rush . "
but 20 years on , the new world does not seem to have arrived .
so what happened ?
early promise superconductivity was first discovered in 1911 by researchers at the university of leiden who used solid mercury in their experiments .
superconductors have no electrical resistance , so unlike conventional conductors they allow an electric current to flow through without any loss .
drs mueller and bednorz were awarded the nobel prize in 1987 the ' woodstock of physics ' at the start , the phenomenon was only seen in materials cooled close to absolute zero , which according to theory is the state of zero heat energy .
three-quarters of a century later , the highest temperature achieved for the onset of superconductivity , the so-called transition temperature , was a frigid 23 kelvin -lrb- -250c -rrb- .
this allowed scientists to exploit the phenomenon in specialist applications such as magnetic resonance imaging -lrb- mri -rrb- scanners and high energy physics particle colliders , cooled by liquid helium .
but more day-to-day applications , such as replacing the electricity grid with superconducting wires , remained impossible without materials able to operate at higher temperatures .
closer to zero the breakthrough came in 1986 .
two ibm researchers , georg bednorz and alex mueller , discovered a new family of ceramic superconductors , known as the copper oxide perovskites , that operated at 35k -lrb- -238c -rrb- the work was rapidly followed up paul chu , of the university of houston , who discovered materials operating at 93k -lrb- -182c -rrb- the material was not as simple as we originally thought paul chu the discovery meant that superconductors had entered the temperature range of liquid nitrogen -lrb- 77k , -196c -rrb- , an abundant and well understood coolant .
" all of a sudden everything was different , " said professor chu .
" there was a euphoric feeling .
people in the field thought nothing was impossible . "
the discovery prompted a huge gathering of physicists in new york to discuss the breakthrough , a meeting later called the " woodstock of physics " .
precise structure but large-scale commercialisation of the technology would prove more difficult .
" the material was not as simple as we originally thought , " said professor chu .
one of the first commercial uses of superconductors was mri scanners despite an intensive two-decade search , the underlying mechanism of superconductivity in the ceramics is still disputed .
in addition , their exact structure , requiring ultra-thin layers of different elements stacked on top of each other , means they are very difficult and expensive to manufacture .
" atomically , you have to line them up very precisely in order for the supercurrent to flow , " explained professor chu .
this , coupled with the fact that ceramics are brittle and difficult to turn into flexible wires and films , meant that prospects for immediate exploitation were not good .
" i think the expectations were a little unrealistic , " said dr dennis newns of ibm .
" the typical time it takes from inventing a new concept to application is 20 years , " he said .
" and that is exactly what we have seen . "
cool running companies in japan , europe , china , south korea and the us are forging ahead with applications .
in the us , american superconductor has developed a way to " bend the unbendable " , creating htsc wires that can carry 150 times more electricity than the equivalent copper cables .
" twenty years ago you would see people making ceramic fibres and trying to bend them and it was like a dry stick of spaghetti , " said greg yurek , ceo and founder of the company .
hts wire is much more compact than its copper equivalent to get around this brittleness , the company embeds up to 85 tiny filaments of superconducting ceramic in a ribbon of metal 4.4mm -lrb- 0.17 inches -rrb- wide .
" think of optical fibres , " said dr yurek .
" if you have a rod of glass and you whack it on your desk it will shatter .
" drop down to a fine optical fibre and it becomes flexible - it 's the same principle here . "
the company also produces wires with a coating of the ceramic just one micron -lrb- millionth of a metre -rrb- thick on a metal alloy .
both are cooled by a sheath of liquid nitrogen .
short sections of the wires have already been installed in columbus , ohio , and a further half-mile of cable will soon be laid on long island , new york .
in the short term , longer stretches of the supercooled cable will be difficult to install , as it requires an infrastructure to pump liquid nitrogen around the grid .
but dr yurek believes that it will not be long before other firms start to offer utility companies these cryogenic services .
" this is the model they have used in the mri industry to guarantee the cold , " he said .
shrinking motors the company also promotes its htsc wires for other advanced applications .
central japan railways uses coils of it for their superconducting experimental magnetic levitation -lrb- maglev -rrb- train .
japan 's maglev set the world speed record for the technology american superconductor has also developed an electric motor using coils of superconducting wire for use in the next generation of us navy destroyers .
electric motors are used by most commercial cruise liners , but are typically very bulky .
using htsc technology dramatically shrinks their size and also increases their efficiency .
the company is just about to start testing its latest 36.5-megawatt engine that is cooled by off-the-shelf liquid helium refrigerators and weighs 75 tonnes .
by comparison , an engine based on copper wires would weigh 300 tonnes .
" that 's great for cruise ships and the navy , because they can use that space for other things like passenger cabins or munitions , " said dr yurek .
" new age " experimentally , things have also moved on .
new superconductors have been found .
for example , a new mercury-based compound has a transition temperature of 134k -lrb- -139c -rrb- " when we applied pressure we raised it up to 164k -lrb- -109c -rrb- - that 's a record , " said professor chu .
" of course from an application point of view , it 's hopeless . "
i think we 're on a launching pad here and we 're now ready to take off greg yurek however , other experimental work raises the possibility of discovering room temperature superconductors that would require no exotic cooling equipment .
a new theory , outlined in a paper in the journal nature physics by dr newns and his ibm colleague dr chang tsuei , seeks to explain the elusive mechanism of superconductivity in the class of ceramics discovered in 1986 .
" we do n't see any fundamental limits , " said dr tsuei .
" if someone discovered a room-temperature superconductor tomorrow that fits with what is outlined by our theory , we would n't be surprised at all , " added dr newns .
this kind of optimism , seen for the first time in the mid-1980s , now seems to be deserved .
there has been a crescendo of research , while at the same time the first commercial htsc products are rolling out of factories .
according to dr yurek , this is a sign that the new age promised by ronald reagan is finally here .
" i think we 're on a launching pad here and we 're now ready to take off , " he said .
