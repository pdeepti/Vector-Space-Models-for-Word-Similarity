with daimlerchrysler in divorce court , can benz make a comeback ? what 's in a name ?
a lot , according to conventional wisdom among corporate ceos .
nearly a decade ago , the highly touted " marriage of equals " between german high-end carmaker daimler-benz and us standard-bearer chrysler nearly ran aground amid disagreement over which of the two partners would get top billing in the corporate identity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car inventor karl benz is not getting his propers , some say daimler won out -lrb- thus the company was called daimlerchrysler , not chryslerdaimler -rrb- .
but in doing so , it sacrificed benz , a part of its identity that goes back to the creation of the firm .
now , some folks are arguing that giving up its heritage - carl benz was the inventor of the first automobile , after all - was a mistake .
with the newly spun-off german arm of daimlerchrysler seeking a revamped corporate identity , a war of words has broken out in the state of baden-württemberg . people from the region of baden - where carl benz was born - are upset that those in stuttgart -lrb- in württemberg , and the town where daimler ag is headquartered -rrb- have gotten all the glory , and are keeping it .
town agitates to revive " benz " " in stuttgart … they should n't forget that it was n't gottlieb daimler , but carl benz who invented the automobile , " a worker at the daimlerchrysler factory in mannheim told dpa news service .
meanwhile , administrators in the town of mannheim -lrb- located in the baden region of baden-württemberg -rrb- are doing their best to encourage daimler ag leader dieter zetsche to reclaim the benz name , the associated press has reported .
" through the planned separation from chrysler , there is a chance to bring the old daimler-benz name back to life , " said a declaration from the local council of mannheim .
and daimler ag headquarters also reported a number of calls of people who wanted to get the benz name back , ap said .
concerns over corporate confusion marina raptis , a spokeswoman for daimler ag , told ap any name change would need to be addressed at an extraordinary general meeting in the autumn .
suggestions would need to be examined with several factors in mind , including property rights and legal and strategic issues , she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gottlieb daimler merged his firm with benz 's in 1926 she noted that the daimler name is well known and serves as an over-arching identity .
names like mercedes-benz ag or daimler-benz ag could mix corporate and product identities , which could harm the company 's position on the product market , raptis argued .
" our suggested and preferred name , daimler ag , attaches us to tradition , but shows a clear direction forward , " raptis said .
the suggested name is not meant to be a slight to benz , she said .
" the history and tradition of our company , as well as the brand mercedes benz will always be tied to carl benz . ...
without carl benz and gottlieb daimler , our company would not exist , " she said .
no one denies that benz 's invention hit the pavement before that of his competitor daimler .
that fact has left some people especially eager to see the name benz back in the company logo .
baden-based politician karl lamers argued that the name benz is the " starting point for today 's international auto concern . "
and the mayor of the city of karlsruhe , heinz fenrich , reminded daimler chief dieter zetsche that benz " got the world on wheels . "
mrs. benz 's famous ride the hybrid name daimler-benz itself came about as a result of an even earlier corporate history of merger and survival .
in 1883 , benz founded the " benz & co .

he patented a single-stroke , four-cylinder engine in january 1886 .
in july of that year , he hooked it to a three-wheel carriage and sent it on its inaugural drive .

fillon , a 53-year-old senator from the ruling ump party who worked closely with sarkozy on his election campaign , has crucial experience in pensions reform which will be a key asset to the new government .

sarkozy is to announce the rest of his 15-member cabinet lineup on friday . fillon 's predecessor , dominique de villepin , presented his resignation on tuesday to chirac ahead of the handover of power to sarkozy , who has pledged to carry out deep social and economic reform .
fillon made his mark as a reformer as social affairs minister under chirac , from 2002 to 2004 , when he carried out an overhaul of france 's pension system , facing down million-strong street protests . low-key meets high energy ironically , in a book in 2006 , fillon had argued for abolishing the post of premier , while advocating a strong presidential-style of rule .
and during the election campaign , sarkozy himself had said that the premier should only " coordinate the work of the government " and should not share power with the head of state .

fillon , a 53-year-old senator from the ruling ump party who worked closely with sarkozy on his election campaign , has crucial experience in pensions reform which will be a key asset to the new government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing french pm de villepin held the post since 2005 the appointment was announced in a presidential statement a day after sarkozy took over as head of state from jacques chirac .
sarkozy is to announce the rest of his 15-member cabinet lineup on friday . fillon 's predecessor , dominique de villepin , presented his resignation on tuesday to chirac ahead of the handover of power to sarkozy , who has pledged to carry out deep social and economic reform .

" the european union is a union of 27 member states and we take decisions based on solidarity .
i came here of course with this spirit of defending european interests in that sense of solidarity , " barroso said .
speaking to reporters after his arrival in samara , a regional centre , he said he would hold " a frank and open discussion " with putin at the summit but did not expect any breakthroughs .
" i am not expecting , honestly , anything spectacular from this meeting , " barroso said . merkel also called for dialogue with moscow , saying ahead of the talks : " russia and the european union are interdependent .
it 's always good to speak to each other rather than talking about each other . "
the summit 's main consultations were set for friday at the volzhsky utyos -lrb- volga cliff -rrb- resort complex , southeast of moscow , but the agenda was limited because of ongoing diplomatic and trade disputes .
" a difficult time " " this summit is taking place at a difficult time , " a german government official told reporters in berlin this week .
" but if we want a strategic partnership with russia it 's important that we talk even during difficult times . "
even if there is no narrowing of differences , both sides will get a better idea of each other 's positions , he said .
eu officials said talks would touch on international issues such as the future status of kosovo and iran 's nuclear programme , as well as russia 's bid to join the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- this year .
but negotiations on a key partnership agreement that governs eu-russia relations , including in the vitally important energy sphere , have been held up because of a trade row between eu member poland and russia .

poland has warned it will maintain a veto on talks unless moscow lifts a ban on meat imports from poland and eu members form a united front on the issue of energy security .
russia has accused poland of holding eu-russia relations " hostage . "
russia 's wto bid the row with poland and a bitter war of words with estonia over a soviet memorial in tallinn have highlighted still-tense relations between moscow and formerly soviet-dominated central europe .
after a recent blockade of the estonian embassy in moscow , and violent scenes at a news conference given by the estonian ambassador , the european commission has urged russia to observe un conventions on protection of diplomats .
russia has suggested it wants to deal only with more established eu states , sparking angry responses from eu officials , who have vowed unity in the face of pressure from russia .
eu leaders have also voiced concern about europe 's rapidly growing reliance on russian oil and gas imports at a time when russia is becoming an increasingly assertive energy power .
there are other items on the summit agenda that could spark controversy .
the european union has supported russia 's bid to join the world trade union as soon as possible but has said that it could withhold final approval until eu-russia trade tariff rows are resolved .
putin has set early wto accession as a key goal for his presidency .
a draft document seen by afp said eu leaders should " make clear that the eu is ready to support early conclusion of russia 's wto accession but not at any price . "
missile defense , democratic freedoms russia has also contributed to the tense mood of the summit with its ongoing row with the us over plans to station elements of a planned missile defense system in poland and the czech republic .
moscow has threatened to tear up a key arms limitation pact if washington goes ahead with those plans .
eu leaders also said they wanted to discuss democratic freedoms in russia , which have come under scrutiny amid a crackdown on opposition protests ahead of presidential elections next year .

" the european union is a union of 27 member states and we take decisions based on solidarity .
i came here of course with this spirit of defending european interests in that sense of solidarity , " barroso said .
speaking to reporters after his arrival in samara , a regional centre , he said he would hold " a frank and open discussion " with putin at the summit but did not expect any breakthroughs .
" i am not expecting , honestly , anything spectacular from this meeting , " barroso said . merkel also called for dialogue with moscow , saying ahead of the talks : " russia and the european union are interdependent .
it 's always good to speak to each other rather than talking about each other . "
the summit 's main consultations were set for friday at the volzhsky utyos -lrb- volga cliff -rrb- resort complex , southeast of moscow , but the agenda was limited because of ongoing diplomatic and trade disputes .
" a difficult time " " this summit is taking place at a difficult time , " a german government official told reporters in berlin this week .
" but if we want a strategic partnership with russia it 's important that we talk even during difficult times . "
even if there is no narrowing of differences , both sides will get a better idea of each other 's positions , he said .
eu officials said talks would touch on international issues such as the future status of kosovo and iran 's nuclear programme , as well as russia 's bid to join the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- this year .
but negotiations on a key partnership agreement that governs eu-russia relations , including in the vitally important energy sphere , have been held up because of a trade row between eu member poland and russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland and russia are locked in a row over polish meat imports " eu members understand us .
so , in a sense , there is a situation of crisis in relations between the eu and russia , " polish foreign minister anna fotyga said thursday in an interview with polish public television .
poland has warned it will maintain a veto on talks unless moscow lifts a ban on meat imports from poland and eu members form a united front on the issue of energy security .
russia has accused poland of holding eu-russia relations " hostage . "
russia 's wto bid the row with poland and a bitter war of words with estonia over a soviet memorial in tallinn have highlighted still-tense relations between moscow and formerly soviet-dominated central europe .
after a recent blockade of the estonian embassy in moscow , and violent scenes at a news conference given by the estonian ambassador , the european commission has urged russia to observe un conventions on protection of diplomats .
russia has suggested it wants to deal only with more established eu states , sparking angry responses from eu officials , who have vowed unity in the face of pressure from russia .
eu leaders have also voiced concern about europe 's rapidly growing reliance on russian oil and gas imports at a time when russia is becoming an increasingly assertive energy power .
there are other items on the summit agenda that could spark controversy .
the european union has supported russia 's bid to join the world trade union as soon as possible but has said that it could withhold final approval until eu-russia trade tariff rows are resolved .
putin has set early wto accession as a key goal for his presidency .
a draft document seen by afp said eu leaders should " make clear that the eu is ready to support early conclusion of russia 's wto accession but not at any price . "
missile defense , democratic freedoms russia has also contributed to the tense mood of the summit with its ongoing row with the us over plans to station elements of a planned missile defense system in poland and the czech republic .
moscow has threatened to tear up a key arms limitation pact if washington goes ahead with those plans .
eu leaders also said they wanted to discuss democratic freedoms in russia , which have come under scrutiny amid a crackdown on opposition protests ahead of presidential elections next year .

with daimlerchrysler in divorce court , can benz make a comeback ? what 's in a name ?
a lot , according to conventional wisdom among corporate ceos .
nearly a decade ago , the highly touted " marriage of equals " between german high-end carmaker daimler-benz and us standard-bearer chrysler nearly ran aground amid disagreement over which of the two partners would get top billing in the corporate identity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car inventor karl benz is not getting his propers , some say daimler won out -lrb- thus the company was called daimlerchrysler , not chryslerdaimler -rrb- .
but in doing so , it sacrificed benz , a part of its identity that goes back to the creation of the firm .
now , some folks are arguing that giving up its heritage - carl benz was the inventor of the first automobile , after all - was a mistake .
with the newly spun-off german arm of daimlerchrysler seeking a revamped corporate identity , a war of words has broken out in the state of baden-württemberg . people from the region of baden - where carl benz was born - are upset that those in stuttgart -lrb- in württemberg , and the town where daimler ag is headquartered -rrb- have gotten all the glory , and are keeping it .
town agitates to revive " benz " " in stuttgart … they should n't forget that it was n't gottlieb daimler , but carl benz who invented the automobile , " a worker at the daimlerchrysler factory in mannheim told dpa news service .
meanwhile , administrators in the town of mannheim -lrb- located in the baden region of baden-württemberg -rrb- are doing their best to encourage daimler ag leader dieter zetsche to reclaim the benz name , the associated press has reported .
" through the planned separation from chrysler , there is a chance to bring the old daimler-benz name back to life , " said a declaration from the local council of mannheim .
and daimler ag headquarters also reported a number of calls of people who wanted to get the benz name back , ap said .
concerns over corporate confusion marina raptis , a spokeswoman for daimler ag , told ap any name change would need to be addressed at an extraordinary general meeting in the autumn .
suggestions would need to be examined with several factors in mind , including property rights and legal and strategic issues , she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gottlieb daimler merged his firm with benz 's in 1926 she noted that the daimler name is well known and serves as an over-arching identity .
names like mercedes-benz ag or daimler-benz ag could mix corporate and product identities , which could harm the company 's position on the product market , raptis argued .
" our suggested and preferred name , daimler ag , attaches us to tradition , but shows a clear direction forward , " raptis said .
the suggested name is not meant to be a slight to benz , she said .
" the history and tradition of our company , as well as the brand mercedes benz will always be tied to carl benz . ...
without carl benz and gottlieb daimler , our company would not exist , " she said .
no one denies that benz 's invention hit the pavement before that of his competitor daimler .
that fact has left some people especially eager to see the name benz back in the company logo .
baden-based politician karl lamers argued that the name benz is the " starting point for today 's international auto concern . "
and the mayor of the city of karlsruhe , heinz fenrich , reminded daimler chief dieter zetsche that benz " got the world on wheels . "
mrs. benz 's famous ride the hybrid name daimler-benz itself came about as a result of an even earlier corporate history of merger and survival .
in 1883 , benz founded the " benz & co .
rhineland gas motor factory " in the town of mannheim .
he patented a single-stroke , four-cylinder engine in january 1886 .
in july of that year , he hooked it to a three-wheel carriage and sent it on its inaugural drive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes-benz is one of the best known brands in the auto industry in a groundbreaking publicity stunt , benz 's wife bertha rode the open-top " benz-patent motor car " to her hometown of pforzheim .
the ride - during which mrs. benz used a hatpin to unplug a clogged gas tube - has become legend .
but business for benz was not especially good , and in 1926 , when worldwide depression threatened the company , it joined up with the daimler motor co. in stuttgart .
at the time of that merger , it was agreed that benz would be in the company name . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : the end of daimler 's " world inc . "

the us and the eu should turn to the old-fashioned tools of diplomacy , argues thorsten benner . last friday , the un commission on sustainable development -lrb- csd -rrb- elected zimbabwe as its next chair .
much to their chagrin , eu countries , the us and canada were outvoted in their opposition against installing mugabe 's repressive regime as chair of this major -lrb- even though for the most part dysfunctional -rrb- un body .
the uk representative emphasized that for zimbabwe to chair the " commission , while -lsb- mugabe 's -rsb- own people suffer the appalling consequences of -lsb- zimbabwe 's -rsb- government policies , is wholly inconsistent with the commission 's aims .
it damages the credibility of the commission itself and its ability to deal with issues affecting the livelihoods of millions from the poorest countries . "
this thursday , belarus , egypt and angola seek membership of the un human rights council .
all three hardly live up to the criteria set out for membership in the new un human rights body : " contribution to the promotion and protection of human rights and -lsb- its -rsb- voluntary pledges and commitments made thereto . "
maintain the status quo ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thorsten benner what strategy should democracies choose with regard to the role of dictatorships in un bodies ?
" simply accept it as a fact of life " is the first option recommended by many , especially the members of the group of 77 -lrb- g77 -rrb- developing country bloc at the un .
sudan 's un ambassador abdalmahmood abdalhaleem , for example , argues that it is the " right of regional groups to choose whoever they want . "
he can refer to the un charter to support his point .
the charter states prominently that the un " is based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its members . "
democracy at the un means " one country , one vote . "
it is not for others to question how sovereign members exercise their right to vote .
case closed .
a second option is based on the exact opposite view .
it argues that the role of dictatorships undermines the credibility and effectiveness of the un so that it is necessary to create alternatives .
introduce a " democracies only " club ?
us senator and presidential candidate john mccain advocates " bringing democratic peoples and nations from around the world into one common organization , a worldwide league of democracies . -lrb- … -rrb- the new league of democracies would form the core of an international order of peace based on freedom .
it could act where the un fails to act , to relieve human suffering in places like darfur . "
both options - accepting the status quo and creating a new " democracies only " club outside the un - are short-sighted .
simply acquiescing to the prominent role of dictatorships in un bodies threatens to further undermine the standing of the united nations in key countries that account for the vast majority of contributions to the un budget , especially the us .
it also undermines the credibility of the un as a whole to stand up for the ideals enshrined in its charter .
forming a " league of democracies " outside the un throws the baby out with the bathwater .
a world organization of only democracies could not supplant the united nations .
this would amount to the same as restricting diplomacy to friendly and like-minded countries , while missing out on the very essence of the business of diplomacy .
old-fashioned tools we need an alternative strategy within the un to further human rights and democracy .
first of all , democracies need to use the old-fashioned tools of diplomacy to reverse the trend of the increasing prominence of dictatorships in un bodies .
the eu and the us in particular should use the powers of moral suasion as well as hard economic and political incentives to ease individual developing countries out of the block of irresponsible voters .
there is no inevitability for countries such as south africa or argentina to side with serial human rights abusers .
while engaging in diplomacy , the us , the eu and other democracies should be respectful in demeanour and firm on principles .
they should make it clear that they are not willing to tolerate serial abuses of the goals of the un on human rights .
the german foreign minister did exactly that earlier this year in his address to the un human rights council on behalf of the eu .
he argued that " it is not acceptable that very serious human rights violations are not addressed - or are not addressed with the necessary directness - because regional or ideological solidarity takes precedence over the willingness to see critical situations without bias . "
aiming for a " community of democracies " establishing a " democracy caucus " within the un would be another important element of a winning strategy .
a democracy caucus would offer a complement to regional and other blocs within the un for cooperation on resolutions and initiatives .
this democracy caucus could also contribute to moving away from the confrontation between the " west vs. the rest " that currently poisons the atmosphere at the un .
major members of the g-77 developing country bloc , such as india , would also be members of the democracy caucus .
this caucus could further a better understanding of what democracy is all about . when confronted with the opposition to his candidacy , the newly elected zimbabwean chair of the csd said that critics had the " right to their opinions . "
he added that " at the end of the day the majority rules as democracy does . "
once a vast majority of un members understands that this misses the very essence of liberal democracy we will have come a long way in living up to the ideals of the un .
as former un secretary-general kofi annan pointed out , " when the united nations can truly call itself a community of democracies , the charter 's noble ideals of protecting human rights and promoting ' social progress in larger freedoms ' will have been brought much closer . "

a statement by the police said el-masri was " under urgent suspicions of setting fire " at the entrance of a wholesale market after having destroyed the glass door .
a judge ordered that el-masri be held in the psychiatric ward of a local hospital pending investigations into the blaze , which caused damage worth 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 675,000 -rrb- . masri 's lawyer , manfred gnjidic , said thursday that his client 's act had been a gesture of despair after a dispute with the store concerned had got out of hand .

interpol issued warrants for 10 of the agents , accusing them of abduction and causing serious bodily harm .
masri 's lawyers say he was an innocent victim of the cia practice of the " extraordinary rendition " of terrorism suspects that has caused intense controversy in several european countries .
he had filed a suit in the united states against his detention but it was rejected by an appeals court on the grounds that events linked to the case were a state secret . court says spying was unlawful this week , germany 's highest court ruled that el-masri 's phone was tapped unlawfully by german authorities .
in jan , 2006 , a munich district court secretly approved a request by investigators that telephones , faxes and mobile phone calls to and from el-masri and his lawyer should be monitored in an effort to uncover the identity of his kidnappers .
the munich court justified its approval on the grounds that a phone tap would help authorities gather information on the identities of the 13 people suspected of kidnapping him .
" the likelihood that the complainant would be contacted by those responsible was so minimal from the start that the chances that the measures would be successful were disproportionate to the severity of the tapping , " the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier : cia arrest warrants wo n't hurt german-us ties warrants issued by a german court for 13 suspected cia operatives linked to the abduction of a german citizen will not harm relations , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier was quoted as saying on saturday .

" the european union is a union of 27 member states and we take decisions based on solidarity .
i came here of course with this spirit of defending european interests in that sense of solidarity , " barroso said .
speaking to reporters after his arrival in samara , a regional centre , he said he would hold " a frank and open discussion " with putin at the summit but did not expect any breakthroughs .
" i am not expecting , honestly , anything spectacular from this meeting , " barroso said . merkel also called for dialogue with moscow , saying ahead of the talks : " russia and the european union are interdependent .
it 's always good to speak to each other rather than talking about each other . "
the summit 's main consultations were set for friday at the volzhsky utyos -lrb- volga cliff -rrb- resort complex , southeast of moscow , but the agenda was limited because of ongoing diplomatic and trade disputes .
" a difficult time " " this summit is taking place at a difficult time , " a german government official told reporters in berlin this week .
" but if we want a strategic partnership with russia it 's important that we talk even during difficult times . "
even if there is no narrowing of differences , both sides will get a better idea of each other 's positions , he said .
eu officials said talks would touch on international issues such as the future status of kosovo and iran 's nuclear programme , as well as russia 's bid to join the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- this year .
but negotiations on a key partnership agreement that governs eu-russia relations , including in the vitally important energy sphere , have been held up because of a trade row between eu member poland and russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland and russia are locked in a row over polish meat imports " eu members understand us .
so , in a sense , there is a situation of crisis in relations between the eu and russia , " polish foreign minister anna fotyga said thursday in an interview with polish public television .

russia has accused poland of holding eu-russia relations " hostage . "
russia 's wto bid the row with poland and a bitter war of words with estonia over a soviet memorial in tallinn have highlighted still-tense relations between moscow and formerly soviet-dominated central europe .
after a recent blockade of the estonian embassy in moscow , and violent scenes at a news conference given by the estonian ambassador , the european commission has urged russia to observe un conventions on protection of diplomats .
russia has suggested it wants to deal only with more established eu states , sparking angry responses from eu officials , who have vowed unity in the face of pressure from russia .
eu leaders have also voiced concern about europe 's rapidly growing reliance on russian oil and gas imports at a time when russia is becoming an increasingly assertive energy power .
there are other items on the summit agenda that could spark controversy .
the european union has supported russia 's bid to join the world trade union as soon as possible but has said that it could withhold final approval until eu-russia trade tariff rows are resolved .
putin has set early wto accession as a key goal for his presidency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 17.05.2007 opinion : united nations of democracies and dictatorships ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the increasing role of non-democracies in key un bodies lead observers to wonder how the un can live up to its ideals .
the us and the eu should turn to the old-fashioned tools of diplomacy , argues thorsten benner . last friday , the un commission on sustainable development -lrb- csd -rrb- elected zimbabwe as its next chair .
much to their chagrin , eu countries , the us and canada were outvoted in their opposition against installing mugabe 's repressive regime as chair of this major -lrb- even though for the most part dysfunctional -rrb- un body .
the uk representative emphasized that for zimbabwe to chair the " commission , while -lsb- mugabe 's -rsb- own people suffer the appalling consequences of -lsb- zimbabwe 's -rsb- government policies , is wholly inconsistent with the commission 's aims .
it damages the credibility of the commission itself and its ability to deal with issues affecting the livelihoods of millions from the poorest countries . "
this thursday , belarus , egypt and angola seek membership of the un human rights council .
all three hardly live up to the criteria set out for membership in the new un human rights body : " contribution to the promotion and protection of human rights and -lsb- its -rsb- voluntary pledges and commitments made thereto . "
maintain the status quo ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thorsten benner what strategy should democracies choose with regard to the role of dictatorships in un bodies ?
" simply accept it as a fact of life " is the first option recommended by many , especially the members of the group of 77 -lrb- g77 -rrb- developing country bloc at the un .
sudan 's un ambassador abdalmahmood abdalhaleem , for example , argues that it is the " right of regional groups to choose whoever they want . "
he can refer to the un charter to support his point .
the charter states prominently that the un " is based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its members . "
democracy at the un means " one country , one vote . "
it is not for others to question how sovereign members exercise their right to vote .
case closed .
a second option is based on the exact opposite view .
it argues that the role of dictatorships undermines the credibility and effectiveness of the un so that it is necessary to create alternatives .
introduce a " democracies only " club ?
us senator and presidential candidate john mccain advocates " bringing democratic peoples and nations from around the world into one common organization , a worldwide league of democracies . -lrb- … -rrb- the new league of democracies would form the core of an international order of peace based on freedom .
it could act where the un fails to act , to relieve human suffering in places like darfur . "
both options - accepting the status quo and creating a new " democracies only " club outside the un - are short-sighted .
simply acquiescing to the prominent role of dictatorships in un bodies threatens to further undermine the standing of the united nations in key countries that account for the vast majority of contributions to the un budget , especially the us .
it also undermines the credibility of the un as a whole to stand up for the ideals enshrined in its charter .
forming a " league of democracies " outside the un throws the baby out with the bathwater .
a world organization of only democracies could not supplant the united nations .
this would amount to the same as restricting diplomacy to friendly and like-minded countries , while missing out on the very essence of the business of diplomacy .
old-fashioned tools we need an alternative strategy within the un to further human rights and democracy .
first of all , democracies need to use the old-fashioned tools of diplomacy to reverse the trend of the increasing prominence of dictatorships in un bodies .
the eu and the us in particular should use the powers of moral suasion as well as hard economic and political incentives to ease individual developing countries out of the block of irresponsible voters .
there is no inevitability for countries such as south africa or argentina to side with serial human rights abusers .
while engaging in diplomacy , the us , the eu and other democracies should be respectful in demeanour and firm on principles .
they should make it clear that they are not willing to tolerate serial abuses of the goals of the un on human rights .
the german foreign minister did exactly that earlier this year in his address to the un human rights council on behalf of the eu .
he argued that " it is not acceptable that very serious human rights violations are not addressed - or are not addressed with the necessary directness - because regional or ideological solidarity takes precedence over the willingness to see critical situations without bias . "
aiming for a " community of democracies " establishing a " democracy caucus " within the un would be another important element of a winning strategy .
a democracy caucus would offer a complement to regional and other blocs within the un for cooperation on resolutions and initiatives .
this democracy caucus could also contribute to moving away from the confrontation between the " west vs. the rest " that currently poisons the atmosphere at the un .
major members of the g-77 developing country bloc , such as india , would also be members of the democracy caucus .
this caucus could further a better understanding of what democracy is all about . when confronted with the opposition to his candidacy , the newly elected zimbabwean chair of the csd said that critics had the " right to their opinions . "
he added that " at the end of the day the majority rules as democracy does . "
once a vast majority of un members understands that this misses the very essence of liberal democracy we will have come a long way in living up to the ideals of the un .
as former un secretary-general kofi annan pointed out , " when the united nations can truly call itself a community of democracies , the charter 's noble ideals of protecting human rights and promoting ' social progress in larger freedoms ' will have been brought much closer . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing french pm de villepin held the post since 2005 the appointment was announced in a presidential statement a day after sarkozy took over as head of state from jacques chirac .
sarkozy is to announce the rest of his 15-member cabinet lineup on friday . fillon 's predecessor , dominique de villepin , presented his resignation on tuesday to chirac ahead of the handover of power to sarkozy , who has pledged to carry out deep social and economic reform .
fillon made his mark as a reformer as social affairs minister under chirac , from 2002 to 2004 , when he carried out an overhaul of france 's pension system , facing down million-strong street protests . low-key meets high energy ironically , in a book in 2006 , fillon had argued for abolishing the post of premier , while advocating a strong presidential-style of rule .
and during the election campaign , sarkozy himself had said that the premier should only " coordinate the work of the government " and should not share power with the head of state .
sarkozy 's jogging partner throughout the campaign , fillon has a low-key demeanor that is often described as complementary to sarkozy 's hyper-active style . speed was apparently of the essence on wednesday , when sarkozy - in a possibly record-breaking move - landed in berlin for his first official state visit , a mere six hours after he was sworn in to office . ' europe must lose its paralysis ' in berlin , the new french president met with german chancellor angela merkel , to show his support for strong franco-german relations and discuss the possibility of reviving the eu constitution .
french and dutch voters rejected the eu constitution in referendums two years ago .
germany currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : possibly breaking speed records , sarko was in berlin six hours after taking office " europe must be shaken from its paralysis as a matter of urgency , " sarkozy said at a joint press conference with merkel . over a working dinner , sarkozy presented his proposal for a mini-treaty comprising the bare essentials of the failed constitution , to allow the institutions of the 27-nation bloc to function fully . sarkozy stressed the importance of maintaining and strengthening the relationship between germany and france , whose partnership is often described as the driving force behind the eu . ' sacred ' friendship " i want to say to the german people that the friendship between france and germany is sacred and that nothing can call it into doubt , " he said . for her part , merkel thanked sarkozy for his speedy visit .
the gesture made it clear how much the two countries need one another , she said . sarkozy said he thinks it is crucial to attack europe 's problems as quickly as possible . " waiting too long just makes this more complicated , " he said , referring particularly to plans for a new eu constitution . " the first urgent task is to free europe from its current paralysis . " as for merkel , she sees sarkozy as a key partner in her plan to get the eu constitution process going again at the eu summit in june . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vowing change , sarkozy succeeds chirac as french president nicolas sarkozy took over as french president from jacques chirac on wednesday , vowing to usher in a period of deep reforms to help his country adapt to a fast-changing world .

with daimlerchrysler in divorce court , can benz make a comeback ? what 's in a name ?
a lot , according to conventional wisdom among corporate ceos .
nearly a decade ago , the highly touted " marriage of equals " between german high-end carmaker daimler-benz and us standard-bearer chrysler nearly ran aground amid disagreement over which of the two partners would get top billing in the corporate identity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car inventor karl benz is not getting his propers , some say daimler won out -lrb- thus the company was called daimlerchrysler , not chryslerdaimler -rrb- .
but in doing so , it sacrificed benz , a part of its identity that goes back to the creation of the firm .
now , some folks are arguing that giving up its heritage - carl benz was the inventor of the first automobile , after all - was a mistake .
with the newly spun-off german arm of daimlerchrysler seeking a revamped corporate identity , a war of words has broken out in the state of baden-württemberg . people from the region of baden - where carl benz was born - are upset that those in stuttgart -lrb- in württemberg , and the town where daimler ag is headquartered -rrb- have gotten all the glory , and are keeping it .
town agitates to revive " benz " " in stuttgart … they should n't forget that it was n't gottlieb daimler , but carl benz who invented the automobile , " a worker at the daimlerchrysler factory in mannheim told dpa news service .
meanwhile , administrators in the town of mannheim -lrb- located in the baden region of baden-württemberg -rrb- are doing their best to encourage daimler ag leader dieter zetsche to reclaim the benz name , the associated press has reported .
" through the planned separation from chrysler , there is a chance to bring the old daimler-benz name back to life , " said a declaration from the local council of mannheim .
and daimler ag headquarters also reported a number of calls of people who wanted to get the benz name back , ap said .
concerns over corporate confusion marina raptis , a spokeswoman for daimler ag , told ap any name change would need to be addressed at an extraordinary general meeting in the autumn .
suggestions would need to be examined with several factors in mind , including property rights and legal and strategic issues , she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gottlieb daimler merged his firm with benz 's in 1926 she noted that the daimler name is well known and serves as an over-arching identity .
names like mercedes-benz ag or daimler-benz ag could mix corporate and product identities , which could harm the company 's position on the product market , raptis argued .
" our suggested and preferred name , daimler ag , attaches us to tradition , but shows a clear direction forward , " raptis said .
the suggested name is not meant to be a slight to benz , she said .
" the history and tradition of our company , as well as the brand mercedes benz will always be tied to carl benz . ...
without carl benz and gottlieb daimler , our company would not exist , " she said .
no one denies that benz 's invention hit the pavement before that of his competitor daimler .
that fact has left some people especially eager to see the name benz back in the company logo .
baden-based politician karl lamers argued that the name benz is the " starting point for today 's international auto concern . "
and the mayor of the city of karlsruhe , heinz fenrich , reminded daimler chief dieter zetsche that benz " got the world on wheels . "
mrs. benz 's famous ride the hybrid name daimler-benz itself came about as a result of an even earlier corporate history of merger and survival .
in 1883 , benz founded the " benz & co .
rhineland gas motor factory " in the town of mannheim .
he patented a single-stroke , four-cylinder engine in january 1886 .
in july of that year , he hooked it to a three-wheel carriage and sent it on its inaugural drive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes-benz is one of the best known brands in the auto industry in a groundbreaking publicity stunt , benz 's wife bertha rode the open-top " benz-patent motor car " to her hometown of pforzheim .

a lot , according to conventional wisdom among corporate ceos .
nearly a decade ago , the highly touted " marriage of equals " between german high-end carmaker daimler-benz and us standard-bearer chrysler nearly ran aground amid disagreement over which of the two partners would get top billing in the corporate identity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car inventor karl benz is not getting his propers , some say daimler won out -lrb- thus the company was called daimlerchrysler , not chryslerdaimler -rrb- .

now , some folks are arguing that giving up its heritage - carl benz was the inventor of the first automobile , after all - was a mistake .
with the newly spun-off german arm of daimlerchrysler seeking a revamped corporate identity , a war of words has broken out in the state of baden-württemberg . people from the region of baden - where carl benz was born - are upset that those in stuttgart -lrb- in württemberg , and the town where daimler ag is headquartered -rrb- have gotten all the glory , and are keeping it .

meanwhile , administrators in the town of mannheim -lrb- located in the baden region of baden-württemberg -rrb- are doing their best to encourage daimler ag leader dieter zetsche to reclaim the benz name , the associated press has reported .
" through the planned separation from chrysler , there is a chance to bring the old daimler-benz name back to life , " said a declaration from the local council of mannheim .
and daimler ag headquarters also reported a number of calls of people who wanted to get the benz name back , ap said .
concerns over corporate confusion marina raptis , a spokeswoman for daimler ag , told ap any name change would need to be addressed at an extraordinary general meeting in the autumn .

" our suggested and preferred name , daimler ag , attaches us to tradition , but shows a clear direction forward , " raptis said .
the suggested name is not meant to be a slight to benz , she said .
" the history and tradition of our company , as well as the brand mercedes benz will always be tied to carl benz . ...

but so far , criticism has been faint . the organization " reporters without borders " ranks poland 58th in its press freedom index of 168 countries .
among the 27 eu member states , it holds the lowest position . the group said it has observed a strong increase in censorship by poland 's conservative government .
the latest attempt involves plans announced earlier this month by the parliament 's new speaker , ludwik dorn , to classify parliamentary journalists .
under the system , certain groups of journalists would have certain reporting privileges and access to politicians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslaw kaczynski , here with german chancellor angela merkel , has n't given up yet dorn , a key ally of poland 's ruling kaczynski twins , said the division would better organize parliamentary work and " avert chaos . "
yet polish journalists disagreed . " dorn should rather read the constitution and what it says on journalists ' access to information , " stefan batorowski from the polish journalists association told polish media . government will continue its efforts polish journalists have been feeling increased government pressure to toe the official line .
all of the country 's journalists were to be screened as part of the government 's controversial vetting law , which it said was aimed at purging public life of ex-communist agents .
but last week , the constitutional court threw a spanner in the works . the judges ruled that most of the government 's planned law was unconstitutional .
it would have required some 700,000 poles to file statements saying whether they had collaborated with the communist-era secret police . those affected included practically all of the country 's intellectuals and included journalists , managers of listed state-owned firms and principals of private schools . people who failed to comply risked losing their jobs and a 10-year professional ban .
the legislation had been an extension of a decade-old vetting law that previously applied to only 30,000 lawmakers , government ministers and judges . while the government grudgingly accepted the court 's decision , formalizing it on tuesday , the battle is n't over . prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , the twin brother of president lech kaczynski , said work was to begin on a new law designed to purge communists from public life .
new legislation would be in accordance with the constitution , he said . clearer international communication is necessary the kaczynski twins have made it clear in their governing style that they want to centralize power .
as a result , some observers have asked why there is n't more of an outcry in the eu regarding legislation such as the vetting law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are the minds of polish intellectuals being x-rayed ?

" they really shot themselves in the foot with austria , " kurpas said .
the övp-fpö coalition government took office and after a few months of chilly diplomatic relations , things returned to normal . " the experience with austria really backfired and showed what limited possibilities exist , " kurpas said . in poland , a feeling of ' we 're doing fine ' even in poland there has been noticeably little resistance to the kaczynski government 's policies . " there are no protests , though there is a massive polarization among the population , " said bastos .
yet effective political opposition was lacking , he said . " also , the economy is going doing relatively well and the national rhetoric is leaving the economy alone , " bastos said .

but can the dresden music festival be spared from the curse of mediocrity ? now in its 30th season , the dresden music festival opens on thursday .
over the two weeks , a host of internationally acclaimed performers - including pianist alfred brendel , cellist heinrich schiff and violinist gidon kremer - are set to make appearances in the eastern german city .
the festival will start with a sing-along performance , as it does each year .
this year it will be joseph haydn 's " four seasons " oratorio . it will also feature a wide range of events on its program including musical theater , dance , jazz , film , literature and visual arts .
despite the star power on this year 's program , the festival has seen better days .
" the most visited classical music festival in germany is dropping into the middle class , " festival director hartmut haenchen said in an interview with german news agency dpa .
the city of dresden has cut the festival budget by 30 percent , forcing organizers to slim down the program to 64 events - compared to 108 in 2006 .

expert-led excursions are on offer , including a trip into dresden 's own natural landscape , the unesco protected elbe valley .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the elbe valley was added to the unesco list in 2004 the area is currently in danger of losing its status on the list of unesco world heritage sites due to a controversial bridge being built across the valley .
the bridge had been approved by a local referendum in 2005 , but unesco said it would consider removing dresden from its list of 830 world heritage sites because the modern construction would have " a serious impact on the integrity of the landscape " of the city . city leaders in saxony 's capital tried to back-pedal on the bridge project , but their efforts were stalled by a court decision upholding the plebiscite .
" it irritates me that politicians think so short-term , " haenchen said about the 106 million euro -lrb- $ 203 million -rrb- bridge project .
many believe that dresden - being known internationally as a city of culture - should invest more in the festival .
" the city has enough bridges , " wrote german web site klassik.com in the aftermath of the 2006 festival .

world-class soloists like marilyn horne and dietrich fischer-diskau as well as top conductors like claudio abbado and zubin mehta came to the elbe river city to share their talents .
after germany 's reunification , the dresden music festival continued to prosper , peaking in 2003 with a record 150,000 visitors .
some 140,000 music lovers attended the event last year , but haenchen said he fears the number could drop to as few as 70,000 attendees this year .

" the european union is a union of 27 member states and we take decisions based on solidarity .
i came here of course with this spirit of defending european interests in that sense of solidarity , " barroso said .
speaking to reporters after his arrival in samara , a regional centre , he said he would hold " a frank and open discussion " with putin at the summit but did not expect any breakthroughs .
" i am not expecting , honestly , anything spectacular from this meeting , " barroso said . merkel also called for dialogue with moscow , saying ahead of the talks : " russia and the european union are interdependent .
it 's always good to speak to each other rather than talking about each other . "
the summit 's main consultations were set for friday at the volzhsky utyos -lrb- volga cliff -rrb- resort complex , southeast of moscow , but the agenda was limited because of ongoing diplomatic and trade disputes .
" a difficult time " " this summit is taking place at a difficult time , " a german government official told reporters in berlin this week .
" but if we want a strategic partnership with russia it 's important that we talk even during difficult times . "
even if there is no narrowing of differences , both sides will get a better idea of each other 's positions , he said .
eu officials said talks would touch on international issues such as the future status of kosovo and iran 's nuclear programme , as well as russia 's bid to join the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- this year .
but negotiations on a key partnership agreement that governs eu-russia relations , including in the vitally important energy sphere , have been held up because of a trade row between eu member poland and russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland and russia are locked in a row over polish meat imports " eu members understand us .
so , in a sense , there is a situation of crisis in relations between the eu and russia , " polish foreign minister anna fotyga said thursday in an interview with polish public television .
poland has warned it will maintain a veto on talks unless moscow lifts a ban on meat imports from poland and eu members form a united front on the issue of energy security .
russia has accused poland of holding eu-russia relations " hostage . "
russia 's wto bid the row with poland and a bitter war of words with estonia over a soviet memorial in tallinn have highlighted still-tense relations between moscow and formerly soviet-dominated central europe .
after a recent blockade of the estonian embassy in moscow , and violent scenes at a news conference given by the estonian ambassador , the european commission has urged russia to observe un conventions on protection of diplomats .
russia has suggested it wants to deal only with more established eu states , sparking angry responses from eu officials , who have vowed unity in the face of pressure from russia .
eu leaders have also voiced concern about europe 's rapidly growing reliance on russian oil and gas imports at a time when russia is becoming an increasingly assertive energy power .
there are other items on the summit agenda that could spark controversy .
the european union has supported russia 's bid to join the world trade union as soon as possible but has said that it could withhold final approval until eu-russia trade tariff rows are resolved .
putin has set early wto accession as a key goal for his presidency .
a draft document seen by afp said eu leaders should " make clear that the eu is ready to support early conclusion of russia 's wto accession but not at any price . "
missile defense , democratic freedoms russia has also contributed to the tense mood of the summit with its ongoing row with the us over plans to station elements of a planned missile defense system in poland and the czech republic .
moscow has threatened to tear up a key arms limitation pact if washington goes ahead with those plans .
eu leaders also said they wanted to discuss democratic freedoms in russia , which have come under scrutiny amid a crackdown on opposition protests ahead of presidential elections next year .

" the european union is a union of 27 member states and we take decisions based on solidarity .
i came here of course with this spirit of defending european interests in that sense of solidarity , " barroso said .
speaking to reporters after his arrival in samara , a regional centre , he said he would hold " a frank and open discussion " with putin at the summit but did not expect any breakthroughs .
" i am not expecting , honestly , anything spectacular from this meeting , " barroso said . merkel also called for dialogue with moscow , saying ahead of the talks : " russia and the european union are interdependent .
it 's always good to speak to each other rather than talking about each other . "
the summit 's main consultations were set for friday at the volzhsky utyos -lrb- volga cliff -rrb- resort complex , southeast of moscow , but the agenda was limited because of ongoing diplomatic and trade disputes .
" a difficult time " " this summit is taking place at a difficult time , " a german government official told reporters in berlin this week .
" but if we want a strategic partnership with russia it 's important that we talk even during difficult times . "
even if there is no narrowing of differences , both sides will get a better idea of each other 's positions , he said .
eu officials said talks would touch on international issues such as the future status of kosovo and iran 's nuclear programme , as well as russia 's bid to join the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- this year .
but negotiations on a key partnership agreement that governs eu-russia relations , including in the vitally important energy sphere , have been held up because of a trade row between eu member poland and russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland and russia are locked in a row over polish meat imports " eu members understand us .
so , in a sense , there is a situation of crisis in relations between the eu and russia , " polish foreign minister anna fotyga said thursday in an interview with polish public television .
poland has warned it will maintain a veto on talks unless moscow lifts a ban on meat imports from poland and eu members form a united front on the issue of energy security .
russia has accused poland of holding eu-russia relations " hostage . "
russia 's wto bid the row with poland and a bitter war of words with estonia over a soviet memorial in tallinn have highlighted still-tense relations between moscow and formerly soviet-dominated central europe .
after a recent blockade of the estonian embassy in moscow , and violent scenes at a news conference given by the estonian ambassador , the european commission has urged russia to observe un conventions on protection of diplomats .
russia has suggested it wants to deal only with more established eu states , sparking angry responses from eu officials , who have vowed unity in the face of pressure from russia .
eu leaders have also voiced concern about europe 's rapidly growing reliance on russian oil and gas imports at a time when russia is becoming an increasingly assertive energy power .
there are other items on the summit agenda that could spark controversy .
the european union has supported russia 's bid to join the world trade union as soon as possible but has said that it could withhold final approval until eu-russia trade tariff rows are resolved .
putin has set early wto accession as a key goal for his presidency .
a draft document seen by afp said eu leaders should " make clear that the eu is ready to support early conclusion of russia 's wto accession but not at any price . "
missile defense , democratic freedoms russia has also contributed to the tense mood of the summit with its ongoing row with the us over plans to station elements of a planned missile defense system in poland and the czech republic .
moscow has threatened to tear up a key arms limitation pact if washington goes ahead with those plans .
eu leaders also said they wanted to discuss democratic freedoms in russia , which have come under scrutiny amid a crackdown on opposition protests ahead of presidential elections next year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a russian crackdown on opposition protests last month sparked major criticism an anti-kremlin group , the other russia , is due to hold a protest rally in samara on friday .
the demonstration has been dogged with problems , including the arrest of several of the main organizers .
meanwhile , hundreds of pro-kremlin activists also prepared to rally in samara on friday against estonia 's decision to move a controversial soviet war monument last month .
russia reprimanded the european union for failing to condemn estonia 's decision , which sparked rioting by ethnic-russians .
brussels has said the issue is an internal matter for estonia . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , russia play down differences , but hurdles remain german foreign minister steinmeier met russian president putin on tuesday in a last-ditch bid to rescue a looming eu-russia summit amid spiraling tensions over a host of issues .

the us and the eu should turn to the old-fashioned tools of diplomacy , argues thorsten benner . last friday , the un commission on sustainable development -lrb- csd -rrb- elected zimbabwe as its next chair .
much to their chagrin , eu countries , the us and canada were outvoted in their opposition against installing mugabe 's repressive regime as chair of this major -lrb- even though for the most part dysfunctional -rrb- un body .
the uk representative emphasized that for zimbabwe to chair the " commission , while -lsb- mugabe 's -rsb- own people suffer the appalling consequences of -lsb- zimbabwe 's -rsb- government policies , is wholly inconsistent with the commission 's aims .
it damages the credibility of the commission itself and its ability to deal with issues affecting the livelihoods of millions from the poorest countries . "
this thursday , belarus , egypt and angola seek membership of the un human rights council .
all three hardly live up to the criteria set out for membership in the new un human rights body : " contribution to the promotion and protection of human rights and -lsb- its -rsb- voluntary pledges and commitments made thereto . "
maintain the status quo ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thorsten benner what strategy should democracies choose with regard to the role of dictatorships in un bodies ?
" simply accept it as a fact of life " is the first option recommended by many , especially the members of the group of 77 -lrb- g77 -rrb- developing country bloc at the un .
sudan 's un ambassador abdalmahmood abdalhaleem , for example , argues that it is the " right of regional groups to choose whoever they want . "
he can refer to the un charter to support his point .
the charter states prominently that the un " is based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its members . "
democracy at the un means " one country , one vote . "
it is not for others to question how sovereign members exercise their right to vote .
case closed .
a second option is based on the exact opposite view .
it argues that the role of dictatorships undermines the credibility and effectiveness of the un so that it is necessary to create alternatives .
introduce a " democracies only " club ?
us senator and presidential candidate john mccain advocates " bringing democratic peoples and nations from around the world into one common organization , a worldwide league of democracies . -lrb- … -rrb- the new league of democracies would form the core of an international order of peace based on freedom .
it could act where the un fails to act , to relieve human suffering in places like darfur . "
both options - accepting the status quo and creating a new " democracies only " club outside the un - are short-sighted .
simply acquiescing to the prominent role of dictatorships in un bodies threatens to further undermine the standing of the united nations in key countries that account for the vast majority of contributions to the un budget , especially the us .
it also undermines the credibility of the un as a whole to stand up for the ideals enshrined in its charter .
forming a " league of democracies " outside the un throws the baby out with the bathwater .
a world organization of only democracies could not supplant the united nations .
this would amount to the same as restricting diplomacy to friendly and like-minded countries , while missing out on the very essence of the business of diplomacy .
old-fashioned tools we need an alternative strategy within the un to further human rights and democracy .
first of all , democracies need to use the old-fashioned tools of diplomacy to reverse the trend of the increasing prominence of dictatorships in un bodies .
the eu and the us in particular should use the powers of moral suasion as well as hard economic and political incentives to ease individual developing countries out of the block of irresponsible voters .
there is no inevitability for countries such as south africa or argentina to side with serial human rights abusers .
while engaging in diplomacy , the us , the eu and other democracies should be respectful in demeanour and firm on principles .
they should make it clear that they are not willing to tolerate serial abuses of the goals of the un on human rights .
the german foreign minister did exactly that earlier this year in his address to the un human rights council on behalf of the eu .
he argued that " it is not acceptable that very serious human rights violations are not addressed - or are not addressed with the necessary directness - because regional or ideological solidarity takes precedence over the willingness to see critical situations without bias . "
aiming for a " community of democracies " establishing a " democracy caucus " within the un would be another important element of a winning strategy .
a democracy caucus would offer a complement to regional and other blocs within the un for cooperation on resolutions and initiatives .
this democracy caucus could also contribute to moving away from the confrontation between the " west vs. the rest " that currently poisons the atmosphere at the un .
major members of the g-77 developing country bloc , such as india , would also be members of the democracy caucus .
this caucus could further a better understanding of what democracy is all about . when confronted with the opposition to his candidacy , the newly elected zimbabwean chair of the csd said that critics had the " right to their opinions . "
he added that " at the end of the day the majority rules as democracy does . "
once a vast majority of un members understands that this misses the very essence of liberal democracy we will have come a long way in living up to the ideals of the un .
as former un secretary-general kofi annan pointed out , " when the united nations can truly call itself a community of democracies , the charter 's noble ideals of protecting human rights and promoting ' social progress in larger freedoms ' will have been brought much closer . "

" the likelihood that the complainant would be contacted by those responsible was so minimal from the start that the chances that the measures would be successful were disproportionate to the severity of the tapping , " the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier : cia arrest warrants wo n't hurt german-us ties warrants issued by a german court for 13 suspected cia operatives linked to the abduction of a german citizen will not harm relations , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier was quoted as saying on saturday .

but can the dresden music festival be spared from the curse of mediocrity ? now in its 30th season , the dresden music festival opens on thursday .
over the two weeks , a host of internationally acclaimed performers - including pianist alfred brendel , cellist heinrich schiff and violinist gidon kremer - are set to make appearances in the eastern german city .
the festival will start with a sing-along performance , as it does each year .
this year it will be joseph haydn 's " four seasons " oratorio . it will also feature a wide range of events on its program including musical theater , dance , jazz , film , literature and visual arts .
despite the star power on this year 's program , the festival has seen better days .
" the most visited classical music festival in germany is dropping into the middle class , " festival director hartmut haenchen said in an interview with german news agency dpa .
the city of dresden has cut the festival budget by 30 percent , forcing organizers to slim down the program to 64 events - compared to 108 in 2006 .
endangered landscapes this year 's festival revolves around the theme of " landscapes . "
expert-led excursions are on offer , including a trip into dresden 's own natural landscape , the unesco protected elbe valley .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the elbe valley was added to the unesco list in 2004 the area is currently in danger of losing its status on the list of unesco world heritage sites due to a controversial bridge being built across the valley .
the bridge had been approved by a local referendum in 2005 , but unesco said it would consider removing dresden from its list of 830 world heritage sites because the modern construction would have " a serious impact on the integrity of the landscape " of the city . city leaders in saxony 's capital tried to back-pedal on the bridge project , but their efforts were stalled by a court decision upholding the plebiscite .
" it irritates me that politicians think so short-term , " haenchen said about the 106 million euro -lrb- $ 203 million -rrb- bridge project .
many believe that dresden - being known internationally as a city of culture - should invest more in the festival .
" the city has enough bridges , " wrote german web site klassik.com in the aftermath of the 2006 festival .
gdr 's most prestigious classical festival bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renowned pianist alfred brendel will perform works from 19th century vienna founded in 1978 by east germany 's communist party , the dresden music festival became the gdr 's most prestigious classical festival and attracted a great deal of attention from abroad .
world-class soloists like marilyn horne and dietrich fischer-diskau as well as top conductors like claudio abbado and zubin mehta came to the elbe river city to share their talents .
after germany 's reunification , the dresden music festival continued to prosper , peaking in 2003 with a record 150,000 visitors .
some 140,000 music lovers attended the event last year , but haenchen said he fears the number could drop to as few as 70,000 attendees this year .
" people play mozart for cows so they give more milk , " haenchen .
" with people , that potential is not being tapped .

" the european union is a union of 27 member states and we take decisions based on solidarity .
i came here of course with this spirit of defending european interests in that sense of solidarity , " barroso said .
speaking to reporters after his arrival in samara , a regional centre , he said he would hold " a frank and open discussion " with putin at the summit but did not expect any breakthroughs .
" i am not expecting , honestly , anything spectacular from this meeting , " barroso said . merkel also called for dialogue with moscow , saying ahead of the talks : " russia and the european union are interdependent .
it 's always good to speak to each other rather than talking about each other . "
the summit 's main consultations were set for friday at the volzhsky utyos -lrb- volga cliff -rrb- resort complex , southeast of moscow , but the agenda was limited because of ongoing diplomatic and trade disputes .
" a difficult time " " this summit is taking place at a difficult time , " a german government official told reporters in berlin this week .
" but if we want a strategic partnership with russia it 's important that we talk even during difficult times . "
even if there is no narrowing of differences , both sides will get a better idea of each other 's positions , he said .
eu officials said talks would touch on international issues such as the future status of kosovo and iran 's nuclear programme , as well as russia 's bid to join the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- this year .
but negotiations on a key partnership agreement that governs eu-russia relations , including in the vitally important energy sphere , have been held up because of a trade row between eu member poland and russia .

poland has warned it will maintain a veto on talks unless moscow lifts a ban on meat imports from poland and eu members form a united front on the issue of energy security .
russia has accused poland of holding eu-russia relations " hostage . "
russia 's wto bid the row with poland and a bitter war of words with estonia over a soviet memorial in tallinn have highlighted still-tense relations between moscow and formerly soviet-dominated central europe .
after a recent blockade of the estonian embassy in moscow , and violent scenes at a news conference given by the estonian ambassador , the european commission has urged russia to observe un conventions on protection of diplomats .
russia has suggested it wants to deal only with more established eu states , sparking angry responses from eu officials , who have vowed unity in the face of pressure from russia .
eu leaders have also voiced concern about europe 's rapidly growing reliance on russian oil and gas imports at a time when russia is becoming an increasingly assertive energy power .
there are other items on the summit agenda that could spark controversy .
the european union has supported russia 's bid to join the world trade union as soon as possible but has said that it could withhold final approval until eu-russia trade tariff rows are resolved .
putin has set early wto accession as a key goal for his presidency .
a draft document seen by afp said eu leaders should " make clear that the eu is ready to support early conclusion of russia 's wto accession but not at any price . "
missile defense , democratic freedoms russia has also contributed to the tense mood of the summit with its ongoing row with the us over plans to station elements of a planned missile defense system in poland and the czech republic .
moscow has threatened to tear up a key arms limitation pact if washington goes ahead with those plans .

with daimlerchrysler in divorce court , can benz make a comeback ? what 's in a name ?
a lot , according to conventional wisdom among corporate ceos .
nearly a decade ago , the highly touted " marriage of equals " between german high-end carmaker daimler-benz and us standard-bearer chrysler nearly ran aground amid disagreement over which of the two partners would get top billing in the corporate identity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car inventor karl benz is not getting his propers , some say daimler won out -lrb- thus the company was called daimlerchrysler , not chryslerdaimler -rrb- .
but in doing so , it sacrificed benz , a part of its identity that goes back to the creation of the firm .
now , some folks are arguing that giving up its heritage - carl benz was the inventor of the first automobile , after all - was a mistake .
with the newly spun-off german arm of daimlerchrysler seeking a revamped corporate identity , a war of words has broken out in the state of baden-württemberg . people from the region of baden - where carl benz was born - are upset that those in stuttgart -lrb- in württemberg , and the town where daimler ag is headquartered -rrb- have gotten all the glory , and are keeping it .
town agitates to revive " benz " " in stuttgart … they should n't forget that it was n't gottlieb daimler , but carl benz who invented the automobile , " a worker at the daimlerchrysler factory in mannheim told dpa news service .
meanwhile , administrators in the town of mannheim -lrb- located in the baden region of baden-württemberg -rrb- are doing their best to encourage daimler ag leader dieter zetsche to reclaim the benz name , the associated press has reported .
" through the planned separation from chrysler , there is a chance to bring the old daimler-benz name back to life , " said a declaration from the local council of mannheim .
and daimler ag headquarters also reported a number of calls of people who wanted to get the benz name back , ap said .
concerns over corporate confusion marina raptis , a spokeswoman for daimler ag , told ap any name change would need to be addressed at an extraordinary general meeting in the autumn .
suggestions would need to be examined with several factors in mind , including property rights and legal and strategic issues , she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gottlieb daimler merged his firm with benz 's in 1926 she noted that the daimler name is well known and serves as an over-arching identity .
names like mercedes-benz ag or daimler-benz ag could mix corporate and product identities , which could harm the company 's position on the product market , raptis argued .
" our suggested and preferred name , daimler ag , attaches us to tradition , but shows a clear direction forward , " raptis said .
the suggested name is not meant to be a slight to benz , she said .
" the history and tradition of our company , as well as the brand mercedes benz will always be tied to carl benz . ...

with daimlerchrysler in divorce court , can benz make a comeback ? what 's in a name ?
a lot , according to conventional wisdom among corporate ceos .
nearly a decade ago , the highly touted " marriage of equals " between german high-end carmaker daimler-benz and us standard-bearer chrysler nearly ran aground amid disagreement over which of the two partners would get top billing in the corporate identity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car inventor karl benz is not getting his propers , some say daimler won out -lrb- thus the company was called daimlerchrysler , not chryslerdaimler -rrb- .
but in doing so , it sacrificed benz , a part of its identity that goes back to the creation of the firm .
now , some folks are arguing that giving up its heritage - carl benz was the inventor of the first automobile , after all - was a mistake .
with the newly spun-off german arm of daimlerchrysler seeking a revamped corporate identity , a war of words has broken out in the state of baden-württemberg . people from the region of baden - where carl benz was born - are upset that those in stuttgart -lrb- in württemberg , and the town where daimler ag is headquartered -rrb- have gotten all the glory , and are keeping it .
town agitates to revive " benz " " in stuttgart … they should n't forget that it was n't gottlieb daimler , but carl benz who invented the automobile , " a worker at the daimlerchrysler factory in mannheim told dpa news service .
meanwhile , administrators in the town of mannheim -lrb- located in the baden region of baden-württemberg -rrb- are doing their best to encourage daimler ag leader dieter zetsche to reclaim the benz name , the associated press has reported .
" through the planned separation from chrysler , there is a chance to bring the old daimler-benz name back to life , " said a declaration from the local council of mannheim .
and daimler ag headquarters also reported a number of calls of people who wanted to get the benz name back , ap said .
concerns over corporate confusion marina raptis , a spokeswoman for daimler ag , told ap any name change would need to be addressed at an extraordinary general meeting in the autumn .
suggestions would need to be examined with several factors in mind , including property rights and legal and strategic issues , she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gottlieb daimler merged his firm with benz 's in 1926 she noted that the daimler name is well known and serves as an over-arching identity .
names like mercedes-benz ag or daimler-benz ag could mix corporate and product identities , which could harm the company 's position on the product market , raptis argued .
" our suggested and preferred name , daimler ag , attaches us to tradition , but shows a clear direction forward , " raptis said .
the suggested name is not meant to be a slight to benz , she said .
" the history and tradition of our company , as well as the brand mercedes benz will always be tied to carl benz . ...
without carl benz and gottlieb daimler , our company would not exist , " she said .
no one denies that benz 's invention hit the pavement before that of his competitor daimler .
that fact has left some people especially eager to see the name benz back in the company logo .

the us and the eu should turn to the old-fashioned tools of diplomacy , argues thorsten benner . last friday , the un commission on sustainable development -lrb- csd -rrb- elected zimbabwe as its next chair .
much to their chagrin , eu countries , the us and canada were outvoted in their opposition against installing mugabe 's repressive regime as chair of this major -lrb- even though for the most part dysfunctional -rrb- un body .
the uk representative emphasized that for zimbabwe to chair the " commission , while -lsb- mugabe 's -rsb- own people suffer the appalling consequences of -lsb- zimbabwe 's -rsb- government policies , is wholly inconsistent with the commission 's aims .
it damages the credibility of the commission itself and its ability to deal with issues affecting the livelihoods of millions from the poorest countries . "
this thursday , belarus , egypt and angola seek membership of the un human rights council .
all three hardly live up to the criteria set out for membership in the new un human rights body : " contribution to the promotion and protection of human rights and -lsb- its -rsb- voluntary pledges and commitments made thereto . "
maintain the status quo ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thorsten benner what strategy should democracies choose with regard to the role of dictatorships in un bodies ?
" simply accept it as a fact of life " is the first option recommended by many , especially the members of the group of 77 -lrb- g77 -rrb- developing country bloc at the un .
sudan 's un ambassador abdalmahmood abdalhaleem , for example , argues that it is the " right of regional groups to choose whoever they want . "
he can refer to the un charter to support his point .
the charter states prominently that the un " is based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its members . "
democracy at the un means " one country , one vote . "
it is not for others to question how sovereign members exercise their right to vote .
case closed .
a second option is based on the exact opposite view .
it argues that the role of dictatorships undermines the credibility and effectiveness of the un so that it is necessary to create alternatives .
introduce a " democracies only " club ?
us senator and presidential candidate john mccain advocates " bringing democratic peoples and nations from around the world into one common organization , a worldwide league of democracies . -lrb- … -rrb- the new league of democracies would form the core of an international order of peace based on freedom .
it could act where the un fails to act , to relieve human suffering in places like darfur . "
both options - accepting the status quo and creating a new " democracies only " club outside the un - are short-sighted .
simply acquiescing to the prominent role of dictatorships in un bodies threatens to further undermine the standing of the united nations in key countries that account for the vast majority of contributions to the un budget , especially the us .
it also undermines the credibility of the un as a whole to stand up for the ideals enshrined in its charter .
forming a " league of democracies " outside the un throws the baby out with the bathwater .
a world organization of only democracies could not supplant the united nations .
this would amount to the same as restricting diplomacy to friendly and like-minded countries , while missing out on the very essence of the business of diplomacy .
old-fashioned tools we need an alternative strategy within the un to further human rights and democracy .
first of all , democracies need to use the old-fashioned tools of diplomacy to reverse the trend of the increasing prominence of dictatorships in un bodies .
the eu and the us in particular should use the powers of moral suasion as well as hard economic and political incentives to ease individual developing countries out of the block of irresponsible voters .
there is no inevitability for countries such as south africa or argentina to side with serial human rights abusers .
while engaging in diplomacy , the us , the eu and other democracies should be respectful in demeanour and firm on principles .
they should make it clear that they are not willing to tolerate serial abuses of the goals of the un on human rights .
the german foreign minister did exactly that earlier this year in his address to the un human rights council on behalf of the eu .
he argued that " it is not acceptable that very serious human rights violations are not addressed - or are not addressed with the necessary directness - because regional or ideological solidarity takes precedence over the willingness to see critical situations without bias . "
aiming for a " community of democracies " establishing a " democracy caucus " within the un would be another important element of a winning strategy .
a democracy caucus would offer a complement to regional and other blocs within the un for cooperation on resolutions and initiatives .
this democracy caucus could also contribute to moving away from the confrontation between the " west vs. the rest " that currently poisons the atmosphere at the un .
major members of the g-77 developing country bloc , such as india , would also be members of the democracy caucus .
this caucus could further a better understanding of what democracy is all about . when confronted with the opposition to his candidacy , the newly elected zimbabwean chair of the csd said that critics had the " right to their opinions . "
he added that " at the end of the day the majority rules as democracy does . "
once a vast majority of un members understands that this misses the very essence of liberal democracy we will have come a long way in living up to the ideals of the un .
as former un secretary-general kofi annan pointed out , " when the united nations can truly call itself a community of democracies , the charter 's noble ideals of protecting human rights and promoting ' social progress in larger freedoms ' will have been brought much closer . "

introduce a " democracies only " club ?
us senator and presidential candidate john mccain advocates " bringing democratic peoples and nations from around the world into one common organization , a worldwide league of democracies . -lrb- … -rrb- the new league of democracies would form the core of an international order of peace based on freedom .
it could act where the un fails to act , to relieve human suffering in places like darfur . "
both options - accepting the status quo and creating a new " democracies only " club outside the un - are short-sighted .
simply acquiescing to the prominent role of dictatorships in un bodies threatens to further undermine the standing of the united nations in key countries that account for the vast majority of contributions to the un budget , especially the us .
it also undermines the credibility of the un as a whole to stand up for the ideals enshrined in its charter .
forming a " league of democracies " outside the un throws the baby out with the bathwater .
a world organization of only democracies could not supplant the united nations .
this would amount to the same as restricting diplomacy to friendly and like-minded countries , while missing out on the very essence of the business of diplomacy .
old-fashioned tools we need an alternative strategy within the un to further human rights and democracy .
first of all , democracies need to use the old-fashioned tools of diplomacy to reverse the trend of the increasing prominence of dictatorships in un bodies .
the eu and the us in particular should use the powers of moral suasion as well as hard economic and political incentives to ease individual developing countries out of the block of irresponsible voters .
there is no inevitability for countries such as south africa or argentina to side with serial human rights abusers .
while engaging in diplomacy , the us , the eu and other democracies should be respectful in demeanour and firm on principles .
they should make it clear that they are not willing to tolerate serial abuses of the goals of the un on human rights .
the german foreign minister did exactly that earlier this year in his address to the un human rights council on behalf of the eu .
he argued that " it is not acceptable that very serious human rights violations are not addressed - or are not addressed with the necessary directness - because regional or ideological solidarity takes precedence over the willingness to see critical situations without bias . "
aiming for a " community of democracies " establishing a " democracy caucus " within the un would be another important element of a winning strategy .
a democracy caucus would offer a complement to regional and other blocs within the un for cooperation on resolutions and initiatives .
this democracy caucus could also contribute to moving away from the confrontation between the " west vs. the rest " that currently poisons the atmosphere at the un .
major members of the g-77 developing country bloc , such as india , would also be members of the democracy caucus .
this caucus could further a better understanding of what democracy is all about . when confronted with the opposition to his candidacy , the newly elected zimbabwean chair of the csd said that critics had the " right to their opinions . "
he added that " at the end of the day the majority rules as democracy does . "
once a vast majority of un members understands that this misses the very essence of liberal democracy we will have come a long way in living up to the ideals of the un .
as former un secretary-general kofi annan pointed out , " when the united nations can truly call itself a community of democracies , the charter 's noble ideals of protecting human rights and promoting ' social progress in larger freedoms ' will have been brought much closer . "

the us and the eu should turn to the old-fashioned tools of diplomacy , argues thorsten benner . last friday , the un commission on sustainable development -lrb- csd -rrb- elected zimbabwe as its next chair .
much to their chagrin , eu countries , the us and canada were outvoted in their opposition against installing mugabe 's repressive regime as chair of this major -lrb- even though for the most part dysfunctional -rrb- un body .
the uk representative emphasized that for zimbabwe to chair the " commission , while -lsb- mugabe 's -rsb- own people suffer the appalling consequences of -lsb- zimbabwe 's -rsb- government policies , is wholly inconsistent with the commission 's aims .
it damages the credibility of the commission itself and its ability to deal with issues affecting the livelihoods of millions from the poorest countries . "
this thursday , belarus , egypt and angola seek membership of the un human rights council .
all three hardly live up to the criteria set out for membership in the new un human rights body : " contribution to the promotion and protection of human rights and -lsb- its -rsb- voluntary pledges and commitments made thereto . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thorsten benner what strategy should democracies choose with regard to the role of dictatorships in un bodies ?
" simply accept it as a fact of life " is the first option recommended by many , especially the members of the group of 77 -lrb- g77 -rrb- developing country bloc at the un .
sudan 's un ambassador abdalmahmood abdalhaleem , for example , argues that it is the " right of regional groups to choose whoever they want . "
he can refer to the un charter to support his point .
the charter states prominently that the un " is based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its members . "
democracy at the un means " one country , one vote . "

fillon , a 53-year-old senator from the ruling ump party who worked closely with sarkozy on his election campaign , has crucial experience in pensions reform which will be a key asset to the new government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing french pm de villepin held the post since 2005 the appointment was announced in a presidential statement a day after sarkozy took over as head of state from jacques chirac .
sarkozy is to announce the rest of his 15-member cabinet lineup on friday . fillon 's predecessor , dominique de villepin , presented his resignation on tuesday to chirac ahead of the handover of power to sarkozy , who has pledged to carry out deep social and economic reform .
fillon made his mark as a reformer as social affairs minister under chirac , from 2002 to 2004 , when he carried out an overhaul of france 's pension system , facing down million-strong street protests . low-key meets high energy ironically , in a book in 2006 , fillon had argued for abolishing the post of premier , while advocating a strong presidential-style of rule .
and during the election campaign , sarkozy himself had said that the premier should only " coordinate the work of the government " and should not share power with the head of state .
sarkozy 's jogging partner throughout the campaign , fillon has a low-key demeanor that is often described as complementary to sarkozy 's hyper-active style . speed was apparently of the essence on wednesday , when sarkozy - in a possibly record-breaking move - landed in berlin for his first official state visit , a mere six hours after he was sworn in to office . ' europe must lose its paralysis ' in berlin , the new french president met with german chancellor angela merkel , to show his support for strong franco-german relations and discuss the possibility of reviving the eu constitution .
french and dutch voters rejected the eu constitution in referendums two years ago .
germany currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : possibly breaking speed records , sarko was in berlin six hours after taking office " europe must be shaken from its paralysis as a matter of urgency , " sarkozy said at a joint press conference with merkel . over a working dinner , sarkozy presented his proposal for a mini-treaty comprising the bare essentials of the failed constitution , to allow the institutions of the 27-nation bloc to function fully . sarkozy stressed the importance of maintaining and strengthening the relationship between germany and france , whose partnership is often described as the driving force behind the eu . ' sacred ' friendship " i want to say to the german people that the friendship between france and germany is sacred and that nothing can call it into doubt , " he said . for her part , merkel thanked sarkozy for his speedy visit .
the gesture made it clear how much the two countries need one another , she said . sarkozy said he thinks it is crucial to attack europe 's problems as quickly as possible . " waiting too long just makes this more complicated , " he said , referring particularly to plans for a new eu constitution . " the first urgent task is to free europe from its current paralysis . " as for merkel , she sees sarkozy as a key partner in her plan to get the eu constitution process going again at the eu summit in june . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vowing change , sarkozy succeeds chirac as french president nicolas sarkozy took over as french president from jacques chirac on wednesday , vowing to usher in a period of deep reforms to help his country adapt to a fast-changing world .

this year it will be joseph haydn 's " four seasons " oratorio . it will also feature a wide range of events on its program including musical theater , dance , jazz , film , literature and visual arts .
despite the star power on this year 's program , the festival has seen better days .
" the most visited classical music festival in germany is dropping into the middle class , " festival director hartmut haenchen said in an interview with german news agency dpa .
the city of dresden has cut the festival budget by 30 percent , forcing organizers to slim down the program to 64 events - compared to 108 in 2006 .
endangered landscapes this year 's festival revolves around the theme of " landscapes . "
expert-led excursions are on offer , including a trip into dresden 's own natural landscape , the unesco protected elbe valley .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the elbe valley was added to the unesco list in 2004 the area is currently in danger of losing its status on the list of unesco world heritage sites due to a controversial bridge being built across the valley .
the bridge had been approved by a local referendum in 2005 , but unesco said it would consider removing dresden from its list of 830 world heritage sites because the modern construction would have " a serious impact on the integrity of the landscape " of the city . city leaders in saxony 's capital tried to back-pedal on the bridge project , but their efforts were stalled by a court decision upholding the plebiscite .
" it irritates me that politicians think so short-term , " haenchen said about the 106 million euro -lrb- $ 203 million -rrb- bridge project .
many believe that dresden - being known internationally as a city of culture - should invest more in the festival .
" the city has enough bridges , " wrote german web site klassik.com in the aftermath of the 2006 festival .
gdr 's most prestigious classical festival bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renowned pianist alfred brendel will perform works from 19th century vienna founded in 1978 by east germany 's communist party , the dresden music festival became the gdr 's most prestigious classical festival and attracted a great deal of attention from abroad .
world-class soloists like marilyn horne and dietrich fischer-diskau as well as top conductors like claudio abbado and zubin mehta came to the elbe river city to share their talents .
after germany 's reunification , the dresden music festival continued to prosper , peaking in 2003 with a record 150,000 visitors .
some 140,000 music lovers attended the event last year , but haenchen said he fears the number could drop to as few as 70,000 attendees this year .
" people play mozart for cows so they give more milk , " haenchen .
" with people , that potential is not being tapped .

fillon , a 53-year-old senator from the ruling ump party who worked closely with sarkozy on his election campaign , has crucial experience in pensions reform which will be a key asset to the new government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing french pm de villepin held the post since 2005 the appointment was announced in a presidential statement a day after sarkozy took over as head of state from jacques chirac .
sarkozy is to announce the rest of his 15-member cabinet lineup on friday . fillon 's predecessor , dominique de villepin , presented his resignation on tuesday to chirac ahead of the handover of power to sarkozy , who has pledged to carry out deep social and economic reform .
fillon made his mark as a reformer as social affairs minister under chirac , from 2002 to 2004 , when he carried out an overhaul of france 's pension system , facing down million-strong street protests . low-key meets high energy ironically , in a book in 2006 , fillon had argued for abolishing the post of premier , while advocating a strong presidential-style of rule .
and during the election campaign , sarkozy himself had said that the premier should only " coordinate the work of the government " and should not share power with the head of state .
sarkozy 's jogging partner throughout the campaign , fillon has a low-key demeanor that is often described as complementary to sarkozy 's hyper-active style . speed was apparently of the essence on wednesday , when sarkozy - in a possibly record-breaking move - landed in berlin for his first official state visit , a mere six hours after he was sworn in to office . ' europe must lose its paralysis ' in berlin , the new french president met with german chancellor angela merkel , to show his support for strong franco-german relations and discuss the possibility of reviving the eu constitution .
french and dutch voters rejected the eu constitution in referendums two years ago .
germany currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : possibly breaking speed records , sarko was in berlin six hours after taking office " europe must be shaken from its paralysis as a matter of urgency , " sarkozy said at a joint press conference with merkel . over a working dinner , sarkozy presented his proposal for a mini-treaty comprising the bare essentials of the failed constitution , to allow the institutions of the 27-nation bloc to function fully . sarkozy stressed the importance of maintaining and strengthening the relationship between germany and france , whose partnership is often described as the driving force behind the eu . ' sacred ' friendship " i want to say to the german people that the friendship between france and germany is sacred and that nothing can call it into doubt , " he said . for her part , merkel thanked sarkozy for his speedy visit .
the gesture made it clear how much the two countries need one another , she said . sarkozy said he thinks it is crucial to attack europe 's problems as quickly as possible . " waiting too long just makes this more complicated , " he said , referring particularly to plans for a new eu constitution . " the first urgent task is to free europe from its current paralysis . " as for merkel , she sees sarkozy as a key partner in her plan to get the eu constitution process going again at the eu summit in june . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vowing change , sarkozy succeeds chirac as french president nicolas sarkozy took over as french president from jacques chirac on wednesday , vowing to usher in a period of deep reforms to help his country adapt to a fast-changing world .

" dorn should rather read the constitution and what it says on journalists ' access to information , " stefan batorowski from the polish journalists association told polish media . government will continue its efforts polish journalists have been feeling increased government pressure to toe the official line .
all of the country 's journalists were to be screened as part of the government 's controversial vetting law , which it said was aimed at purging public life of ex-communist agents .
but last week , the constitutional court threw a spanner in the works . the judges ruled that most of the government 's planned law was unconstitutional .
it would have required some 700,000 poles to file statements saying whether they had collaborated with the communist-era secret police . those affected included practically all of the country 's intellectuals and included journalists , managers of listed state-owned firms and principals of private schools . people who failed to comply risked losing their jobs and a 10-year professional ban .
the legislation had been an extension of a decade-old vetting law that previously applied to only 30,000 lawmakers , government ministers and judges . while the government grudgingly accepted the court 's decision , formalizing it on tuesday , the battle is n't over . prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , the twin brother of president lech kaczynski , said work was to begin on a new law designed to purge communists from public life .
new legislation would be in accordance with the constitution , he said . clearer international communication is necessary the kaczynski twins have made it clear in their governing style that they want to centralize power .
as a result , some observers have asked why there is n't more of an outcry in the eu regarding legislation such as the vetting law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are the minds of polish intellectuals being x-rayed ?

" when it is apparent that coming to terms with the past is being politically exploited , " then better international communication is needed , bastos said .

" they really shot themselves in the foot with austria , " kurpas said .

a statement by the police said el-masri was " under urgent suspicions of setting fire " at the entrance of a wholesale market after having destroyed the glass door .
a judge ordered that el-masri be held in the psychiatric ward of a local hospital pending investigations into the blaze , which caused damage worth 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 675,000 -rrb- . masri 's lawyer , manfred gnjidic , said thursday that his client 's act had been a gesture of despair after a dispute with the store concerned had got out of hand .
he said masri had still not received proper psychological counselling for the torture he said he had suffered .
suspect says he was tortured by cia el-masri claims he was mistakenly identified as an associate of the sept .

he made headlines when it emerged he was flown to a cia-run prison known as the " salt pit " in afghanistan where he was secretly detained for five months and tortured .
he was released in late may 2004 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cia extraordinary renditions caused an uproar in european countries german prosecutors are seeking to bring 13 cia workers in the us to justice for the abduction .
interpol issued warrants for 10 of the agents , accusing them of abduction and causing serious bodily harm .
masri 's lawyers say he was an innocent victim of the cia practice of the " extraordinary rendition " of terrorism suspects that has caused intense controversy in several european countries .
he had filed a suit in the united states against his detention but it was rejected by an appeals court on the grounds that events linked to the case were a state secret . court says spying was unlawful this week , germany 's highest court ruled that el-masri 's phone was tapped unlawfully by german authorities .
in jan , 2006 , a munich district court secretly approved a request by investigators that telephones , faxes and mobile phone calls to and from el-masri and his lawyer should be monitored in an effort to uncover the identity of his kidnappers .
the munich court justified its approval on the grounds that a phone tap would help authorities gather information on the identities of the 13 people suspected of kidnapping him .
" the likelihood that the complainant would be contacted by those responsible was so minimal from the start that the chances that the measures would be successful were disproportionate to the severity of the tapping , " the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier : cia arrest warrants wo n't hurt german-us ties warrants issued by a german court for 13 suspected cia operatives linked to the abduction of a german citizen will not harm relations , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier was quoted as saying on saturday .

but so far , criticism has been faint . the organization " reporters without borders " ranks poland 58th in its press freedom index of 168 countries .
among the 27 eu member states , it holds the lowest position . the group said it has observed a strong increase in censorship by poland 's conservative government .
the latest attempt involves plans announced earlier this month by the parliament 's new speaker , ludwik dorn , to classify parliamentary journalists .
under the system , certain groups of journalists would have certain reporting privileges and access to politicians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslaw kaczynski , here with german chancellor angela merkel , has n't given up yet dorn , a key ally of poland 's ruling kaczynski twins , said the division would better organize parliamentary work and " avert chaos . "
yet polish journalists disagreed . " dorn should rather read the constitution and what it says on journalists ' access to information , " stefan batorowski from the polish journalists association told polish media . government will continue its efforts polish journalists have been feeling increased government pressure to toe the official line .
all of the country 's journalists were to be screened as part of the government 's controversial vetting law , which it said was aimed at purging public life of ex-communist agents .
but last week , the constitutional court threw a spanner in the works . the judges ruled that most of the government 's planned law was unconstitutional .
it would have required some 700,000 poles to file statements saying whether they had collaborated with the communist-era secret police . those affected included practically all of the country 's intellectuals and included journalists , managers of listed state-owned firms and principals of private schools . people who failed to comply risked losing their jobs and a 10-year professional ban .
the legislation had been an extension of a decade-old vetting law that previously applied to only 30,000 lawmakers , government ministers and judges . while the government grudgingly accepted the court 's decision , formalizing it on tuesday , the battle is n't over . prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , the twin brother of president lech kaczynski , said work was to begin on a new law designed to purge communists from public life .
new legislation would be in accordance with the constitution , he said . clearer international communication is necessary the kaczynski twins have made it clear in their governing style that they want to centralize power .
as a result , some observers have asked why there is n't more of an outcry in the eu regarding legislation such as the vetting law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are the minds of polish intellectuals being x-rayed ?
" of course , every country has the legal and political right to regulate domestic policies themselves , " said stephen bastos from the german council on foreign relations in berlin . but , bastos said , this case was different . " when it is apparent that coming to terms with the past is being politically exploited , " then better international communication is needed , bastos said .
" this is to a large degree the case here . " eu criticism has not been successful in the past yet the eu is reserved .
after all , it has burned its fingers in the past for criticizing a member state 's domestic affairs , said sebastian kurpas from the center for european policy studies in brussels . back in 2000 , for example , eu member states threatened to cut all official ties to austria if the conservative people 's party -lrb- övp -rrb- formed a coalition government with the far-right freedom party -lrb- fpö -rrb- . " they really shot themselves in the foot with austria , " kurpas said .
the övp-fpö coalition government took office and after a few months of chilly diplomatic relations , things returned to normal . " the experience with austria really backfired and showed what limited possibilities exist , " kurpas said . in poland , a feeling of ' we 're doing fine ' even in poland there has been noticeably little resistance to the kaczynski government 's policies . " there are no protests , though there is a massive polarization among the population , " said bastos .
yet effective political opposition was lacking , he said . " also , the economy is going doing relatively well and the national rhetoric is leaving the economy alone , " bastos said .
a feeling of " we 're doing fine " existed among the people , he added . on an eu level , the bloc does n't need any bad blood with poland either . " there are enough problems right now in terms of the european constitution , as well as strained relations to russia to deal with , " kurpas said . germany , which holds the rotating eu presidency , needs poland on its side at the european council meeting in brussels in june . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , russia play down differences , but hurdles remain german foreign minister steinmeier met russian president putin on tuesday in a last-ditch bid to rescue a looming eu-russia summit amid spiraling tensions over a host of issues .

" the european union is a union of 27 member states and we take decisions based on solidarity .
i came here of course with this spirit of defending european interests in that sense of solidarity , " barroso said .
speaking to reporters after his arrival in samara , a regional centre , he said he would hold " a frank and open discussion " with putin at the summit but did not expect any breakthroughs .
" i am not expecting , honestly , anything spectacular from this meeting , " barroso said . merkel also called for dialogue with moscow , saying ahead of the talks : " russia and the european union are interdependent .
it 's always good to speak to each other rather than talking about each other . "
the summit 's main consultations were set for friday at the volzhsky utyos -lrb- volga cliff -rrb- resort complex , southeast of moscow , but the agenda was limited because of ongoing diplomatic and trade disputes .
" a difficult time " " this summit is taking place at a difficult time , " a german government official told reporters in berlin this week .
" but if we want a strategic partnership with russia it 's important that we talk even during difficult times . "
even if there is no narrowing of differences , both sides will get a better idea of each other 's positions , he said .
eu officials said talks would touch on international issues such as the future status of kosovo and iran 's nuclear programme , as well as russia 's bid to join the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- this year .
but negotiations on a key partnership agreement that governs eu-russia relations , including in the vitally important energy sphere , have been held up because of a trade row between eu member poland and russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland and russia are locked in a row over polish meat imports " eu members understand us .
so , in a sense , there is a situation of crisis in relations between the eu and russia , " polish foreign minister anna fotyga said thursday in an interview with polish public television .
poland has warned it will maintain a veto on talks unless moscow lifts a ban on meat imports from poland and eu members form a united front on the issue of energy security .
russia has accused poland of holding eu-russia relations " hostage . "
russia 's wto bid the row with poland and a bitter war of words with estonia over a soviet memorial in tallinn have highlighted still-tense relations between moscow and formerly soviet-dominated central europe .
after a recent blockade of the estonian embassy in moscow , and violent scenes at a news conference given by the estonian ambassador , the european commission has urged russia to observe un conventions on protection of diplomats .
russia has suggested it wants to deal only with more established eu states , sparking angry responses from eu officials , who have vowed unity in the face of pressure from russia .
eu leaders have also voiced concern about europe 's rapidly growing reliance on russian oil and gas imports at a time when russia is becoming an increasingly assertive energy power .
there are other items on the summit agenda that could spark controversy .
the european union has supported russia 's bid to join the world trade union as soon as possible but has said that it could withhold final approval until eu-russia trade tariff rows are resolved .
putin has set early wto accession as a key goal for his presidency .
a draft document seen by afp said eu leaders should " make clear that the eu is ready to support early conclusion of russia 's wto accession but not at any price . "
missile defense , democratic freedoms russia has also contributed to the tense mood of the summit with its ongoing row with the us over plans to station elements of a planned missile defense system in poland and the czech republic .
moscow has threatened to tear up a key arms limitation pact if washington goes ahead with those plans .
eu leaders also said they wanted to discuss democratic freedoms in russia , which have come under scrutiny amid a crackdown on opposition protests ahead of presidential elections next year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a russian crackdown on opposition protests last month sparked major criticism an anti-kremlin group , the other russia , is due to hold a protest rally in samara on friday .

meanwhile , hundreds of pro-kremlin activists also prepared to rally in samara on friday against estonia 's decision to move a controversial soviet war monument last month .

but so far , criticism has been faint . the organization " reporters without borders " ranks poland 58th in its press freedom index of 168 countries .
among the 27 eu member states , it holds the lowest position . the group said it has observed a strong increase in censorship by poland 's conservative government .
the latest attempt involves plans announced earlier this month by the parliament 's new speaker , ludwik dorn , to classify parliamentary journalists .
under the system , certain groups of journalists would have certain reporting privileges and access to politicians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslaw kaczynski , here with german chancellor angela merkel , has n't given up yet dorn , a key ally of poland 's ruling kaczynski twins , said the division would better organize parliamentary work and " avert chaos . "
yet polish journalists disagreed . " dorn should rather read the constitution and what it says on journalists ' access to information , " stefan batorowski from the polish journalists association told polish media . government will continue its efforts polish journalists have been feeling increased government pressure to toe the official line .
all of the country 's journalists were to be screened as part of the government 's controversial vetting law , which it said was aimed at purging public life of ex-communist agents .
but last week , the constitutional court threw a spanner in the works . the judges ruled that most of the government 's planned law was unconstitutional .
it would have required some 700,000 poles to file statements saying whether they had collaborated with the communist-era secret police . those affected included practically all of the country 's intellectuals and included journalists , managers of listed state-owned firms and principals of private schools . people who failed to comply risked losing their jobs and a 10-year professional ban .
the legislation had been an extension of a decade-old vetting law that previously applied to only 30,000 lawmakers , government ministers and judges . while the government grudgingly accepted the court 's decision , formalizing it on tuesday , the battle is n't over . prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , the twin brother of president lech kaczynski , said work was to begin on a new law designed to purge communists from public life .
new legislation would be in accordance with the constitution , he said . clearer international communication is necessary the kaczynski twins have made it clear in their governing style that they want to centralize power .
as a result , some observers have asked why there is n't more of an outcry in the eu regarding legislation such as the vetting law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are the minds of polish intellectuals being x-rayed ?
" of course , every country has the legal and political right to regulate domestic policies themselves , " said stephen bastos from the german council on foreign relations in berlin . but , bastos said , this case was different . " when it is apparent that coming to terms with the past is being politically exploited , " then better international communication is needed , bastos said .
" this is to a large degree the case here . " eu criticism has not been successful in the past yet the eu is reserved .
after all , it has burned its fingers in the past for criticizing a member state 's domestic affairs , said sebastian kurpas from the center for european policy studies in brussels . back in 2000 , for example , eu member states threatened to cut all official ties to austria if the conservative people 's party -lrb- övp -rrb- formed a coalition government with the far-right freedom party -lrb- fpö -rrb- . " they really shot themselves in the foot with austria , " kurpas said .
the övp-fpö coalition government took office and after a few months of chilly diplomatic relations , things returned to normal . " the experience with austria really backfired and showed what limited possibilities exist , " kurpas said . in poland , a feeling of ' we 're doing fine ' even in poland there has been noticeably little resistance to the kaczynski government 's policies . " there are no protests , though there is a massive polarization among the population , " said bastos .
yet effective political opposition was lacking , he said . " also , the economy is going doing relatively well and the national rhetoric is leaving the economy alone , " bastos said .
a feeling of " we 're doing fine " existed among the people , he added . on an eu level , the bloc does n't need any bad blood with poland either .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 17.05.2007 opinion : united nations of democracies and dictatorships ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the increasing role of non-democracies in key un bodies lead observers to wonder how the un can live up to its ideals .
the us and the eu should turn to the old-fashioned tools of diplomacy , argues thorsten benner . last friday , the un commission on sustainable development -lrb- csd -rrb- elected zimbabwe as its next chair .
much to their chagrin , eu countries , the us and canada were outvoted in their opposition against installing mugabe 's repressive regime as chair of this major -lrb- even though for the most part dysfunctional -rrb- un body .
the uk representative emphasized that for zimbabwe to chair the " commission , while -lsb- mugabe 's -rsb- own people suffer the appalling consequences of -lsb- zimbabwe 's -rsb- government policies , is wholly inconsistent with the commission 's aims .
it damages the credibility of the commission itself and its ability to deal with issues affecting the livelihoods of millions from the poorest countries . "
this thursday , belarus , egypt and angola seek membership of the un human rights council .
all three hardly live up to the criteria set out for membership in the new un human rights body : " contribution to the promotion and protection of human rights and -lsb- its -rsb- voluntary pledges and commitments made thereto . "
maintain the status quo ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thorsten benner what strategy should democracies choose with regard to the role of dictatorships in un bodies ?
" simply accept it as a fact of life " is the first option recommended by many , especially the members of the group of 77 -lrb- g77 -rrb- developing country bloc at the un .
sudan 's un ambassador abdalmahmood abdalhaleem , for example , argues that it is the " right of regional groups to choose whoever they want . "
he can refer to the un charter to support his point .
the charter states prominently that the un " is based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its members . "
democracy at the un means " one country , one vote . "
it is not for others to question how sovereign members exercise their right to vote .
case closed .
a second option is based on the exact opposite view .
it argues that the role of dictatorships undermines the credibility and effectiveness of the un so that it is necessary to create alternatives .
introduce a " democracies only " club ?
us senator and presidential candidate john mccain advocates " bringing democratic peoples and nations from around the world into one common organization , a worldwide league of democracies . -lrb- … -rrb- the new league of democracies would form the core of an international order of peace based on freedom .
it could act where the un fails to act , to relieve human suffering in places like darfur . "
both options - accepting the status quo and creating a new " democracies only " club outside the un - are short-sighted .
simply acquiescing to the prominent role of dictatorships in un bodies threatens to further undermine the standing of the united nations in key countries that account for the vast majority of contributions to the un budget , especially the us .
it also undermines the credibility of the un as a whole to stand up for the ideals enshrined in its charter .
forming a " league of democracies " outside the un throws the baby out with the bathwater .
a world organization of only democracies could not supplant the united nations .
this would amount to the same as restricting diplomacy to friendly and like-minded countries , while missing out on the very essence of the business of diplomacy .
old-fashioned tools we need an alternative strategy within the un to further human rights and democracy .
first of all , democracies need to use the old-fashioned tools of diplomacy to reverse the trend of the increasing prominence of dictatorships in un bodies .
the eu and the us in particular should use the powers of moral suasion as well as hard economic and political incentives to ease individual developing countries out of the block of irresponsible voters .
there is no inevitability for countries such as south africa or argentina to side with serial human rights abusers .
while engaging in diplomacy , the us , the eu and other democracies should be respectful in demeanour and firm on principles .
they should make it clear that they are not willing to tolerate serial abuses of the goals of the un on human rights .
the german foreign minister did exactly that earlier this year in his address to the un human rights council on behalf of the eu .
he argued that " it is not acceptable that very serious human rights violations are not addressed - or are not addressed with the necessary directness - because regional or ideological solidarity takes precedence over the willingness to see critical situations without bias . "
aiming for a " community of democracies " establishing a " democracy caucus " within the un would be another important element of a winning strategy .
a democracy caucus would offer a complement to regional and other blocs within the un for cooperation on resolutions and initiatives .
this democracy caucus could also contribute to moving away from the confrontation between the " west vs. the rest " that currently poisons the atmosphere at the un .
major members of the g-77 developing country bloc , such as india , would also be members of the democracy caucus .
this caucus could further a better understanding of what democracy is all about . when confronted with the opposition to his candidacy , the newly elected zimbabwean chair of the csd said that critics had the " right to their opinions . "
he added that " at the end of the day the majority rules as democracy does . "
once a vast majority of un members understands that this misses the very essence of liberal democracy we will have come a long way in living up to the ideals of the un .
as former un secretary-general kofi annan pointed out , " when the united nations can truly call itself a community of democracies , the charter 's noble ideals of protecting human rights and promoting ' social progress in larger freedoms ' will have been brought much closer . "

fillon , a 53-year-old senator from the ruling ump party who worked closely with sarkozy on his election campaign , has crucial experience in pensions reform which will be a key asset to the new government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing french pm de villepin held the post since 2005 the appointment was announced in a presidential statement a day after sarkozy took over as head of state from jacques chirac .
sarkozy is to announce the rest of his 15-member cabinet lineup on friday . fillon 's predecessor , dominique de villepin , presented his resignation on tuesday to chirac ahead of the handover of power to sarkozy , who has pledged to carry out deep social and economic reform .
fillon made his mark as a reformer as social affairs minister under chirac , from 2002 to 2004 , when he carried out an overhaul of france 's pension system , facing down million-strong street protests . low-key meets high energy ironically , in a book in 2006 , fillon had argued for abolishing the post of premier , while advocating a strong presidential-style of rule .
and during the election campaign , sarkozy himself had said that the premier should only " coordinate the work of the government " and should not share power with the head of state .
sarkozy 's jogging partner throughout the campaign , fillon has a low-key demeanor that is often described as complementary to sarkozy 's hyper-active style . speed was apparently of the essence on wednesday , when sarkozy - in a possibly record-breaking move - landed in berlin for his first official state visit , a mere six hours after he was sworn in to office . ' europe must lose its paralysis ' in berlin , the new french president met with german chancellor angela merkel , to show his support for strong franco-german relations and discuss the possibility of reviving the eu constitution .
french and dutch voters rejected the eu constitution in referendums two years ago .
germany currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : possibly breaking speed records , sarko was in berlin six hours after taking office " europe must be shaken from its paralysis as a matter of urgency , " sarkozy said at a joint press conference with merkel . over a working dinner , sarkozy presented his proposal for a mini-treaty comprising the bare essentials of the failed constitution , to allow the institutions of the 27-nation bloc to function fully . sarkozy stressed the importance of maintaining and strengthening the relationship between germany and france , whose partnership is often described as the driving force behind the eu . ' sacred ' friendship " i want to say to the german people that the friendship between france and germany is sacred and that nothing can call it into doubt , " he said . for her part , merkel thanked sarkozy for his speedy visit .
the gesture made it clear how much the two countries need one another , she said . sarkozy said he thinks it is crucial to attack europe 's problems as quickly as possible . " waiting too long just makes this more complicated , " he said , referring particularly to plans for a new eu constitution . " the first urgent task is to free europe from its current paralysis . " as for merkel , she sees sarkozy as a key partner in her plan to get the eu constitution process going again at the eu summit in june . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vowing change , sarkozy succeeds chirac as french president nicolas sarkozy took over as french president from jacques chirac on wednesday , vowing to usher in a period of deep reforms to help his country adapt to a fast-changing world .

but can the dresden music festival be spared from the curse of mediocrity ? now in its 30th season , the dresden music festival opens on thursday .
over the two weeks , a host of internationally acclaimed performers - including pianist alfred brendel , cellist heinrich schiff and violinist gidon kremer - are set to make appearances in the eastern german city .
the festival will start with a sing-along performance , as it does each year .
this year it will be joseph haydn 's " four seasons " oratorio . it will also feature a wide range of events on its program including musical theater , dance , jazz , film , literature and visual arts .
despite the star power on this year 's program , the festival has seen better days .
" the most visited classical music festival in germany is dropping into the middle class , " festival director hartmut haenchen said in an interview with german news agency dpa .
the city of dresden has cut the festival budget by 30 percent , forcing organizers to slim down the program to 64 events - compared to 108 in 2006 .
endangered landscapes this year 's festival revolves around the theme of " landscapes . "
expert-led excursions are on offer , including a trip into dresden 's own natural landscape , the unesco protected elbe valley .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the elbe valley was added to the unesco list in 2004 the area is currently in danger of losing its status on the list of unesco world heritage sites due to a controversial bridge being built across the valley .
the bridge had been approved by a local referendum in 2005 , but unesco said it would consider removing dresden from its list of 830 world heritage sites because the modern construction would have " a serious impact on the integrity of the landscape " of the city . city leaders in saxony 's capital tried to back-pedal on the bridge project , but their efforts were stalled by a court decision upholding the plebiscite .
" it irritates me that politicians think so short-term , " haenchen said about the 106 million euro -lrb- $ 203 million -rrb- bridge project .
many believe that dresden - being known internationally as a city of culture - should invest more in the festival .
" the city has enough bridges , " wrote german web site klassik.com in the aftermath of the 2006 festival .
gdr 's most prestigious classical festival bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renowned pianist alfred brendel will perform works from 19th century vienna founded in 1978 by east germany 's communist party , the dresden music festival became the gdr 's most prestigious classical festival and attracted a great deal of attention from abroad .
world-class soloists like marilyn horne and dietrich fischer-diskau as well as top conductors like claudio abbado and zubin mehta came to the elbe river city to share their talents .
after germany 's reunification , the dresden music festival continued to prosper , peaking in 2003 with a record 150,000 visitors .
some 140,000 music lovers attended the event last year , but haenchen said he fears the number could drop to as few as 70,000 attendees this year .

a statement by the police said el-masri was " under urgent suspicions of setting fire " at the entrance of a wholesale market after having destroyed the glass door .
a judge ordered that el-masri be held in the psychiatric ward of a local hospital pending investigations into the blaze , which caused damage worth 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 675,000 -rrb- . masri 's lawyer , manfred gnjidic , said thursday that his client 's act had been a gesture of despair after a dispute with the store concerned had got out of hand .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cia extraordinary renditions caused an uproar in european countries german prosecutors are seeking to bring 13 cia workers in the us to justice for the abduction .
interpol issued warrants for 10 of the agents , accusing them of abduction and causing serious bodily harm .
masri 's lawyers say he was an innocent victim of the cia practice of the " extraordinary rendition " of terrorism suspects that has caused intense controversy in several european countries .
he had filed a suit in the united states against his detention but it was rejected by an appeals court on the grounds that events linked to the case were a state secret . court says spying was unlawful this week , germany 's highest court ruled that el-masri 's phone was tapped unlawfully by german authorities .
in jan , 2006 , a munich district court secretly approved a request by investigators that telephones , faxes and mobile phone calls to and from el-masri and his lawyer should be monitored in an effort to uncover the identity of his kidnappers .
the munich court justified its approval on the grounds that a phone tap would help authorities gather information on the identities of the 13 people suspected of kidnapping him .
" the likelihood that the complainant would be contacted by those responsible was so minimal from the start that the chances that the measures would be successful were disproportionate to the severity of the tapping , " the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier : cia arrest warrants wo n't hurt german-us ties warrants issued by a german court for 13 suspected cia operatives linked to the abduction of a german citizen will not harm relations , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier was quoted as saying on saturday .

but can the dresden music festival be spared from the curse of mediocrity ? now in its 30th season , the dresden music festival opens on thursday .
over the two weeks , a host of internationally acclaimed performers - including pianist alfred brendel , cellist heinrich schiff and violinist gidon kremer - are set to make appearances in the eastern german city .
the festival will start with a sing-along performance , as it does each year .
this year it will be joseph haydn 's " four seasons " oratorio . it will also feature a wide range of events on its program including musical theater , dance , jazz , film , literature and visual arts .
despite the star power on this year 's program , the festival has seen better days .
" the most visited classical music festival in germany is dropping into the middle class , " festival director hartmut haenchen said in an interview with german news agency dpa .

the bridge had been approved by a local referendum in 2005 , but unesco said it would consider removing dresden from its list of 830 world heritage sites because the modern construction would have " a serious impact on the integrity of the landscape " of the city . city leaders in saxony 's capital tried to back-pedal on the bridge project , but their efforts were stalled by a court decision upholding the plebiscite .
" it irritates me that politicians think so short-term , " haenchen said about the 106 million euro -lrb- $ 203 million -rrb- bridge project .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 17.05.2007 eu , public shrug as poland keeps trying to curb journalists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the polish government is keeping a close eye on the country 's media poland 's intellectuals are feeling the heat as the government vows to push through a controversial new law designed to purge communists from public life .
but so far , criticism has been faint . the organization " reporters without borders " ranks poland 58th in its press freedom index of 168 countries .
among the 27 eu member states , it holds the lowest position . the group said it has observed a strong increase in censorship by poland 's conservative government .
the latest attempt involves plans announced earlier this month by the parliament 's new speaker , ludwik dorn , to classify parliamentary journalists .
under the system , certain groups of journalists would have certain reporting privileges and access to politicians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslaw kaczynski , here with german chancellor angela merkel , has n't given up yet dorn , a key ally of poland 's ruling kaczynski twins , said the division would better organize parliamentary work and " avert chaos . "
yet polish journalists disagreed . " dorn should rather read the constitution and what it says on journalists ' access to information , " stefan batorowski from the polish journalists association told polish media . government will continue its efforts polish journalists have been feeling increased government pressure to toe the official line .
all of the country 's journalists were to be screened as part of the government 's controversial vetting law , which it said was aimed at purging public life of ex-communist agents .
but last week , the constitutional court threw a spanner in the works . the judges ruled that most of the government 's planned law was unconstitutional .
it would have required some 700,000 poles to file statements saying whether they had collaborated with the communist-era secret police . those affected included practically all of the country 's intellectuals and included journalists , managers of listed state-owned firms and principals of private schools . people who failed to comply risked losing their jobs and a 10-year professional ban .
the legislation had been an extension of a decade-old vetting law that previously applied to only 30,000 lawmakers , government ministers and judges . while the government grudgingly accepted the court 's decision , formalizing it on tuesday , the battle is n't over . prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , the twin brother of president lech kaczynski , said work was to begin on a new law designed to purge communists from public life .
new legislation would be in accordance with the constitution , he said . clearer international communication is necessary the kaczynski twins have made it clear in their governing style that they want to centralize power .
as a result , some observers have asked why there is n't more of an outcry in the eu regarding legislation such as the vetting law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are the minds of polish intellectuals being x-rayed ?
" of course , every country has the legal and political right to regulate domestic policies themselves , " said stephen bastos from the german council on foreign relations in berlin . but , bastos said , this case was different . " when it is apparent that coming to terms with the past is being politically exploited , " then better international communication is needed , bastos said .
" this is to a large degree the case here . " eu criticism has not been successful in the past yet the eu is reserved .
after all , it has burned its fingers in the past for criticizing a member state 's domestic affairs , said sebastian kurpas from the center for european policy studies in brussels . back in 2000 , for example , eu member states threatened to cut all official ties to austria if the conservative people 's party -lrb- övp -rrb- formed a coalition government with the far-right freedom party -lrb- fpö -rrb- . " they really shot themselves in the foot with austria , " kurpas said .
the övp-fpö coalition government took office and after a few months of chilly diplomatic relations , things returned to normal . " the experience with austria really backfired and showed what limited possibilities exist , " kurpas said . in poland , a feeling of ' we 're doing fine ' even in poland there has been noticeably little resistance to the kaczynski government 's policies . " there are no protests , though there is a massive polarization among the population , " said bastos .
yet effective political opposition was lacking , he said . " also , the economy is going doing relatively well and the national rhetoric is leaving the economy alone , " bastos said .
a feeling of " we 're doing fine " existed among the people , he added . on an eu level , the bloc does n't need any bad blood with poland either . " there are enough problems right now in terms of the european constitution , as well as strained relations to russia to deal with , " kurpas said . germany , which holds the rotating eu presidency , needs poland on its side at the european council meeting in brussels in june . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , russia play down differences , but hurdles remain german foreign minister steinmeier met russian president putin on tuesday in a last-ditch bid to rescue a looming eu-russia summit amid spiraling tensions over a host of issues .
-lrb- 15.05.2007 -rrb- communist screening law divides polish society poland 's new lustration law has split the country .
it requires more than 700,000 poles to confess as to whether they were communist spies .

critics have dubbed it a political tool .
-lrb- 15.04.2007 -rrb- poland cracks down on liberal media a group of polish journalists are refusing to be screened by the government .
they say authorities are using a recently passed vetting law to hit back against the liberal opposition and conduct a witch hunt in the media .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the elbe valley was added to the unesco list in 2004 the area is currently in danger of losing its status on the list of unesco world heritage sites due to a controversial bridge being built across the valley .
the bridge had been approved by a local referendum in 2005 , but unesco said it would consider removing dresden from its list of 830 world heritage sites because the modern construction would have " a serious impact on the integrity of the landscape " of the city . city leaders in saxony 's capital tried to back-pedal on the bridge project , but their efforts were stalled by a court decision upholding the plebiscite .
" it irritates me that politicians think so short-term , " haenchen said about the 106 million euro -lrb- $ 203 million -rrb- bridge project .
many believe that dresden - being known internationally as a city of culture - should invest more in the festival .
" the city has enough bridges , " wrote german web site klassik.com in the aftermath of the 2006 festival .

world-class soloists like marilyn horne and dietrich fischer-diskau as well as top conductors like claudio abbado and zubin mehta came to the elbe river city to share their talents .
after germany 's reunification , the dresden music festival continued to prosper , peaking in 2003 with a record 150,000 visitors .
some 140,000 music lovers attended the event last year , but haenchen said he fears the number could drop to as few as 70,000 attendees this year .

" the european union is a union of 27 member states and we take decisions based on solidarity .
i came here of course with this spirit of defending european interests in that sense of solidarity , " barroso said .
speaking to reporters after his arrival in samara , a regional centre , he said he would hold " a frank and open discussion " with putin at the summit but did not expect any breakthroughs .
" i am not expecting , honestly , anything spectacular from this meeting , " barroso said . merkel also called for dialogue with moscow , saying ahead of the talks : " russia and the european union are interdependent .
it 's always good to speak to each other rather than talking about each other . "
the summit 's main consultations were set for friday at the volzhsky utyos -lrb- volga cliff -rrb- resort complex , southeast of moscow , but the agenda was limited because of ongoing diplomatic and trade disputes .
" a difficult time " " this summit is taking place at a difficult time , " a german government official told reporters in berlin this week .
" but if we want a strategic partnership with russia it 's important that we talk even during difficult times . "
even if there is no narrowing of differences , both sides will get a better idea of each other 's positions , he said .
eu officials said talks would touch on international issues such as the future status of kosovo and iran 's nuclear programme , as well as russia 's bid to join the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- this year .
but negotiations on a key partnership agreement that governs eu-russia relations , including in the vitally important energy sphere , have been held up because of a trade row between eu member poland and russia .

after a recent blockade of the estonian embassy in moscow , and violent scenes at a news conference given by the estonian ambassador , the european commission has urged russia to observe un conventions on protection of diplomats .
russia has suggested it wants to deal only with more established eu states , sparking angry responses from eu officials , who have vowed unity in the face of pressure from russia .
eu leaders have also voiced concern about europe 's rapidly growing reliance on russian oil and gas imports at a time when russia is becoming an increasingly assertive energy power .
there are other items on the summit agenda that could spark controversy .
the european union has supported russia 's bid to join the world trade union as soon as possible but has said that it could withhold final approval until eu-russia trade tariff rows are resolved .
putin has set early wto accession as a key goal for his presidency .

with daimlerchrysler in divorce court , can benz make a comeback ? what 's in a name ?
a lot , according to conventional wisdom among corporate ceos .
nearly a decade ago , the highly touted " marriage of equals " between german high-end carmaker daimler-benz and us standard-bearer chrysler nearly ran aground amid disagreement over which of the two partners would get top billing in the corporate identity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car inventor karl benz is not getting his propers , some say daimler won out -lrb- thus the company was called daimlerchrysler , not chryslerdaimler -rrb- .
but in doing so , it sacrificed benz , a part of its identity that goes back to the creation of the firm .
now , some folks are arguing that giving up its heritage - carl benz was the inventor of the first automobile , after all - was a mistake .
with the newly spun-off german arm of daimlerchrysler seeking a revamped corporate identity , a war of words has broken out in the state of baden-württemberg . people from the region of baden - where carl benz was born - are upset that those in stuttgart -lrb- in württemberg , and the town where daimler ag is headquartered -rrb- have gotten all the glory , and are keeping it .
town agitates to revive " benz " " in stuttgart … they should n't forget that it was n't gottlieb daimler , but carl benz who invented the automobile , " a worker at the daimlerchrysler factory in mannheim told dpa news service .
meanwhile , administrators in the town of mannheim -lrb- located in the baden region of baden-württemberg -rrb- are doing their best to encourage daimler ag leader dieter zetsche to reclaim the benz name , the associated press has reported .
" through the planned separation from chrysler , there is a chance to bring the old daimler-benz name back to life , " said a declaration from the local council of mannheim .
and daimler ag headquarters also reported a number of calls of people who wanted to get the benz name back , ap said .
concerns over corporate confusion marina raptis , a spokeswoman for daimler ag , told ap any name change would need to be addressed at an extraordinary general meeting in the autumn .
suggestions would need to be examined with several factors in mind , including property rights and legal and strategic issues , she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gottlieb daimler merged his firm with benz 's in 1926 she noted that the daimler name is well known and serves as an over-arching identity .
names like mercedes-benz ag or daimler-benz ag could mix corporate and product identities , which could harm the company 's position on the product market , raptis argued .
" our suggested and preferred name , daimler ag , attaches us to tradition , but shows a clear direction forward , " raptis said .
the suggested name is not meant to be a slight to benz , she said .
" the history and tradition of our company , as well as the brand mercedes benz will always be tied to carl benz . ...
without carl benz and gottlieb daimler , our company would not exist , " she said .
no one denies that benz 's invention hit the pavement before that of his competitor daimler .
that fact has left some people especially eager to see the name benz back in the company logo .
baden-based politician karl lamers argued that the name benz is the " starting point for today 's international auto concern . "
and the mayor of the city of karlsruhe , heinz fenrich , reminded daimler chief dieter zetsche that benz " got the world on wheels . "
mrs. benz 's famous ride the hybrid name daimler-benz itself came about as a result of an even earlier corporate history of merger and survival .
in 1883 , benz founded the " benz & co .
rhineland gas motor factory " in the town of mannheim .
he patented a single-stroke , four-cylinder engine in january 1886 .
in july of that year , he hooked it to a three-wheel carriage and sent it on its inaugural drive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes-benz is one of the best known brands in the auto industry in a groundbreaking publicity stunt , benz 's wife bertha rode the open-top " benz-patent motor car " to her hometown of pforzheim .
the ride - during which mrs. benz used a hatpin to unplug a clogged gas tube - has become legend .
but business for benz was not especially good , and in 1926 , when worldwide depression threatened the company , it joined up with the daimler motor co. in stuttgart .
at the time of that merger , it was agreed that benz would be in the company name . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : the end of daimler 's " world inc . "

with daimlerchrysler in divorce court , can benz make a comeback ? what 's in a name ?
a lot , according to conventional wisdom among corporate ceos .
nearly a decade ago , the highly touted " marriage of equals " between german high-end carmaker daimler-benz and us standard-bearer chrysler nearly ran aground amid disagreement over which of the two partners would get top billing in the corporate identity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car inventor karl benz is not getting his propers , some say daimler won out -lrb- thus the company was called daimlerchrysler , not chryslerdaimler -rrb- .
but in doing so , it sacrificed benz , a part of its identity that goes back to the creation of the firm .
now , some folks are arguing that giving up its heritage - carl benz was the inventor of the first automobile , after all - was a mistake .
with the newly spun-off german arm of daimlerchrysler seeking a revamped corporate identity , a war of words has broken out in the state of baden-württemberg . people from the region of baden - where carl benz was born - are upset that those in stuttgart -lrb- in württemberg , and the town where daimler ag is headquartered -rrb- have gotten all the glory , and are keeping it .
town agitates to revive " benz " " in stuttgart … they should n't forget that it was n't gottlieb daimler , but carl benz who invented the automobile , " a worker at the daimlerchrysler factory in mannheim told dpa news service .
meanwhile , administrators in the town of mannheim -lrb- located in the baden region of baden-württemberg -rrb- are doing their best to encourage daimler ag leader dieter zetsche to reclaim the benz name , the associated press has reported .
" through the planned separation from chrysler , there is a chance to bring the old daimler-benz name back to life , " said a declaration from the local council of mannheim .
and daimler ag headquarters also reported a number of calls of people who wanted to get the benz name back , ap said .
concerns over corporate confusion marina raptis , a spokeswoman for daimler ag , told ap any name change would need to be addressed at an extraordinary general meeting in the autumn .
suggestions would need to be examined with several factors in mind , including property rights and legal and strategic issues , she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gottlieb daimler merged his firm with benz 's in 1926 she noted that the daimler name is well known and serves as an over-arching identity .
names like mercedes-benz ag or daimler-benz ag could mix corporate and product identities , which could harm the company 's position on the product market , raptis argued .
" our suggested and preferred name , daimler ag , attaches us to tradition , but shows a clear direction forward , " raptis said .
the suggested name is not meant to be a slight to benz , she said .
" the history and tradition of our company , as well as the brand mercedes benz will always be tied to carl benz . ...
without carl benz and gottlieb daimler , our company would not exist , " she said .
no one denies that benz 's invention hit the pavement before that of his competitor daimler .
that fact has left some people especially eager to see the name benz back in the company logo .
baden-based politician karl lamers argued that the name benz is the " starting point for today 's international auto concern . "
and the mayor of the city of karlsruhe , heinz fenrich , reminded daimler chief dieter zetsche that benz " got the world on wheels . "
mrs. benz 's famous ride the hybrid name daimler-benz itself came about as a result of an even earlier corporate history of merger and survival .
in 1883 , benz founded the " benz & co .
rhineland gas motor factory " in the town of mannheim .
he patented a single-stroke , four-cylinder engine in january 1886 .
in july of that year , he hooked it to a three-wheel carriage and sent it on its inaugural drive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes-benz is one of the best known brands in the auto industry in a groundbreaking publicity stunt , benz 's wife bertha rode the open-top " benz-patent motor car " to her hometown of pforzheim .
the ride - during which mrs. benz used a hatpin to unplug a clogged gas tube - has become legend .
but business for benz was not especially good , and in 1926 , when worldwide depression threatened the company , it joined up with the daimler motor co. in stuttgart .
at the time of that merger , it was agreed that benz would be in the company name . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : the end of daimler 's " world inc . "
the nine-year , trans-atlantic marriage of automakers daimler and chrysler has come to an end and it 's probably best that way for all involved , said deutsche welle 's karl zawadzky .

a statement by the police said el-masri was " under urgent suspicions of setting fire " at the entrance of a wholesale market after having destroyed the glass door .
a judge ordered that el-masri be held in the psychiatric ward of a local hospital pending investigations into the blaze , which caused damage worth 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 675,000 -rrb- . masri 's lawyer , manfred gnjidic , said thursday that his client 's act had been a gesture of despair after a dispute with the store concerned had got out of hand .

fillon , a 53-year-old senator from the ruling ump party who worked closely with sarkozy on his election campaign , has crucial experience in pensions reform which will be a key asset to the new government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing french pm de villepin held the post since 2005 the appointment was announced in a presidential statement a day after sarkozy took over as head of state from jacques chirac .
sarkozy is to announce the rest of his 15-member cabinet lineup on friday . fillon 's predecessor , dominique de villepin , presented his resignation on tuesday to chirac ahead of the handover of power to sarkozy , who has pledged to carry out deep social and economic reform .
fillon made his mark as a reformer as social affairs minister under chirac , from 2002 to 2004 , when he carried out an overhaul of france 's pension system , facing down million-strong street protests . low-key meets high energy ironically , in a book in 2006 , fillon had argued for abolishing the post of premier , while advocating a strong presidential-style of rule .
and during the election campaign , sarkozy himself had said that the premier should only " coordinate the work of the government " and should not share power with the head of state .
sarkozy 's jogging partner throughout the campaign , fillon has a low-key demeanor that is often described as complementary to sarkozy 's hyper-active style . speed was apparently of the essence on wednesday , when sarkozy - in a possibly record-breaking move - landed in berlin for his first official state visit , a mere six hours after he was sworn in to office . ' europe must lose its paralysis ' in berlin , the new french president met with german chancellor angela merkel , to show his support for strong franco-german relations and discuss the possibility of reviving the eu constitution .
french and dutch voters rejected the eu constitution in referendums two years ago .
germany currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : possibly breaking speed records , sarko was in berlin six hours after taking office " europe must be shaken from its paralysis as a matter of urgency , " sarkozy said at a joint press conference with merkel . over a working dinner , sarkozy presented his proposal for a mini-treaty comprising the bare essentials of the failed constitution , to allow the institutions of the 27-nation bloc to function fully . sarkozy stressed the importance of maintaining and strengthening the relationship between germany and france , whose partnership is often described as the driving force behind the eu . ' sacred ' friendship " i want to say to the german people that the friendship between france and germany is sacred and that nothing can call it into doubt , " he said . for her part , merkel thanked sarkozy for his speedy visit .
the gesture made it clear how much the two countries need one another , she said . sarkozy said he thinks it is crucial to attack europe 's problems as quickly as possible . " waiting too long just makes this more complicated , " he said , referring particularly to plans for a new eu constitution . " the first urgent task is to free europe from its current paralysis . " as for merkel , she sees sarkozy as a key partner in her plan to get the eu constitution process going again at the eu summit in june . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vowing change , sarkozy succeeds chirac as french president nicolas sarkozy took over as french president from jacques chirac on wednesday , vowing to usher in a period of deep reforms to help his country adapt to a fast-changing world .

a lot , according to conventional wisdom among corporate ceos .
nearly a decade ago , the highly touted " marriage of equals " between german high-end carmaker daimler-benz and us standard-bearer chrysler nearly ran aground amid disagreement over which of the two partners would get top billing in the corporate identity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car inventor karl benz is not getting his propers , some say daimler won out -lrb- thus the company was called daimlerchrysler , not chryslerdaimler -rrb- .
but in doing so , it sacrificed benz , a part of its identity that goes back to the creation of the firm .
now , some folks are arguing that giving up its heritage - carl benz was the inventor of the first automobile , after all - was a mistake .
with the newly spun-off german arm of daimlerchrysler seeking a revamped corporate identity , a war of words has broken out in the state of baden-württemberg . people from the region of baden - where carl benz was born - are upset that those in stuttgart -lrb- in württemberg , and the town where daimler ag is headquartered -rrb- have gotten all the glory , and are keeping it .

meanwhile , administrators in the town of mannheim -lrb- located in the baden region of baden-württemberg -rrb- are doing their best to encourage daimler ag leader dieter zetsche to reclaim the benz name , the associated press has reported .
" through the planned separation from chrysler , there is a chance to bring the old daimler-benz name back to life , " said a declaration from the local council of mannheim .
and daimler ag headquarters also reported a number of calls of people who wanted to get the benz name back , ap said .
concerns over corporate confusion marina raptis , a spokeswoman for daimler ag , told ap any name change would need to be addressed at an extraordinary general meeting in the autumn .

names like mercedes-benz ag or daimler-benz ag could mix corporate and product identities , which could harm the company 's position on the product market , raptis argued .
" our suggested and preferred name , daimler ag , attaches us to tradition , but shows a clear direction forward , " raptis said .
the suggested name is not meant to be a slight to benz , she said .
" the history and tradition of our company , as well as the brand mercedes benz will always be tied to carl benz . ...
without carl benz and gottlieb daimler , our company would not exist , " she said .
no one denies that benz 's invention hit the pavement before that of his competitor daimler .
that fact has left some people especially eager to see the name benz back in the company logo .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 17.05.2007 france 's sarkozy appoints center-right fillon prime minister großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fillon -lrb- left -rrb- , is expected to stand behind sarkozy 's -lrb- right -rrb- plans to reform newly appointed french president nicolas sarkozy named his loyal adviser francois fillon , a reform-minded moderate right-winger , as his prime minister . sarkozy 's first cabinet appointment came as no surprise .
fillon , a 53-year-old senator from the ruling ump party who worked closely with sarkozy on his election campaign , has crucial experience in pensions reform which will be a key asset to the new government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing french pm de villepin held the post since 2005 the appointment was announced in a presidential statement a day after sarkozy took over as head of state from jacques chirac .
sarkozy is to announce the rest of his 15-member cabinet lineup on friday . fillon 's predecessor , dominique de villepin , presented his resignation on tuesday to chirac ahead of the handover of power to sarkozy , who has pledged to carry out deep social and economic reform .
fillon made his mark as a reformer as social affairs minister under chirac , from 2002 to 2004 , when he carried out an overhaul of france 's pension system , facing down million-strong street protests . low-key meets high energy ironically , in a book in 2006 , fillon had argued for abolishing the post of premier , while advocating a strong presidential-style of rule .
and during the election campaign , sarkozy himself had said that the premier should only " coordinate the work of the government " and should not share power with the head of state .
sarkozy 's jogging partner throughout the campaign , fillon has a low-key demeanor that is often described as complementary to sarkozy 's hyper-active style . speed was apparently of the essence on wednesday , when sarkozy - in a possibly record-breaking move - landed in berlin for his first official state visit , a mere six hours after he was sworn in to office . ' europe must lose its paralysis ' in berlin , the new french president met with german chancellor angela merkel , to show his support for strong franco-german relations and discuss the possibility of reviving the eu constitution .
french and dutch voters rejected the eu constitution in referendums two years ago .
germany currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : possibly breaking speed records , sarko was in berlin six hours after taking office " europe must be shaken from its paralysis as a matter of urgency , " sarkozy said at a joint press conference with merkel . over a working dinner , sarkozy presented his proposal for a mini-treaty comprising the bare essentials of the failed constitution , to allow the institutions of the 27-nation bloc to function fully . sarkozy stressed the importance of maintaining and strengthening the relationship between germany and france , whose partnership is often described as the driving force behind the eu . ' sacred ' friendship " i want to say to the german people that the friendship between france and germany is sacred and that nothing can call it into doubt , " he said . for her part , merkel thanked sarkozy for his speedy visit .
the gesture made it clear how much the two countries need one another , she said . sarkozy said he thinks it is crucial to attack europe 's problems as quickly as possible . " waiting too long just makes this more complicated , " he said , referring particularly to plans for a new eu constitution . " the first urgent task is to free europe from its current paralysis . " as for merkel , she sees sarkozy as a key partner in her plan to get the eu constitution process going again at the eu summit in june . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vowing change , sarkozy succeeds chirac as french president nicolas sarkozy took over as french president from jacques chirac on wednesday , vowing to usher in a period of deep reforms to help his country adapt to a fast-changing world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 17.05.2007 france 's sarkozy appoints center-right fillon prime minister großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fillon -lrb- left -rrb- , is expected to stand behind sarkozy 's -lrb- right -rrb- plans to reform newly appointed french president nicolas sarkozy named his loyal adviser francois fillon , a reform-minded moderate right-winger , as his prime minister . sarkozy 's first cabinet appointment came as no surprise .
fillon , a 53-year-old senator from the ruling ump party who worked closely with sarkozy on his election campaign , has crucial experience in pensions reform which will be a key asset to the new government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing french pm de villepin held the post since 2005 the appointment was announced in a presidential statement a day after sarkozy took over as head of state from jacques chirac .
sarkozy is to announce the rest of his 15-member cabinet lineup on friday . fillon 's predecessor , dominique de villepin , presented his resignation on tuesday to chirac ahead of the handover of power to sarkozy , who has pledged to carry out deep social and economic reform .
fillon made his mark as a reformer as social affairs minister under chirac , from 2002 to 2004 , when he carried out an overhaul of france 's pension system , facing down million-strong street protests . low-key meets high energy ironically , in a book in 2006 , fillon had argued for abolishing the post of premier , while advocating a strong presidential-style of rule .
and during the election campaign , sarkozy himself had said that the premier should only " coordinate the work of the government " and should not share power with the head of state .
sarkozy 's jogging partner throughout the campaign , fillon has a low-key demeanor that is often described as complementary to sarkozy 's hyper-active style . speed was apparently of the essence on wednesday , when sarkozy - in a possibly record-breaking move - landed in berlin for his first official state visit , a mere six hours after he was sworn in to office . ' europe must lose its paralysis ' in berlin , the new french president met with german chancellor angela merkel , to show his support for strong franco-german relations and discuss the possibility of reviving the eu constitution .
french and dutch voters rejected the eu constitution in referendums two years ago .
germany currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : possibly breaking speed records , sarko was in berlin six hours after taking office " europe must be shaken from its paralysis as a matter of urgency , " sarkozy said at a joint press conference with merkel . over a working dinner , sarkozy presented his proposal for a mini-treaty comprising the bare essentials of the failed constitution , to allow the institutions of the 27-nation bloc to function fully . sarkozy stressed the importance of maintaining and strengthening the relationship between germany and france , whose partnership is often described as the driving force behind the eu . ' sacred ' friendship " i want to say to the german people that the friendship between france and germany is sacred and that nothing can call it into doubt , " he said . for her part , merkel thanked sarkozy for his speedy visit .
the gesture made it clear how much the two countries need one another , she said . sarkozy said he thinks it is crucial to attack europe 's problems as quickly as possible . " waiting too long just makes this more complicated , " he said , referring particularly to plans for a new eu constitution . " the first urgent task is to free europe from its current paralysis . " as for merkel , she sees sarkozy as a key partner in her plan to get the eu constitution process going again at the eu summit in june . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vowing change , sarkozy succeeds chirac as french president nicolas sarkozy took over as french president from jacques chirac on wednesday , vowing to usher in a period of deep reforms to help his country adapt to a fast-changing world .

" the european union is a union of 27 member states and we take decisions based on solidarity .
i came here of course with this spirit of defending european interests in that sense of solidarity , " barroso said .
speaking to reporters after his arrival in samara , a regional centre , he said he would hold " a frank and open discussion " with putin at the summit but did not expect any breakthroughs .
" i am not expecting , honestly , anything spectacular from this meeting , " barroso said . merkel also called for dialogue with moscow , saying ahead of the talks : " russia and the european union are interdependent .

with daimlerchrysler in divorce court , can benz make a comeback ? what 's in a name ?
a lot , according to conventional wisdom among corporate ceos .
nearly a decade ago , the highly touted " marriage of equals " between german high-end carmaker daimler-benz and us standard-bearer chrysler nearly ran aground amid disagreement over which of the two partners would get top billing in the corporate identity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car inventor karl benz is not getting his propers , some say daimler won out -lrb- thus the company was called daimlerchrysler , not chryslerdaimler -rrb- .
but in doing so , it sacrificed benz , a part of its identity that goes back to the creation of the firm .
now , some folks are arguing that giving up its heritage - carl benz was the inventor of the first automobile , after all - was a mistake .
with the newly spun-off german arm of daimlerchrysler seeking a revamped corporate identity , a war of words has broken out in the state of baden-württemberg . people from the region of baden - where carl benz was born - are upset that those in stuttgart -lrb- in württemberg , and the town where daimler ag is headquartered -rrb- have gotten all the glory , and are keeping it .
town agitates to revive " benz " " in stuttgart … they should n't forget that it was n't gottlieb daimler , but carl benz who invented the automobile , " a worker at the daimlerchrysler factory in mannheim told dpa news service .
meanwhile , administrators in the town of mannheim -lrb- located in the baden region of baden-württemberg -rrb- are doing their best to encourage daimler ag leader dieter zetsche to reclaim the benz name , the associated press has reported .
" through the planned separation from chrysler , there is a chance to bring the old daimler-benz name back to life , " said a declaration from the local council of mannheim .
and daimler ag headquarters also reported a number of calls of people who wanted to get the benz name back , ap said .
concerns over corporate confusion marina raptis , a spokeswoman for daimler ag , told ap any name change would need to be addressed at an extraordinary general meeting in the autumn .
suggestions would need to be examined with several factors in mind , including property rights and legal and strategic issues , she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gottlieb daimler merged his firm with benz 's in 1926 she noted that the daimler name is well known and serves as an over-arching identity .
names like mercedes-benz ag or daimler-benz ag could mix corporate and product identities , which could harm the company 's position on the product market , raptis argued .
" our suggested and preferred name , daimler ag , attaches us to tradition , but shows a clear direction forward , " raptis said .
the suggested name is not meant to be a slight to benz , she said .
" the history and tradition of our company , as well as the brand mercedes benz will always be tied to carl benz . ...
without carl benz and gottlieb daimler , our company would not exist , " she said .
no one denies that benz 's invention hit the pavement before that of his competitor daimler .
that fact has left some people especially eager to see the name benz back in the company logo .
baden-based politician karl lamers argued that the name benz is the " starting point for today 's international auto concern . "
and the mayor of the city of karlsruhe , heinz fenrich , reminded daimler chief dieter zetsche that benz " got the world on wheels . "
mrs. benz 's famous ride the hybrid name daimler-benz itself came about as a result of an even earlier corporate history of merger and survival .
in 1883 , benz founded the " benz & co .
rhineland gas motor factory " in the town of mannheim .
he patented a single-stroke , four-cylinder engine in january 1886 .
in july of that year , he hooked it to a three-wheel carriage and sent it on its inaugural drive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes-benz is one of the best known brands in the auto industry in a groundbreaking publicity stunt , benz 's wife bertha rode the open-top " benz-patent motor car " to her hometown of pforzheim .
the ride - during which mrs. benz used a hatpin to unplug a clogged gas tube - has become legend .
but business for benz was not especially good , and in 1926 , when worldwide depression threatened the company , it joined up with the daimler motor co. in stuttgart .
at the time of that merger , it was agreed that benz would be in the company name . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : the end of daimler 's " world inc . "

' sacred ' friendship " i want to say to the german people that the friendship between france and germany is sacred and that nothing can call it into doubt , " he said . for her part , merkel thanked sarkozy for his speedy visit .
the gesture made it clear how much the two countries need one another , she said . sarkozy said he thinks it is crucial to attack europe 's problems as quickly as possible . " waiting too long just makes this more complicated , " he said , referring particularly to plans for a new eu constitution . " the first urgent task is to free europe from its current paralysis .

fillon , a 53-year-old senator from the ruling ump party who worked closely with sarkozy on his election campaign , has crucial experience in pensions reform which will be a key asset to the new government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing french pm de villepin held the post since 2005 the appointment was announced in a presidential statement a day after sarkozy took over as head of state from jacques chirac .
sarkozy is to announce the rest of his 15-member cabinet lineup on friday . fillon 's predecessor , dominique de villepin , presented his resignation on tuesday to chirac ahead of the handover of power to sarkozy , who has pledged to carry out deep social and economic reform .
fillon made his mark as a reformer as social affairs minister under chirac , from 2002 to 2004 , when he carried out an overhaul of france 's pension system , facing down million-strong street protests . low-key meets high energy ironically , in a book in 2006 , fillon had argued for abolishing the post of premier , while advocating a strong presidential-style of rule .
and during the election campaign , sarkozy himself had said that the premier should only " coordinate the work of the government " and should not share power with the head of state .
sarkozy 's jogging partner throughout the campaign , fillon has a low-key demeanor that is often described as complementary to sarkozy 's hyper-active style . speed was apparently of the essence on wednesday , when sarkozy - in a possibly record-breaking move - landed in berlin for his first official state visit , a mere six hours after he was sworn in to office . ' europe must lose its paralysis ' in berlin , the new french president met with german chancellor angela merkel , to show his support for strong franco-german relations and discuss the possibility of reviving the eu constitution .

" the european union is a union of 27 member states and we take decisions based on solidarity .
i came here of course with this spirit of defending european interests in that sense of solidarity , " barroso said .
speaking to reporters after his arrival in samara , a regional centre , he said he would hold " a frank and open discussion " with putin at the summit but did not expect any breakthroughs .
" i am not expecting , honestly , anything spectacular from this meeting , " barroso said . merkel also called for dialogue with moscow , saying ahead of the talks : " russia and the european union are interdependent .
it 's always good to speak to each other rather than talking about each other . "
the summit 's main consultations were set for friday at the volzhsky utyos -lrb- volga cliff -rrb- resort complex , southeast of moscow , but the agenda was limited because of ongoing diplomatic and trade disputes .
" a difficult time " " this summit is taking place at a difficult time , " a german government official told reporters in berlin this week .
" but if we want a strategic partnership with russia it 's important that we talk even during difficult times . "
even if there is no narrowing of differences , both sides will get a better idea of each other 's positions , he said .
eu officials said talks would touch on international issues such as the future status of kosovo and iran 's nuclear programme , as well as russia 's bid to join the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- this year .
but negotiations on a key partnership agreement that governs eu-russia relations , including in the vitally important energy sphere , have been held up because of a trade row between eu member poland and russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland and russia are locked in a row over polish meat imports " eu members understand us .
so , in a sense , there is a situation of crisis in relations between the eu and russia , " polish foreign minister anna fotyga said thursday in an interview with polish public television .
poland has warned it will maintain a veto on talks unless moscow lifts a ban on meat imports from poland and eu members form a united front on the issue of energy security .
russia has accused poland of holding eu-russia relations " hostage . "
russia 's wto bid the row with poland and a bitter war of words with estonia over a soviet memorial in tallinn have highlighted still-tense relations between moscow and formerly soviet-dominated central europe .
after a recent blockade of the estonian embassy in moscow , and violent scenes at a news conference given by the estonian ambassador , the european commission has urged russia to observe un conventions on protection of diplomats .
russia has suggested it wants to deal only with more established eu states , sparking angry responses from eu officials , who have vowed unity in the face of pressure from russia .
eu leaders have also voiced concern about europe 's rapidly growing reliance on russian oil and gas imports at a time when russia is becoming an increasingly assertive energy power .
there are other items on the summit agenda that could spark controversy .
the european union has supported russia 's bid to join the world trade union as soon as possible but has said that it could withhold final approval until eu-russia trade tariff rows are resolved .
putin has set early wto accession as a key goal for his presidency .
a draft document seen by afp said eu leaders should " make clear that the eu is ready to support early conclusion of russia 's wto accession but not at any price . "
missile defense , democratic freedoms russia has also contributed to the tense mood of the summit with its ongoing row with the us over plans to station elements of a planned missile defense system in poland and the czech republic .
moscow has threatened to tear up a key arms limitation pact if washington goes ahead with those plans .
eu leaders also said they wanted to discuss democratic freedoms in russia , which have come under scrutiny amid a crackdown on opposition protests ahead of presidential elections next year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a russian crackdown on opposition protests last month sparked major criticism an anti-kremlin group , the other russia , is due to hold a protest rally in samara on friday .
the demonstration has been dogged with problems , including the arrest of several of the main organizers .
meanwhile , hundreds of pro-kremlin activists also prepared to rally in samara on friday against estonia 's decision to move a controversial soviet war monument last month .
russia reprimanded the european union for failing to condemn estonia 's decision , which sparked rioting by ethnic-russians .
brussels has said the issue is an internal matter for estonia . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , russia play down differences , but hurdles remain german foreign minister steinmeier met russian president putin on tuesday in a last-ditch bid to rescue a looming eu-russia summit amid spiraling tensions over a host of issues .

" the european union is a union of 27 member states and we take decisions based on solidarity .
i came here of course with this spirit of defending european interests in that sense of solidarity , " barroso said .
speaking to reporters after his arrival in samara , a regional centre , he said he would hold " a frank and open discussion " with putin at the summit but did not expect any breakthroughs .
" i am not expecting , honestly , anything spectacular from this meeting , " barroso said . merkel also called for dialogue with moscow , saying ahead of the talks : " russia and the european union are interdependent .
it 's always good to speak to each other rather than talking about each other . "
the summit 's main consultations were set for friday at the volzhsky utyos -lrb- volga cliff -rrb- resort complex , southeast of moscow , but the agenda was limited because of ongoing diplomatic and trade disputes .
" a difficult time " " this summit is taking place at a difficult time , " a german government official told reporters in berlin this week .
" but if we want a strategic partnership with russia it 's important that we talk even during difficult times . "
even if there is no narrowing of differences , both sides will get a better idea of each other 's positions , he said .
eu officials said talks would touch on international issues such as the future status of kosovo and iran 's nuclear programme , as well as russia 's bid to join the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- this year .
but negotiations on a key partnership agreement that governs eu-russia relations , including in the vitally important energy sphere , have been held up because of a trade row between eu member poland and russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland and russia are locked in a row over polish meat imports " eu members understand us .
so , in a sense , there is a situation of crisis in relations between the eu and russia , " polish foreign minister anna fotyga said thursday in an interview with polish public television .
poland has warned it will maintain a veto on talks unless moscow lifts a ban on meat imports from poland and eu members form a united front on the issue of energy security .
russia has accused poland of holding eu-russia relations " hostage . "
russia 's wto bid the row with poland and a bitter war of words with estonia over a soviet memorial in tallinn have highlighted still-tense relations between moscow and formerly soviet-dominated central europe .
after a recent blockade of the estonian embassy in moscow , and violent scenes at a news conference given by the estonian ambassador , the european commission has urged russia to observe un conventions on protection of diplomats .
russia has suggested it wants to deal only with more established eu states , sparking angry responses from eu officials , who have vowed unity in the face of pressure from russia .
eu leaders have also voiced concern about europe 's rapidly growing reliance on russian oil and gas imports at a time when russia is becoming an increasingly assertive energy power .
there are other items on the summit agenda that could spark controversy .
the european union has supported russia 's bid to join the world trade union as soon as possible but has said that it could withhold final approval until eu-russia trade tariff rows are resolved .
putin has set early wto accession as a key goal for his presidency .
a draft document seen by afp said eu leaders should " make clear that the eu is ready to support early conclusion of russia 's wto accession but not at any price . "
missile defense , democratic freedoms russia has also contributed to the tense mood of the summit with its ongoing row with the us over plans to station elements of a planned missile defense system in poland and the czech republic .
moscow has threatened to tear up a key arms limitation pact if washington goes ahead with those plans .
eu leaders also said they wanted to discuss democratic freedoms in russia , which have come under scrutiny amid a crackdown on opposition protests ahead of presidential elections next year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a russian crackdown on opposition protests last month sparked major criticism an anti-kremlin group , the other russia , is due to hold a protest rally in samara on friday .
the demonstration has been dogged with problems , including the arrest of several of the main organizers .
meanwhile , hundreds of pro-kremlin activists also prepared to rally in samara on friday against estonia 's decision to move a controversial soviet war monument last month .
russia reprimanded the european union for failing to condemn estonia 's decision , which sparked rioting by ethnic-russians .
brussels has said the issue is an internal matter for estonia . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , russia play down differences , but hurdles remain german foreign minister steinmeier met russian president putin on tuesday in a last-ditch bid to rescue a looming eu-russia summit amid spiraling tensions over a host of issues .

over the two weeks , a host of internationally acclaimed performers - including pianist alfred brendel , cellist heinrich schiff and violinist gidon kremer - are set to make appearances in the eastern german city .
the festival will start with a sing-along performance , as it does each year .
this year it will be joseph haydn 's " four seasons " oratorio . it will also feature a wide range of events on its program including musical theater , dance , jazz , film , literature and visual arts .
despite the star power on this year 's program , the festival has seen better days .
" the most visited classical music festival in germany is dropping into the middle class , " festival director hartmut haenchen said in an interview with german news agency dpa .

the bridge had been approved by a local referendum in 2005 , but unesco said it would consider removing dresden from its list of 830 world heritage sites because the modern construction would have " a serious impact on the integrity of the landscape " of the city . city leaders in saxony 's capital tried to back-pedal on the bridge project , but their efforts were stalled by a court decision upholding the plebiscite .
" it irritates me that politicians think so short-term , " haenchen said about the 106 million euro -lrb- $ 203 million -rrb- bridge project .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 17.05.2007 opinion : united nations of democracies and dictatorships ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the increasing role of non-democracies in key un bodies lead observers to wonder how the un can live up to its ideals .
the us and the eu should turn to the old-fashioned tools of diplomacy , argues thorsten benner . last friday , the un commission on sustainable development -lrb- csd -rrb- elected zimbabwe as its next chair .
much to their chagrin , eu countries , the us and canada were outvoted in their opposition against installing mugabe 's repressive regime as chair of this major -lrb- even though for the most part dysfunctional -rrb- un body .
the uk representative emphasized that for zimbabwe to chair the " commission , while -lsb- mugabe 's -rsb- own people suffer the appalling consequences of -lsb- zimbabwe 's -rsb- government policies , is wholly inconsistent with the commission 's aims .
it damages the credibility of the commission itself and its ability to deal with issues affecting the livelihoods of millions from the poorest countries . "
this thursday , belarus , egypt and angola seek membership of the un human rights council .
all three hardly live up to the criteria set out for membership in the new un human rights body : " contribution to the promotion and protection of human rights and -lsb- its -rsb- voluntary pledges and commitments made thereto . "
maintain the status quo ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thorsten benner what strategy should democracies choose with regard to the role of dictatorships in un bodies ?
" simply accept it as a fact of life " is the first option recommended by many , especially the members of the group of 77 -lrb- g77 -rrb- developing country bloc at the un .
sudan 's un ambassador abdalmahmood abdalhaleem , for example , argues that it is the " right of regional groups to choose whoever they want . "
he can refer to the un charter to support his point .
the charter states prominently that the un " is based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its members . "
democracy at the un means " one country , one vote . "
it is not for others to question how sovereign members exercise their right to vote .
case closed .
a second option is based on the exact opposite view .
it argues that the role of dictatorships undermines the credibility and effectiveness of the un so that it is necessary to create alternatives .
introduce a " democracies only " club ?
us senator and presidential candidate john mccain advocates " bringing democratic peoples and nations from around the world into one common organization , a worldwide league of democracies . -lrb- … -rrb- the new league of democracies would form the core of an international order of peace based on freedom .
it could act where the un fails to act , to relieve human suffering in places like darfur . "
both options - accepting the status quo and creating a new " democracies only " club outside the un - are short-sighted .
simply acquiescing to the prominent role of dictatorships in un bodies threatens to further undermine the standing of the united nations in key countries that account for the vast majority of contributions to the un budget , especially the us .
it also undermines the credibility of the un as a whole to stand up for the ideals enshrined in its charter .
forming a " league of democracies " outside the un throws the baby out with the bathwater .
a world organization of only democracies could not supplant the united nations .
this would amount to the same as restricting diplomacy to friendly and like-minded countries , while missing out on the very essence of the business of diplomacy .
old-fashioned tools we need an alternative strategy within the un to further human rights and democracy .
first of all , democracies need to use the old-fashioned tools of diplomacy to reverse the trend of the increasing prominence of dictatorships in un bodies .
the eu and the us in particular should use the powers of moral suasion as well as hard economic and political incentives to ease individual developing countries out of the block of irresponsible voters .
there is no inevitability for countries such as south africa or argentina to side with serial human rights abusers .
while engaging in diplomacy , the us , the eu and other democracies should be respectful in demeanour and firm on principles .
they should make it clear that they are not willing to tolerate serial abuses of the goals of the un on human rights .
the german foreign minister did exactly that earlier this year in his address to the un human rights council on behalf of the eu .
he argued that " it is not acceptable that very serious human rights violations are not addressed - or are not addressed with the necessary directness - because regional or ideological solidarity takes precedence over the willingness to see critical situations without bias . "
aiming for a " community of democracies " establishing a " democracy caucus " within the un would be another important element of a winning strategy .
a democracy caucus would offer a complement to regional and other blocs within the un for cooperation on resolutions and initiatives .
this democracy caucus could also contribute to moving away from the confrontation between the " west vs. the rest " that currently poisons the atmosphere at the un .
major members of the g-77 developing country bloc , such as india , would also be members of the democracy caucus .
this caucus could further a better understanding of what democracy is all about . when confronted with the opposition to his candidacy , the newly elected zimbabwean chair of the csd said that critics had the " right to their opinions . "
he added that " at the end of the day the majority rules as democracy does . "
once a vast majority of un members understands that this misses the very essence of liberal democracy we will have come a long way in living up to the ideals of the un .
as former un secretary-general kofi annan pointed out , " when the united nations can truly call itself a community of democracies , the charter 's noble ideals of protecting human rights and promoting ' social progress in larger freedoms ' will have been brought much closer . "

the us and the eu should turn to the old-fashioned tools of diplomacy , argues thorsten benner . last friday , the un commission on sustainable development -lrb- csd -rrb- elected zimbabwe as its next chair .
much to their chagrin , eu countries , the us and canada were outvoted in their opposition against installing mugabe 's repressive regime as chair of this major -lrb- even though for the most part dysfunctional -rrb- un body .
the uk representative emphasized that for zimbabwe to chair the " commission , while -lsb- mugabe 's -rsb- own people suffer the appalling consequences of -lsb- zimbabwe 's -rsb- government policies , is wholly inconsistent with the commission 's aims .
it damages the credibility of the commission itself and its ability to deal with issues affecting the livelihoods of millions from the poorest countries . "
this thursday , belarus , egypt and angola seek membership of the un human rights council .
all three hardly live up to the criteria set out for membership in the new un human rights body : " contribution to the promotion and protection of human rights and -lsb- its -rsb- voluntary pledges and commitments made thereto . "
maintain the status quo ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thorsten benner what strategy should democracies choose with regard to the role of dictatorships in un bodies ?
" simply accept it as a fact of life " is the first option recommended by many , especially the members of the group of 77 -lrb- g77 -rrb- developing country bloc at the un .
sudan 's un ambassador abdalmahmood abdalhaleem , for example , argues that it is the " right of regional groups to choose whoever they want . "
he can refer to the un charter to support his point .
the charter states prominently that the un " is based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its members . "
democracy at the un means " one country , one vote . "
it is not for others to question how sovereign members exercise their right to vote .
case closed .
a second option is based on the exact opposite view .
it argues that the role of dictatorships undermines the credibility and effectiveness of the un so that it is necessary to create alternatives .
introduce a " democracies only " club ?
us senator and presidential candidate john mccain advocates " bringing democratic peoples and nations from around the world into one common organization , a worldwide league of democracies . -lrb- … -rrb- the new league of democracies would form the core of an international order of peace based on freedom .
it could act where the un fails to act , to relieve human suffering in places like darfur . "
both options - accepting the status quo and creating a new " democracies only " club outside the un - are short-sighted .
simply acquiescing to the prominent role of dictatorships in un bodies threatens to further undermine the standing of the united nations in key countries that account for the vast majority of contributions to the un budget , especially the us .
it also undermines the credibility of the un as a whole to stand up for the ideals enshrined in its charter .
forming a " league of democracies " outside the un throws the baby out with the bathwater .
a world organization of only democracies could not supplant the united nations .
this would amount to the same as restricting diplomacy to friendly and like-minded countries , while missing out on the very essence of the business of diplomacy .
old-fashioned tools we need an alternative strategy within the un to further human rights and democracy .
first of all , democracies need to use the old-fashioned tools of diplomacy to reverse the trend of the increasing prominence of dictatorships in un bodies .
the eu and the us in particular should use the powers of moral suasion as well as hard economic and political incentives to ease individual developing countries out of the block of irresponsible voters .
there is no inevitability for countries such as south africa or argentina to side with serial human rights abusers .
while engaging in diplomacy , the us , the eu and other democracies should be respectful in demeanour and firm on principles .
they should make it clear that they are not willing to tolerate serial abuses of the goals of the un on human rights .
the german foreign minister did exactly that earlier this year in his address to the un human rights council on behalf of the eu .
he argued that " it is not acceptable that very serious human rights violations are not addressed - or are not addressed with the necessary directness - because regional or ideological solidarity takes precedence over the willingness to see critical situations without bias . "
aiming for a " community of democracies " establishing a " democracy caucus " within the un would be another important element of a winning strategy .
a democracy caucus would offer a complement to regional and other blocs within the un for cooperation on resolutions and initiatives .
this democracy caucus could also contribute to moving away from the confrontation between the " west vs. the rest " that currently poisons the atmosphere at the un .
major members of the g-77 developing country bloc , such as india , would also be members of the democracy caucus .
this caucus could further a better understanding of what democracy is all about . when confronted with the opposition to his candidacy , the newly elected zimbabwean chair of the csd said that critics had the " right to their opinions . "
he added that " at the end of the day the majority rules as democracy does . "
once a vast majority of un members understands that this misses the very essence of liberal democracy we will have come a long way in living up to the ideals of the un .
as former un secretary-general kofi annan pointed out , " when the united nations can truly call itself a community of democracies , the charter 's noble ideals of protecting human rights and promoting ' social progress in larger freedoms ' will have been brought much closer . "

major members of the g-77 developing country bloc , such as india , would also be members of the democracy caucus .
this caucus could further a better understanding of what democracy is all about . when confronted with the opposition to his candidacy , the newly elected zimbabwean chair of the csd said that critics had the " right to their opinions . "
he added that " at the end of the day the majority rules as democracy does . "
once a vast majority of un members understands that this misses the very essence of liberal democracy we will have come a long way in living up to the ideals of the un .
as former un secretary-general kofi annan pointed out , " when the united nations can truly call itself a community of democracies , the charter 's noble ideals of protecting human rights and promoting ' social progress in larger freedoms ' will have been brought much closer . "

the us and the eu should turn to the old-fashioned tools of diplomacy , argues thorsten benner . last friday , the un commission on sustainable development -lrb- csd -rrb- elected zimbabwe as its next chair .
much to their chagrin , eu countries , the us and canada were outvoted in their opposition against installing mugabe 's repressive regime as chair of this major -lrb- even though for the most part dysfunctional -rrb- un body .
the uk representative emphasized that for zimbabwe to chair the " commission , while -lsb- mugabe 's -rsb- own people suffer the appalling consequences of -lsb- zimbabwe 's -rsb- government policies , is wholly inconsistent with the commission 's aims .
it damages the credibility of the commission itself and its ability to deal with issues affecting the livelihoods of millions from the poorest countries . "
this thursday , belarus , egypt and angola seek membership of the un human rights council .
all three hardly live up to the criteria set out for membership in the new un human rights body : " contribution to the promotion and protection of human rights and -lsb- its -rsb- voluntary pledges and commitments made thereto . "
maintain the status quo ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thorsten benner what strategy should democracies choose with regard to the role of dictatorships in un bodies ?
" simply accept it as a fact of life " is the first option recommended by many , especially the members of the group of 77 -lrb- g77 -rrb- developing country bloc at the un .
sudan 's un ambassador abdalmahmood abdalhaleem , for example , argues that it is the " right of regional groups to choose whoever they want . "
he can refer to the un charter to support his point .
the charter states prominently that the un " is based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its members . "
democracy at the un means " one country , one vote . "
it is not for others to question how sovereign members exercise their right to vote .
case closed .
a second option is based on the exact opposite view .
it argues that the role of dictatorships undermines the credibility and effectiveness of the un so that it is necessary to create alternatives .
introduce a " democracies only " club ?
us senator and presidential candidate john mccain advocates " bringing democratic peoples and nations from around the world into one common organization , a worldwide league of democracies . -lrb- … -rrb- the new league of democracies would form the core of an international order of peace based on freedom .
it could act where the un fails to act , to relieve human suffering in places like darfur . "
both options - accepting the status quo and creating a new " democracies only " club outside the un - are short-sighted .
simply acquiescing to the prominent role of dictatorships in un bodies threatens to further undermine the standing of the united nations in key countries that account for the vast majority of contributions to the un budget , especially the us .
it also undermines the credibility of the un as a whole to stand up for the ideals enshrined in its charter .
forming a " league of democracies " outside the un throws the baby out with the bathwater .
a world organization of only democracies could not supplant the united nations .
this would amount to the same as restricting diplomacy to friendly and like-minded countries , while missing out on the very essence of the business of diplomacy .
old-fashioned tools we need an alternative strategy within the un to further human rights and democracy .
first of all , democracies need to use the old-fashioned tools of diplomacy to reverse the trend of the increasing prominence of dictatorships in un bodies .
the eu and the us in particular should use the powers of moral suasion as well as hard economic and political incentives to ease individual developing countries out of the block of irresponsible voters .
there is no inevitability for countries such as south africa or argentina to side with serial human rights abusers .
while engaging in diplomacy , the us , the eu and other democracies should be respectful in demeanour and firm on principles .
they should make it clear that they are not willing to tolerate serial abuses of the goals of the un on human rights .
the german foreign minister did exactly that earlier this year in his address to the un human rights council on behalf of the eu .
he argued that " it is not acceptable that very serious human rights violations are not addressed - or are not addressed with the necessary directness - because regional or ideological solidarity takes precedence over the willingness to see critical situations without bias . "
aiming for a " community of democracies " establishing a " democracy caucus " within the un would be another important element of a winning strategy .
a democracy caucus would offer a complement to regional and other blocs within the un for cooperation on resolutions and initiatives .
this democracy caucus could also contribute to moving away from the confrontation between the " west vs. the rest " that currently poisons the atmosphere at the un .
major members of the g-77 developing country bloc , such as india , would also be members of the democracy caucus .

he added that " at the end of the day the majority rules as democracy does . "
once a vast majority of un members understands that this misses the very essence of liberal democracy we will have come a long way in living up to the ideals of the un .
as former un secretary-general kofi annan pointed out , " when the united nations can truly call itself a community of democracies , the charter 's noble ideals of protecting human rights and promoting ' social progress in larger freedoms ' will have been brought much closer . "

but so far , criticism has been faint . the organization " reporters without borders " ranks poland 58th in its press freedom index of 168 countries .
among the 27 eu member states , it holds the lowest position . the group said it has observed a strong increase in censorship by poland 's conservative government .
the latest attempt involves plans announced earlier this month by the parliament 's new speaker , ludwik dorn , to classify parliamentary journalists .
under the system , certain groups of journalists would have certain reporting privileges and access to politicians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslaw kaczynski , here with german chancellor angela merkel , has n't given up yet dorn , a key ally of poland 's ruling kaczynski twins , said the division would better organize parliamentary work and " avert chaos . "
yet polish journalists disagreed . " dorn should rather read the constitution and what it says on journalists ' access to information , " stefan batorowski from the polish journalists association told polish media . government will continue its efforts polish journalists have been feeling increased government pressure to toe the official line .
all of the country 's journalists were to be screened as part of the government 's controversial vetting law , which it said was aimed at purging public life of ex-communist agents .
but last week , the constitutional court threw a spanner in the works . the judges ruled that most of the government 's planned law was unconstitutional .
it would have required some 700,000 poles to file statements saying whether they had collaborated with the communist-era secret police . those affected included practically all of the country 's intellectuals and included journalists , managers of listed state-owned firms and principals of private schools . people who failed to comply risked losing their jobs and a 10-year professional ban .
the legislation had been an extension of a decade-old vetting law that previously applied to only 30,000 lawmakers , government ministers and judges . while the government grudgingly accepted the court 's decision , formalizing it on tuesday , the battle is n't over . prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , the twin brother of president lech kaczynski , said work was to begin on a new law designed to purge communists from public life .
new legislation would be in accordance with the constitution , he said . clearer international communication is necessary the kaczynski twins have made it clear in their governing style that they want to centralize power .
as a result , some observers have asked why there is n't more of an outcry in the eu regarding legislation such as the vetting law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are the minds of polish intellectuals being x-rayed ?
" of course , every country has the legal and political right to regulate domestic policies themselves , " said stephen bastos from the german council on foreign relations in berlin . but , bastos said , this case was different . " when it is apparent that coming to terms with the past is being politically exploited , " then better international communication is needed , bastos said .
" this is to a large degree the case here . " eu criticism has not been successful in the past yet the eu is reserved .
after all , it has burned its fingers in the past for criticizing a member state 's domestic affairs , said sebastian kurpas from the center for european policy studies in brussels . back in 2000 , for example , eu member states threatened to cut all official ties to austria if the conservative people 's party -lrb- övp -rrb- formed a coalition government with the far-right freedom party -lrb- fpö -rrb- . " they really shot themselves in the foot with austria , " kurpas said .
the övp-fpö coalition government took office and after a few months of chilly diplomatic relations , things returned to normal . " the experience with austria really backfired and showed what limited possibilities exist , " kurpas said . in poland , a feeling of ' we 're doing fine ' even in poland there has been noticeably little resistance to the kaczynski government 's policies . " there are no protests , though there is a massive polarization among the population , " said bastos .
yet effective political opposition was lacking , he said . " also , the economy is going doing relatively well and the national rhetoric is leaving the economy alone , " bastos said .
a feeling of " we 're doing fine " existed among the people , he added . on an eu level , the bloc does n't need any bad blood with poland either . " there are enough problems right now in terms of the european constitution , as well as strained relations to russia to deal with , " kurpas said . germany , which holds the rotating eu presidency , needs poland on its side at the european council meeting in brussels in june . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , russia play down differences , but hurdles remain german foreign minister steinmeier met russian president putin on tuesday in a last-ditch bid to rescue a looming eu-russia summit amid spiraling tensions over a host of issues .

the legislation had been an extension of a decade-old vetting law that previously applied to only 30,000 lawmakers , government ministers and judges . while the government grudgingly accepted the court 's decision , formalizing it on tuesday , the battle is n't over . prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , the twin brother of president lech kaczynski , said work was to begin on a new law designed to purge communists from public life .
new legislation would be in accordance with the constitution , he said . clearer international communication is necessary the kaczynski twins have made it clear in their governing style that they want to centralize power .
as a result , some observers have asked why there is n't more of an outcry in the eu regarding legislation such as the vetting law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are the minds of polish intellectuals being x-rayed ?
" of course , every country has the legal and political right to regulate domestic policies themselves , " said stephen bastos from the german council on foreign relations in berlin . but , bastos said , this case was different . " when it is apparent that coming to terms with the past is being politically exploited , " then better international communication is needed , bastos said .
" this is to a large degree the case here . " eu criticism has not been successful in the past yet the eu is reserved .
after all , it has burned its fingers in the past for criticizing a member state 's domestic affairs , said sebastian kurpas from the center for european policy studies in brussels . back in 2000 , for example , eu member states threatened to cut all official ties to austria if the conservative people 's party -lrb- övp -rrb- formed a coalition government with the far-right freedom party -lrb- fpö -rrb- . " they really shot themselves in the foot with austria , " kurpas said .
the övp-fpö coalition government took office and after a few months of chilly diplomatic relations , things returned to normal . " the experience with austria really backfired and showed what limited possibilities exist , " kurpas said . in poland , a feeling of ' we 're doing fine ' even in poland there has been noticeably little resistance to the kaczynski government 's policies . " there are no protests , though there is a massive polarization among the population , " said bastos .
yet effective political opposition was lacking , he said . " also , the economy is going doing relatively well and the national rhetoric is leaving the economy alone , " bastos said .
a feeling of " we 're doing fine " existed among the people , he added . on an eu level , the bloc does n't need any bad blood with poland either . " there are enough problems right now in terms of the european constitution , as well as strained relations to russia to deal with , " kurpas said . germany , which holds the rotating eu presidency , needs poland on its side at the european council meeting in brussels in june . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , russia play down differences , but hurdles remain german foreign minister steinmeier met russian president putin on tuesday in a last-ditch bid to rescue a looming eu-russia summit amid spiraling tensions over a host of issues .

fillon , a 53-year-old senator from the ruling ump party who worked closely with sarkozy on his election campaign , has crucial experience in pensions reform which will be a key asset to the new government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing french pm de villepin held the post since 2005 the appointment was announced in a presidential statement a day after sarkozy took over as head of state from jacques chirac .
sarkozy is to announce the rest of his 15-member cabinet lineup on friday . fillon 's predecessor , dominique de villepin , presented his resignation on tuesday to chirac ahead of the handover of power to sarkozy , who has pledged to carry out deep social and economic reform .
fillon made his mark as a reformer as social affairs minister under chirac , from 2002 to 2004 , when he carried out an overhaul of france 's pension system , facing down million-strong street protests . low-key meets high energy ironically , in a book in 2006 , fillon had argued for abolishing the post of premier , while advocating a strong presidential-style of rule .
and during the election campaign , sarkozy himself had said that the premier should only " coordinate the work of the government " and should not share power with the head of state .
sarkozy 's jogging partner throughout the campaign , fillon has a low-key demeanor that is often described as complementary to sarkozy 's hyper-active style . speed was apparently of the essence on wednesday , when sarkozy - in a possibly record-breaking move - landed in berlin for his first official state visit , a mere six hours after he was sworn in to office .

fillon , a 53-year-old senator from the ruling ump party who worked closely with sarkozy on his election campaign , has crucial experience in pensions reform which will be a key asset to the new government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing french pm de villepin held the post since 2005 the appointment was announced in a presidential statement a day after sarkozy took over as head of state from jacques chirac .
sarkozy is to announce the rest of his 15-member cabinet lineup on friday . fillon 's predecessor , dominique de villepin , presented his resignation on tuesday to chirac ahead of the handover of power to sarkozy , who has pledged to carry out deep social and economic reform .
fillon made his mark as a reformer as social affairs minister under chirac , from 2002 to 2004 , when he carried out an overhaul of france 's pension system , facing down million-strong street protests . low-key meets high energy ironically , in a book in 2006 , fillon had argued for abolishing the post of premier , while advocating a strong presidential-style of rule .
and during the election campaign , sarkozy himself had said that the premier should only " coordinate the work of the government " and should not share power with the head of state .
sarkozy 's jogging partner throughout the campaign , fillon has a low-key demeanor that is often described as complementary to sarkozy 's hyper-active style . speed was apparently of the essence on wednesday , when sarkozy - in a possibly record-breaking move - landed in berlin for his first official state visit , a mere six hours after he was sworn in to office . ' europe must lose its paralysis ' in berlin , the new french president met with german chancellor angela merkel , to show his support for strong franco-german relations and discuss the possibility of reviving the eu constitution .
french and dutch voters rejected the eu constitution in referendums two years ago .
germany currently holds the rotating presidency of the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : possibly breaking speed records , sarko was in berlin six hours after taking office " europe must be shaken from its paralysis as a matter of urgency , " sarkozy said at a joint press conference with merkel . over a working dinner , sarkozy presented his proposal for a mini-treaty comprising the bare essentials of the failed constitution , to allow the institutions of the 27-nation bloc to function fully . sarkozy stressed the importance of maintaining and strengthening the relationship between germany and france , whose partnership is often described as the driving force behind the eu . ' sacred ' friendship " i want to say to the german people that the friendship between france and germany is sacred and that nothing can call it into doubt , " he said . for her part , merkel thanked sarkozy for his speedy visit .
the gesture made it clear how much the two countries need one another , she said . sarkozy said he thinks it is crucial to attack europe 's problems as quickly as possible . " waiting too long just makes this more complicated , " he said , referring particularly to plans for a new eu constitution . " the first urgent task is to free europe from its current paralysis . " as for merkel , she sees sarkozy as a key partner in her plan to get the eu constitution process going again at the eu summit in june . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vowing change , sarkozy succeeds chirac as french president nicolas sarkozy took over as french president from jacques chirac on wednesday , vowing to usher in a period of deep reforms to help his country adapt to a fast-changing world .

with daimlerchrysler in divorce court , can benz make a comeback ? what 's in a name ?
a lot , according to conventional wisdom among corporate ceos .
nearly a decade ago , the highly touted " marriage of equals " between german high-end carmaker daimler-benz and us standard-bearer chrysler nearly ran aground amid disagreement over which of the two partners would get top billing in the corporate identity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car inventor karl benz is not getting his propers , some say daimler won out -lrb- thus the company was called daimlerchrysler , not chryslerdaimler -rrb- .
but in doing so , it sacrificed benz , a part of its identity that goes back to the creation of the firm .
now , some folks are arguing that giving up its heritage - carl benz was the inventor of the first automobile , after all - was a mistake .
with the newly spun-off german arm of daimlerchrysler seeking a revamped corporate identity , a war of words has broken out in the state of baden-württemberg . people from the region of baden - where carl benz was born - are upset that those in stuttgart -lrb- in württemberg , and the town where daimler ag is headquartered -rrb- have gotten all the glory , and are keeping it .
town agitates to revive " benz " " in stuttgart … they should n't forget that it was n't gottlieb daimler , but carl benz who invented the automobile , " a worker at the daimlerchrysler factory in mannheim told dpa news service .
meanwhile , administrators in the town of mannheim -lrb- located in the baden region of baden-württemberg -rrb- are doing their best to encourage daimler ag leader dieter zetsche to reclaim the benz name , the associated press has reported .
" through the planned separation from chrysler , there is a chance to bring the old daimler-benz name back to life , " said a declaration from the local council of mannheim .
and daimler ag headquarters also reported a number of calls of people who wanted to get the benz name back , ap said .
concerns over corporate confusion marina raptis , a spokeswoman for daimler ag , told ap any name change would need to be addressed at an extraordinary general meeting in the autumn .
suggestions would need to be examined with several factors in mind , including property rights and legal and strategic issues , she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gottlieb daimler merged his firm with benz 's in 1926 she noted that the daimler name is well known and serves as an over-arching identity .
names like mercedes-benz ag or daimler-benz ag could mix corporate and product identities , which could harm the company 's position on the product market , raptis argued .
" our suggested and preferred name , daimler ag , attaches us to tradition , but shows a clear direction forward , " raptis said .
the suggested name is not meant to be a slight to benz , she said .
" the history and tradition of our company , as well as the brand mercedes benz will always be tied to carl benz . ...
without carl benz and gottlieb daimler , our company would not exist , " she said .
no one denies that benz 's invention hit the pavement before that of his competitor daimler .
that fact has left some people especially eager to see the name benz back in the company logo .
baden-based politician karl lamers argued that the name benz is the " starting point for today 's international auto concern . "
and the mayor of the city of karlsruhe , heinz fenrich , reminded daimler chief dieter zetsche that benz " got the world on wheels . "
mrs. benz 's famous ride the hybrid name daimler-benz itself came about as a result of an even earlier corporate history of merger and survival .
in 1883 , benz founded the " benz & co .

" the european union is a union of 27 member states and we take decisions based on solidarity .
i came here of course with this spirit of defending european interests in that sense of solidarity , " barroso said .
speaking to reporters after his arrival in samara , a regional centre , he said he would hold " a frank and open discussion " with putin at the summit but did not expect any breakthroughs .
" i am not expecting , honestly , anything spectacular from this meeting , " barroso said . merkel also called for dialogue with moscow , saying ahead of the talks : " russia and the european union are interdependent .
it 's always good to speak to each other rather than talking about each other . "
the summit 's main consultations were set for friday at the volzhsky utyos -lrb- volga cliff -rrb- resort complex , southeast of moscow , but the agenda was limited because of ongoing diplomatic and trade disputes .
" a difficult time " " this summit is taking place at a difficult time , " a german government official told reporters in berlin this week .
" but if we want a strategic partnership with russia it 's important that we talk even during difficult times . "
even if there is no narrowing of differences , both sides will get a better idea of each other 's positions , he said .
eu officials said talks would touch on international issues such as the future status of kosovo and iran 's nuclear programme , as well as russia 's bid to join the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- this year .
but negotiations on a key partnership agreement that governs eu-russia relations , including in the vitally important energy sphere , have been held up because of a trade row between eu member poland and russia .

after a recent blockade of the estonian embassy in moscow , and violent scenes at a news conference given by the estonian ambassador , the european commission has urged russia to observe un conventions on protection of diplomats .
russia has suggested it wants to deal only with more established eu states , sparking angry responses from eu officials , who have vowed unity in the face of pressure from russia .
eu leaders have also voiced concern about europe 's rapidly growing reliance on russian oil and gas imports at a time when russia is becoming an increasingly assertive energy power .
there are other items on the summit agenda that could spark controversy .
the european union has supported russia 's bid to join the world trade union as soon as possible but has said that it could withhold final approval until eu-russia trade tariff rows are resolved .
putin has set early wto accession as a key goal for his presidency .

missile defense , democratic freedoms russia has also contributed to the tense mood of the summit with its ongoing row with the us over plans to station elements of a planned missile defense system in poland and the czech republic .
moscow has threatened to tear up a key arms limitation pact if washington goes ahead with those plans .

" the european union is a union of 27 member states and we take decisions based on solidarity .
i came here of course with this spirit of defending european interests in that sense of solidarity , " barroso said .
speaking to reporters after his arrival in samara , a regional centre , he said he would hold " a frank and open discussion " with putin at the summit but did not expect any breakthroughs .

it 's always good to speak to each other rather than talking about each other . "
the summit 's main consultations were set for friday at the volzhsky utyos -lrb- volga cliff -rrb- resort complex , southeast of moscow , but the agenda was limited because of ongoing diplomatic and trade disputes .

russia has suggested it wants to deal only with more established eu states , sparking angry responses from eu officials , who have vowed unity in the face of pressure from russia .

but can the dresden music festival be spared from the curse of mediocrity ? now in its 30th season , the dresden music festival opens on thursday .
over the two weeks , a host of internationally acclaimed performers - including pianist alfred brendel , cellist heinrich schiff and violinist gidon kremer - are set to make appearances in the eastern german city .
the festival will start with a sing-along performance , as it does each year .
this year it will be joseph haydn 's " four seasons " oratorio . it will also feature a wide range of events on its program including musical theater , dance , jazz , film , literature and visual arts .
despite the star power on this year 's program , the festival has seen better days .
" the most visited classical music festival in germany is dropping into the middle class , " festival director hartmut haenchen said in an interview with german news agency dpa .
the city of dresden has cut the festival budget by 30 percent , forcing organizers to slim down the program to 64 events - compared to 108 in 2006 .
endangered landscapes this year 's festival revolves around the theme of " landscapes . "
expert-led excursions are on offer , including a trip into dresden 's own natural landscape , the unesco protected elbe valley .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the elbe valley was added to the unesco list in 2004 the area is currently in danger of losing its status on the list of unesco world heritage sites due to a controversial bridge being built across the valley .
the bridge had been approved by a local referendum in 2005 , but unesco said it would consider removing dresden from its list of 830 world heritage sites because the modern construction would have " a serious impact on the integrity of the landscape " of the city . city leaders in saxony 's capital tried to back-pedal on the bridge project , but their efforts were stalled by a court decision upholding the plebiscite .
" it irritates me that politicians think so short-term , " haenchen said about the 106 million euro -lrb- $ 203 million -rrb- bridge project .
many believe that dresden - being known internationally as a city of culture - should invest more in the festival .
" the city has enough bridges , " wrote german web site klassik.com in the aftermath of the 2006 festival .
gdr 's most prestigious classical festival bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renowned pianist alfred brendel will perform works from 19th century vienna founded in 1978 by east germany 's communist party , the dresden music festival became the gdr 's most prestigious classical festival and attracted a great deal of attention from abroad .
world-class soloists like marilyn horne and dietrich fischer-diskau as well as top conductors like claudio abbado and zubin mehta came to the elbe river city to share their talents .
after germany 's reunification , the dresden music festival continued to prosper , peaking in 2003 with a record 150,000 visitors .
some 140,000 music lovers attended the event last year , but haenchen said he fears the number could drop to as few as 70,000 attendees this year .
" people play mozart for cows so they give more milk , " haenchen .

over the two weeks , a host of internationally acclaimed performers - including pianist alfred brendel , cellist heinrich schiff and violinist gidon kremer - are set to make appearances in the eastern german city .
the festival will start with a sing-along performance , as it does each year .
this year it will be joseph haydn 's " four seasons " oratorio . it will also feature a wide range of events on its program including musical theater , dance , jazz , film , literature and visual arts .
despite the star power on this year 's program , the festival has seen better days .
" the most visited classical music festival in germany is dropping into the middle class , " festival director hartmut haenchen said in an interview with german news agency dpa .

the bridge had been approved by a local referendum in 2005 , but unesco said it would consider removing dresden from its list of 830 world heritage sites because the modern construction would have " a serious impact on the integrity of the landscape " of the city . city leaders in saxony 's capital tried to back-pedal on the bridge project , but their efforts were stalled by a court decision upholding the plebiscite .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 17.05.2007 opinion : united nations of democracies and dictatorships ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the increasing role of non-democracies in key un bodies lead observers to wonder how the un can live up to its ideals .
the us and the eu should turn to the old-fashioned tools of diplomacy , argues thorsten benner . last friday , the un commission on sustainable development -lrb- csd -rrb- elected zimbabwe as its next chair .
much to their chagrin , eu countries , the us and canada were outvoted in their opposition against installing mugabe 's repressive regime as chair of this major -lrb- even though for the most part dysfunctional -rrb- un body .
the uk representative emphasized that for zimbabwe to chair the " commission , while -lsb- mugabe 's -rsb- own people suffer the appalling consequences of -lsb- zimbabwe 's -rsb- government policies , is wholly inconsistent with the commission 's aims .
it damages the credibility of the commission itself and its ability to deal with issues affecting the livelihoods of millions from the poorest countries . "
this thursday , belarus , egypt and angola seek membership of the un human rights council .
all three hardly live up to the criteria set out for membership in the new un human rights body : " contribution to the promotion and protection of human rights and -lsb- its -rsb- voluntary pledges and commitments made thereto . "
maintain the status quo ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thorsten benner what strategy should democracies choose with regard to the role of dictatorships in un bodies ?
" simply accept it as a fact of life " is the first option recommended by many , especially the members of the group of 77 -lrb- g77 -rrb- developing country bloc at the un .
sudan 's un ambassador abdalmahmood abdalhaleem , for example , argues that it is the " right of regional groups to choose whoever they want . "
he can refer to the un charter to support his point .
the charter states prominently that the un " is based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its members . "
democracy at the un means " one country , one vote . "
it is not for others to question how sovereign members exercise their right to vote .
case closed .
a second option is based on the exact opposite view .
it argues that the role of dictatorships undermines the credibility and effectiveness of the un so that it is necessary to create alternatives .
introduce a " democracies only " club ?
us senator and presidential candidate john mccain advocates " bringing democratic peoples and nations from around the world into one common organization , a worldwide league of democracies . -lrb- … -rrb- the new league of democracies would form the core of an international order of peace based on freedom .
it could act where the un fails to act , to relieve human suffering in places like darfur . "
both options - accepting the status quo and creating a new " democracies only " club outside the un - are short-sighted .
simply acquiescing to the prominent role of dictatorships in un bodies threatens to further undermine the standing of the united nations in key countries that account for the vast majority of contributions to the un budget , especially the us .
it also undermines the credibility of the un as a whole to stand up for the ideals enshrined in its charter .
forming a " league of democracies " outside the un throws the baby out with the bathwater .
a world organization of only democracies could not supplant the united nations .
this would amount to the same as restricting diplomacy to friendly and like-minded countries , while missing out on the very essence of the business of diplomacy .
old-fashioned tools we need an alternative strategy within the un to further human rights and democracy .
first of all , democracies need to use the old-fashioned tools of diplomacy to reverse the trend of the increasing prominence of dictatorships in un bodies .
the eu and the us in particular should use the powers of moral suasion as well as hard economic and political incentives to ease individual developing countries out of the block of irresponsible voters .
there is no inevitability for countries such as south africa or argentina to side with serial human rights abusers .
while engaging in diplomacy , the us , the eu and other democracies should be respectful in demeanour and firm on principles .
they should make it clear that they are not willing to tolerate serial abuses of the goals of the un on human rights .
the german foreign minister did exactly that earlier this year in his address to the un human rights council on behalf of the eu .
he argued that " it is not acceptable that very serious human rights violations are not addressed - or are not addressed with the necessary directness - because regional or ideological solidarity takes precedence over the willingness to see critical situations without bias . "
aiming for a " community of democracies " establishing a " democracy caucus " within the un would be another important element of a winning strategy .
a democracy caucus would offer a complement to regional and other blocs within the un for cooperation on resolutions and initiatives .
this democracy caucus could also contribute to moving away from the confrontation between the " west vs. the rest " that currently poisons the atmosphere at the un .
major members of the g-77 developing country bloc , such as india , would also be members of the democracy caucus .
this caucus could further a better understanding of what democracy is all about . when confronted with the opposition to his candidacy , the newly elected zimbabwean chair of the csd said that critics had the " right to their opinions . "
he added that " at the end of the day the majority rules as democracy does . "
once a vast majority of un members understands that this misses the very essence of liberal democracy we will have come a long way in living up to the ideals of the un .
as former un secretary-general kofi annan pointed out , " when the united nations can truly call itself a community of democracies , the charter 's noble ideals of protecting human rights and promoting ' social progress in larger freedoms ' will have been brought much closer . "
thorsten benner is associate director of the global public policy institute -lrb- gppi -rrb- in berlin , an independent think tank focussed on effective and accountable governance and the reform of international organizations . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de from africa to germany , blogs reflect a globalized world as the number of blogs around the world continues to climb , many blogs focusing on local issues are gaining a global audience in this hyper-connected media landscape .

the us and the eu should turn to the old-fashioned tools of diplomacy , argues thorsten benner . last friday , the un commission on sustainable development -lrb- csd -rrb- elected zimbabwe as its next chair .
much to their chagrin , eu countries , the us and canada were outvoted in their opposition against installing mugabe 's repressive regime as chair of this major -lrb- even though for the most part dysfunctional -rrb- un body .
the uk representative emphasized that for zimbabwe to chair the " commission , while -lsb- mugabe 's -rsb- own people suffer the appalling consequences of -lsb- zimbabwe 's -rsb- government policies , is wholly inconsistent with the commission 's aims .
it damages the credibility of the commission itself and its ability to deal with issues affecting the livelihoods of millions from the poorest countries . "
this thursday , belarus , egypt and angola seek membership of the un human rights council .
all three hardly live up to the criteria set out for membership in the new un human rights body : " contribution to the promotion and protection of human rights and -lsb- its -rsb- voluntary pledges and commitments made thereto . "
maintain the status quo ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thorsten benner what strategy should democracies choose with regard to the role of dictatorships in un bodies ?
" simply accept it as a fact of life " is the first option recommended by many , especially the members of the group of 77 -lrb- g77 -rrb- developing country bloc at the un .
sudan 's un ambassador abdalmahmood abdalhaleem , for example , argues that it is the " right of regional groups to choose whoever they want . "
he can refer to the un charter to support his point .
the charter states prominently that the un " is based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its members . "
democracy at the un means " one country , one vote . "
it is not for others to question how sovereign members exercise their right to vote .
case closed .
a second option is based on the exact opposite view .
it argues that the role of dictatorships undermines the credibility and effectiveness of the un so that it is necessary to create alternatives .
introduce a " democracies only " club ?
us senator and presidential candidate john mccain advocates " bringing democratic peoples and nations from around the world into one common organization , a worldwide league of democracies . -lrb- … -rrb- the new league of democracies would form the core of an international order of peace based on freedom .
it could act where the un fails to act , to relieve human suffering in places like darfur . "
both options - accepting the status quo and creating a new " democracies only " club outside the un - are short-sighted .
simply acquiescing to the prominent role of dictatorships in un bodies threatens to further undermine the standing of the united nations in key countries that account for the vast majority of contributions to the un budget , especially the us .
it also undermines the credibility of the un as a whole to stand up for the ideals enshrined in its charter .
forming a " league of democracies " outside the un throws the baby out with the bathwater .
a world organization of only democracies could not supplant the united nations .
this would amount to the same as restricting diplomacy to friendly and like-minded countries , while missing out on the very essence of the business of diplomacy .
old-fashioned tools we need an alternative strategy within the un to further human rights and democracy .
first of all , democracies need to use the old-fashioned tools of diplomacy to reverse the trend of the increasing prominence of dictatorships in un bodies .
the eu and the us in particular should use the powers of moral suasion as well as hard economic and political incentives to ease individual developing countries out of the block of irresponsible voters .
there is no inevitability for countries such as south africa or argentina to side with serial human rights abusers .
while engaging in diplomacy , the us , the eu and other democracies should be respectful in demeanour and firm on principles .
they should make it clear that they are not willing to tolerate serial abuses of the goals of the un on human rights .
the german foreign minister did exactly that earlier this year in his address to the un human rights council on behalf of the eu .
he argued that " it is not acceptable that very serious human rights violations are not addressed - or are not addressed with the necessary directness - because regional or ideological solidarity takes precedence over the willingness to see critical situations without bias . "
aiming for a " community of democracies " establishing a " democracy caucus " within the un would be another important element of a winning strategy .
a democracy caucus would offer a complement to regional and other blocs within the un for cooperation on resolutions and initiatives .
this democracy caucus could also contribute to moving away from the confrontation between the " west vs. the rest " that currently poisons the atmosphere at the un .
major members of the g-77 developing country bloc , such as india , would also be members of the democracy caucus .
this caucus could further a better understanding of what democracy is all about . when confronted with the opposition to his candidacy , the newly elected zimbabwean chair of the csd said that critics had the " right to their opinions . "
he added that " at the end of the day the majority rules as democracy does . "
once a vast majority of un members understands that this misses the very essence of liberal democracy we will have come a long way in living up to the ideals of the un .
as former un secretary-general kofi annan pointed out , " when the united nations can truly call itself a community of democracies , the charter 's noble ideals of protecting human rights and promoting ' social progress in larger freedoms ' will have been brought much closer . "

this democracy caucus could also contribute to moving away from the confrontation between the " west vs. the rest " that currently poisons the atmosphere at the un .
major members of the g-77 developing country bloc , such as india , would also be members of the democracy caucus .
this caucus could further a better understanding of what democracy is all about . when confronted with the opposition to his candidacy , the newly elected zimbabwean chair of the csd said that critics had the " right to their opinions . "
he added that " at the end of the day the majority rules as democracy does . "
once a vast majority of un members understands that this misses the very essence of liberal democracy we will have come a long way in living up to the ideals of the un .
as former un secretary-general kofi annan pointed out , " when the united nations can truly call itself a community of democracies , the charter 's noble ideals of protecting human rights and promoting ' social progress in larger freedoms ' will have been brought much closer . "

the us and the eu should turn to the old-fashioned tools of diplomacy , argues thorsten benner . last friday , the un commission on sustainable development -lrb- csd -rrb- elected zimbabwe as its next chair .
much to their chagrin , eu countries , the us and canada were outvoted in their opposition against installing mugabe 's repressive regime as chair of this major -lrb- even though for the most part dysfunctional -rrb- un body .
the uk representative emphasized that for zimbabwe to chair the " commission , while -lsb- mugabe 's -rsb- own people suffer the appalling consequences of -lsb- zimbabwe 's -rsb- government policies , is wholly inconsistent with the commission 's aims .
it damages the credibility of the commission itself and its ability to deal with issues affecting the livelihoods of millions from the poorest countries . "
this thursday , belarus , egypt and angola seek membership of the un human rights council .
all three hardly live up to the criteria set out for membership in the new un human rights body : " contribution to the promotion and protection of human rights and -lsb- its -rsb- voluntary pledges and commitments made thereto . "
maintain the status quo ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thorsten benner what strategy should democracies choose with regard to the role of dictatorships in un bodies ?
" simply accept it as a fact of life " is the first option recommended by many , especially the members of the group of 77 -lrb- g77 -rrb- developing country bloc at the un .
sudan 's un ambassador abdalmahmood abdalhaleem , for example , argues that it is the " right of regional groups to choose whoever they want . "
he can refer to the un charter to support his point .
the charter states prominently that the un " is based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its members . "
democracy at the un means " one country , one vote . "
it is not for others to question how sovereign members exercise their right to vote .
case closed .
a second option is based on the exact opposite view .
it argues that the role of dictatorships undermines the credibility and effectiveness of the un so that it is necessary to create alternatives .
introduce a " democracies only " club ?
us senator and presidential candidate john mccain advocates " bringing democratic peoples and nations from around the world into one common organization , a worldwide league of democracies . -lrb- … -rrb- the new league of democracies would form the core of an international order of peace based on freedom .
it could act where the un fails to act , to relieve human suffering in places like darfur . "
both options - accepting the status quo and creating a new " democracies only " club outside the un - are short-sighted .
simply acquiescing to the prominent role of dictatorships in un bodies threatens to further undermine the standing of the united nations in key countries that account for the vast majority of contributions to the un budget , especially the us .
it also undermines the credibility of the un as a whole to stand up for the ideals enshrined in its charter .
forming a " league of democracies " outside the un throws the baby out with the bathwater .
a world organization of only democracies could not supplant the united nations .
this would amount to the same as restricting diplomacy to friendly and like-minded countries , while missing out on the very essence of the business of diplomacy .
old-fashioned tools we need an alternative strategy within the un to further human rights and democracy .
first of all , democracies need to use the old-fashioned tools of diplomacy to reverse the trend of the increasing prominence of dictatorships in un bodies .
the eu and the us in particular should use the powers of moral suasion as well as hard economic and political incentives to ease individual developing countries out of the block of irresponsible voters .
there is no inevitability for countries such as south africa or argentina to side with serial human rights abusers .
while engaging in diplomacy , the us , the eu and other democracies should be respectful in demeanour and firm on principles .
they should make it clear that they are not willing to tolerate serial abuses of the goals of the un on human rights .
the german foreign minister did exactly that earlier this year in his address to the un human rights council on behalf of the eu .
he argued that " it is not acceptable that very serious human rights violations are not addressed - or are not addressed with the necessary directness - because regional or ideological solidarity takes precedence over the willingness to see critical situations without bias . "
aiming for a " community of democracies " establishing a " democracy caucus " within the un would be another important element of a winning strategy .
a democracy caucus would offer a complement to regional and other blocs within the un for cooperation on resolutions and initiatives .
this democracy caucus could also contribute to moving away from the confrontation between the " west vs. the rest " that currently poisons the atmosphere at the un .
major members of the g-77 developing country bloc , such as india , would also be members of the democracy caucus .
this caucus could further a better understanding of what democracy is all about . when confronted with the opposition to his candidacy , the newly elected zimbabwean chair of the csd said that critics had the " right to their opinions . "

but so far , criticism has been faint . the organization " reporters without borders " ranks poland 58th in its press freedom index of 168 countries .
among the 27 eu member states , it holds the lowest position . the group said it has observed a strong increase in censorship by poland 's conservative government .
the latest attempt involves plans announced earlier this month by the parliament 's new speaker , ludwik dorn , to classify parliamentary journalists .
under the system , certain groups of journalists would have certain reporting privileges and access to politicians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslaw kaczynski , here with german chancellor angela merkel , has n't given up yet dorn , a key ally of poland 's ruling kaczynski twins , said the division would better organize parliamentary work and " avert chaos . "
yet polish journalists disagreed . " dorn should rather read the constitution and what it says on journalists ' access to information , " stefan batorowski from the polish journalists association told polish media . government will continue its efforts polish journalists have been feeling increased government pressure to toe the official line .
all of the country 's journalists were to be screened as part of the government 's controversial vetting law , which it said was aimed at purging public life of ex-communist agents .
but last week , the constitutional court threw a spanner in the works . the judges ruled that most of the government 's planned law was unconstitutional .
it would have required some 700,000 poles to file statements saying whether they had collaborated with the communist-era secret police . those affected included practically all of the country 's intellectuals and included journalists , managers of listed state-owned firms and principals of private schools . people who failed to comply risked losing their jobs and a 10-year professional ban .
the legislation had been an extension of a decade-old vetting law that previously applied to only 30,000 lawmakers , government ministers and judges . while the government grudgingly accepted the court 's decision , formalizing it on tuesday , the battle is n't over . prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , the twin brother of president lech kaczynski , said work was to begin on a new law designed to purge communists from public life .
new legislation would be in accordance with the constitution , he said . clearer international communication is necessary the kaczynski twins have made it clear in their governing style that they want to centralize power .
as a result , some observers have asked why there is n't more of an outcry in the eu regarding legislation such as the vetting law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are the minds of polish intellectuals being x-rayed ?
" of course , every country has the legal and political right to regulate domestic policies themselves , " said stephen bastos from the german council on foreign relations in berlin . but , bastos said , this case was different . " when it is apparent that coming to terms with the past is being politically exploited , " then better international communication is needed , bastos said .
" this is to a large degree the case here . " eu criticism has not been successful in the past yet the eu is reserved .
after all , it has burned its fingers in the past for criticizing a member state 's domestic affairs , said sebastian kurpas from the center for european policy studies in brussels . back in 2000 , for example , eu member states threatened to cut all official ties to austria if the conservative people 's party -lrb- övp -rrb- formed a coalition government with the far-right freedom party -lrb- fpö -rrb- . " they really shot themselves in the foot with austria , " kurpas said .
the övp-fpö coalition government took office and after a few months of chilly diplomatic relations , things returned to normal . " the experience with austria really backfired and showed what limited possibilities exist , " kurpas said . in poland , a feeling of ' we 're doing fine ' even in poland there has been noticeably little resistance to the kaczynski government 's policies . " there are no protests , though there is a massive polarization among the population , " said bastos .
yet effective political opposition was lacking , he said . " also , the economy is going doing relatively well and the national rhetoric is leaving the economy alone , " bastos said .
a feeling of " we 're doing fine " existed among the people , he added . on an eu level , the bloc does n't need any bad blood with poland either .

but so far , criticism has been faint . the organization " reporters without borders " ranks poland 58th in its press freedom index of 168 countries .
among the 27 eu member states , it holds the lowest position . the group said it has observed a strong increase in censorship by poland 's conservative government .

all of the country 's journalists were to be screened as part of the government 's controversial vetting law , which it said was aimed at purging public life of ex-communist agents .

new legislation would be in accordance with the constitution , he said . clearer international communication is necessary the kaczynski twins have made it clear in their governing style that they want to centralize power .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de classical music -pipe- 17.05.2007 germany 's best attended music festival plagued by cuts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the semper opera house is a dresden landmark and a venue for the festival the most prestigious festival in communist east germany is still making do , despite severe budget cuts .
but can the dresden music festival be spared from the curse of mediocrity ? now in its 30th season , the dresden music festival opens on thursday .
over the two weeks , a host of internationally acclaimed performers - including pianist alfred brendel , cellist heinrich schiff and violinist gidon kremer - are set to make appearances in the eastern german city .
the festival will start with a sing-along performance , as it does each year .
this year it will be joseph haydn 's " four seasons " oratorio . it will also feature a wide range of events on its program including musical theater , dance , jazz , film , literature and visual arts .
despite the star power on this year 's program , the festival has seen better days .
" the most visited classical music festival in germany is dropping into the middle class , " festival director hartmut haenchen said in an interview with german news agency dpa .
the city of dresden has cut the festival budget by 30 percent , forcing organizers to slim down the program to 64 events - compared to 108 in 2006 .
endangered landscapes this year 's festival revolves around the theme of " landscapes . "
expert-led excursions are on offer , including a trip into dresden 's own natural landscape , the unesco protected elbe valley .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the elbe valley was added to the unesco list in 2004 the area is currently in danger of losing its status on the list of unesco world heritage sites due to a controversial bridge being built across the valley .
the bridge had been approved by a local referendum in 2005 , but unesco said it would consider removing dresden from its list of 830 world heritage sites because the modern construction would have " a serious impact on the integrity of the landscape " of the city . city leaders in saxony 's capital tried to back-pedal on the bridge project , but their efforts were stalled by a court decision upholding the plebiscite .
" it irritates me that politicians think so short-term , " haenchen said about the 106 million euro -lrb- $ 203 million -rrb- bridge project .
many believe that dresden - being known internationally as a city of culture - should invest more in the festival .
" the city has enough bridges , " wrote german web site klassik.com in the aftermath of the 2006 festival .
gdr 's most prestigious classical festival bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renowned pianist alfred brendel will perform works from 19th century vienna founded in 1978 by east germany 's communist party , the dresden music festival became the gdr 's most prestigious classical festival and attracted a great deal of attention from abroad .
world-class soloists like marilyn horne and dietrich fischer-diskau as well as top conductors like claudio abbado and zubin mehta came to the elbe river city to share their talents .
after germany 's reunification , the dresden music festival continued to prosper , peaking in 2003 with a record 150,000 visitors .
some 140,000 music lovers attended the event last year , but haenchen said he fears the number could drop to as few as 70,000 attendees this year .

but can the dresden music festival be spared from the curse of mediocrity ? now in its 30th season , the dresden music festival opens on thursday .
over the two weeks , a host of internationally acclaimed performers - including pianist alfred brendel , cellist heinrich schiff and violinist gidon kremer - are set to make appearances in the eastern german city .
the festival will start with a sing-along performance , as it does each year .
this year it will be joseph haydn 's " four seasons " oratorio . it will also feature a wide range of events on its program including musical theater , dance , jazz , film , literature and visual arts .
despite the star power on this year 's program , the festival has seen better days .
" the most visited classical music festival in germany is dropping into the middle class , " festival director hartmut haenchen said in an interview with german news agency dpa .
the city of dresden has cut the festival budget by 30 percent , forcing organizers to slim down the program to 64 events - compared to 108 in 2006 .
endangered landscapes this year 's festival revolves around the theme of " landscapes . "
expert-led excursions are on offer , including a trip into dresden 's own natural landscape , the unesco protected elbe valley .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the elbe valley was added to the unesco list in 2004 the area is currently in danger of losing its status on the list of unesco world heritage sites due to a controversial bridge being built across the valley .
the bridge had been approved by a local referendum in 2005 , but unesco said it would consider removing dresden from its list of 830 world heritage sites because the modern construction would have " a serious impact on the integrity of the landscape " of the city . city leaders in saxony 's capital tried to back-pedal on the bridge project , but their efforts were stalled by a court decision upholding the plebiscite .
" it irritates me that politicians think so short-term , " haenchen said about the 106 million euro -lrb- $ 203 million -rrb- bridge project .
many believe that dresden - being known internationally as a city of culture - should invest more in the festival .
" the city has enough bridges , " wrote german web site klassik.com in the aftermath of the 2006 festival .
gdr 's most prestigious classical festival bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renowned pianist alfred brendel will perform works from 19th century vienna founded in 1978 by east germany 's communist party , the dresden music festival became the gdr 's most prestigious classical festival and attracted a great deal of attention from abroad .
world-class soloists like marilyn horne and dietrich fischer-diskau as well as top conductors like claudio abbado and zubin mehta came to the elbe river city to share their talents .
after germany 's reunification , the dresden music festival continued to prosper , peaking in 2003 with a record 150,000 visitors .
some 140,000 music lovers attended the event last year , but haenchen said he fears the number could drop to as few as 70,000 attendees this year .

the us and the eu should turn to the old-fashioned tools of diplomacy , argues thorsten benner . last friday , the un commission on sustainable development -lrb- csd -rrb- elected zimbabwe as its next chair .
much to their chagrin , eu countries , the us and canada were outvoted in their opposition against installing mugabe 's repressive regime as chair of this major -lrb- even though for the most part dysfunctional -rrb- un body .
the uk representative emphasized that for zimbabwe to chair the " commission , while -lsb- mugabe 's -rsb- own people suffer the appalling consequences of -lsb- zimbabwe 's -rsb- government policies , is wholly inconsistent with the commission 's aims .
it damages the credibility of the commission itself and its ability to deal with issues affecting the livelihoods of millions from the poorest countries . "
this thursday , belarus , egypt and angola seek membership of the un human rights council .
all three hardly live up to the criteria set out for membership in the new un human rights body : " contribution to the promotion and protection of human rights and -lsb- its -rsb- voluntary pledges and commitments made thereto . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thorsten benner what strategy should democracies choose with regard to the role of dictatorships in un bodies ?
" simply accept it as a fact of life " is the first option recommended by many , especially the members of the group of 77 -lrb- g77 -rrb- developing country bloc at the un .
sudan 's un ambassador abdalmahmood abdalhaleem , for example , argues that it is the " right of regional groups to choose whoever they want . "
he can refer to the un charter to support his point .
the charter states prominently that the un " is based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its members . "
democracy at the un means " one country , one vote . "
it is not for others to question how sovereign members exercise their right to vote .
case closed .
a second option is based on the exact opposite view .
it argues that the role of dictatorships undermines the credibility and effectiveness of the un so that it is necessary to create alternatives .
introduce a " democracies only " club ?
us senator and presidential candidate john mccain advocates " bringing democratic peoples and nations from around the world into one common organization , a worldwide league of democracies . -lrb- … -rrb- the new league of democracies would form the core of an international order of peace based on freedom .
it could act where the un fails to act , to relieve human suffering in places like darfur . "
both options - accepting the status quo and creating a new " democracies only " club outside the un - are short-sighted .
simply acquiescing to the prominent role of dictatorships in un bodies threatens to further undermine the standing of the united nations in key countries that account for the vast majority of contributions to the un budget , especially the us .
it also undermines the credibility of the un as a whole to stand up for the ideals enshrined in its charter .
forming a " league of democracies " outside the un throws the baby out with the bathwater .
a world organization of only democracies could not supplant the united nations .
this would amount to the same as restricting diplomacy to friendly and like-minded countries , while missing out on the very essence of the business of diplomacy .
old-fashioned tools we need an alternative strategy within the un to further human rights and democracy .
first of all , democracies need to use the old-fashioned tools of diplomacy to reverse the trend of the increasing prominence of dictatorships in un bodies .
the eu and the us in particular should use the powers of moral suasion as well as hard economic and political incentives to ease individual developing countries out of the block of irresponsible voters .
there is no inevitability for countries such as south africa or argentina to side with serial human rights abusers .
while engaging in diplomacy , the us , the eu and other democracies should be respectful in demeanour and firm on principles .
they should make it clear that they are not willing to tolerate serial abuses of the goals of the un on human rights .
the german foreign minister did exactly that earlier this year in his address to the un human rights council on behalf of the eu .
he argued that " it is not acceptable that very serious human rights violations are not addressed - or are not addressed with the necessary directness - because regional or ideological solidarity takes precedence over the willingness to see critical situations without bias . "
aiming for a " community of democracies " establishing a " democracy caucus " within the un would be another important element of a winning strategy .
a democracy caucus would offer a complement to regional and other blocs within the un for cooperation on resolutions and initiatives .
this democracy caucus could also contribute to moving away from the confrontation between the " west vs. the rest " that currently poisons the atmosphere at the un .
major members of the g-77 developing country bloc , such as india , would also be members of the democracy caucus .
this caucus could further a better understanding of what democracy is all about . when confronted with the opposition to his candidacy , the newly elected zimbabwean chair of the csd said that critics had the " right to their opinions . "
he added that " at the end of the day the majority rules as democracy does . "
once a vast majority of un members understands that this misses the very essence of liberal democracy we will have come a long way in living up to the ideals of the un .
as former un secretary-general kofi annan pointed out , " when the united nations can truly call itself a community of democracies , the charter 's noble ideals of protecting human rights and promoting ' social progress in larger freedoms ' will have been brought much closer . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 17.05.2007 eu , public shrug as poland keeps trying to curb journalists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the polish government is keeping a close eye on the country 's media poland 's intellectuals are feeling the heat as the government vows to push through a controversial new law designed to purge communists from public life .
but so far , criticism has been faint . the organization " reporters without borders " ranks poland 58th in its press freedom index of 168 countries .
among the 27 eu member states , it holds the lowest position . the group said it has observed a strong increase in censorship by poland 's conservative government .
the latest attempt involves plans announced earlier this month by the parliament 's new speaker , ludwik dorn , to classify parliamentary journalists .
under the system , certain groups of journalists would have certain reporting privileges and access to politicians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslaw kaczynski , here with german chancellor angela merkel , has n't given up yet dorn , a key ally of poland 's ruling kaczynski twins , said the division would better organize parliamentary work and " avert chaos . "
yet polish journalists disagreed . " dorn should rather read the constitution and what it says on journalists ' access to information , " stefan batorowski from the polish journalists association told polish media . government will continue its efforts polish journalists have been feeling increased government pressure to toe the official line .
all of the country 's journalists were to be screened as part of the government 's controversial vetting law , which it said was aimed at purging public life of ex-communist agents .
but last week , the constitutional court threw a spanner in the works . the judges ruled that most of the government 's planned law was unconstitutional .
it would have required some 700,000 poles to file statements saying whether they had collaborated with the communist-era secret police . those affected included practically all of the country 's intellectuals and included journalists , managers of listed state-owned firms and principals of private schools . people who failed to comply risked losing their jobs and a 10-year professional ban .
the legislation had been an extension of a decade-old vetting law that previously applied to only 30,000 lawmakers , government ministers and judges . while the government grudgingly accepted the court 's decision , formalizing it on tuesday , the battle is n't over . prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , the twin brother of president lech kaczynski , said work was to begin on a new law designed to purge communists from public life .
new legislation would be in accordance with the constitution , he said . clearer international communication is necessary the kaczynski twins have made it clear in their governing style that they want to centralize power .
as a result , some observers have asked why there is n't more of an outcry in the eu regarding legislation such as the vetting law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are the minds of polish intellectuals being x-rayed ?
" of course , every country has the legal and political right to regulate domestic policies themselves , " said stephen bastos from the german council on foreign relations in berlin . but , bastos said , this case was different . " when it is apparent that coming to terms with the past is being politically exploited , " then better international communication is needed , bastos said .
" this is to a large degree the case here . " eu criticism has not been successful in the past yet the eu is reserved .
after all , it has burned its fingers in the past for criticizing a member state 's domestic affairs , said sebastian kurpas from the center for european policy studies in brussels . back in 2000 , for example , eu member states threatened to cut all official ties to austria if the conservative people 's party -lrb- övp -rrb- formed a coalition government with the far-right freedom party -lrb- fpö -rrb- .

but can the dresden music festival be spared from the curse of mediocrity ? now in its 30th season , the dresden music festival opens on thursday .
over the two weeks , a host of internationally acclaimed performers - including pianist alfred brendel , cellist heinrich schiff and violinist gidon kremer - are set to make appearances in the eastern german city .
the festival will start with a sing-along performance , as it does each year .
this year it will be joseph haydn 's " four seasons " oratorio . it will also feature a wide range of events on its program including musical theater , dance , jazz , film , literature and visual arts .
despite the star power on this year 's program , the festival has seen better days .
" the most visited classical music festival in germany is dropping into the middle class , " festival director hartmut haenchen said in an interview with german news agency dpa .
the city of dresden has cut the festival budget by 30 percent , forcing organizers to slim down the program to 64 events - compared to 108 in 2006 .
endangered landscapes this year 's festival revolves around the theme of " landscapes . "
expert-led excursions are on offer , including a trip into dresden 's own natural landscape , the unesco protected elbe valley .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the elbe valley was added to the unesco list in 2004 the area is currently in danger of losing its status on the list of unesco world heritage sites due to a controversial bridge being built across the valley .
the bridge had been approved by a local referendum in 2005 , but unesco said it would consider removing dresden from its list of 830 world heritage sites because the modern construction would have " a serious impact on the integrity of the landscape " of the city . city leaders in saxony 's capital tried to back-pedal on the bridge project , but their efforts were stalled by a court decision upholding the plebiscite .
" it irritates me that politicians think so short-term , " haenchen said about the 106 million euro -lrb- $ 203 million -rrb- bridge project .
many believe that dresden - being known internationally as a city of culture - should invest more in the festival .
" the city has enough bridges , " wrote german web site klassik.com in the aftermath of the 2006 festival .
gdr 's most prestigious classical festival bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renowned pianist alfred brendel will perform works from 19th century vienna founded in 1978 by east germany 's communist party , the dresden music festival became the gdr 's most prestigious classical festival and attracted a great deal of attention from abroad .
world-class soloists like marilyn horne and dietrich fischer-diskau as well as top conductors like claudio abbado and zubin mehta came to the elbe river city to share their talents .
after germany 's reunification , the dresden music festival continued to prosper , peaking in 2003 with a record 150,000 visitors .
some 140,000 music lovers attended the event last year , but haenchen said he fears the number could drop to as few as 70,000 attendees this year .
" people play mozart for cows so they give more milk , " haenchen .
" with people , that potential is not being tapped .

" the most visited classical music festival in germany is dropping into the middle class , " festival director hartmut haenchen said in an interview with german news agency dpa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 17.05.2007 opinion : united nations of democracies and dictatorships ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the increasing role of non-democracies in key un bodies lead observers to wonder how the un can live up to its ideals .
the us and the eu should turn to the old-fashioned tools of diplomacy , argues thorsten benner . last friday , the un commission on sustainable development -lrb- csd -rrb- elected zimbabwe as its next chair .
much to their chagrin , eu countries , the us and canada were outvoted in their opposition against installing mugabe 's repressive regime as chair of this major -lrb- even though for the most part dysfunctional -rrb- un body .
the uk representative emphasized that for zimbabwe to chair the " commission , while -lsb- mugabe 's -rsb- own people suffer the appalling consequences of -lsb- zimbabwe 's -rsb- government policies , is wholly inconsistent with the commission 's aims .
it damages the credibility of the commission itself and its ability to deal with issues affecting the livelihoods of millions from the poorest countries . "
this thursday , belarus , egypt and angola seek membership of the un human rights council .
all three hardly live up to the criteria set out for membership in the new un human rights body : " contribution to the promotion and protection of human rights and -lsb- its -rsb- voluntary pledges and commitments made thereto . "
maintain the status quo ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thorsten benner what strategy should democracies choose with regard to the role of dictatorships in un bodies ?
" simply accept it as a fact of life " is the first option recommended by many , especially the members of the group of 77 -lrb- g77 -rrb- developing country bloc at the un .
sudan 's un ambassador abdalmahmood abdalhaleem , for example , argues that it is the " right of regional groups to choose whoever they want . "
he can refer to the un charter to support his point .
the charter states prominently that the un " is based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its members . "
democracy at the un means " one country , one vote . "
it is not for others to question how sovereign members exercise their right to vote .
case closed .
a second option is based on the exact opposite view .
it argues that the role of dictatorships undermines the credibility and effectiveness of the un so that it is necessary to create alternatives .
introduce a " democracies only " club ?
us senator and presidential candidate john mccain advocates " bringing democratic peoples and nations from around the world into one common organization , a worldwide league of democracies . -lrb- … -rrb- the new league of democracies would form the core of an international order of peace based on freedom .
it could act where the un fails to act , to relieve human suffering in places like darfur . "
both options - accepting the status quo and creating a new " democracies only " club outside the un - are short-sighted .
simply acquiescing to the prominent role of dictatorships in un bodies threatens to further undermine the standing of the united nations in key countries that account for the vast majority of contributions to the un budget , especially the us .
it also undermines the credibility of the un as a whole to stand up for the ideals enshrined in its charter .
forming a " league of democracies " outside the un throws the baby out with the bathwater .
a world organization of only democracies could not supplant the united nations .
this would amount to the same as restricting diplomacy to friendly and like-minded countries , while missing out on the very essence of the business of diplomacy .
old-fashioned tools we need an alternative strategy within the un to further human rights and democracy .
first of all , democracies need to use the old-fashioned tools of diplomacy to reverse the trend of the increasing prominence of dictatorships in un bodies .
the eu and the us in particular should use the powers of moral suasion as well as hard economic and political incentives to ease individual developing countries out of the block of irresponsible voters .
there is no inevitability for countries such as south africa or argentina to side with serial human rights abusers .
while engaging in diplomacy , the us , the eu and other democracies should be respectful in demeanour and firm on principles .
they should make it clear that they are not willing to tolerate serial abuses of the goals of the un on human rights .
the german foreign minister did exactly that earlier this year in his address to the un human rights council on behalf of the eu .
he argued that " it is not acceptable that very serious human rights violations are not addressed - or are not addressed with the necessary directness - because regional or ideological solidarity takes precedence over the willingness to see critical situations without bias . "
aiming for a " community of democracies " establishing a " democracy caucus " within the un would be another important element of a winning strategy .
a democracy caucus would offer a complement to regional and other blocs within the un for cooperation on resolutions and initiatives .
this democracy caucus could also contribute to moving away from the confrontation between the " west vs. the rest " that currently poisons the atmosphere at the un .
major members of the g-77 developing country bloc , such as india , would also be members of the democracy caucus .
this caucus could further a better understanding of what democracy is all about . when confronted with the opposition to his candidacy , the newly elected zimbabwean chair of the csd said that critics had the " right to their opinions . "
he added that " at the end of the day the majority rules as democracy does . "
once a vast majority of un members understands that this misses the very essence of liberal democracy we will have come a long way in living up to the ideals of the un .
as former un secretary-general kofi annan pointed out , " when the united nations can truly call itself a community of democracies , the charter 's noble ideals of protecting human rights and promoting ' social progress in larger freedoms ' will have been brought much closer . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 17.05.2007 eu , public shrug as poland keeps trying to curb journalists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the polish government is keeping a close eye on the country 's media poland 's intellectuals are feeling the heat as the government vows to push through a controversial new law designed to purge communists from public life .
but so far , criticism has been faint . the organization " reporters without borders " ranks poland 58th in its press freedom index of 168 countries .
among the 27 eu member states , it holds the lowest position . the group said it has observed a strong increase in censorship by poland 's conservative government .
the latest attempt involves plans announced earlier this month by the parliament 's new speaker , ludwik dorn , to classify parliamentary journalists .
under the system , certain groups of journalists would have certain reporting privileges and access to politicians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslaw kaczynski , here with german chancellor angela merkel , has n't given up yet dorn , a key ally of poland 's ruling kaczynski twins , said the division would better organize parliamentary work and " avert chaos . "
yet polish journalists disagreed . " dorn should rather read the constitution and what it says on journalists ' access to information , " stefan batorowski from the polish journalists association told polish media . government will continue its efforts polish journalists have been feeling increased government pressure to toe the official line .
all of the country 's journalists were to be screened as part of the government 's controversial vetting law , which it said was aimed at purging public life of ex-communist agents .
but last week , the constitutional court threw a spanner in the works . the judges ruled that most of the government 's planned law was unconstitutional .
it would have required some 700,000 poles to file statements saying whether they had collaborated with the communist-era secret police . those affected included practically all of the country 's intellectuals and included journalists , managers of listed state-owned firms and principals of private schools . people who failed to comply risked losing their jobs and a 10-year professional ban .
the legislation had been an extension of a decade-old vetting law that previously applied to only 30,000 lawmakers , government ministers and judges . while the government grudgingly accepted the court 's decision , formalizing it on tuesday , the battle is n't over . prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , the twin brother of president lech kaczynski , said work was to begin on a new law designed to purge communists from public life .
new legislation would be in accordance with the constitution , he said . clearer international communication is necessary the kaczynski twins have made it clear in their governing style that they want to centralize power .
as a result , some observers have asked why there is n't more of an outcry in the eu regarding legislation such as the vetting law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are the minds of polish intellectuals being x-rayed ?
" of course , every country has the legal and political right to regulate domestic policies themselves , " said stephen bastos from the german council on foreign relations in berlin . but , bastos said , this case was different . " when it is apparent that coming to terms with the past is being politically exploited , " then better international communication is needed , bastos said .
" this is to a large degree the case here . " eu criticism has not been successful in the past yet the eu is reserved .
after all , it has burned its fingers in the past for criticizing a member state 's domestic affairs , said sebastian kurpas from the center for european policy studies in brussels . back in 2000 , for example , eu member states threatened to cut all official ties to austria if the conservative people 's party -lrb- övp -rrb- formed a coalition government with the far-right freedom party -lrb- fpö -rrb- . " they really shot themselves in the foot with austria , " kurpas said .
the övp-fpö coalition government took office and after a few months of chilly diplomatic relations , things returned to normal . " the experience with austria really backfired and showed what limited possibilities exist , " kurpas said . in poland , a feeling of ' we 're doing fine ' even in poland there has been noticeably little resistance to the kaczynski government 's policies . " there are no protests , though there is a massive polarization among the population , " said bastos .
yet effective political opposition was lacking , he said . " also , the economy is going doing relatively well and the national rhetoric is leaving the economy alone , " bastos said .
a feeling of " we 're doing fine " existed among the people , he added . on an eu level , the bloc does n't need any bad blood with poland either . " there are enough problems right now in terms of the european constitution , as well as strained relations to russia to deal with , " kurpas said . germany , which holds the rotating eu presidency , needs poland on its side at the european council meeting in brussels in june . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , russia play down differences , but hurdles remain german foreign minister steinmeier met russian president putin on tuesday in a last-ditch bid to rescue a looming eu-russia summit amid spiraling tensions over a host of issues .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 17.05.2007 opinion : united nations of democracies and dictatorships ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the increasing role of non-democracies in key un bodies lead observers to wonder how the un can live up to its ideals .
the us and the eu should turn to the old-fashioned tools of diplomacy , argues thorsten benner . last friday , the un commission on sustainable development -lrb- csd -rrb- elected zimbabwe as its next chair .
much to their chagrin , eu countries , the us and canada were outvoted in their opposition against installing mugabe 's repressive regime as chair of this major -lrb- even though for the most part dysfunctional -rrb- un body .
the uk representative emphasized that for zimbabwe to chair the " commission , while -lsb- mugabe 's -rsb- own people suffer the appalling consequences of -lsb- zimbabwe 's -rsb- government policies , is wholly inconsistent with the commission 's aims .
it damages the credibility of the commission itself and its ability to deal with issues affecting the livelihoods of millions from the poorest countries . "
this thursday , belarus , egypt and angola seek membership of the un human rights council .
all three hardly live up to the criteria set out for membership in the new un human rights body : " contribution to the promotion and protection of human rights and -lsb- its -rsb- voluntary pledges and commitments made thereto . "
maintain the status quo ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thorsten benner what strategy should democracies choose with regard to the role of dictatorships in un bodies ?
" simply accept it as a fact of life " is the first option recommended by many , especially the members of the group of 77 -lrb- g77 -rrb- developing country bloc at the un .
sudan 's un ambassador abdalmahmood abdalhaleem , for example , argues that it is the " right of regional groups to choose whoever they want . "
he can refer to the un charter to support his point .
the charter states prominently that the un " is based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its members . "
democracy at the un means " one country , one vote . "
it is not for others to question how sovereign members exercise their right to vote .
case closed .
a second option is based on the exact opposite view .
it argues that the role of dictatorships undermines the credibility and effectiveness of the un so that it is necessary to create alternatives .
introduce a " democracies only " club ?
us senator and presidential candidate john mccain advocates " bringing democratic peoples and nations from around the world into one common organization , a worldwide league of democracies . -lrb- … -rrb- the new league of democracies would form the core of an international order of peace based on freedom .
it could act where the un fails to act , to relieve human suffering in places like darfur . "
both options - accepting the status quo and creating a new " democracies only " club outside the un - are short-sighted .
simply acquiescing to the prominent role of dictatorships in un bodies threatens to further undermine the standing of the united nations in key countries that account for the vast majority of contributions to the un budget , especially the us .
it also undermines the credibility of the un as a whole to stand up for the ideals enshrined in its charter .
forming a " league of democracies " outside the un throws the baby out with the bathwater .
a world organization of only democracies could not supplant the united nations .
this would amount to the same as restricting diplomacy to friendly and like-minded countries , while missing out on the very essence of the business of diplomacy .
old-fashioned tools we need an alternative strategy within the un to further human rights and democracy .
first of all , democracies need to use the old-fashioned tools of diplomacy to reverse the trend of the increasing prominence of dictatorships in un bodies .
the eu and the us in particular should use the powers of moral suasion as well as hard economic and political incentives to ease individual developing countries out of the block of irresponsible voters .
there is no inevitability for countries such as south africa or argentina to side with serial human rights abusers .
while engaging in diplomacy , the us , the eu and other democracies should be respectful in demeanour and firm on principles .
they should make it clear that they are not willing to tolerate serial abuses of the goals of the un on human rights .
the german foreign minister did exactly that earlier this year in his address to the un human rights council on behalf of the eu .
he argued that " it is not acceptable that very serious human rights violations are not addressed - or are not addressed with the necessary directness - because regional or ideological solidarity takes precedence over the willingness to see critical situations without bias . "
aiming for a " community of democracies " establishing a " democracy caucus " within the un would be another important element of a winning strategy .
a democracy caucus would offer a complement to regional and other blocs within the un for cooperation on resolutions and initiatives .
this democracy caucus could also contribute to moving away from the confrontation between the " west vs. the rest " that currently poisons the atmosphere at the un .
major members of the g-77 developing country bloc , such as india , would also be members of the democracy caucus .
this caucus could further a better understanding of what democracy is all about . when confronted with the opposition to his candidacy , the newly elected zimbabwean chair of the csd said that critics had the " right to their opinions . "
he added that " at the end of the day the majority rules as democracy does . "
once a vast majority of un members understands that this misses the very essence of liberal democracy we will have come a long way in living up to the ideals of the un .
as former un secretary-general kofi annan pointed out , " when the united nations can truly call itself a community of democracies , the charter 's noble ideals of protecting human rights and promoting ' social progress in larger freedoms ' will have been brought much closer . "
thorsten benner is associate director of the global public policy institute -lrb- gppi -rrb- in berlin , an independent think tank focussed on effective and accountable governance and the reform of international organizations . -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de from africa to germany , blogs reflect a globalized world as the number of blogs around the world continues to climb , many blogs focusing on local issues are gaining a global audience in this hyper-connected media landscape .

a statement by the police said el-masri was " under urgent suspicions of setting fire " at the entrance of a wholesale market after having destroyed the glass door .
a judge ordered that el-masri be held in the psychiatric ward of a local hospital pending investigations into the blaze , which caused damage worth 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 675,000 -rrb- . masri 's lawyer , manfred gnjidic , said thursday that his client 's act had been a gesture of despair after a dispute with the store concerned had got out of hand .

the us and the eu should turn to the old-fashioned tools of diplomacy , argues thorsten benner . last friday , the un commission on sustainable development -lrb- csd -rrb- elected zimbabwe as its next chair .
much to their chagrin , eu countries , the us and canada were outvoted in their opposition against installing mugabe 's repressive regime as chair of this major -lrb- even though for the most part dysfunctional -rrb- un body .
the uk representative emphasized that for zimbabwe to chair the " commission , while -lsb- mugabe 's -rsb- own people suffer the appalling consequences of -lsb- zimbabwe 's -rsb- government policies , is wholly inconsistent with the commission 's aims .
it damages the credibility of the commission itself and its ability to deal with issues affecting the livelihoods of millions from the poorest countries . "
this thursday , belarus , egypt and angola seek membership of the un human rights council .
all three hardly live up to the criteria set out for membership in the new un human rights body : " contribution to the promotion and protection of human rights and -lsb- its -rsb- voluntary pledges and commitments made thereto . "
maintain the status quo ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thorsten benner what strategy should democracies choose with regard to the role of dictatorships in un bodies ?
" simply accept it as a fact of life " is the first option recommended by many , especially the members of the group of 77 -lrb- g77 -rrb- developing country bloc at the un .
sudan 's un ambassador abdalmahmood abdalhaleem , for example , argues that it is the " right of regional groups to choose whoever they want . "
he can refer to the un charter to support his point .
the charter states prominently that the un " is based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its members . "
democracy at the un means " one country , one vote . "
it is not for others to question how sovereign members exercise their right to vote .
case closed .
a second option is based on the exact opposite view .
it argues that the role of dictatorships undermines the credibility and effectiveness of the un so that it is necessary to create alternatives .
introduce a " democracies only " club ?
us senator and presidential candidate john mccain advocates " bringing democratic peoples and nations from around the world into one common organization , a worldwide league of democracies . -lrb- … -rrb- the new league of democracies would form the core of an international order of peace based on freedom .
it could act where the un fails to act , to relieve human suffering in places like darfur . "
both options - accepting the status quo and creating a new " democracies only " club outside the un - are short-sighted .
simply acquiescing to the prominent role of dictatorships in un bodies threatens to further undermine the standing of the united nations in key countries that account for the vast majority of contributions to the un budget , especially the us .
it also undermines the credibility of the un as a whole to stand up for the ideals enshrined in its charter .
forming a " league of democracies " outside the un throws the baby out with the bathwater .
a world organization of only democracies could not supplant the united nations .
this would amount to the same as restricting diplomacy to friendly and like-minded countries , while missing out on the very essence of the business of diplomacy .
old-fashioned tools we need an alternative strategy within the un to further human rights and democracy .
first of all , democracies need to use the old-fashioned tools of diplomacy to reverse the trend of the increasing prominence of dictatorships in un bodies .
the eu and the us in particular should use the powers of moral suasion as well as hard economic and political incentives to ease individual developing countries out of the block of irresponsible voters .
there is no inevitability for countries such as south africa or argentina to side with serial human rights abusers .
while engaging in diplomacy , the us , the eu and other democracies should be respectful in demeanour and firm on principles .
they should make it clear that they are not willing to tolerate serial abuses of the goals of the un on human rights .
the german foreign minister did exactly that earlier this year in his address to the un human rights council on behalf of the eu .
he argued that " it is not acceptable that very serious human rights violations are not addressed - or are not addressed with the necessary directness - because regional or ideological solidarity takes precedence over the willingness to see critical situations without bias . "
aiming for a " community of democracies " establishing a " democracy caucus " within the un would be another important element of a winning strategy .
a democracy caucus would offer a complement to regional and other blocs within the un for cooperation on resolutions and initiatives .
this democracy caucus could also contribute to moving away from the confrontation between the " west vs. the rest " that currently poisons the atmosphere at the un .
major members of the g-77 developing country bloc , such as india , would also be members of the democracy caucus .
this caucus could further a better understanding of what democracy is all about . when confronted with the opposition to his candidacy , the newly elected zimbabwean chair of the csd said that critics had the " right to their opinions . "
he added that " at the end of the day the majority rules as democracy does . "
once a vast majority of un members understands that this misses the very essence of liberal democracy we will have come a long way in living up to the ideals of the un .
as former un secretary-general kofi annan pointed out , " when the united nations can truly call itself a community of democracies , the charter 's noble ideals of protecting human rights and promoting ' social progress in larger freedoms ' will have been brought much closer . "

but so far , criticism has been faint . the organization " reporters without borders " ranks poland 58th in its press freedom index of 168 countries .
among the 27 eu member states , it holds the lowest position . the group said it has observed a strong increase in censorship by poland 's conservative government .
the latest attempt involves plans announced earlier this month by the parliament 's new speaker , ludwik dorn , to classify parliamentary journalists .
under the system , certain groups of journalists would have certain reporting privileges and access to politicians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslaw kaczynski , here with german chancellor angela merkel , has n't given up yet dorn , a key ally of poland 's ruling kaczynski twins , said the division would better organize parliamentary work and " avert chaos . "
yet polish journalists disagreed . " dorn should rather read the constitution and what it says on journalists ' access to information , " stefan batorowski from the polish journalists association told polish media . government will continue its efforts polish journalists have been feeling increased government pressure to toe the official line .
all of the country 's journalists were to be screened as part of the government 's controversial vetting law , which it said was aimed at purging public life of ex-communist agents .
but last week , the constitutional court threw a spanner in the works . the judges ruled that most of the government 's planned law was unconstitutional .
it would have required some 700,000 poles to file statements saying whether they had collaborated with the communist-era secret police . those affected included practically all of the country 's intellectuals and included journalists , managers of listed state-owned firms and principals of private schools . people who failed to comply risked losing their jobs and a 10-year professional ban .
the legislation had been an extension of a decade-old vetting law that previously applied to only 30,000 lawmakers , government ministers and judges . while the government grudgingly accepted the court 's decision , formalizing it on tuesday , the battle is n't over . prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , the twin brother of president lech kaczynski , said work was to begin on a new law designed to purge communists from public life .
new legislation would be in accordance with the constitution , he said . clearer international communication is necessary the kaczynski twins have made it clear in their governing style that they want to centralize power .
as a result , some observers have asked why there is n't more of an outcry in the eu regarding legislation such as the vetting law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are the minds of polish intellectuals being x-rayed ?
" of course , every country has the legal and political right to regulate domestic policies themselves , " said stephen bastos from the german council on foreign relations in berlin . but , bastos said , this case was different . " when it is apparent that coming to terms with the past is being politically exploited , " then better international communication is needed , bastos said .
" this is to a large degree the case here . " eu criticism has not been successful in the past yet the eu is reserved .
after all , it has burned its fingers in the past for criticizing a member state 's domestic affairs , said sebastian kurpas from the center for european policy studies in brussels . back in 2000 , for example , eu member states threatened to cut all official ties to austria if the conservative people 's party -lrb- övp -rrb- formed a coalition government with the far-right freedom party -lrb- fpö -rrb- . " they really shot themselves in the foot with austria , " kurpas said .
the övp-fpö coalition government took office and after a few months of chilly diplomatic relations , things returned to normal . " the experience with austria really backfired and showed what limited possibilities exist , " kurpas said . in poland , a feeling of ' we 're doing fine ' even in poland there has been noticeably little resistance to the kaczynski government 's policies . " there are no protests , though there is a massive polarization among the population , " said bastos .
yet effective political opposition was lacking , he said . " also , the economy is going doing relatively well and the national rhetoric is leaving the economy alone , " bastos said .
a feeling of " we 're doing fine " existed among the people , he added . on an eu level , the bloc does n't need any bad blood with poland either . " there are enough problems right now in terms of the european constitution , as well as strained relations to russia to deal with , " kurpas said . germany , which holds the rotating eu presidency , needs poland on its side at the european council meeting in brussels in june . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu , russia play down differences , but hurdles remain german foreign minister steinmeier met russian president putin on tuesday in a last-ditch bid to rescue a looming eu-russia summit amid spiraling tensions over a host of issues .

the us and the eu should turn to the old-fashioned tools of diplomacy , argues thorsten benner . last friday , the un commission on sustainable development -lrb- csd -rrb- elected zimbabwe as its next chair .
much to their chagrin , eu countries , the us and canada were outvoted in their opposition against installing mugabe 's repressive regime as chair of this major -lrb- even though for the most part dysfunctional -rrb- un body .
the uk representative emphasized that for zimbabwe to chair the " commission , while -lsb- mugabe 's -rsb- own people suffer the appalling consequences of -lsb- zimbabwe 's -rsb- government policies , is wholly inconsistent with the commission 's aims .
it damages the credibility of the commission itself and its ability to deal with issues affecting the livelihoods of millions from the poorest countries . "
this thursday , belarus , egypt and angola seek membership of the un human rights council .
all three hardly live up to the criteria set out for membership in the new un human rights body : " contribution to the promotion and protection of human rights and -lsb- its -rsb- voluntary pledges and commitments made thereto . "
maintain the status quo ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thorsten benner what strategy should democracies choose with regard to the role of dictatorships in un bodies ?
" simply accept it as a fact of life " is the first option recommended by many , especially the members of the group of 77 -lrb- g77 -rrb- developing country bloc at the un .
sudan 's un ambassador abdalmahmood abdalhaleem , for example , argues that it is the " right of regional groups to choose whoever they want . "
he can refer to the un charter to support his point .
the charter states prominently that the un " is based on the principle of the sovereign equality of all its members . "
democracy at the un means " one country , one vote . "
it is not for others to question how sovereign members exercise their right to vote .
case closed .
a second option is based on the exact opposite view .
it argues that the role of dictatorships undermines the credibility and effectiveness of the un so that it is necessary to create alternatives .
introduce a " democracies only " club ?
us senator and presidential candidate john mccain advocates " bringing democratic peoples and nations from around the world into one common organization , a worldwide league of democracies . -lrb- … -rrb- the new league of democracies would form the core of an international order of peace based on freedom .
it could act where the un fails to act , to relieve human suffering in places like darfur . "
both options - accepting the status quo and creating a new " democracies only " club outside the un - are short-sighted .
simply acquiescing to the prominent role of dictatorships in un bodies threatens to further undermine the standing of the united nations in key countries that account for the vast majority of contributions to the un budget , especially the us .
it also undermines the credibility of the un as a whole to stand up for the ideals enshrined in its charter .
forming a " league of democracies " outside the un throws the baby out with the bathwater .
a world organization of only democracies could not supplant the united nations .
this would amount to the same as restricting diplomacy to friendly and like-minded countries , while missing out on the very essence of the business of diplomacy .
old-fashioned tools we need an alternative strategy within the un to further human rights and democracy .
first of all , democracies need to use the old-fashioned tools of diplomacy to reverse the trend of the increasing prominence of dictatorships in un bodies .
the eu and the us in particular should use the powers of moral suasion as well as hard economic and political incentives to ease individual developing countries out of the block of irresponsible voters .
there is no inevitability for countries such as south africa or argentina to side with serial human rights abusers .
while engaging in diplomacy , the us , the eu and other democracies should be respectful in demeanour and firm on principles .
they should make it clear that they are not willing to tolerate serial abuses of the goals of the un on human rights .
the german foreign minister did exactly that earlier this year in his address to the un human rights council on behalf of the eu .
he argued that " it is not acceptable that very serious human rights violations are not addressed - or are not addressed with the necessary directness - because regional or ideological solidarity takes precedence over the willingness to see critical situations without bias . "
aiming for a " community of democracies " establishing a " democracy caucus " within the un would be another important element of a winning strategy .
a democracy caucus would offer a complement to regional and other blocs within the un for cooperation on resolutions and initiatives .
this democracy caucus could also contribute to moving away from the confrontation between the " west vs. the rest " that currently poisons the atmosphere at the un .
major members of the g-77 developing country bloc , such as india , would also be members of the democracy caucus .
this caucus could further a better understanding of what democracy is all about . when confronted with the opposition to his candidacy , the newly elected zimbabwean chair of the csd said that critics had the " right to their opinions . "
he added that " at the end of the day the majority rules as democracy does . "
once a vast majority of un members understands that this misses the very essence of liberal democracy we will have come a long way in living up to the ideals of the un .
as former un secretary-general kofi annan pointed out , " when the united nations can truly call itself a community of democracies , the charter 's noble ideals of protecting human rights and promoting ' social progress in larger freedoms ' will have been brought much closer . "

but can the dresden music festival be spared from the curse of mediocrity ? now in its 30th season , the dresden music festival opens on thursday .
over the two weeks , a host of internationally acclaimed performers - including pianist alfred brendel , cellist heinrich schiff and violinist gidon kremer - are set to make appearances in the eastern german city .
the festival will start with a sing-along performance , as it does each year .
this year it will be joseph haydn 's " four seasons " oratorio . it will also feature a wide range of events on its program including musical theater , dance , jazz , film , literature and visual arts .
despite the star power on this year 's program , the festival has seen better days .
" the most visited classical music festival in germany is dropping into the middle class , " festival director hartmut haenchen said in an interview with german news agency dpa .
the city of dresden has cut the festival budget by 30 percent , forcing organizers to slim down the program to 64 events - compared to 108 in 2006 .
endangered landscapes this year 's festival revolves around the theme of " landscapes . "
expert-led excursions are on offer , including a trip into dresden 's own natural landscape , the unesco protected elbe valley .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the elbe valley was added to the unesco list in 2004 the area is currently in danger of losing its status on the list of unesco world heritage sites due to a controversial bridge being built across the valley .
the bridge had been approved by a local referendum in 2005 , but unesco said it would consider removing dresden from its list of 830 world heritage sites because the modern construction would have " a serious impact on the integrity of the landscape " of the city . city leaders in saxony 's capital tried to back-pedal on the bridge project , but their efforts were stalled by a court decision upholding the plebiscite .
" it irritates me that politicians think so short-term , " haenchen said about the 106 million euro -lrb- $ 203 million -rrb- bridge project .
many believe that dresden - being known internationally as a city of culture - should invest more in the festival .
" the city has enough bridges , " wrote german web site klassik.com in the aftermath of the 2006 festival .
gdr 's most prestigious classical festival bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renowned pianist alfred brendel will perform works from 19th century vienna founded in 1978 by east germany 's communist party , the dresden music festival became the gdr 's most prestigious classical festival and attracted a great deal of attention from abroad .
world-class soloists like marilyn horne and dietrich fischer-diskau as well as top conductors like claudio abbado and zubin mehta came to the elbe river city to share their talents .
after germany 's reunification , the dresden music festival continued to prosper , peaking in 2003 with a record 150,000 visitors .
some 140,000 music lovers attended the event last year , but haenchen said he fears the number could drop to as few as 70,000 attendees this year .
" people play mozart for cows so they give more milk , " haenchen .
" with people , that potential is not being tapped .

with daimlerchrysler in divorce court , can benz make a comeback ? what 's in a name ?
a lot , according to conventional wisdom among corporate ceos .
nearly a decade ago , the highly touted " marriage of equals " between german high-end carmaker daimler-benz and us standard-bearer chrysler nearly ran aground amid disagreement over which of the two partners would get top billing in the corporate identity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car inventor karl benz is not getting his propers , some say daimler won out -lrb- thus the company was called daimlerchrysler , not chryslerdaimler -rrb- .
but in doing so , it sacrificed benz , a part of its identity that goes back to the creation of the firm .
now , some folks are arguing that giving up its heritage - carl benz was the inventor of the first automobile , after all - was a mistake .
with the newly spun-off german arm of daimlerchrysler seeking a revamped corporate identity , a war of words has broken out in the state of baden-württemberg . people from the region of baden - where carl benz was born - are upset that those in stuttgart -lrb- in württemberg , and the town where daimler ag is headquartered -rrb- have gotten all the glory , and are keeping it .
town agitates to revive " benz " " in stuttgart … they should n't forget that it was n't gottlieb daimler , but carl benz who invented the automobile , " a worker at the daimlerchrysler factory in mannheim told dpa news service .
meanwhile , administrators in the town of mannheim -lrb- located in the baden region of baden-württemberg -rrb- are doing their best to encourage daimler ag leader dieter zetsche to reclaim the benz name , the associated press has reported .
" through the planned separation from chrysler , there is a chance to bring the old daimler-benz name back to life , " said a declaration from the local council of mannheim .
and daimler ag headquarters also reported a number of calls of people who wanted to get the benz name back , ap said .
concerns over corporate confusion marina raptis , a spokeswoman for daimler ag , told ap any name change would need to be addressed at an extraordinary general meeting in the autumn .
suggestions would need to be examined with several factors in mind , including property rights and legal and strategic issues , she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gottlieb daimler merged his firm with benz 's in 1926 she noted that the daimler name is well known and serves as an over-arching identity .
names like mercedes-benz ag or daimler-benz ag could mix corporate and product identities , which could harm the company 's position on the product market , raptis argued .
" our suggested and preferred name , daimler ag , attaches us to tradition , but shows a clear direction forward , " raptis said .
the suggested name is not meant to be a slight to benz , she said .
" the history and tradition of our company , as well as the brand mercedes benz will always be tied to carl benz . ...
without carl benz and gottlieb daimler , our company would not exist , " she said .
no one denies that benz 's invention hit the pavement before that of his competitor daimler .
that fact has left some people especially eager to see the name benz back in the company logo .
baden-based politician karl lamers argued that the name benz is the " starting point for today 's international auto concern . "
and the mayor of the city of karlsruhe , heinz fenrich , reminded daimler chief dieter zetsche that benz " got the world on wheels . "
mrs. benz 's famous ride the hybrid name daimler-benz itself came about as a result of an even earlier corporate history of merger and survival .
in 1883 , benz founded the " benz & co .
rhineland gas motor factory " in the town of mannheim .
he patented a single-stroke , four-cylinder engine in january 1886 .
in july of that year , he hooked it to a three-wheel carriage and sent it on its inaugural drive .

but can the dresden music festival be spared from the curse of mediocrity ? now in its 30th season , the dresden music festival opens on thursday .
over the two weeks , a host of internationally acclaimed performers - including pianist alfred brendel , cellist heinrich schiff and violinist gidon kremer - are set to make appearances in the eastern german city .
the festival will start with a sing-along performance , as it does each year .
this year it will be joseph haydn 's " four seasons " oratorio . it will also feature a wide range of events on its program including musical theater , dance , jazz , film , literature and visual arts .
despite the star power on this year 's program , the festival has seen better days .
" the most visited classical music festival in germany is dropping into the middle class , " festival director hartmut haenchen said in an interview with german news agency dpa .
the city of dresden has cut the festival budget by 30 percent , forcing organizers to slim down the program to 64 events - compared to 108 in 2006 .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the elbe valley was added to the unesco list in 2004 the area is currently in danger of losing its status on the list of unesco world heritage sites due to a controversial bridge being built across the valley .
the bridge had been approved by a local referendum in 2005 , but unesco said it would consider removing dresden from its list of 830 world heritage sites because the modern construction would have " a serious impact on the integrity of the landscape " of the city . city leaders in saxony 's capital tried to back-pedal on the bridge project , but their efforts were stalled by a court decision upholding the plebiscite .
" it irritates me that politicians think so short-term , " haenchen said about the 106 million euro -lrb- $ 203 million -rrb- bridge project .
many believe that dresden - being known internationally as a city of culture - should invest more in the festival .
" the city has enough bridges , " wrote german web site klassik.com in the aftermath of the 2006 festival .

world-class soloists like marilyn horne and dietrich fischer-diskau as well as top conductors like claudio abbado and zubin mehta came to the elbe river city to share their talents .
after germany 's reunification , the dresden music festival continued to prosper , peaking in 2003 with a record 150,000 visitors .
some 140,000 music lovers attended the event last year , but haenchen said he fears the number could drop to as few as 70,000 attendees this year .

fillon , a 53-year-old senator from the ruling ump party who worked closely with sarkozy on his election campaign , has crucial experience in pensions reform which will be a key asset to the new government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outgoing french pm de villepin held the post since 2005 the appointment was announced in a presidential statement a day after sarkozy took over as head of state from jacques chirac .
sarkozy is to announce the rest of his 15-member cabinet lineup on friday . fillon 's predecessor , dominique de villepin , presented his resignation on tuesday to chirac ahead of the handover of power to sarkozy , who has pledged to carry out deep social and economic reform .
fillon made his mark as a reformer as social affairs minister under chirac , from 2002 to 2004 , when he carried out an overhaul of france 's pension system , facing down million-strong street protests . low-key meets high energy ironically , in a book in 2006 , fillon had argued for abolishing the post of premier , while advocating a strong presidential-style of rule .
and during the election campaign , sarkozy himself had said that the premier should only " coordinate the work of the government " and should not share power with the head of state .
sarkozy 's jogging partner throughout the campaign , fillon has a low-key demeanor that is often described as complementary to sarkozy 's hyper-active style . speed was apparently of the essence on wednesday , when sarkozy - in a possibly record-breaking move - landed in berlin for his first official state visit , a mere six hours after he was sworn in to office .

' sacred ' friendship " i want to say to the german people that the friendship between france and germany is sacred and that nothing can call it into doubt , " he said . for her part , merkel thanked sarkozy for his speedy visit .
the gesture made it clear how much the two countries need one another , she said . sarkozy said he thinks it is crucial to attack europe 's problems as quickly as possible . " waiting too long just makes this more complicated , " he said , referring particularly to plans for a new eu constitution . " the first urgent task is to free europe from its current paralysis .

but can the dresden music festival be spared from the curse of mediocrity ? now in its 30th season , the dresden music festival opens on thursday .
over the two weeks , a host of internationally acclaimed performers - including pianist alfred brendel , cellist heinrich schiff and violinist gidon kremer - are set to make appearances in the eastern german city .
the festival will start with a sing-along performance , as it does each year .
this year it will be joseph haydn 's " four seasons " oratorio . it will also feature a wide range of events on its program including musical theater , dance , jazz , film , literature and visual arts .
despite the star power on this year 's program , the festival has seen better days .
" the most visited classical music festival in germany is dropping into the middle class , " festival director hartmut haenchen said in an interview with german news agency dpa .
the city of dresden has cut the festival budget by 30 percent , forcing organizers to slim down the program to 64 events - compared to 108 in 2006 .

the bridge had been approved by a local referendum in 2005 , but unesco said it would consider removing dresden from its list of 830 world heritage sites because the modern construction would have " a serious impact on the integrity of the landscape " of the city . city leaders in saxony 's capital tried to back-pedal on the bridge project , but their efforts were stalled by a court decision upholding the plebiscite .
" it irritates me that politicians think so short-term , " haenchen said about the 106 million euro -lrb- $ 203 million -rrb- bridge project .
many believe that dresden - being known internationally as a city of culture - should invest more in the festival .

after germany 's reunification , the dresden music festival continued to prosper , peaking in 2003 with a record 150,000 visitors .

" the european union is a union of 27 member states and we take decisions based on solidarity .
i came here of course with this spirit of defending european interests in that sense of solidarity , " barroso said .
speaking to reporters after his arrival in samara , a regional centre , he said he would hold " a frank and open discussion " with putin at the summit but did not expect any breakthroughs .
" i am not expecting , honestly , anything spectacular from this meeting , " barroso said . merkel also called for dialogue with moscow , saying ahead of the talks : " russia and the european union are interdependent .
it 's always good to speak to each other rather than talking about each other . "
the summit 's main consultations were set for friday at the volzhsky utyos -lrb- volga cliff -rrb- resort complex , southeast of moscow , but the agenda was limited because of ongoing diplomatic and trade disputes .
" a difficult time " " this summit is taking place at a difficult time , " a german government official told reporters in berlin this week .
" but if we want a strategic partnership with russia it 's important that we talk even during difficult times . "
even if there is no narrowing of differences , both sides will get a better idea of each other 's positions , he said .
eu officials said talks would touch on international issues such as the future status of kosovo and iran 's nuclear programme , as well as russia 's bid to join the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- this year .
but negotiations on a key partnership agreement that governs eu-russia relations , including in the vitally important energy sphere , have been held up because of a trade row between eu member poland and russia .

russia 's wto bid the row with poland and a bitter war of words with estonia over a soviet memorial in tallinn have highlighted still-tense relations between moscow and formerly soviet-dominated central europe .
after a recent blockade of the estonian embassy in moscow , and violent scenes at a news conference given by the estonian ambassador , the european commission has urged russia to observe un conventions on protection of diplomats .
russia has suggested it wants to deal only with more established eu states , sparking angry responses from eu officials , who have vowed unity in the face of pressure from russia .
eu leaders have also voiced concern about europe 's rapidly growing reliance on russian oil and gas imports at a time when russia is becoming an increasingly assertive energy power .
there are other items on the summit agenda that could spark controversy .
the european union has supported russia 's bid to join the world trade union as soon as possible but has said that it could withhold final approval until eu-russia trade tariff rows are resolved .

" the european union is a union of 27 member states and we take decisions based on solidarity .
i came here of course with this spirit of defending european interests in that sense of solidarity , " barroso said .
speaking to reporters after his arrival in samara , a regional centre , he said he would hold " a frank and open discussion " with putin at the summit but did not expect any breakthroughs .
" i am not expecting , honestly , anything spectacular from this meeting , " barroso said . merkel also called for dialogue with moscow , saying ahead of the talks : " russia and the european union are interdependent .
it 's always good to speak to each other rather than talking about each other . "
the summit 's main consultations were set for friday at the volzhsky utyos -lrb- volga cliff -rrb- resort complex , southeast of moscow , but the agenda was limited because of ongoing diplomatic and trade disputes .
" a difficult time " " this summit is taking place at a difficult time , " a german government official told reporters in berlin this week .
" but if we want a strategic partnership with russia it 's important that we talk even during difficult times . "
even if there is no narrowing of differences , both sides will get a better idea of each other 's positions , he said .
eu officials said talks would touch on international issues such as the future status of kosovo and iran 's nuclear programme , as well as russia 's bid to join the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- this year .
but negotiations on a key partnership agreement that governs eu-russia relations , including in the vitally important energy sphere , have been held up because of a trade row between eu member poland and russia .

poland has warned it will maintain a veto on talks unless moscow lifts a ban on meat imports from poland and eu members form a united front on the issue of energy security .
russia has accused poland of holding eu-russia relations " hostage . "
russia 's wto bid the row with poland and a bitter war of words with estonia over a soviet memorial in tallinn have highlighted still-tense relations between moscow and formerly soviet-dominated central europe .
after a recent blockade of the estonian embassy in moscow , and violent scenes at a news conference given by the estonian ambassador , the european commission has urged russia to observe un conventions on protection of diplomats .
russia has suggested it wants to deal only with more established eu states , sparking angry responses from eu officials , who have vowed unity in the face of pressure from russia .
eu leaders have also voiced concern about europe 's rapidly growing reliance on russian oil and gas imports at a time when russia is becoming an increasingly assertive energy power .
there are other items on the summit agenda that could spark controversy .
the european union has supported russia 's bid to join the world trade union as soon as possible but has said that it could withhold final approval until eu-russia trade tariff rows are resolved .

but can the dresden music festival be spared from the curse of mediocrity ? now in its 30th season , the dresden music festival opens on thursday .
over the two weeks , a host of internationally acclaimed performers - including pianist alfred brendel , cellist heinrich schiff and violinist gidon kremer - are set to make appearances in the eastern german city .
the festival will start with a sing-along performance , as it does each year .
this year it will be joseph haydn 's " four seasons " oratorio . it will also feature a wide range of events on its program including musical theater , dance , jazz , film , literature and visual arts .
despite the star power on this year 's program , the festival has seen better days .
" the most visited classical music festival in germany is dropping into the middle class , " festival director hartmut haenchen said in an interview with german news agency dpa .
the city of dresden has cut the festival budget by 30 percent , forcing organizers to slim down the program to 64 events - compared to 108 in 2006 .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the elbe valley was added to the unesco list in 2004 the area is currently in danger of losing its status on the list of unesco world heritage sites due to a controversial bridge being built across the valley .
the bridge had been approved by a local referendum in 2005 , but unesco said it would consider removing dresden from its list of 830 world heritage sites because the modern construction would have " a serious impact on the integrity of the landscape " of the city . city leaders in saxony 's capital tried to back-pedal on the bridge project , but their efforts were stalled by a court decision upholding the plebiscite .
" it irritates me that politicians think so short-term , " haenchen said about the 106 million euro -lrb- $ 203 million -rrb- bridge project .
many believe that dresden - being known internationally as a city of culture - should invest more in the festival .
" the city has enough bridges , " wrote german web site klassik.com in the aftermath of the 2006 festival .

world-class soloists like marilyn horne and dietrich fischer-diskau as well as top conductors like claudio abbado and zubin mehta came to the elbe river city to share their talents .
after germany 's reunification , the dresden music festival continued to prosper , peaking in 2003 with a record 150,000 visitors .
some 140,000 music lovers attended the event last year , but haenchen said he fears the number could drop to as few as 70,000 attendees this year .

" the european union is a union of 27 member states and we take decisions based on solidarity .
i came here of course with this spirit of defending european interests in that sense of solidarity , " barroso said .
speaking to reporters after his arrival in samara , a regional centre , he said he would hold " a frank and open discussion " with putin at the summit but did not expect any breakthroughs .
" i am not expecting , honestly , anything spectacular from this meeting , " barroso said . merkel also called for dialogue with moscow , saying ahead of the talks : " russia and the european union are interdependent .
it 's always good to speak to each other rather than talking about each other . "
the summit 's main consultations were set for friday at the volzhsky utyos -lrb- volga cliff -rrb- resort complex , southeast of moscow , but the agenda was limited because of ongoing diplomatic and trade disputes .
" a difficult time " " this summit is taking place at a difficult time , " a german government official told reporters in berlin this week .
" but if we want a strategic partnership with russia it 's important that we talk even during difficult times . "
even if there is no narrowing of differences , both sides will get a better idea of each other 's positions , he said .
eu officials said talks would touch on international issues such as the future status of kosovo and iran 's nuclear programme , as well as russia 's bid to join the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- this year .
but negotiations on a key partnership agreement that governs eu-russia relations , including in the vitally important energy sphere , have been held up because of a trade row between eu member poland and russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland and russia are locked in a row over polish meat imports " eu members understand us .
so , in a sense , there is a situation of crisis in relations between the eu and russia , " polish foreign minister anna fotyga said thursday in an interview with polish public television .
poland has warned it will maintain a veto on talks unless moscow lifts a ban on meat imports from poland and eu members form a united front on the issue of energy security .
russia has accused poland of holding eu-russia relations " hostage . "
russia 's wto bid the row with poland and a bitter war of words with estonia over a soviet memorial in tallinn have highlighted still-tense relations between moscow and formerly soviet-dominated central europe .
after a recent blockade of the estonian embassy in moscow , and violent scenes at a news conference given by the estonian ambassador , the european commission has urged russia to observe un conventions on protection of diplomats .
russia has suggested it wants to deal only with more established eu states , sparking angry responses from eu officials , who have vowed unity in the face of pressure from russia .
eu leaders have also voiced concern about europe 's rapidly growing reliance on russian oil and gas imports at a time when russia is becoming an increasingly assertive energy power .
there are other items on the summit agenda that could spark controversy .
the european union has supported russia 's bid to join the world trade union as soon as possible but has said that it could withhold final approval until eu-russia trade tariff rows are resolved .
putin has set early wto accession as a key goal for his presidency .
a draft document seen by afp said eu leaders should " make clear that the eu is ready to support early conclusion of russia 's wto accession but not at any price . "
missile defense , democratic freedoms russia has also contributed to the tense mood of the summit with its ongoing row with the us over plans to station elements of a planned missile defense system in poland and the czech republic .
moscow has threatened to tear up a key arms limitation pact if washington goes ahead with those plans .
eu leaders also said they wanted to discuss democratic freedoms in russia , which have come under scrutiny amid a crackdown on opposition protests ahead of presidential elections next year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a russian crackdown on opposition protests last month sparked major criticism an anti-kremlin group , the other russia , is due to hold a protest rally in samara on friday .
the demonstration has been dogged with problems , including the arrest of several of the main organizers .
meanwhile , hundreds of pro-kremlin activists also prepared to rally in samara on friday against estonia 's decision to move a controversial soviet war monument last month .
russia reprimanded the european union for failing to condemn estonia 's decision , which sparked rioting by ethnic-russians .
brussels has said the issue is an internal matter for estonia . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : eu , russia play down differences , but hurdles remain german foreign minister steinmeier met russian president putin on tuesday in a last-ditch bid to rescue a looming eu-russia summit amid spiraling tensions over a host of issues .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 17.05.2007 eu , public shrug as poland keeps trying to curb journalists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the polish government is keeping a close eye on the country 's media poland 's intellectuals are feeling the heat as the government vows to push through a controversial new law designed to purge communists from public life .
but so far , criticism has been faint . the organization " reporters without borders " ranks poland 58th in its press freedom index of 168 countries .
among the 27 eu member states , it holds the lowest position . the group said it has observed a strong increase in censorship by poland 's conservative government .
the latest attempt involves plans announced earlier this month by the parliament 's new speaker , ludwik dorn , to classify parliamentary journalists .
under the system , certain groups of journalists would have certain reporting privileges and access to politicians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaroslaw kaczynski , here with german chancellor angela merkel , has n't given up yet dorn , a key ally of poland 's ruling kaczynski twins , said the division would better organize parliamentary work and " avert chaos . "
yet polish journalists disagreed . " dorn should rather read the constitution and what it says on journalists ' access to information , " stefan batorowski from the polish journalists association told polish media . government will continue its efforts polish journalists have been feeling increased government pressure to toe the official line .
all of the country 's journalists were to be screened as part of the government 's controversial vetting law , which it said was aimed at purging public life of ex-communist agents .
but last week , the constitutional court threw a spanner in the works . the judges ruled that most of the government 's planned law was unconstitutional .
it would have required some 700,000 poles to file statements saying whether they had collaborated with the communist-era secret police . those affected included practically all of the country 's intellectuals and included journalists , managers of listed state-owned firms and principals of private schools . people who failed to comply risked losing their jobs and a 10-year professional ban .
the legislation had been an extension of a decade-old vetting law that previously applied to only 30,000 lawmakers , government ministers and judges . while the government grudgingly accepted the court 's decision , formalizing it on tuesday , the battle is n't over . prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , the twin brother of president lech kaczynski , said work was to begin on a new law designed to purge communists from public life .
new legislation would be in accordance with the constitution , he said . clearer international communication is necessary the kaczynski twins have made it clear in their governing style that they want to centralize power .
as a result , some observers have asked why there is n't more of an outcry in the eu regarding legislation such as the vetting law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are the minds of polish intellectuals being x-rayed ?
" of course , every country has the legal and political right to regulate domestic policies themselves , " said stephen bastos from the german council on foreign relations in berlin . but , bastos said , this case was different . " when it is apparent that coming to terms with the past is being politically exploited , " then better international communication is needed , bastos said .
" this is to a large degree the case here . " eu criticism has not been successful in the past yet the eu is reserved .
after all , it has burned its fingers in the past for criticizing a member state 's domestic affairs , said sebastian kurpas from the center for european policy studies in brussels . back in 2000 , for example , eu member states threatened to cut all official ties to austria if the conservative people 's party -lrb- övp -rrb- formed a coalition government with the far-right freedom party -lrb- fpö -rrb- . " they really shot themselves in the foot with austria , " kurpas said .
the övp-fpö coalition government took office and after a few months of chilly diplomatic relations , things returned to normal . " the experience with austria really backfired and showed what limited possibilities exist , " kurpas said . in poland , a feeling of ' we 're doing fine ' even in poland there has been noticeably little resistance to the kaczynski government 's policies . " there are no protests , though there is a massive polarization among the population , " said bastos .
yet effective political opposition was lacking , he said . " also , the economy is going doing relatively well and the national rhetoric is leaving the economy alone , " bastos said .
a feeling of " we 're doing fine " existed among the people , he added . on an eu level , the bloc does n't need any bad blood with poland either . " there are enough problems right now in terms of the european constitution , as well as strained relations to russia to deal with , " kurpas said . germany , which holds the rotating eu presidency , needs poland on its side at the european council meeting in brussels in june . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : eu , russia play down differences , but hurdles remain german foreign minister steinmeier met russian president putin on tuesday in a last-ditch bid to rescue a looming eu-russia summit amid spiraling tensions over a host of issues .
-lrb- 15.05.2007 -rrb- dw-world : communist screening law divides polish society poland 's new lustration law has split the country .
it requires more than 700,000 poles to confess as to whether they were communist spies .
it 's high time , the law 's backers say .
critics have dubbed it a political tool .
-lrb- 15.04.2007 -rrb- dw-world : poland cracks down on liberal media a group of polish journalists are refusing to be screened by the government .
they say authorities are using a recently passed vetting law to hit back against the liberal opposition and conduct a witch hunt in the media .

many tulear residents resent the highlanders ' wealth mistrust between the coastal residents of tulear and " migrants " from the highlands exploded into violence , with shops ransacked , police opening fire on protestors and two local politicians arrested .
after two weeks with no electricity - it is now over a month since the city last had a regular supply - the students took to the streets .
they claim that the president 's senior official in the city , colonel randrianamampionona , threatened to throw a grenade at them when they complained about the electricity situation - a charge he strenuously denies .
by the next day , the protest had spread and there was widespread violence and looting .
five people were injured by bullets when police opened fire on the demonstrators and local senator robert razaka was arrested , along with 30 others .
two weeks later , militias still roam the city 's streets at night , supposedly protecting their neighbourhood - in reality threatening and extorting money from passers-by .
although electricity was the flashpoint , it was highland people , rather than the authorities , who felt the full force of local anger .
' angry ' many of the 80 businesses targeted belonged to the merina people , originally from the highlands around the capital , antananarivo .
max is a driver in tulear and is from a coastal group .
this is a creation of opposition politicians .
look at me , i am from the coast and my wife is a merina colonel randrianamampionona he sums up the feelings of many coastal people towards their highland neighbours .
" the political system favours the merina .
that is why people are angry .
this electricity situation would never happen in the capital , " he said .
for the first time in madagascar 's post-colonial history , both the president , marc ravalomanana , and the prime minister , charles rabemananjara , are highlanders .
the situation is making coastal people , known as " cotiers " , believe that political influence is loaded against them .
dielibou youssouf somano , one of tulear 's most prominent citizens , is doing his best to minimise ethnic tensions in tulear .
this lawyer , former kick-boxing champion and bar owner organised protection for a local hotel that he thought might be attacked .
he does however , understand the frustration .
" this ethnic tension between coastal people and highlanders has always been there .
there is big resentment here because a lot of the best jobs seem to go to people from the highlands , " he said .
" many highland people have been here for generations and we know them , they are our friends .
but it is between neighbourhoods that the problems are getting worse . "
colonial role the authorities are less convinced that there is a real problem .
the president 's senior official in the region claims that relations are good .
" this is a creation of opposition politicians .
look at me , i am from the coast and my wife is a merina , " said colonel randrianamampionona .
even though it is not our neighbours ' fault , we will still attack them to show how angry we feel max - driver " lots of coastal and highland people get married .
objectively there are no ethnic tensions in tulear . "
he denied media reports that over 200 ethnic merinas had taken refuge in a local army base for fear of being attacked .
" plenty of merina people work here in my office .
if they were so scared , why have n't they left ? "
he claims that in colonial times tension did exist but he says it is no more than history now .
the merina were the first group to unite madagascar under king andrianampoinimerina and his son , radama , at the beginning of the 19th century .
when the french finally took the island as a colony in 1896 they dealt largely with the merina .
the concentration of power and educational opportunities in the capital , antananarivo , increased the perceived merina superiority .
tulear itself did not have a university until the 1970s .
threats highland people make up less than 5 % of the 400,000 people who live in tulear .
one highland woman , who was too afraid to be named , told the bbc that they had been threatened .
for days after it rains whole sections of tulear 's streets remain flooded " when the protests started over electricity we were told by the coastal people that they would steal our property and we would be killed .
they threw stones at our shop , " she said .
she lives in one room with 18 members of her family .
she denies that the highland people are favoured , but she knows that is what coastal people think .
" we have come here and we 've been successful with our business . "
mr somano says the resentment has both political and economic roots .
" the reason ethnic tensions are getting worse is because people here feel politically disenfranchised .
when they arrested senator razaka after the protests , it was like they cut out our tongues . "
" the electricity is a problem , the roads are terrible and life is very expensive here , " he said .
" even the price of charcoal , which we use for all our cooking , has doubled in price in the last few months .
until the government really listen to what coastal people are saying then ethnic tensions are just going to get worse . "
max puts it more bluntly .
" we do not hate the merina but we think the political system favours them .
" even though it is not our neighbours ' fault , we will still attack them to show how angry we feel . "

this is a creation of opposition politicians .
look at me , i am from the coast and my wife is a merina colonel randrianamampionona he sums up the feelings of many coastal people towards their highland neighbours .
" the political system favours the merina .
that is why people are angry .
this electricity situation would never happen in the capital , " he said .
for the first time in madagascar 's post-colonial history , both the president , marc ravalomanana , and the prime minister , charles rabemananjara , are highlanders .
the situation is making coastal people , known as " cotiers " , believe that political influence is loaded against them .
dielibou youssouf somano , one of tulear 's most prominent citizens , is doing his best to minimise ethnic tensions in tulear .
this lawyer , former kick-boxing champion and bar owner organised protection for a local hotel that he thought might be attacked .
he does however , understand the frustration .
" this ethnic tension between coastal people and highlanders has always been there .
there is big resentment here because a lot of the best jobs seem to go to people from the highlands , " he said .
" many highland people have been here for generations and we know them , they are our friends .
but it is between neighbourhoods that the problems are getting worse . "
colonial role the authorities are less convinced that there is a real problem .
the president 's senior official in the region claims that relations are good .
" this is a creation of opposition politicians .
look at me , i am from the coast and my wife is a merina , " said colonel randrianamampionona .
even though it is not our neighbours ' fault , we will still attack them to show how angry we feel max - driver " lots of coastal and highland people get married .
objectively there are no ethnic tensions in tulear . "
he denied media reports that over 200 ethnic merinas had taken refuge in a local army base for fear of being attacked .
" plenty of merina people work here in my office .
if they were so scared , why have n't they left ? "
he claims that in colonial times tension did exist but he says it is no more than history now .
the merina were the first group to unite madagascar under king andrianampoinimerina and his son , radama , at the beginning of the 19th century .
when the french finally took the island as a colony in 1896 they dealt largely with the merina .
the concentration of power and educational opportunities in the capital , antananarivo , increased the perceived merina superiority .
tulear itself did not have a university until the 1970s .
threats highland people make up less than 5 % of the 400,000 people who live in tulear .
one highland woman , who was too afraid to be named , told the bbc that they had been threatened .
for days after it rains whole sections of tulear 's streets remain flooded " when the protests started over electricity we were told by the coastal people that they would steal our property and we would be killed .
they threw stones at our shop , " she said .
she lives in one room with 18 members of her family .
she denies that the highland people are favoured , but she knows that is what coastal people think .
" we have come here and we 've been successful with our business . "
mr somano says the resentment has both political and economic roots .
" the reason ethnic tensions are getting worse is because people here feel politically disenfranchised .
when they arrested senator razaka after the protests , it was like they cut out our tongues . "
" the electricity is a problem , the roads are terrible and life is very expensive here , " he said .
" even the price of charcoal , which we use for all our cooking , has doubled in price in the last few months .
until the government really listen to what coastal people are saying then ethnic tensions are just going to get worse . "
max puts it more bluntly .
" we do not hate the merina but we think the political system favours them .
" even though it is not our neighbours ' fault , we will still attack them to show how angry we feel . "

mistrust between the coastal residents of tulear and " migrants " from the highlands exploded into violence , with shops ransacked , police opening fire on protestors and two local politicians arrested .
after two weeks with no electricity - it is now over a month since the city last had a regular supply - the students took to the streets .
they claim that the president 's senior official in the city , colonel randrianamampionona , threatened to throw a grenade at them when they complained about the electricity situation - a charge he strenuously denies .
by the next day , the protest had spread and there was widespread violence and looting .
five people were injured by bullets when police opened fire on the demonstrators and local senator robert razaka was arrested , along with 30 others .
two weeks later , militias still roam the city 's streets at night , supposedly protecting their neighbourhood - in reality threatening and extorting money from passers-by .
although electricity was the flashpoint , it was highland people , rather than the authorities , who felt the full force of local anger .

there will soon be more cars in china than the us china 's car market grew 25 % last year and it has overtaken japan to be the second-largest car market in the world with sales of 8 million vehicles , including light trucks and minivans .
but with just six car owners per 100 people , compared with 90 % car ownership in the us and 80 % in the uk , the potential for growth is enormous .
according to the research company ac nielsen , china also has more people who aspire to own a car , but currently do not , than any other country .
also , analysts roland berger associates estimate that the worldwide demand for small cars will rise by 30 % in the next decade .

chery - also based away from coastal china , in anhui province - is aggressively rolling out new models , including a new a1 compact that was one of the stars at the shanghai motor show .

the reconciliation has been strongly supported by president vladimir putin , who attended the televised ceremony .
leaders of the new york-based russian orthodox church abroad flew into moscow for the historic reunification .
at the ceremony on thursday the patriarch of moscow , alexy ii , joined the leader of the russian orthodox church abroad , metropolitan lavry , in celebrating mass at the christ the saviour cathedral .
it was blown up by the soviet dictator joseph stalin , and rebuilt after the collapse of communism .
on saturday , the two will jointly consecrate a new church on a site in southern moscow , where the soviet secret police shot thousands of orthodox priests .
forced exile the russian orthodox church abroad owes its origin to the civil war - which followed the russian revolution of 1917 and ended with the victory of the militantly atheist bolsheviks over the monarchist whites .
exiled bishops and clerics proclaimed the russian orthodox church abroad at a meeting in serbia in 1922 - later relocating to new york .
mr putin visited the mt athos monastery in greece in 2005 in 1927 , it broke off relations with the russian orthodox hierarchy in moscow - saying it had fallen under bolshevik control .
ruthlessly persecuted by the soviet regime , the russian orthodox church has recovered some of its old influence since the break-up of the soviet union in 1991 .
although church attendance remains relatively low , former soviet functionaries like president putin and his predecessor , the late president boris yeltsin , have emphasised their new-found status as orthodox believers and have made a point of being seen at major religious festivals .
mr putin , in particular , has tried to involve the russian orthodox church in the task of reviving a sense of russian patriotism and " great power " consciousness .
paradoxically , this includes rehabilitating certain aspects of the soviet past - mr putin himself describing the break-up of the soviet union as a " tragedy " .
church rivalry historically , the russian orthodox church 's connections with the russian state were strong and close .
it was a mainstay of the tsarist regime and a champion of russian cultural exceptionalism .
ranked fifth in order of seniority by the other orthodox churches - after constantinople -lrb- istanbul -rrb- , alexandria , antioch and jerusalem - it has traditionally striven to assume first position .
in 1981 , the russian orthodox church abroad proclaimed russia 's last tsar , nicholas ii , and his family - all shot by the bolsheviks in 1918 - as saints .
seven years ago , the orthodox church in russia did the same .
nevertheless , some members of the russian orthodox church abroad remain unhappy about this week 's reunion - and have threatened to break away .
a spokesman for the russian orthodox church abroad , archpriest alexander lebedev , is quoted by the russian interfax news agency as stressing his church 's devotion to " russianness " - and suggesting it was uneasy about the moscow patriarchate 's ecumenical contacts with other , non-orthodox , christians - notably its membership of the world council of churches .
but he accepted that its membership would continue " for some time to come " - in order to stop the patriarchate of constantinople stepping into its place .

united utilities , severn trent , south east water and southern all saw their complaint levels rise by more than the industry average .
incorrect billing and poor complaint handling were the chief gripes , the consumer council for water -lrb- ccw -rrb- said .
in total , the ccw received 13,603 complaints in the year to march .
" it is particularly disappointing to find some companies , for the second consecutive year , tripping up when they have introduced basic billing systems - causing customers great concern , " said dame yve buckland , chair of the ccw .
" in some cases these problems are compounded when customers can not even reach their company 's staff on the phone to complain , " dame buckland added .
turnaround ?
despite being singled out as one of the worst performers , brian hurd , customer services director of united utilities , said complaint levels had started to fall at his company since last november .
" the majority of the complaints occurred in the first half of the year when we were still in the process of bedding in a new computer billing system , " he explained .
in a statement , severn trent water said that they were " disappointed to see an increase in complaints " and were " determined " to tackle the issues causing concern to their customers .
other water companies performed better and some saw a fall in the number of complaints for the whole of 2006/2007 , compared to the previous 12-month period .

a key ally of nicolas sarkozy and - as his campaign director - one of the architects of his successful presidential election campaign , francois fillon is a former french education and social affairs minister with a reputation for strength but also subtlety in pushing through reforms .
he is an old-school gaullist who was once close to president jacques chirac , but pledged his loyalty to mr sarkozy in 2005 after being unceremoniously dumped from the then government .
mr fillon comes from the left of mr sarkozy 's union for a popular movement party and believes in social inclusiveness , a fact which could help him deal with some of france 's notoriously difficult trade unions when it comes to bargaining over economic reform .
mr sarkozy has promised to put employment at the top of his agenda .
but plans to chip away at the 35-hour working week , reform france 's generous welfare system or help employers to hire and fire more easily have foundered in the past when france 's unions called for mass street protests - leading several previous governments to back down .
five children francois fillon currently sits as a senator in the upper house of parliament for the region of sarthe .
french pm 's welsh wife his welsh wife , penelope , was born in the village of llanover near abergavenny , and the couple have five children .
madame fillon is chatelaine of the chateau de beaucé , an imposing manor house at sablé-sur-sarthe .
it is not clear whether the whole family will abandon the french countryside for the grandeur of the matignon , the french prime minister 's residence on the left bank of paris .
mr fillon will be in charge of a government of just 15 ministers , half its current number , as mr sarkozy puts into practice his pledge to slim down the state .
he has also promised that half his ministers will be women .
mr fillon served as minister for labour under prime minister jean-pierre raffarin 's first government in 2002 , which set out to reform france 's 35-hour week and pensions system .
while in government , the consensual mr fillon gained a reputation for pushing through reforms without becoming too personally unpopular - a trait he may well need again .

a key ally of nicolas sarkozy and - as his campaign director - one of the architects of his successful presidential election campaign , francois fillon is a former french education and social affairs minister with a reputation for strength but also subtlety in pushing through reforms .
mr fillon will head a slimmed-down government of 15 ministers he is an old-school gaullist who was once close to president jacques chirac , but pledged his loyalty to mr sarkozy in 2005 after being unceremoniously dumped from the then government .
mr fillon comes from the left of mr sarkozy 's union for a popular movement party and believes in social inclusiveness , a fact which could help him deal with some of france 's notoriously difficult trade unions when it comes to bargaining over economic reform .
mr sarkozy has promised to put employment at the top of his agenda .
but plans to chip away at the 35-hour working week , reform france 's generous welfare system or help employers to hire and fire more easily have foundered in the past when france 's unions called for mass street protests - leading several previous governments to back down .

it is not clear whether the whole family will abandon the french countryside for the grandeur of the matignon , the french prime minister 's residence on the left bank of paris .
mr fillon will be in charge of a government of just 15 ministers , half its current number , as mr sarkozy puts into practice his pledge to slim down the state .
he has also promised that half his ministers will be women .
mr fillon served as minister for labour under prime minister jean-pierre raffarin 's first government in 2002 , which set out to reform france 's 35-hour week and pensions system .
