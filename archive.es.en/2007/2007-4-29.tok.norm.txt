" turkey is secular and will remain secular , " " neither sharia , nor coup d 'etat , democratic turkey , " they chanted .
police at the scene told reporters that the number of demonstrators was well over one million .
organizers said the rally drew people from all over turkey and abroad .
the istanbul demonstration followed a similar one in ankara on april 14 that attracted up to 1.5 million people , according to some estimates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister erdogan -lrb- r . -rrb- , with abdullah gul tensions rose after foreign minister abdullah gul , a former islamist from the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , narrowly missed becoming the country 's next president in a first round of voting in parliament on friday .
the akp dominates the 550-seat parliament , but does not have the required two-thirds majority to get gul elected in the first two rounds of voting .
the opposition boycotted the vote because of gul 's islamist past and because they were not consulted on his candiacy for the non-partisan post .
army statements cause concerns the army , which has carried out three coups in the past , issued a statement saying it was determined to protect turkey 's secular system and was ready to take action if the need arose , making it clear , according to many analysts , that gul 's candidacy was not welcome .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish army sees itself as the guardian of secularism the government responded by calling the army to order and gul on sunday ruled out withdrawing his presidential bid .
" it is out of the question for me to withdraw my candidacy in any way , " he told reporters in ankara .
the prospect of gul becoming head of state has alarmed secularists who fear the strict separation of state and religion will be eroded and islam will creep into all fields of life if he is elected .
court to decide on next round of voting the main opposition republican people 's party has asked the constitutional court to cancel friday 's presidential vote in parliament , arguing that the assembly did not have the necessary quorum to open the voting session .
if the court annuls the vote , general elections set for november 4 could be brought forward .
if does not , gul could be elected president in a third round of voting on may 9 , when an absolute majority of 276 votes would suffice , compared to the two-thirds majority of 367 required for the first two rounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a court decision may decide which president leads turkey " we all need to await the decision of the constitutional court , " gul said .
" the court will undoubtedly make the best evaluation and reach the right decision . "
gul and prime minister recep tayyip erdogan served in now-defunct islamist parties before setting up the akp in 2001 .
they say they have disawoved their islamist roots and are now committed to secular principles .
fear of an islamist agenda but secularists suspect the akp of harbouring a secret islamic agenda , citing its unsuccessful attempts to criminalise adultery , restrict alcohol sales and lift a ban on islamic headscarves in government offices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many turks fear the introduction of sharia law they fear the government will have a free hand to implement islamist policies if the party controls the presidency .
the turkish press on sunday was unanimous in calling on the government and the army to resolve their differences democratically and said early elections were the only way to prevent the country from plunging into chaos .
" turkey either giving up on secularism or suspending democracy are two doomsday scenarios impossible to choose between , " the popular daily vatan said .
the liberal daily milliyet said the army 's warning had " cast a shadow on the credibility and respectability of civilian institutions . "
" the latest developments show that the current term of parliament has reached the end of its natural life .

" we have all witnessed the dangers of climate change in the last few months .
we only saw winter in the calendar in germany , " he said , alluding to last year 's unusually mild winter . gabriel reminded the mps that germany needs to improve its energy efficiency by three percent per year in order to meet the eu target of reducing carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions by 20 percent below 1990-levels by 2020 . but the environment minister went further , proposing an eight-point plan that includes cutting germany 's co2 emissions by 40 percent within 13 years .
gabriel said he wanted to enlist industry 's help in pursuing this ambitious goal . " we should set ourselves the goal of making germany the most energy-efficient country in the world , " gabriel told the mps in berlin . efficiency from the bottom up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german railways : the better way to travel , says gabriel the action plan also calls on ordinary citizens to contribute to the fight against global warming , and envisions an 11-percent reduction in electricity use by 2020 .
this alone would save 40 million tons of co2 , gabriel said . the social democrat minister also encouraged germans to take the train more often as part of the effort .
gabriel told the german tabloid bild zeitung on thursday that he plans to further subsidize germany 's extensive railway system to lure travellers away from inexpensive short-haul flights with airlines such as germanwings or ryanair . " we must ensure that train services are able to compete with air travel , " gabriel said , and suggested that train tickets should qualify for a sales tax break that would allow the deutsche bahn ag to reduce ticket prices for consumers . " there is no tax on airline fuel , but the rail operator must pay the full value-added tax on the sale of long-distance tickets , " gabriel complained to the bundestag .
" that is unfair and can not remain that way . " green power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the green talk , germany plans to build more coal power plants gabriel also unveiled plans to modernize power stations across germany .
he said he wants to double the number of combined heat and power plants that trap and reuse heat generated in power production instead of releasing it . the german government under chancellor angela merkel has agreed to generate over a quarter of its power from environmentally friendly sources by 2020 , according to gabriel .
wind turbines , photovoltaic -lrb- solar -rrb- panels and biofuels are some of the most common forms of green energy , and they have become a formidable market force in germany . but gabriel criticized the government 's tacit approval of plans to build almost 30 new coal power plants on german soil , and he further attacked the conservative camp for advocating nuclear power as a " green " alternative .
nuclear power plants emit near-zero greenhouse gases , but nuclear waste and the possibility of a meltdown pose a different kind of environmental threat . investing in efficiency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three billion euros is a lot , but still better than constant droughts gabriel 's program would cost the german government three billion euros -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- over the next three years , according to the environment ministry 's own estimates .
the program aims to slash 270 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 . despite the country 's long tradition of progressive green policies , germany currently emits more than one billion tons of carbon dioxide per year , making it the world 's sixth-largest polluter . a german economic think-tank recently calculated that the consequences of unfettered cliamte change would cost germany more than 130 billion euros by the middle of the century .
compared to this sum , gabriel 's request for an additional three billion euros seems like a negligable investment in the future . global deadlock environmental protection groups welcomed gabriel 's plans , which they described as ambitious , but cautioned that words had to be followed by action . but gabriel warned that germany 's best efforts would be useless if the world did not follow suit .
chancellor merkel has made climate change a high priority at the june g8 summit in germany , but us president bush , leader of the world 's heaviest-polluting nation , has been reluctant to sign on to greenhouse gas regulations . " if we succeed in breaking the deadlock between the united states and some industrial countries on the one hand and developing countries on the other , the chances do n't look bad , " gabriel said .

german soccer authorities will investigate a " secret " meeting between bayern munich and werder bremen 's striker miroslav klose to see if any of the strict rules concerning approaches to contracted players were breached . holger hieronymus , deputy chief executive of the german football league -lrb- dfl -rrb- , told dpa sunday that both bayern and werder would be asked to make statements about the meeting .
klose has admitted he met bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld and general manager uli hoeness last tuesday in hanover , two days before werder played espanyol in the first leg of the semi-finals of the uefa cup .
under dfl regulations , clubs should not approach players from other clubs without first making an official approach in writing .
werder knew nothing about bayern 's meeting with klose until it was reported afterwards .
both bayern and klose could be fined by the dfl as a result of the meeting .
in a recent similar case in england , chelsea and defender ashley cole were fined a total of 900,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.25 million -rrb- for an unauthorised meeting which led to the player 's transfer from arsenal .
the dfl has decided to launch the investigation although there has been no official complaint from werder bremen .
bremen boss seething at miro 's meeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " are you coming to munich , or what ? "
however werder sports director klaus allofs was angered by the meeting and met klose and his adviser on friday to demand an explanation .
allofs told the german sports television channel dsf on sunday that the matter was now over for werder , however he would still like an explanation from bayern .
" i have not yet spoken personally to uli hoeness .
i am interested to hear what he has to say , " he said .
klose , top scorer at the 2006 world cup , has apologized via a bremen club statement to fans for the timing of his talks with bayern , but said on saturday he did not regret the meeting .
in the statement , he described the meeting as " merely information talks and not contractual negotiations " .
allofs repeated that klose , who has another year to run on his contract with werder , would not be sold to another bundesliga club .

german soccer authorities will investigate a " secret " meeting between bayern munich and werder bremen 's striker miroslav klose to see if any of the strict rules concerning approaches to contracted players were breached . holger hieronymus , deputy chief executive of the german football league -lrb- dfl -rrb- , told dpa sunday that both bayern and werder would be asked to make statements about the meeting .
klose has admitted he met bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld and general manager uli hoeness last tuesday in hanover , two days before werder played espanyol in the first leg of the semi-finals of the uefa cup .
under dfl regulations , clubs should not approach players from other clubs without first making an official approach in writing .
werder knew nothing about bayern 's meeting with klose until it was reported afterwards .
both bayern and klose could be fined by the dfl as a result of the meeting .
in a recent similar case in england , chelsea and defender ashley cole were fined a total of 900,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.25 million -rrb- for an unauthorised meeting which led to the player 's transfer from arsenal .
the dfl has decided to launch the investigation although there has been no official complaint from werder bremen .
bremen boss seething at miro 's meeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " are you coming to munich , or what ? "
however werder sports director klaus allofs was angered by the meeting and met klose and his adviser on friday to demand an explanation .
allofs told the german sports television channel dsf on sunday that the matter was now over for werder , however he would still like an explanation from bayern .
" i have not yet spoken personally to uli hoeness .
i am interested to hear what he has to say , " he said .
klose , top scorer at the 2006 world cup , has apologized via a bremen club statement to fans for the timing of his talks with bayern , but said on saturday he did not regret the meeting .
in the statement , he described the meeting as " merely information talks and not contractual negotiations " .
allofs repeated that klose , who has another year to run on his contract with werder , would not be sold to another bundesliga club .

this alone would save 40 million tons of co2 , gabriel said . the social democrat minister also encouraged germans to take the train more often as part of the effort .
gabriel told the german tabloid bild zeitung on thursday that he plans to further subsidize germany 's extensive railway system to lure travellers away from inexpensive short-haul flights with airlines such as germanwings or ryanair . " we must ensure that train services are able to compete with air travel , " gabriel said , and suggested that train tickets should qualify for a sales tax break that would allow the deutsche bahn ag to reduce ticket prices for consumers .

german soccer authorities will investigate a " secret " meeting between bayern munich and werder bremen 's striker miroslav klose to see if any of the strict rules concerning approaches to contracted players were breached . holger hieronymus , deputy chief executive of the german football league -lrb- dfl -rrb- , told dpa sunday that both bayern and werder would be asked to make statements about the meeting .
klose has admitted he met bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld and general manager uli hoeness last tuesday in hanover , two days before werder played espanyol in the first leg of the semi-finals of the uefa cup .
under dfl regulations , clubs should not approach players from other clubs without first making an official approach in writing .
werder knew nothing about bayern 's meeting with klose until it was reported afterwards .
both bayern and klose could be fined by the dfl as a result of the meeting .
in a recent similar case in england , chelsea and defender ashley cole were fined a total of 900,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.25 million -rrb- for an unauthorised meeting which led to the player 's transfer from arsenal .
the dfl has decided to launch the investigation although there has been no official complaint from werder bremen .
bremen boss seething at miro 's meeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " are you coming to munich , or what ? "
however werder sports director klaus allofs was angered by the meeting and met klose and his adviser on friday to demand an explanation .
allofs told the german sports television channel dsf on sunday that the matter was now over for werder , however he would still like an explanation from bayern .
" i have not yet spoken personally to uli hoeness .
i am interested to hear what he has to say , " he said .
klose , top scorer at the 2006 world cup , has apologized via a bremen club statement to fans for the timing of his talks with bayern , but said on saturday he did not regret the meeting .
in the statement , he described the meeting as " merely information talks and not contractual negotiations " .
allofs repeated that klose , who has another year to run on his contract with werder , would not be sold to another bundesliga club .

meanwhile title-holders bayern munich , beaten at home 2-1 by sv hamburg on saturday , have slipped out of the picture - now eight points behind stuttgart in fourth place .
veh and his stuttgart players had never considered themselves as title contenders until now , always maintaining their main ambition was perhaps to qualify for the champions league next season .
a first league title since 1992 was never a serious proposition .
but after the tight 1-0 win saturday at relegation-doomed bottom club borussia mönchengladbach , veh said : " we have the chance to reach first place .
it 's been a super season which we now want to top . "
" thankless " win puts title in sight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was all huff and puff in gladbach but vfb got the win veh was delighted by his side 's " thankless " 1-0 victory at mönchengladbach , achieved through midfielder roberto hilbert 's 53rd minute goal .
" that was a thankless win , " said veh .
" playing the league 's bottom side really puts you under pressure and you feel the expectation to get three points .
gladbach stood up very well in defence and were very hard to break down .
" but after we got the crucial goal , we really turned it on in the second half and were a pleasure to watch , " the coach purred .
stuttgart , who have only led the table once this season , also have the german cup in their sights after reaching the final against nuremberg , and an unlikely double is now very much a possibility .
veh 's young team has been under no pressure at all this season - unlike rivals bayern or schalke - and have impressed in attack where young german striker mario gomez and the brazilian cacau have scored 25 goals between them .

schalke slid to a 2-1 defeat at bochum on friday , while werder are out of sorts following a 3-0 defeat against espanyol in the uefa cup on thursday and news that striker miroslav klose has met bayern munich officials to sound out a possible transfer .
schalke coach mirko slomka said : " perhaps it was good that we lost .
in any case better than losing on the last day of the season .
we have to win our remaining three games and hope that the others also slip up . "
record title-holders bayern are now writing off a season which seems to be going from bad to worse after a 10th league defeat , at home to a hamburg side who now look to have pulled themselves out of relegation trouble .
" if i really said what i am thinking then the club would suspend me , so i am keeping my thoughts to myself , " said a clearly frustrated goalkeeper oliver kahn after the 2-1 defeat .
bayern 's peruvian claudio pizarro gave the home side the lead after 35 minutes , but hamburg 's dutch midfielder rafael van der vaart , who is being courted by bayern , cancelled out the advantage with a 71st minute goal .

the bayern coach added : " the disappointment is huge .
we did n't work hard enough and we were not firm enough in attack , while in midfield we lost too many personal battles .
hamburg were more determined and that was the difference . "
bayern 's general manager uli hoeness could barely contain his wrath .
" all our energy is now going into getting a new team on the pitch next season which will have nothing in common with this team , " he said .
" this team has had its chance .
if you have a whole year to take your chance and do n't use it then you do n't deserve a second one . "
bayern were jeered off the pitch after another lacklustre display which means the team have missed out on the champions league - qualifying instead for the uefa cup - for the first time since 1996 .
" it 's clear to everyone that this team needs fresh players and we will get them , " said hoeness .
" we have enough money for new players . "
according to italy 's la gazzetta dello sport newspaper , italy striker luca toni will be one of the newcomers , but there has so far been no confirmation of the report from bayern .

german soccer authorities will investigate a " secret " meeting between bayern munich and werder bremen 's striker miroslav klose to see if any of the strict rules concerning approaches to contracted players were breached . holger hieronymus , deputy chief executive of the german football league -lrb- dfl -rrb- , told dpa sunday that both bayern and werder would be asked to make statements about the meeting .
klose has admitted he met bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld and general manager uli hoeness last tuesday in hanover , two days before werder played espanyol in the first leg of the semi-finals of the uefa cup .
under dfl regulations , clubs should not approach players from other clubs without first making an official approach in writing .
werder knew nothing about bayern 's meeting with klose until it was reported afterwards .
both bayern and klose could be fined by the dfl as a result of the meeting .
in a recent similar case in england , chelsea and defender ashley cole were fined a total of 900,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.25 million -rrb- for an unauthorised meeting which led to the player 's transfer from arsenal .
the dfl has decided to launch the investigation although there has been no official complaint from werder bremen .

however werder sports director klaus allofs was angered by the meeting and met klose and his adviser on friday to demand an explanation .
allofs told the german sports television channel dsf on sunday that the matter was now over for werder , however he would still like an explanation from bayern .
" i have not yet spoken personally to uli hoeness .
i am interested to hear what he has to say , " he said .
klose , top scorer at the 2006 world cup , has apologized via a bremen club statement to fans for the timing of his talks with bayern , but said on saturday he did not regret the meeting .
in the statement , he described the meeting as " merely information talks and not contractual negotiations " .
allofs repeated that klose , who has another year to run on his contract with werder , would not be sold to another bundesliga club .
" we have faith in miro and now have to find a solution , " he said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de losers in lederhosen : bayern munich 's fall bayernglück - that 's german for the good fortune usually enjoyed by bayern munich when a game , or a season , is on the line .

all three treatments are based on replacing human genes , cells or tissues affected by various diseases with healthy ones . the regulation provides for a compulsory centralized procedure to authorize the marketing of innovative medical products and also for the subsequent monitoring of patients and products . ' great economic potential ' it also offers " new hope to thousands of patients and researchers , " the strasbourg-based parliament said in a statement . british mep giles chichester , a member of the parliament 's industry , research and energy committee , strongly supported the measure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vote followed an ethical debate in the eu parliament " i regularly see reports in the press of exciting new therapies and developments in this field .
but usually they are in the usa and not in europe , which is to our loss , " he said . such innovative therapies , which have huge potential for curing ailments such as parkinson 's , alzheimer 's , blindness , spinal cord injury , cancer and heart disease , " have great potential for the european economy , " the parliament said . ethical debate on stem-cell research the parliament assured it " does not interfere with decisions made by member states on whether to allow the use of specific types of cells such as embryonic stem cells in accordance with their ethical choices . " stem-cell therapy is the most controversial emerging medical treatment as it can involve cells extracted from human embryos .
the practice is illegal in some eu countries , including poland and italy . some meps had tabled ethical amendments , but these were mainly rejected .
the opposition came mostly from italian and german members and those from eastern europe , who wanted to exclude from the regulations those treatments deemed to be ethically questionable . polish mep konrad szymanski warned that the new rules " may have serious shortcomings " as " there may not be enough guarantees for human dignities . "
if europe rightly wanted to set human rights standards in the world , he continued , it could not afford to adopt a " passive position " when it comes to advanced therapies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : treatments for diseases like alzheimers and cancer are in play an amendment that proposed the exclusion of embryonic or fetal-cell tissue products from the regulation was defeated by 357 votes to 269 .
the parliament did vote to exclude any products containing non-viable human or animal cells or tissues . regulation offers guarantees to donors , patients the regulation states that the donation of cells and tissues must be voluntary and unpaid and the anonymity of donors and recipients guaranteed .
patients must also have the right to know the origin of any cells or tissues used , subject to respect for donor anonymity . three of the main political groupings in the parliament had agreed a compromise package to allow the regulation to enter into force speedily , probably around mid-2008 . it already has the approval of representatives of the 27 eu member states , despite opposition from the official parliamentary rapporteur , slovak miroslav mikolasic . current rules on the authorization of the so-called ' advanced therapies ' differ widely across the eu 's 27 member states . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversial decision allows women to donate eggs to science the decision by british fertility regulators to pay women to donate eggs to medical research raises tricky questions about the ethics of compromising women 's health in the pursuit of scientific stardom .
-lrb- 02.03.2007 -rrb- patent protest erupts over human stem cell research german laws regarding embryonic stem cells are some of the most restrictive in the world .
this month , a german court also partially reversed approval for a patent to a german scientist for his stem cell research methods .
-lrb- 28.12.2006 -rrb- german scientists go abroad to pursue stem cell research german laws regarding embryonic stem cells are among the most restrictive in the world .
that has led to a brain drain to other countries , where the use of discarded embryos from fertility clinics is not prohibited .
-lrb- 11.07.2006 -rrb- feedback should europe support stem-cell research ?

german soccer authorities will investigate a " secret " meeting between bayern munich and werder bremen 's striker miroslav klose to see if any of the strict rules concerning approaches to contracted players were breached . holger hieronymus , deputy chief executive of the german football league -lrb- dfl -rrb- , told dpa sunday that both bayern and werder would be asked to make statements about the meeting .
klose has admitted he met bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld and general manager uli hoeness last tuesday in hanover , two days before werder played espanyol in the first leg of the semi-finals of the uefa cup .
under dfl regulations , clubs should not approach players from other clubs without first making an official approach in writing .
werder knew nothing about bayern 's meeting with klose until it was reported afterwards .
both bayern and klose could be fined by the dfl as a result of the meeting .
in a recent similar case in england , chelsea and defender ashley cole were fined a total of 900,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.25 million -rrb- for an unauthorised meeting which led to the player 's transfer from arsenal .
the dfl has decided to launch the investigation although there has been no official complaint from werder bremen .

" turkey is secular and will remain secular , " " neither sharia , nor coup d 'etat , democratic turkey , " they chanted .
police at the scene told reporters that the number of demonstrators was well over one million .
organizers said the rally drew people from all over turkey and abroad .
the istanbul demonstration followed a similar one in ankara on april 14 that attracted up to 1.5 million people , according to some estimates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister erdogan -lrb- r . -rrb- , with abdullah gul tensions rose after foreign minister abdullah gul , a former islamist from the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , narrowly missed becoming the country 's next president in a first round of voting in parliament on friday .
the akp dominates the 550-seat parliament , but does not have the required two-thirds majority to get gul elected in the first two rounds of voting .
the opposition boycotted the vote because of gul 's islamist past and because they were not consulted on his candiacy for the non-partisan post .
army statements cause concerns the army , which has carried out three coups in the past , issued a statement saying it was determined to protect turkey 's secular system and was ready to take action if the need arose , making it clear , according to many analysts , that gul 's candidacy was not welcome .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish army sees itself as the guardian of secularism the government responded by calling the army to order and gul on sunday ruled out withdrawing his presidential bid .
" it is out of the question for me to withdraw my candidacy in any way , " he told reporters in ankara .
the prospect of gul becoming head of state has alarmed secularists who fear the strict separation of state and religion will be eroded and islam will creep into all fields of life if he is elected .
court to decide on next round of voting the main opposition republican people 's party has asked the constitutional court to cancel friday 's presidential vote in parliament , arguing that the assembly did not have the necessary quorum to open the voting session .
if the court annuls the vote , general elections set for november 4 could be brought forward .
if does not , gul could be elected president in a third round of voting on may 9 , when an absolute majority of 276 votes would suffice , compared to the two-thirds majority of 367 required for the first two rounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a court decision may decide which president leads turkey " we all need to await the decision of the constitutional court , " gul said .
" the court will undoubtedly make the best evaluation and reach the right decision . "
gul and prime minister recep tayyip erdogan served in now-defunct islamist parties before setting up the akp in 2001 .
they say they have disawoved their islamist roots and are now committed to secular principles .
fear of an islamist agenda but secularists suspect the akp of harbouring a secret islamic agenda , citing its unsuccessful attempts to criminalise adultery , restrict alcohol sales and lift a ban on islamic headscarves in government offices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many turks fear the introduction of sharia law they fear the government will have a free hand to implement islamist policies if the party controls the presidency .
the turkish press on sunday was unanimous in calling on the government and the army to resolve their differences democratically and said early elections were the only way to prevent the country from plunging into chaos .
" turkey either giving up on secularism or suspending democracy are two doomsday scenarios impossible to choose between , " the popular daily vatan said .
the liberal daily milliyet said the army 's warning had " cast a shadow on the credibility and respectability of civilian institutions . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 29.04.2007 surprise package stuttgart in position to pounce großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sticking their necks out : stuttgart are now daring to dream of bundesliga success vfb stuttgart have been downplaying their title chances all season , but now no one is underestimating armin veh 's team as the bundesliga season reaches its climax with vfb 's nervous rivals coming unstuck around them . with three matches remaining of the season , stuttgart have moved within a point of leaders schalke 04 and could defend their second place in the table if werder bremen slip up at arminia bielefeld in a match later sunday .
meanwhile title-holders bayern munich , beaten at home 2-1 by sv hamburg on saturday , have slipped out of the picture - now eight points behind stuttgart in fourth place .
veh and his stuttgart players had never considered themselves as title contenders until now , always maintaining their main ambition was perhaps to qualify for the champions league next season .
a first league title since 1992 was never a serious proposition .
but after the tight 1-0 win saturday at relegation-doomed bottom club borussia mönchengladbach , veh said : " we have the chance to reach first place .
it 's been a super season which we now want to top . "
" thankless " win puts title in sight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was all huff and puff in gladbach but vfb got the win veh was delighted by his side 's " thankless " 1-0 victory at mönchengladbach , achieved through midfielder roberto hilbert 's 53rd minute goal .
" that was a thankless win , " said veh .
" playing the league 's bottom side really puts you under pressure and you feel the expectation to get three points .
gladbach stood up very well in defence and were very hard to break down .
" but after we got the crucial goal , we really turned it on in the second half and were a pleasure to watch , " the coach purred .
stuttgart , who have only led the table once this season , also have the german cup in their sights after reaching the final against nuremberg , and an unlikely double is now very much a possibility .
veh 's young team has been under no pressure at all this season - unlike rivals bayern or schalke - and have impressed in attack where young german striker mario gomez and the brazilian cacau have scored 25 goals between them .
pressure taking toll on tightly-packed rivals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke were undone by a committed bochum team friday meanwhile their rivals are showing signs of cracking .
schalke slid to a 2-1 defeat at bochum on friday , while werder are out of sorts following a 3-0 defeat against espanyol in the uefa cup on thursday and news that striker miroslav klose has met bayern munich officials to sound out a possible transfer .
schalke coach mirko slomka said : " perhaps it was good that we lost .
in any case better than losing on the last day of the season .
we have to win our remaining three games and hope that the others also slip up . "
record title-holders bayern are now writing off a season which seems to be going from bad to worse after a 10th league defeat , at home to a hamburg side who now look to have pulled themselves out of relegation trouble .
" if i really said what i am thinking then the club would suspend me , so i am keeping my thoughts to myself , " said a clearly frustrated goalkeeper oliver kahn after the 2-1 defeat .
bayern 's peruvian claudio pizarro gave the home side the lead after 35 minutes , but hamburg 's dutch midfielder rafael van der vaart , who is being courted by bayern , cancelled out the advantage with a 71st minute goal .
hsv 's jose paolo guerrero grabbed the 76th-minute winner .
apoplectic bayern hierarchy to sell team bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness and hitzfeld coach ottmar hitzfeld was left lamenting a " lack of professional attitude " .
the bayern coach added : " the disappointment is huge .
we did n't work hard enough and we were not firm enough in attack , while in midfield we lost too many personal battles .
hamburg were more determined and that was the difference . "
bayern 's general manager uli hoeness could barely contain his wrath .
" all our energy is now going into getting a new team on the pitch next season which will have nothing in common with this team , " he said .
" this team has had its chance .
if you have a whole year to take your chance and do n't use it then you do n't deserve a second one . "
bayern were jeered off the pitch after another lacklustre display which means the team have missed out on the champions league - qualifying instead for the uefa cup - for the first time since 1996 .
" it 's clear to everyone that this team needs fresh players and we will get them , " said hoeness .
" we have enough money for new players . "
according to italy 's la gazzetta dello sport newspaper , italy striker luca toni will be one of the newcomers , but there has so far been no confirmation of the report from bayern .
relegation conundrum unraveling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's gilberto opens the floodgates for the 4-0 elsewhere , hertha berlin trounced hosts alemannia aachen 4-0 to go seventh in the league as brazilian midfielder gilberto opened the scoring with a goal after just seven minutes .
berlin striker christian gimenez grabbed a second three minutes after the break to make it 2-0 , before marko pantelic and yildiray basturk grabbed two late goals .
meanwhile , vfl wolfsburg drew 1-1 at nuremberg after polish midfielder jacek krzynowek slotted home a left-footed shot after a 40-metre run on 18 minutes for the guests .
but the home side were back level just five minutes later when defender andreas wolf headed them on level terms .
mid-table hanover had dutch midfielder arnold jan bruggink 's right-footed shot to thank for their opening goal in their 2-1 win at second-from-bottom mainz 05 .
and hanover 's bulgarian midfielder chavdar yankov extended their lead to 2-0 with a right-footed shot from a 50th minute corner before mainz 's egyptian international mohamed zidan grabbed a late consolation goal .
thomas doll 's borussia dortmund moved away from the relegation dog-fight after swiss international alexander frei gave them a 2-0 win at home to eintracht frankfurt with two well-struck free-kicks either side of half-time .
saturday 's results have cleared the relegation picture somewhat , with hanover now safe and hamburg , bochum and borussia dortmund virtually secure .

meanwhile title-holders bayern munich , beaten at home 2-1 by sv hamburg on saturday , have slipped out of the picture - now eight points behind stuttgart in fourth place .
veh and his stuttgart players had never considered themselves as title contenders until now , always maintaining their main ambition was perhaps to qualify for the champions league next season .
a first league title since 1992 was never a serious proposition .
but after the tight 1-0 win saturday at relegation-doomed bottom club borussia mönchengladbach , veh said : " we have the chance to reach first place .
it 's been a super season which we now want to top . "
" thankless " win puts title in sight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was all huff and puff in gladbach but vfb got the win veh was delighted by his side 's " thankless " 1-0 victory at mönchengladbach , achieved through midfielder roberto hilbert 's 53rd minute goal .
" that was a thankless win , " said veh .
" playing the league 's bottom side really puts you under pressure and you feel the expectation to get three points .
gladbach stood up very well in defence and were very hard to break down .
" but after we got the crucial goal , we really turned it on in the second half and were a pleasure to watch , " the coach purred .
stuttgart , who have only led the table once this season , also have the german cup in their sights after reaching the final against nuremberg , and an unlikely double is now very much a possibility .
veh 's young team has been under no pressure at all this season - unlike rivals bayern or schalke - and have impressed in attack where young german striker mario gomez and the brazilian cacau have scored 25 goals between them .
pressure taking toll on tightly-packed rivals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke were undone by a committed bochum team friday meanwhile their rivals are showing signs of cracking .
schalke slid to a 2-1 defeat at bochum on friday , while werder are out of sorts following a 3-0 defeat against espanyol in the uefa cup on thursday and news that striker miroslav klose has met bayern munich officials to sound out a possible transfer .
schalke coach mirko slomka said : " perhaps it was good that we lost .
in any case better than losing on the last day of the season .
we have to win our remaining three games and hope that the others also slip up . "
record title-holders bayern are now writing off a season which seems to be going from bad to worse after a 10th league defeat , at home to a hamburg side who now look to have pulled themselves out of relegation trouble .
" if i really said what i am thinking then the club would suspend me , so i am keeping my thoughts to myself , " said a clearly frustrated goalkeeper oliver kahn after the 2-1 defeat .
bayern 's peruvian claudio pizarro gave the home side the lead after 35 minutes , but hamburg 's dutch midfielder rafael van der vaart , who is being courted by bayern , cancelled out the advantage with a 71st minute goal .
hsv 's jose paolo guerrero grabbed the 76th-minute winner .
apoplectic bayern hierarchy to sell team bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness and hitzfeld coach ottmar hitzfeld was left lamenting a " lack of professional attitude " .
the bayern coach added : " the disappointment is huge .
we did n't work hard enough and we were not firm enough in attack , while in midfield we lost too many personal battles .
hamburg were more determined and that was the difference . "
bayern 's general manager uli hoeness could barely contain his wrath .
" all our energy is now going into getting a new team on the pitch next season which will have nothing in common with this team , " he said .
" this team has had its chance .
if you have a whole year to take your chance and do n't use it then you do n't deserve a second one . "
bayern were jeered off the pitch after another lacklustre display which means the team have missed out on the champions league - qualifying instead for the uefa cup - for the first time since 1996 .
" it 's clear to everyone that this team needs fresh players and we will get them , " said hoeness .
" we have enough money for new players . "
according to italy 's la gazzetta dello sport newspaper , italy striker luca toni will be one of the newcomers , but there has so far been no confirmation of the report from bayern .
relegation conundrum unraveling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's gilberto opens the floodgates for the 4-0 elsewhere , hertha berlin trounced hosts alemannia aachen 4-0 to go seventh in the league as brazilian midfielder gilberto opened the scoring with a goal after just seven minutes .
berlin striker christian gimenez grabbed a second three minutes after the break to make it 2-0 , before marko pantelic and yildiray basturk grabbed two late goals .
meanwhile , vfl wolfsburg drew 1-1 at nuremberg after polish midfielder jacek krzynowek slotted home a left-footed shot after a 40-metre run on 18 minutes for the guests .
but the home side were back level just five minutes later when defender andreas wolf headed them on level terms .
mid-table hanover had dutch midfielder arnold jan bruggink 's right-footed shot to thank for their opening goal in their 2-1 win at second-from-bottom mainz 05 .
and hanover 's bulgarian midfielder chavdar yankov extended their lead to 2-0 with a right-footed shot from a 50th minute corner before mainz 's egyptian international mohamed zidan grabbed a late consolation goal .
thomas doll 's borussia dortmund moved away from the relegation dog-fight after swiss international alexander frei gave them a 2-0 win at home to eintracht frankfurt with two well-struck free-kicks either side of half-time .
saturday 's results have cleared the relegation picture somewhat , with hanover now safe and hamburg , bochum and borussia dortmund virtually secure .

german soccer authorities will investigate a " secret " meeting between bayern munich and werder bremen 's striker miroslav klose to see if any of the strict rules concerning approaches to contracted players were breached . holger hieronymus , deputy chief executive of the german football league -lrb- dfl -rrb- , told dpa sunday that both bayern and werder would be asked to make statements about the meeting .
klose has admitted he met bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld and general manager uli hoeness last tuesday in hanover , two days before werder played espanyol in the first leg of the semi-finals of the uefa cup .
under dfl regulations , clubs should not approach players from other clubs without first making an official approach in writing .
werder knew nothing about bayern 's meeting with klose until it was reported afterwards .
both bayern and klose could be fined by the dfl as a result of the meeting .
in a recent similar case in england , chelsea and defender ashley cole were fined a total of 900,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.25 million -rrb- for an unauthorised meeting which led to the player 's transfer from arsenal .

in the statement , he described the meeting as " merely information talks and not contractual negotiations " .

" we have all witnessed the dangers of climate change in the last few months .
we only saw winter in the calendar in germany , " he said , alluding to last year 's unusually mild winter . gabriel reminded the mps that germany needs to improve its energy efficiency by three percent per year in order to meet the eu target of reducing carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions by 20 percent below 1990-levels by 2020 . but the environment minister went further , proposing an eight-point plan that includes cutting germany 's co2 emissions by 40 percent within 13 years .
gabriel said he wanted to enlist industry 's help in pursuing this ambitious goal . " we should set ourselves the goal of making germany the most energy-efficient country in the world , " gabriel told the mps in berlin . efficiency from the bottom up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german railways : the better way to travel , says gabriel the action plan also calls on ordinary citizens to contribute to the fight against global warming , and envisions an 11-percent reduction in electricity use by 2020 .
this alone would save 40 million tons of co2 , gabriel said . the social democrat minister also encouraged germans to take the train more often as part of the effort .
gabriel told the german tabloid bild zeitung on thursday that he plans to further subsidize germany 's extensive railway system to lure travellers away from inexpensive short-haul flights with airlines such as germanwings or ryanair . " we must ensure that train services are able to compete with air travel , " gabriel said , and suggested that train tickets should qualify for a sales tax break that would allow the deutsche bahn ag to reduce ticket prices for consumers . " there is no tax on airline fuel , but the rail operator must pay the full value-added tax on the sale of long-distance tickets , " gabriel complained to the bundestag .
" that is unfair and can not remain that way . " green power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the green talk , germany plans to build more coal power plants gabriel also unveiled plans to modernize power stations across germany .
he said he wants to double the number of combined heat and power plants that trap and reuse heat generated in power production instead of releasing it . the german government under chancellor angela merkel has agreed to generate over a quarter of its power from environmentally friendly sources by 2020 , according to gabriel .
wind turbines , photovoltaic -lrb- solar -rrb- panels and biofuels are some of the most common forms of green energy , and they have become a formidable market force in germany . but gabriel criticized the government 's tacit approval of plans to build almost 30 new coal power plants on german soil , and he further attacked the conservative camp for advocating nuclear power as a " green " alternative .
nuclear power plants emit near-zero greenhouse gases , but nuclear waste and the possibility of a meltdown pose a different kind of environmental threat . investing in efficiency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three billion euros is a lot , but still better than constant droughts gabriel 's program would cost the german government three billion euros -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- over the next three years , according to the environment ministry 's own estimates .
the program aims to slash 270 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 . despite the country 's long tradition of progressive green policies , germany currently emits more than one billion tons of carbon dioxide per year , making it the world 's sixth-largest polluter . a german economic think-tank recently calculated that the consequences of unfettered cliamte change would cost germany more than 130 billion euros by the middle of the century .
compared to this sum , gabriel 's request for an additional three billion euros seems like a negligable investment in the future . global deadlock environmental protection groups welcomed gabriel 's plans , which they described as ambitious , but cautioned that words had to be followed by action . but gabriel warned that germany 's best efforts would be useless if the world did not follow suit .
chancellor merkel has made climate change a high priority at the june g8 summit in germany , but us president bush , leader of the world 's heaviest-polluting nation , has been reluctant to sign on to greenhouse gas regulations . " if we succeed in breaking the deadlock between the united states and some industrial countries on the one hand and developing countries on the other , the chances do n't look bad , " gabriel said .
" i am quite optimistic . " dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu urges germany to do more to combat climate change a day after a bleak report on global warming and its potentially devastating effects was published , germany and the eu are at loggerheads over whether europe 's largest economy is doing enough to lower greenhouse gases .

meanwhile title-holders bayern munich , beaten at home 2-1 by sv hamburg on saturday , have slipped out of the picture - now eight points behind stuttgart in fourth place .
veh and his stuttgart players had never considered themselves as title contenders until now , always maintaining their main ambition was perhaps to qualify for the champions league next season .
a first league title since 1992 was never a serious proposition .
but after the tight 1-0 win saturday at relegation-doomed bottom club borussia mönchengladbach , veh said : " we have the chance to reach first place .
it 's been a super season which we now want to top . "
" thankless " win puts title in sight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was all huff and puff in gladbach but vfb got the win veh was delighted by his side 's " thankless " 1-0 victory at mönchengladbach , achieved through midfielder roberto hilbert 's 53rd minute goal .
" that was a thankless win , " said veh .
" playing the league 's bottom side really puts you under pressure and you feel the expectation to get three points .
gladbach stood up very well in defence and were very hard to break down .
" but after we got the crucial goal , we really turned it on in the second half and were a pleasure to watch , " the coach purred .
stuttgart , who have only led the table once this season , also have the german cup in their sights after reaching the final against nuremberg , and an unlikely double is now very much a possibility .
veh 's young team has been under no pressure at all this season - unlike rivals bayern or schalke - and have impressed in attack where young german striker mario gomez and the brazilian cacau have scored 25 goals between them .
pressure taking toll on tightly-packed rivals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke were undone by a committed bochum team friday meanwhile their rivals are showing signs of cracking .
schalke slid to a 2-1 defeat at bochum on friday , while werder are out of sorts following a 3-0 defeat against espanyol in the uefa cup on thursday and news that striker miroslav klose has met bayern munich officials to sound out a possible transfer .
schalke coach mirko slomka said : " perhaps it was good that we lost .
in any case better than losing on the last day of the season .
we have to win our remaining three games and hope that the others also slip up . "
record title-holders bayern are now writing off a season which seems to be going from bad to worse after a 10th league defeat , at home to a hamburg side who now look to have pulled themselves out of relegation trouble .
" if i really said what i am thinking then the club would suspend me , so i am keeping my thoughts to myself , " said a clearly frustrated goalkeeper oliver kahn after the 2-1 defeat .
bayern 's peruvian claudio pizarro gave the home side the lead after 35 minutes , but hamburg 's dutch midfielder rafael van der vaart , who is being courted by bayern , cancelled out the advantage with a 71st minute goal .

hamburg were more determined and that was the difference . "
bayern 's general manager uli hoeness could barely contain his wrath .
" all our energy is now going into getting a new team on the pitch next season which will have nothing in common with this team , " he said .
" this team has had its chance .
if you have a whole year to take your chance and do n't use it then you do n't deserve a second one . "
bayern were jeered off the pitch after another lacklustre display which means the team have missed out on the champions league - qualifying instead for the uefa cup - for the first time since 1996 .
" it 's clear to everyone that this team needs fresh players and we will get them , " said hoeness .
" we have enough money for new players . "
according to italy 's la gazzetta dello sport newspaper , italy striker luca toni will be one of the newcomers , but there has so far been no confirmation of the report from bayern .

berlin striker christian gimenez grabbed a second three minutes after the break to make it 2-0 , before marko pantelic and yildiray basturk grabbed two late goals .
meanwhile , vfl wolfsburg drew 1-1 at nuremberg after polish midfielder jacek krzynowek slotted home a left-footed shot after a 40-metre run on 18 minutes for the guests .
but the home side were back level just five minutes later when defender andreas wolf headed them on level terms .
mid-table hanover had dutch midfielder arnold jan bruggink 's right-footed shot to thank for their opening goal in their 2-1 win at second-from-bottom mainz 05 .

thomas doll 's borussia dortmund moved away from the relegation dog-fight after swiss international alexander frei gave them a 2-0 win at home to eintracht frankfurt with two well-struck free-kicks either side of half-time .

we only saw winter in the calendar in germany , " he said , alluding to last year 's unusually mild winter . gabriel reminded the mps that germany needs to improve its energy efficiency by three percent per year in order to meet the eu target of reducing carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions by 20 percent below 1990-levels by 2020 . but the environment minister went further , proposing an eight-point plan that includes cutting germany 's co2 emissions by 40 percent within 13 years .
gabriel said he wanted to enlist industry 's help in pursuing this ambitious goal . " we should set ourselves the goal of making germany the most energy-efficient country in the world , " gabriel told the mps in berlin . efficiency from the bottom up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german railways : the better way to travel , says gabriel the action plan also calls on ordinary citizens to contribute to the fight against global warming , and envisions an 11-percent reduction in electricity use by 2020 .
this alone would save 40 million tons of co2 , gabriel said . the social democrat minister also encouraged germans to take the train more often as part of the effort .
gabriel told the german tabloid bild zeitung on thursday that he plans to further subsidize germany 's extensive railway system to lure travellers away from inexpensive short-haul flights with airlines such as germanwings or ryanair . " we must ensure that train services are able to compete with air travel , " gabriel said , and suggested that train tickets should qualify for a sales tax break that would allow the deutsche bahn ag to reduce ticket prices for consumers . " there is no tax on airline fuel , but the rail operator must pay the full value-added tax on the sale of long-distance tickets , " gabriel complained to the bundestag .
" that is unfair and can not remain that way . " green power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the green talk , germany plans to build more coal power plants gabriel also unveiled plans to modernize power stations across germany .
he said he wants to double the number of combined heat and power plants that trap and reuse heat generated in power production instead of releasing it . the german government under chancellor angela merkel has agreed to generate over a quarter of its power from environmentally friendly sources by 2020 , according to gabriel .
wind turbines , photovoltaic -lrb- solar -rrb- panels and biofuels are some of the most common forms of green energy , and they have become a formidable market force in germany . but gabriel criticized the government 's tacit approval of plans to build almost 30 new coal power plants on german soil , and he further attacked the conservative camp for advocating nuclear power as a " green " alternative .
nuclear power plants emit near-zero greenhouse gases , but nuclear waste and the possibility of a meltdown pose a different kind of environmental threat . investing in efficiency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three billion euros is a lot , but still better than constant droughts gabriel 's program would cost the german government three billion euros -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- over the next three years , according to the environment ministry 's own estimates .
the program aims to slash 270 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 . despite the country 's long tradition of progressive green policies , germany currently emits more than one billion tons of carbon dioxide per year , making it the world 's sixth-largest polluter . a german economic think-tank recently calculated that the consequences of unfettered cliamte change would cost germany more than 130 billion euros by the middle of the century .
compared to this sum , gabriel 's request for an additional three billion euros seems like a negligable investment in the future . global deadlock environmental protection groups welcomed gabriel 's plans , which they described as ambitious , but cautioned that words had to be followed by action . but gabriel warned that germany 's best efforts would be useless if the world did not follow suit .
chancellor merkel has made climate change a high priority at the june g8 summit in germany , but us president bush , leader of the world 's heaviest-polluting nation , has been reluctant to sign on to greenhouse gas regulations . " if we succeed in breaking the deadlock between the united states and some industrial countries on the one hand and developing countries on the other , the chances do n't look bad , " gabriel said .

we only saw winter in the calendar in germany , " he said , alluding to last year 's unusually mild winter . gabriel reminded the mps that germany needs to improve its energy efficiency by three percent per year in order to meet the eu target of reducing carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions by 20 percent below 1990-levels by 2020 . but the environment minister went further , proposing an eight-point plan that includes cutting germany 's co2 emissions by 40 percent within 13 years .
gabriel said he wanted to enlist industry 's help in pursuing this ambitious goal . " we should set ourselves the goal of making germany the most energy-efficient country in the world , " gabriel told the mps in berlin . efficiency from the bottom up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german railways : the better way to travel , says gabriel the action plan also calls on ordinary citizens to contribute to the fight against global warming , and envisions an 11-percent reduction in electricity use by 2020 .
this alone would save 40 million tons of co2 , gabriel said . the social democrat minister also encouraged germans to take the train more often as part of the effort .
gabriel told the german tabloid bild zeitung on thursday that he plans to further subsidize germany 's extensive railway system to lure travellers away from inexpensive short-haul flights with airlines such as germanwings or ryanair . " we must ensure that train services are able to compete with air travel , " gabriel said , and suggested that train tickets should qualify for a sales tax break that would allow the deutsche bahn ag to reduce ticket prices for consumers . " there is no tax on airline fuel , but the rail operator must pay the full value-added tax on the sale of long-distance tickets , " gabriel complained to the bundestag .
" that is unfair and can not remain that way . " green power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the green talk , germany plans to build more coal power plants gabriel also unveiled plans to modernize power stations across germany .
he said he wants to double the number of combined heat and power plants that trap and reuse heat generated in power production instead of releasing it . the german government under chancellor angela merkel has agreed to generate over a quarter of its power from environmentally friendly sources by 2020 , according to gabriel .
wind turbines , photovoltaic -lrb- solar -rrb- panels and biofuels are some of the most common forms of green energy , and they have become a formidable market force in germany . but gabriel criticized the government 's tacit approval of plans to build almost 30 new coal power plants on german soil , and he further attacked the conservative camp for advocating nuclear power as a " green " alternative .
nuclear power plants emit near-zero greenhouse gases , but nuclear waste and the possibility of a meltdown pose a different kind of environmental threat . investing in efficiency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three billion euros is a lot , but still better than constant droughts gabriel 's program would cost the german government three billion euros -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- over the next three years , according to the environment ministry 's own estimates .
the program aims to slash 270 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 . despite the country 's long tradition of progressive green policies , germany currently emits more than one billion tons of carbon dioxide per year , making it the world 's sixth-largest polluter . a german economic think-tank recently calculated that the consequences of unfettered cliamte change would cost germany more than 130 billion euros by the middle of the century .
compared to this sum , gabriel 's request for an additional three billion euros seems like a negligable investment in the future . global deadlock environmental protection groups welcomed gabriel 's plans , which they described as ambitious , but cautioned that words had to be followed by action . but gabriel warned that germany 's best efforts would be useless if the world did not follow suit .
chancellor merkel has made climate change a high priority at the june g8 summit in germany , but us president bush , leader of the world 's heaviest-polluting nation , has been reluctant to sign on to greenhouse gas regulations . " if we succeed in breaking the deadlock between the united states and some industrial countries on the one hand and developing countries on the other , the chances do n't look bad , " gabriel said .

the akp dominates the 550-seat parliament , but does not have the required two-thirds majority to get gul elected in the first two rounds of voting .
the opposition boycotted the vote because of gul 's islamist past and because they were not consulted on his candiacy for the non-partisan post .
army statements cause concerns the army , which has carried out three coups in the past , issued a statement saying it was determined to protect turkey 's secular system and was ready to take action if the need arose , making it clear , according to many analysts , that gul 's candidacy was not welcome .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish army sees itself as the guardian of secularism the government responded by calling the army to order and gul on sunday ruled out withdrawing his presidential bid .
" it is out of the question for me to withdraw my candidacy in any way , " he told reporters in ankara .
the prospect of gul becoming head of state has alarmed secularists who fear the strict separation of state and religion will be eroded and islam will creep into all fields of life if he is elected .
court to decide on next round of voting the main opposition republican people 's party has asked the constitutional court to cancel friday 's presidential vote in parliament , arguing that the assembly did not have the necessary quorum to open the voting session .
if the court annuls the vote , general elections set for november 4 could be brought forward .
if does not , gul could be elected president in a third round of voting on may 9 , when an absolute majority of 276 votes would suffice , compared to the two-thirds majority of 367 required for the first two rounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a court decision may decide which president leads turkey " we all need to await the decision of the constitutional court , " gul said .
" the court will undoubtedly make the best evaluation and reach the right decision . "
gul and prime minister recep tayyip erdogan served in now-defunct islamist parties before setting up the akp in 2001 .
they say they have disawoved their islamist roots and are now committed to secular principles .
fear of an islamist agenda but secularists suspect the akp of harbouring a secret islamic agenda , citing its unsuccessful attempts to criminalise adultery , restrict alcohol sales and lift a ban on islamic headscarves in government offices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many turks fear the introduction of sharia law they fear the government will have a free hand to implement islamist policies if the party controls the presidency .
the turkish press on sunday was unanimous in calling on the government and the army to resolve their differences democratically and said early elections were the only way to prevent the country from plunging into chaos .
" turkey either giving up on secularism or suspending democracy are two doomsday scenarios impossible to choose between , " the popular daily vatan said .
the liberal daily milliyet said the army 's warning had " cast a shadow on the credibility and respectability of civilian institutions . "
" the latest developments show that the current term of parliament has reached the end of its natural life .
elections should be held at once , " it added . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu warns turkish army about meddling in presidential elections the european union warned the turkish army on saturday not to interfere in the country 's democratic process amid a dispute over the ruling party 's islamist-rooted candidate to be turkey 's next president .

now , a government crackdown is forcing many coffee shops out of business . a dense , sweet-smelling smoke fills the room in the de molen coffee shop .
here in the dutch city of enschede , the streets are littered with places like de molen , which openly sell soft drugs such as hashish or marijuana . but dozens of coffee shops have had to close shop in recent months , reflecting a growing consensus in the netherlands that the country 's notoriously liberal drug policy is currently doing more harm than good . enschede has been particularly problematic for local authorities , because of its immediate proximity to the german border .
thousands of drug tourists , mainly from germany , pour across the border each year for a taste of legal marijuana , a controlled substance in almost every country of the world - including , technically , the netherlands . " many germans come to visit enschede just because of our coffee shops - that is a fact , " says enschede city spokesman michael haase .
indeed , the nearest coffee shop is located just 300 meters beyond the border checkpoint . the limits of tolerance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a girl smokes up in a dutch coffee shop the dutch ministry of foreign affairs has published a brochure complaining that shops located along the german border " frequently " cause trouble .
and haase says local residents are sometimes harassed by glassy-eyed drug tourists . enschede 's drug trade has also become a liability for the border police , as drug tourists are regularly caught trying to smuggle the lucrative weed back into their home country . but the last decade has seen a steady decline in the number of coffee shops , according to city officials .
eight years ago , enschede counted 17 coffee shops ; today , only 9 remain to serve the city 's population of 155,000 . the number of coffee shops has declined nationally , as well , with nearly 740 coffee shops in 2004 compared to 1180 in 1997 .
rather than a result of market realities , the decline stems from a concerted political effort to put a lid on the legal drug trade . " dutch local politicians have watched the drug tourism critically and have tightened the reins , " says christoph boenig , spokesman for the cross-border network euregio .
and michael haase , the city spokesman , says " there is a consensus amongst all political parties " concerning drug policy . since 1999 , local politicians in enschede have had the authority to shut down coffee shops , even if there were no reports of trouble or disturbances . business as usual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch labor party 's wouter bos campaigned in enschede last year but it is unclear whether the reduction in the number of coffee shops has actually resulted in a decrease in drug consumption and drug tourism ; and not all the coffee shops have closed down .
in the de molen coffee shop , it is business as usual . the de molen serves fifty customers on a normal day , and twice as many on weekends and holidays .
the staff there reports that the number of german and dutch customers is about equal . each customer is allowed to buy up to five grams of soft drugs , ranging from cannabis products like hashish or marijuana to psilocybin mushrooms , a psychoactive drug that can lead to hours of hallucinations .
the de molen , like most of its competitors , offers several different varieties of marijuana . " you can choose from many different flavors and strengths , " a saleswoman explains .
the cheapest is called " ketama , " and 0.8 grams cost five euros -lrb- ca. seven dollars -rrb- . but other varieties , such as " white widow , " have been engineered for maximum strength , containing as much as 25 percent tetrahydrocannabinol -lrb- thc -rrb- , the active ingredient in the cannabis plant .
a few decades ago , cannabis varieties rarely contained more than 10 percent thc . revising the drug policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a typical marijuana plant this increased effectiveness has caused policymakers to reconsider the definition of " soft " drugs .
some have advocated to bring dutch policy in line with international standards by completely banning all drugs , soft or hard .
but others say the current policy of tolerance is inconsistent , and that soft drugs should be legalized on the books as well as in practice . the netherlands effectively decriminalized soft drugs a few decades ago when it introduced a policy of " non-enforcement . "
although possession and cultivation of cannabis remains technically illegal in holland , law enforcement has systematically turned a blind eye , and the courts usually rule in favor of individual defendants . two years ago , gerd leers , mayor of the border city of maastricht , criticized this government policy .
leers said that by allowing possession and retail sales of cannabis but not cultivation or wholesale , the government creates problems of crime and public safety . the de molen coffee shop has survived the wave of closures - and so has another legal curiosity of the dutch penal code .
shops are barred from transporting drugs to their stores .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 29.04.2007 germany to become world 's most energy-efficient country großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environment minister sigmar gabriel tackles the " inconvenient truth " of pollution the german environment ministry this week unveiled a set of highly ambitious proposals that would lead germany to become the world 's most energy-efficient country in the coming years . environment minister sigmar gabriel told the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , that the time had come to act .
" we have all witnessed the dangers of climate change in the last few months .
we only saw winter in the calendar in germany , " he said , alluding to last year 's unusually mild winter . gabriel reminded the mps that germany needs to improve its energy efficiency by three percent per year in order to meet the eu target of reducing carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions by 20 percent below 1990-levels by 2020 . but the environment minister went further , proposing an eight-point plan that includes cutting germany 's co2 emissions by 40 percent within 13 years .
gabriel said he wanted to enlist industry 's help in pursuing this ambitious goal . " we should set ourselves the goal of making germany the most energy-efficient country in the world , " gabriel told the mps in berlin . efficiency from the bottom up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german railways : the better way to travel , says gabriel the action plan also calls on ordinary citizens to contribute to the fight against global warming , and envisions an 11-percent reduction in electricity use by 2020 .
this alone would save 40 million tons of co2 , gabriel said . the social democrat minister also encouraged germans to take the train more often as part of the effort .
gabriel told the german tabloid bild zeitung on thursday that he plans to further subsidize germany 's extensive railway system to lure travellers away from inexpensive short-haul flights with airlines such as germanwings or ryanair . " we must ensure that train services are able to compete with air travel , " gabriel said , and suggested that train tickets should qualify for a sales tax break that would allow the deutsche bahn ag to reduce ticket prices for consumers . " there is no tax on airline fuel , but the rail operator must pay the full value-added tax on the sale of long-distance tickets , " gabriel complained to the bundestag .
" that is unfair and can not remain that way . " green power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the green talk , germany plans to build more coal power plants gabriel also unveiled plans to modernize power stations across germany .
he said he wants to double the number of combined heat and power plants that trap and reuse heat generated in power production instead of releasing it . the german government under chancellor angela merkel has agreed to generate over a quarter of its power from environmentally friendly sources by 2020 , according to gabriel .
wind turbines , photovoltaic -lrb- solar -rrb- panels and biofuels are some of the most common forms of green energy , and they have become a formidable market force in germany . but gabriel criticized the government 's tacit approval of plans to build almost 30 new coal power plants on german soil , and he further attacked the conservative camp for advocating nuclear power as a " green " alternative .
nuclear power plants emit near-zero greenhouse gases , but nuclear waste and the possibility of a meltdown pose a different kind of environmental threat . investing in efficiency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three billion euros is a lot , but still better than constant droughts gabriel 's program would cost the german government three billion euros -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- over the next three years , according to the environment ministry 's own estimates .
the program aims to slash 270 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 . despite the country 's long tradition of progressive green policies , germany currently emits more than one billion tons of carbon dioxide per year , making it the world 's sixth-largest polluter . a german economic think-tank recently calculated that the consequences of unfettered cliamte change would cost germany more than 130 billion euros by the middle of the century .
compared to this sum , gabriel 's request for an additional three billion euros seems like a negligable investment in the future . global deadlock environmental protection groups welcomed gabriel 's plans , which they described as ambitious , but cautioned that words had to be followed by action . but gabriel warned that germany 's best efforts would be useless if the world did not follow suit .
chancellor merkel has made climate change a high priority at the june g8 summit in germany , but us president bush , leader of the world 's heaviest-polluting nation , has been reluctant to sign on to greenhouse gas regulations . " if we succeed in breaking the deadlock between the united states and some industrial countries on the one hand and developing countries on the other , the chances do n't look bad , " gabriel said .

now , a government crackdown is forcing many coffee shops out of business . a dense , sweet-smelling smoke fills the room in the de molen coffee shop .
here in the dutch city of enschede , the streets are littered with places like de molen , which openly sell soft drugs such as hashish or marijuana . but dozens of coffee shops have had to close shop in recent months , reflecting a growing consensus in the netherlands that the country 's notoriously liberal drug policy is currently doing more harm than good . enschede has been particularly problematic for local authorities , because of its immediate proximity to the german border .
thousands of drug tourists , mainly from germany , pour across the border each year for a taste of legal marijuana , a controlled substance in almost every country of the world - including , technically , the netherlands . " many germans come to visit enschede just because of our coffee shops - that is a fact , " says enschede city spokesman michael haase .
indeed , the nearest coffee shop is located just 300 meters beyond the border checkpoint . the limits of tolerance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a girl smokes up in a dutch coffee shop the dutch ministry of foreign affairs has published a brochure complaining that shops located along the german border " frequently " cause trouble .
and haase says local residents are sometimes harassed by glassy-eyed drug tourists . enschede 's drug trade has also become a liability for the border police , as drug tourists are regularly caught trying to smuggle the lucrative weed back into their home country . but the last decade has seen a steady decline in the number of coffee shops , according to city officials .
eight years ago , enschede counted 17 coffee shops ; today , only 9 remain to serve the city 's population of 155,000 . the number of coffee shops has declined nationally , as well , with nearly 740 coffee shops in 2004 compared to 1180 in 1997 .
rather than a result of market realities , the decline stems from a concerted political effort to put a lid on the legal drug trade . " dutch local politicians have watched the drug tourism critically and have tightened the reins , " says christoph boenig , spokesman for the cross-border network euregio .
and michael haase , the city spokesman , says " there is a consensus amongst all political parties " concerning drug policy . since 1999 , local politicians in enschede have had the authority to shut down coffee shops , even if there were no reports of trouble or disturbances . business as usual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch labor party 's wouter bos campaigned in enschede last year but it is unclear whether the reduction in the number of coffee shops has actually resulted in a decrease in drug consumption and drug tourism ; and not all the coffee shops have closed down .
in the de molen coffee shop , it is business as usual . the de molen serves fifty customers on a normal day , and twice as many on weekends and holidays .
the staff there reports that the number of german and dutch customers is about equal . each customer is allowed to buy up to five grams of soft drugs , ranging from cannabis products like hashish or marijuana to psilocybin mushrooms , a psychoactive drug that can lead to hours of hallucinations .
the de molen , like most of its competitors , offers several different varieties of marijuana . " you can choose from many different flavors and strengths , " a saleswoman explains .
the cheapest is called " ketama , " and 0.8 grams cost five euros -lrb- ca. seven dollars -rrb- . but other varieties , such as " white widow , " have been engineered for maximum strength , containing as much as 25 percent tetrahydrocannabinol -lrb- thc -rrb- , the active ingredient in the cannabis plant .
a few decades ago , cannabis varieties rarely contained more than 10 percent thc . revising the drug policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a typical marijuana plant this increased effectiveness has caused policymakers to reconsider the definition of " soft " drugs .
some have advocated to bring dutch policy in line with international standards by completely banning all drugs , soft or hard .
but others say the current policy of tolerance is inconsistent , and that soft drugs should be legalized on the books as well as in practice . the netherlands effectively decriminalized soft drugs a few decades ago when it introduced a policy of " non-enforcement . "
although possession and cultivation of cannabis remains technically illegal in holland , law enforcement has systematically turned a blind eye , and the courts usually rule in favor of individual defendants . two years ago , gerd leers , mayor of the border city of maastricht , criticized this government policy .

all three treatments are based on replacing human genes , cells or tissues affected by various diseases with healthy ones . the regulation provides for a compulsory centralized procedure to authorize the marketing of innovative medical products and also for the subsequent monitoring of patients and products . ' great economic potential ' it also offers " new hope to thousands of patients and researchers , " the strasbourg-based parliament said in a statement . british mep giles chichester , a member of the parliament 's industry , research and energy committee , strongly supported the measure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vote followed an ethical debate in the eu parliament " i regularly see reports in the press of exciting new therapies and developments in this field .
but usually they are in the usa and not in europe , which is to our loss , " he said . such innovative therapies , which have huge potential for curing ailments such as parkinson 's , alzheimer 's , blindness , spinal cord injury , cancer and heart disease , " have great potential for the european economy , " the parliament said . ethical debate on stem-cell research the parliament assured it " does not interfere with decisions made by member states on whether to allow the use of specific types of cells such as embryonic stem cells in accordance with their ethical choices . " stem-cell therapy is the most controversial emerging medical treatment as it can involve cells extracted from human embryos .
the practice is illegal in some eu countries , including poland and italy . some meps had tabled ethical amendments , but these were mainly rejected .
the opposition came mostly from italian and german members and those from eastern europe , who wanted to exclude from the regulations those treatments deemed to be ethically questionable . polish mep konrad szymanski warned that the new rules " may have serious shortcomings " as " there may not be enough guarantees for human dignities . "
if europe rightly wanted to set human rights standards in the world , he continued , it could not afford to adopt a " passive position " when it comes to advanced therapies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : treatments for diseases like alzheimers and cancer are in play an amendment that proposed the exclusion of embryonic or fetal-cell tissue products from the regulation was defeated by 357 votes to 269 .
the parliament did vote to exclude any products containing non-viable human or animal cells or tissues . regulation offers guarantees to donors , patients the regulation states that the donation of cells and tissues must be voluntary and unpaid and the anonymity of donors and recipients guaranteed .
patients must also have the right to know the origin of any cells or tissues used , subject to respect for donor anonymity . three of the main political groupings in the parliament had agreed a compromise package to allow the regulation to enter into force speedily , probably around mid-2008 . it already has the approval of representatives of the 27 eu member states , despite opposition from the official parliamentary rapporteur , slovak miroslav mikolasic . current rules on the authorization of the so-called ' advanced therapies ' differ widely across the eu 's 27 member states . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversial decision allows women to donate eggs to science the decision by british fertility regulators to pay women to donate eggs to medical research raises tricky questions about the ethics of compromising women 's health in the pursuit of scientific stardom .
-lrb- 02.03.2007 -rrb- patent protest erupts over human stem cell research german laws regarding embryonic stem cells are some of the most restrictive in the world .
this month , a german court also partially reversed approval for a patent to a german scientist for his stem cell research methods .

" we have all witnessed the dangers of climate change in the last few months .
we only saw winter in the calendar in germany , " he said , alluding to last year 's unusually mild winter . gabriel reminded the mps that germany needs to improve its energy efficiency by three percent per year in order to meet the eu target of reducing carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions by 20 percent below 1990-levels by 2020 . but the environment minister went further , proposing an eight-point plan that includes cutting germany 's co2 emissions by 40 percent within 13 years .
gabriel said he wanted to enlist industry 's help in pursuing this ambitious goal . " we should set ourselves the goal of making germany the most energy-efficient country in the world , " gabriel told the mps in berlin . efficiency from the bottom up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german railways : the better way to travel , says gabriel the action plan also calls on ordinary citizens to contribute to the fight against global warming , and envisions an 11-percent reduction in electricity use by 2020 .
this alone would save 40 million tons of co2 , gabriel said . the social democrat minister also encouraged germans to take the train more often as part of the effort .
gabriel told the german tabloid bild zeitung on thursday that he plans to further subsidize germany 's extensive railway system to lure travellers away from inexpensive short-haul flights with airlines such as germanwings or ryanair . " we must ensure that train services are able to compete with air travel , " gabriel said , and suggested that train tickets should qualify for a sales tax break that would allow the deutsche bahn ag to reduce ticket prices for consumers . " there is no tax on airline fuel , but the rail operator must pay the full value-added tax on the sale of long-distance tickets , " gabriel complained to the bundestag .
" that is unfair and can not remain that way . " green power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the green talk , germany plans to build more coal power plants gabriel also unveiled plans to modernize power stations across germany .
he said he wants to double the number of combined heat and power plants that trap and reuse heat generated in power production instead of releasing it . the german government under chancellor angela merkel has agreed to generate over a quarter of its power from environmentally friendly sources by 2020 , according to gabriel .
wind turbines , photovoltaic -lrb- solar -rrb- panels and biofuels are some of the most common forms of green energy , and they have become a formidable market force in germany . but gabriel criticized the government 's tacit approval of plans to build almost 30 new coal power plants on german soil , and he further attacked the conservative camp for advocating nuclear power as a " green " alternative .
nuclear power plants emit near-zero greenhouse gases , but nuclear waste and the possibility of a meltdown pose a different kind of environmental threat . investing in efficiency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three billion euros is a lot , but still better than constant droughts gabriel 's program would cost the german government three billion euros -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- over the next three years , according to the environment ministry 's own estimates .
the program aims to slash 270 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 . despite the country 's long tradition of progressive green policies , germany currently emits more than one billion tons of carbon dioxide per year , making it the world 's sixth-largest polluter . a german economic think-tank recently calculated that the consequences of unfettered cliamte change would cost germany more than 130 billion euros by the middle of the century .
compared to this sum , gabriel 's request for an additional three billion euros seems like a negligable investment in the future . global deadlock environmental protection groups welcomed gabriel 's plans , which they described as ambitious , but cautioned that words had to be followed by action . but gabriel warned that germany 's best efforts would be useless if the world did not follow suit .
chancellor merkel has made climate change a high priority at the june g8 summit in germany , but us president bush , leader of the world 's heaviest-polluting nation , has been reluctant to sign on to greenhouse gas regulations . " if we succeed in breaking the deadlock between the united states and some industrial countries on the one hand and developing countries on the other , the chances do n't look bad , " gabriel said .

" we have all witnessed the dangers of climate change in the last few months .
we only saw winter in the calendar in germany , " he said , alluding to last year 's unusually mild winter . gabriel reminded the mps that germany needs to improve its energy efficiency by three percent per year in order to meet the eu target of reducing carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions by 20 percent below 1990-levels by 2020 . but the environment minister went further , proposing an eight-point plan that includes cutting germany 's co2 emissions by 40 percent within 13 years .
gabriel said he wanted to enlist industry 's help in pursuing this ambitious goal . " we should set ourselves the goal of making germany the most energy-efficient country in the world , " gabriel told the mps in berlin . efficiency from the bottom up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german railways : the better way to travel , says gabriel the action plan also calls on ordinary citizens to contribute to the fight against global warming , and envisions an 11-percent reduction in electricity use by 2020 .
this alone would save 40 million tons of co2 , gabriel said . the social democrat minister also encouraged germans to take the train more often as part of the effort .
gabriel told the german tabloid bild zeitung on thursday that he plans to further subsidize germany 's extensive railway system to lure travellers away from inexpensive short-haul flights with airlines such as germanwings or ryanair . " we must ensure that train services are able to compete with air travel , " gabriel said , and suggested that train tickets should qualify for a sales tax break that would allow the deutsche bahn ag to reduce ticket prices for consumers . " there is no tax on airline fuel , but the rail operator must pay the full value-added tax on the sale of long-distance tickets , " gabriel complained to the bundestag .
" that is unfair and can not remain that way . " green power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the green talk , germany plans to build more coal power plants gabriel also unveiled plans to modernize power stations across germany .
he said he wants to double the number of combined heat and power plants that trap and reuse heat generated in power production instead of releasing it . the german government under chancellor angela merkel has agreed to generate over a quarter of its power from environmentally friendly sources by 2020 , according to gabriel .
wind turbines , photovoltaic -lrb- solar -rrb- panels and biofuels are some of the most common forms of green energy , and they have become a formidable market force in germany . but gabriel criticized the government 's tacit approval of plans to build almost 30 new coal power plants on german soil , and he further attacked the conservative camp for advocating nuclear power as a " green " alternative .
nuclear power plants emit near-zero greenhouse gases , but nuclear waste and the possibility of a meltdown pose a different kind of environmental threat . investing in efficiency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three billion euros is a lot , but still better than constant droughts gabriel 's program would cost the german government three billion euros -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- over the next three years , according to the environment ministry 's own estimates .
the program aims to slash 270 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 . despite the country 's long tradition of progressive green policies , germany currently emits more than one billion tons of carbon dioxide per year , making it the world 's sixth-largest polluter . a german economic think-tank recently calculated that the consequences of unfettered cliamte change would cost germany more than 130 billion euros by the middle of the century .
compared to this sum , gabriel 's request for an additional three billion euros seems like a negligable investment in the future . global deadlock environmental protection groups welcomed gabriel 's plans , which they described as ambitious , but cautioned that words had to be followed by action . but gabriel warned that germany 's best efforts would be useless if the world did not follow suit .
chancellor merkel has made climate change a high priority at the june g8 summit in germany , but us president bush , leader of the world 's heaviest-polluting nation , has been reluctant to sign on to greenhouse gas regulations . " if we succeed in breaking the deadlock between the united states and some industrial countries on the one hand and developing countries on the other , the chances do n't look bad , " gabriel said .

now , a government crackdown is forcing many coffee shops out of business . a dense , sweet-smelling smoke fills the room in the de molen coffee shop .
here in the dutch city of enschede , the streets are littered with places like de molen , which openly sell soft drugs such as hashish or marijuana . but dozens of coffee shops have had to close shop in recent months , reflecting a growing consensus in the netherlands that the country 's notoriously liberal drug policy is currently doing more harm than good . enschede has been particularly problematic for local authorities , because of its immediate proximity to the german border .
thousands of drug tourists , mainly from germany , pour across the border each year for a taste of legal marijuana , a controlled substance in almost every country of the world - including , technically , the netherlands . " many germans come to visit enschede just because of our coffee shops - that is a fact , " says enschede city spokesman michael haase .
indeed , the nearest coffee shop is located just 300 meters beyond the border checkpoint . the limits of tolerance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a girl smokes up in a dutch coffee shop the dutch ministry of foreign affairs has published a brochure complaining that shops located along the german border " frequently " cause trouble .
and haase says local residents are sometimes harassed by glassy-eyed drug tourists . enschede 's drug trade has also become a liability for the border police , as drug tourists are regularly caught trying to smuggle the lucrative weed back into their home country . but the last decade has seen a steady decline in the number of coffee shops , according to city officials .
eight years ago , enschede counted 17 coffee shops ; today , only 9 remain to serve the city 's population of 155,000 . the number of coffee shops has declined nationally , as well , with nearly 740 coffee shops in 2004 compared to 1180 in 1997 .
rather than a result of market realities , the decline stems from a concerted political effort to put a lid on the legal drug trade . " dutch local politicians have watched the drug tourism critically and have tightened the reins , " says christoph boenig , spokesman for the cross-border network euregio .
and michael haase , the city spokesman , says " there is a consensus amongst all political parties " concerning drug policy . since 1999 , local politicians in enschede have had the authority to shut down coffee shops , even if there were no reports of trouble or disturbances . business as usual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch labor party 's wouter bos campaigned in enschede last year but it is unclear whether the reduction in the number of coffee shops has actually resulted in a decrease in drug consumption and drug tourism ; and not all the coffee shops have closed down .
in the de molen coffee shop , it is business as usual . the de molen serves fifty customers on a normal day , and twice as many on weekends and holidays .
the staff there reports that the number of german and dutch customers is about equal . each customer is allowed to buy up to five grams of soft drugs , ranging from cannabis products like hashish or marijuana to psilocybin mushrooms , a psychoactive drug that can lead to hours of hallucinations .
the de molen , like most of its competitors , offers several different varieties of marijuana . " you can choose from many different flavors and strengths , " a saleswoman explains .
the cheapest is called " ketama , " and 0.8 grams cost five euros -lrb- ca. seven dollars -rrb- . but other varieties , such as " white widow , " have been engineered for maximum strength , containing as much as 25 percent tetrahydrocannabinol -lrb- thc -rrb- , the active ingredient in the cannabis plant .
a few decades ago , cannabis varieties rarely contained more than 10 percent thc . revising the drug policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a typical marijuana plant this increased effectiveness has caused policymakers to reconsider the definition of " soft " drugs .
some have advocated to bring dutch policy in line with international standards by completely banning all drugs , soft or hard .
but others say the current policy of tolerance is inconsistent , and that soft drugs should be legalized on the books as well as in practice . the netherlands effectively decriminalized soft drugs a few decades ago when it introduced a policy of " non-enforcement . "
although possession and cultivation of cannabis remains technically illegal in holland , law enforcement has systematically turned a blind eye , and the courts usually rule in favor of individual defendants . two years ago , gerd leers , mayor of the border city of maastricht , criticized this government policy .
leers said that by allowing possession and retail sales of cannabis but not cultivation or wholesale , the government creates problems of crime and public safety . the de molen coffee shop has survived the wave of closures - and so has another legal curiosity of the dutch penal code .

" we have all witnessed the dangers of climate change in the last few months .
we only saw winter in the calendar in germany , " he said , alluding to last year 's unusually mild winter . gabriel reminded the mps that germany needs to improve its energy efficiency by three percent per year in order to meet the eu target of reducing carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions by 20 percent below 1990-levels by 2020 . but the environment minister went further , proposing an eight-point plan that includes cutting germany 's co2 emissions by 40 percent within 13 years .
gabriel said he wanted to enlist industry 's help in pursuing this ambitious goal . " we should set ourselves the goal of making germany the most energy-efficient country in the world , " gabriel told the mps in berlin . efficiency from the bottom up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german railways : the better way to travel , says gabriel the action plan also calls on ordinary citizens to contribute to the fight against global warming , and envisions an 11-percent reduction in electricity use by 2020 .
this alone would save 40 million tons of co2 , gabriel said . the social democrat minister also encouraged germans to take the train more often as part of the effort .
gabriel told the german tabloid bild zeitung on thursday that he plans to further subsidize germany 's extensive railway system to lure travellers away from inexpensive short-haul flights with airlines such as germanwings or ryanair . " we must ensure that train services are able to compete with air travel , " gabriel said , and suggested that train tickets should qualify for a sales tax break that would allow the deutsche bahn ag to reduce ticket prices for consumers . " there is no tax on airline fuel , but the rail operator must pay the full value-added tax on the sale of long-distance tickets , " gabriel complained to the bundestag .
" that is unfair and can not remain that way . " green power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the green talk , germany plans to build more coal power plants gabriel also unveiled plans to modernize power stations across germany .
he said he wants to double the number of combined heat and power plants that trap and reuse heat generated in power production instead of releasing it . the german government under chancellor angela merkel has agreed to generate over a quarter of its power from environmentally friendly sources by 2020 , according to gabriel .
wind turbines , photovoltaic -lrb- solar -rrb- panels and biofuels are some of the most common forms of green energy , and they have become a formidable market force in germany . but gabriel criticized the government 's tacit approval of plans to build almost 30 new coal power plants on german soil , and he further attacked the conservative camp for advocating nuclear power as a " green " alternative .

the program aims to slash 270 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 . despite the country 's long tradition of progressive green policies , germany currently emits more than one billion tons of carbon dioxide per year , making it the world 's sixth-largest polluter . a german economic think-tank recently calculated that the consequences of unfettered cliamte change would cost germany more than 130 billion euros by the middle of the century .
compared to this sum , gabriel 's request for an additional three billion euros seems like a negligable investment in the future . global deadlock environmental protection groups welcomed gabriel 's plans , which they described as ambitious , but cautioned that words had to be followed by action . but gabriel warned that germany 's best efforts would be useless if the world did not follow suit .
chancellor merkel has made climate change a high priority at the june g8 summit in germany , but us president bush , leader of the world 's heaviest-polluting nation , has been reluctant to sign on to greenhouse gas regulations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 29.04.2007 eu lawmakers move to boost advanced medical therapies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stem-cell therapy is the most controversial of the new treatments eu lawmakers backed planned rules on new types of " advanced " treatment for diseases such as cancer or alzheimer 's , and shot down calls for a blanket ban on medicines developed through stem-cell research . earlier this week , the european parliament overcame considerable misgivings from some meps over ethical questions , and adopted new rules to help authorize cutting-edge medical treatments , the new eu regulation on so-called “ advanced therapies ” covers gene therapy , adult stem-cell therapy and tissue engineering .
all three treatments are based on replacing human genes , cells or tissues affected by various diseases with healthy ones . the regulation provides for a compulsory centralized procedure to authorize the marketing of innovative medical products and also for the subsequent monitoring of patients and products . ' great economic potential ' it also offers " new hope to thousands of patients and researchers , " the strasbourg-based parliament said in a statement . british mep giles chichester , a member of the parliament 's industry , research and energy committee , strongly supported the measure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vote followed an ethical debate in the eu parliament " i regularly see reports in the press of exciting new therapies and developments in this field .
but usually they are in the usa and not in europe , which is to our loss , " he said . such innovative therapies , which have huge potential for curing ailments such as parkinson 's , alzheimer 's , blindness , spinal cord injury , cancer and heart disease , " have great potential for the european economy , " the parliament said . ethical debate on stem-cell research the parliament assured it " does not interfere with decisions made by member states on whether to allow the use of specific types of cells such as embryonic stem cells in accordance with their ethical choices . " stem-cell therapy is the most controversial emerging medical treatment as it can involve cells extracted from human embryos .
the practice is illegal in some eu countries , including poland and italy . some meps had tabled ethical amendments , but these were mainly rejected .
the opposition came mostly from italian and german members and those from eastern europe , who wanted to exclude from the regulations those treatments deemed to be ethically questionable . polish mep konrad szymanski warned that the new rules " may have serious shortcomings " as " there may not be enough guarantees for human dignities . "
if europe rightly wanted to set human rights standards in the world , he continued , it could not afford to adopt a " passive position " when it comes to advanced therapies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : treatments for diseases like alzheimers and cancer are in play an amendment that proposed the exclusion of embryonic or fetal-cell tissue products from the regulation was defeated by 357 votes to 269 .
the parliament did vote to exclude any products containing non-viable human or animal cells or tissues . regulation offers guarantees to donors , patients the regulation states that the donation of cells and tissues must be voluntary and unpaid and the anonymity of donors and recipients guaranteed .
patients must also have the right to know the origin of any cells or tissues used , subject to respect for donor anonymity . three of the main political groupings in the parliament had agreed a compromise package to allow the regulation to enter into force speedily , probably around mid-2008 . it already has the approval of representatives of the 27 eu member states , despite opposition from the official parliamentary rapporteur , slovak miroslav mikolasic . current rules on the authorization of the so-called ' advanced therapies ' differ widely across the eu 's 27 member states . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversial decision allows women to donate eggs to science the decision by british fertility regulators to pay women to donate eggs to medical research raises tricky questions about the ethics of compromising women 's health in the pursuit of scientific stardom .
-lrb- 02.03.2007 -rrb- patent protest erupts over human stem cell research german laws regarding embryonic stem cells are some of the most restrictive in the world .
this month , a german court also partially reversed approval for a patent to a german scientist for his stem cell research methods .

that has led to a brain drain to other countries , where the use of discarded embryos from fertility clinics is not prohibited .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 29.04.2007 germany to become world 's most energy-efficient country großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environment minister sigmar gabriel tackles the " inconvenient truth " of pollution the german environment ministry this week unveiled a set of highly ambitious proposals that would lead germany to become the world 's most energy-efficient country in the coming years . environment minister sigmar gabriel told the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , that the time had come to act .
" we have all witnessed the dangers of climate change in the last few months .
we only saw winter in the calendar in germany , " he said , alluding to last year 's unusually mild winter . gabriel reminded the mps that germany needs to improve its energy efficiency by three percent per year in order to meet the eu target of reducing carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions by 20 percent below 1990-levels by 2020 . but the environment minister went further , proposing an eight-point plan that includes cutting germany 's co2 emissions by 40 percent within 13 years .
gabriel said he wanted to enlist industry 's help in pursuing this ambitious goal . " we should set ourselves the goal of making germany the most energy-efficient country in the world , " gabriel told the mps in berlin . efficiency from the bottom up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german railways : the better way to travel , says gabriel the action plan also calls on ordinary citizens to contribute to the fight against global warming , and envisions an 11-percent reduction in electricity use by 2020 .
this alone would save 40 million tons of co2 , gabriel said . the social democrat minister also encouraged germans to take the train more often as part of the effort .
gabriel told the german tabloid bild zeitung on thursday that he plans to further subsidize germany 's extensive railway system to lure travellers away from inexpensive short-haul flights with airlines such as germanwings or ryanair . " we must ensure that train services are able to compete with air travel , " gabriel said , and suggested that train tickets should qualify for a sales tax break that would allow the deutsche bahn ag to reduce ticket prices for consumers . " there is no tax on airline fuel , but the rail operator must pay the full value-added tax on the sale of long-distance tickets , " gabriel complained to the bundestag .
" that is unfair and can not remain that way . " green power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the green talk , germany plans to build more coal power plants gabriel also unveiled plans to modernize power stations across germany .
he said he wants to double the number of combined heat and power plants that trap and reuse heat generated in power production instead of releasing it . the german government under chancellor angela merkel has agreed to generate over a quarter of its power from environmentally friendly sources by 2020 , according to gabriel .
wind turbines , photovoltaic -lrb- solar -rrb- panels and biofuels are some of the most common forms of green energy , and they have become a formidable market force in germany . but gabriel criticized the government 's tacit approval of plans to build almost 30 new coal power plants on german soil , and he further attacked the conservative camp for advocating nuclear power as a " green " alternative .
nuclear power plants emit near-zero greenhouse gases , but nuclear waste and the possibility of a meltdown pose a different kind of environmental threat . investing in efficiency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three billion euros is a lot , but still better than constant droughts gabriel 's program would cost the german government three billion euros -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- over the next three years , according to the environment ministry 's own estimates .
the program aims to slash 270 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 . despite the country 's long tradition of progressive green policies , germany currently emits more than one billion tons of carbon dioxide per year , making it the world 's sixth-largest polluter . a german economic think-tank recently calculated that the consequences of unfettered cliamte change would cost germany more than 130 billion euros by the middle of the century .
compared to this sum , gabriel 's request for an additional three billion euros seems like a negligable investment in the future . global deadlock environmental protection groups welcomed gabriel 's plans , which they described as ambitious , but cautioned that words had to be followed by action . but gabriel warned that germany 's best efforts would be useless if the world did not follow suit .
chancellor merkel has made climate change a high priority at the june g8 summit in germany , but us president bush , leader of the world 's heaviest-polluting nation , has been reluctant to sign on to greenhouse gas regulations . " if we succeed in breaking the deadlock between the united states and some industrial countries on the one hand and developing countries on the other , the chances do n't look bad , " gabriel said .
" i am quite optimistic . " dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu urges germany to do more to combat climate change a day after a bleak report on global warming and its potentially devastating effects was published , germany and the eu are at loggerheads over whether europe 's largest economy is doing enough to lower greenhouse gases .

meanwhile title-holders bayern munich , beaten at home 2-1 by sv hamburg on saturday , have slipped out of the picture - now eight points behind stuttgart in fourth place .
veh and his stuttgart players had never considered themselves as title contenders until now , always maintaining their main ambition was perhaps to qualify for the champions league next season .
a first league title since 1992 was never a serious proposition .
but after the tight 1-0 win saturday at relegation-doomed bottom club borussia mönchengladbach , veh said : " we have the chance to reach first place .
it 's been a super season which we now want to top . "
" thankless " win puts title in sight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was all huff and puff in gladbach but vfb got the win veh was delighted by his side 's " thankless " 1-0 victory at mönchengladbach , achieved through midfielder roberto hilbert 's 53rd minute goal .
" that was a thankless win , " said veh .
" playing the league 's bottom side really puts you under pressure and you feel the expectation to get three points .
gladbach stood up very well in defence and were very hard to break down .
" but after we got the crucial goal , we really turned it on in the second half and were a pleasure to watch , " the coach purred .
stuttgart , who have only led the table once this season , also have the german cup in their sights after reaching the final against nuremberg , and an unlikely double is now very much a possibility .
veh 's young team has been under no pressure at all this season - unlike rivals bayern or schalke - and have impressed in attack where young german striker mario gomez and the brazilian cacau have scored 25 goals between them .
pressure taking toll on tightly-packed rivals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke were undone by a committed bochum team friday meanwhile their rivals are showing signs of cracking .
schalke slid to a 2-1 defeat at bochum on friday , while werder are out of sorts following a 3-0 defeat against espanyol in the uefa cup on thursday and news that striker miroslav klose has met bayern munich officials to sound out a possible transfer .
schalke coach mirko slomka said : " perhaps it was good that we lost .
in any case better than losing on the last day of the season .
we have to win our remaining three games and hope that the others also slip up . "
record title-holders bayern are now writing off a season which seems to be going from bad to worse after a 10th league defeat , at home to a hamburg side who now look to have pulled themselves out of relegation trouble .
" if i really said what i am thinking then the club would suspend me , so i am keeping my thoughts to myself , " said a clearly frustrated goalkeeper oliver kahn after the 2-1 defeat .
bayern 's peruvian claudio pizarro gave the home side the lead after 35 minutes , but hamburg 's dutch midfielder rafael van der vaart , who is being courted by bayern , cancelled out the advantage with a 71st minute goal .
hsv 's jose paolo guerrero grabbed the 76th-minute winner .
apoplectic bayern hierarchy to sell team bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness and hitzfeld coach ottmar hitzfeld was left lamenting a " lack of professional attitude " .
the bayern coach added : " the disappointment is huge .
we did n't work hard enough and we were not firm enough in attack , while in midfield we lost too many personal battles .
hamburg were more determined and that was the difference . "
bayern 's general manager uli hoeness could barely contain his wrath .
" all our energy is now going into getting a new team on the pitch next season which will have nothing in common with this team , " he said .
" this team has had its chance .
if you have a whole year to take your chance and do n't use it then you do n't deserve a second one . "
bayern were jeered off the pitch after another lacklustre display which means the team have missed out on the champions league - qualifying instead for the uefa cup - for the first time since 1996 .
" it 's clear to everyone that this team needs fresh players and we will get them , " said hoeness .
" we have enough money for new players . "
according to italy 's la gazzetta dello sport newspaper , italy striker luca toni will be one of the newcomers , but there has so far been no confirmation of the report from bayern .
relegation conundrum unraveling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's gilberto opens the floodgates for the 4-0 elsewhere , hertha berlin trounced hosts alemannia aachen 4-0 to go seventh in the league as brazilian midfielder gilberto opened the scoring with a goal after just seven minutes .
berlin striker christian gimenez grabbed a second three minutes after the break to make it 2-0 , before marko pantelic and yildiray basturk grabbed two late goals .
meanwhile , vfl wolfsburg drew 1-1 at nuremberg after polish midfielder jacek krzynowek slotted home a left-footed shot after a 40-metre run on 18 minutes for the guests .
but the home side were back level just five minutes later when defender andreas wolf headed them on level terms .
mid-table hanover had dutch midfielder arnold jan bruggink 's right-footed shot to thank for their opening goal in their 2-1 win at second-from-bottom mainz 05 .
and hanover 's bulgarian midfielder chavdar yankov extended their lead to 2-0 with a right-footed shot from a 50th minute corner before mainz 's egyptian international mohamed zidan grabbed a late consolation goal .
thomas doll 's borussia dortmund moved away from the relegation dog-fight after swiss international alexander frei gave them a 2-0 win at home to eintracht frankfurt with two well-struck free-kicks either side of half-time .
saturday 's results have cleared the relegation picture somewhat , with hanover now safe and hamburg , bochum and borussia dortmund virtually secure .
mainz , alemannia aachen , arminia bielefeld and eintracht frankfurt are the teams most in danger in joining mönchengladbach as the two other clubs to go down . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bochum trip up schalke and cut bundesliga lead to two points the question on everyone 's lips saturday morning was " have schalke blown the bundesliga at bochum again ?

but after the tight 1-0 win saturday at relegation-doomed bottom club borussia mönchengladbach , veh said : " we have the chance to reach first place .
it 's been a super season which we now want to top . "
" thankless " win puts title in sight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was all huff and puff in gladbach but vfb got the win veh was delighted by his side 's " thankless " 1-0 victory at mönchengladbach , achieved through midfielder roberto hilbert 's 53rd minute goal .
" that was a thankless win , " said veh .
" playing the league 's bottom side really puts you under pressure and you feel the expectation to get three points .
gladbach stood up very well in defence and were very hard to break down .
" but after we got the crucial goal , we really turned it on in the second half and were a pleasure to watch , " the coach purred .
stuttgart , who have only led the table once this season , also have the german cup in their sights after reaching the final against nuremberg , and an unlikely double is now very much a possibility .
veh 's young team has been under no pressure at all this season - unlike rivals bayern or schalke - and have impressed in attack where young german striker mario gomez and the brazilian cacau have scored 25 goals between them .
pressure taking toll on tightly-packed rivals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke were undone by a committed bochum team friday meanwhile their rivals are showing signs of cracking .
schalke slid to a 2-1 defeat at bochum on friday , while werder are out of sorts following a 3-0 defeat against espanyol in the uefa cup on thursday and news that striker miroslav klose has met bayern munich officials to sound out a possible transfer .
schalke coach mirko slomka said : " perhaps it was good that we lost .
in any case better than losing on the last day of the season .
we have to win our remaining three games and hope that the others also slip up . "
record title-holders bayern are now writing off a season which seems to be going from bad to worse after a 10th league defeat , at home to a hamburg side who now look to have pulled themselves out of relegation trouble .
" if i really said what i am thinking then the club would suspend me , so i am keeping my thoughts to myself , " said a clearly frustrated goalkeeper oliver kahn after the 2-1 defeat .
bayern 's peruvian claudio pizarro gave the home side the lead after 35 minutes , but hamburg 's dutch midfielder rafael van der vaart , who is being courted by bayern , cancelled out the advantage with a 71st minute goal .
hsv 's jose paolo guerrero grabbed the 76th-minute winner .
apoplectic bayern hierarchy to sell team bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness and hitzfeld coach ottmar hitzfeld was left lamenting a " lack of professional attitude " .
the bayern coach added : " the disappointment is huge .
we did n't work hard enough and we were not firm enough in attack , while in midfield we lost too many personal battles .
hamburg were more determined and that was the difference . "
bayern 's general manager uli hoeness could barely contain his wrath .
" all our energy is now going into getting a new team on the pitch next season which will have nothing in common with this team , " he said .
" this team has had its chance .
if you have a whole year to take your chance and do n't use it then you do n't deserve a second one . "
bayern were jeered off the pitch after another lacklustre display which means the team have missed out on the champions league - qualifying instead for the uefa cup - for the first time since 1996 .
" it 's clear to everyone that this team needs fresh players and we will get them , " said hoeness .
" we have enough money for new players . "
according to italy 's la gazzetta dello sport newspaper , italy striker luca toni will be one of the newcomers , but there has so far been no confirmation of the report from bayern .
relegation conundrum unraveling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's gilberto opens the floodgates for the 4-0 elsewhere , hertha berlin trounced hosts alemannia aachen 4-0 to go seventh in the league as brazilian midfielder gilberto opened the scoring with a goal after just seven minutes .
berlin striker christian gimenez grabbed a second three minutes after the break to make it 2-0 , before marko pantelic and yildiray basturk grabbed two late goals .
meanwhile , vfl wolfsburg drew 1-1 at nuremberg after polish midfielder jacek krzynowek slotted home a left-footed shot after a 40-metre run on 18 minutes for the guests .
but the home side were back level just five minutes later when defender andreas wolf headed them on level terms .
mid-table hanover had dutch midfielder arnold jan bruggink 's right-footed shot to thank for their opening goal in their 2-1 win at second-from-bottom mainz 05 .
and hanover 's bulgarian midfielder chavdar yankov extended their lead to 2-0 with a right-footed shot from a 50th minute corner before mainz 's egyptian international mohamed zidan grabbed a late consolation goal .
thomas doll 's borussia dortmund moved away from the relegation dog-fight after swiss international alexander frei gave them a 2-0 win at home to eintracht frankfurt with two well-struck free-kicks either side of half-time .
saturday 's results have cleared the relegation picture somewhat , with hanover now safe and hamburg , bochum and borussia dortmund virtually secure .
mainz , alemannia aachen , arminia bielefeld and eintracht frankfurt are the teams most in danger in joining mönchengladbach as the two other clubs to go down . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bochum trip up schalke and cut bundesliga lead to two points the question on everyone 's lips saturday morning was " have schalke blown the bundesliga at bochum again ?

" turkey is secular and will remain secular , " " neither sharia , nor coup d 'etat , democratic turkey , " they chanted .
police at the scene told reporters that the number of demonstrators was well over one million .
organizers said the rally drew people from all over turkey and abroad .
the istanbul demonstration followed a similar one in ankara on april 14 that attracted up to 1.5 million people , according to some estimates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister erdogan -lrb- r . -rrb- , with abdullah gul tensions rose after foreign minister abdullah gul , a former islamist from the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , narrowly missed becoming the country 's next president in a first round of voting in parliament on friday .
the akp dominates the 550-seat parliament , but does not have the required two-thirds majority to get gul elected in the first two rounds of voting .
the opposition boycotted the vote because of gul 's islamist past and because they were not consulted on his candiacy for the non-partisan post .
army statements cause concerns the army , which has carried out three coups in the past , issued a statement saying it was determined to protect turkey 's secular system and was ready to take action if the need arose , making it clear , according to many analysts , that gul 's candidacy was not welcome .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish army sees itself as the guardian of secularism the government responded by calling the army to order and gul on sunday ruled out withdrawing his presidential bid .
" it is out of the question for me to withdraw my candidacy in any way , " he told reporters in ankara .
the prospect of gul becoming head of state has alarmed secularists who fear the strict separation of state and religion will be eroded and islam will creep into all fields of life if he is elected .
court to decide on next round of voting the main opposition republican people 's party has asked the constitutional court to cancel friday 's presidential vote in parliament , arguing that the assembly did not have the necessary quorum to open the voting session .
if the court annuls the vote , general elections set for november 4 could be brought forward .
if does not , gul could be elected president in a third round of voting on may 9 , when an absolute majority of 276 votes would suffice , compared to the two-thirds majority of 367 required for the first two rounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a court decision may decide which president leads turkey " we all need to await the decision of the constitutional court , " gul said .
" the court will undoubtedly make the best evaluation and reach the right decision . "
gul and prime minister recep tayyip erdogan served in now-defunct islamist parties before setting up the akp in 2001 .
they say they have disawoved their islamist roots and are now committed to secular principles .
fear of an islamist agenda but secularists suspect the akp of harbouring a secret islamic agenda , citing its unsuccessful attempts to criminalise adultery , restrict alcohol sales and lift a ban on islamic headscarves in government offices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many turks fear the introduction of sharia law they fear the government will have a free hand to implement islamist policies if the party controls the presidency .
the turkish press on sunday was unanimous in calling on the government and the army to resolve their differences democratically and said early elections were the only way to prevent the country from plunging into chaos .
" turkey either giving up on secularism or suspending democracy are two doomsday scenarios impossible to choose between , " the popular daily vatan said .
the liberal daily milliyet said the army 's warning had " cast a shadow on the credibility and respectability of civilian institutions . "

german soccer authorities will investigate a " secret " meeting between bayern munich and werder bremen 's striker miroslav klose to see if any of the strict rules concerning approaches to contracted players were breached . holger hieronymus , deputy chief executive of the german football league -lrb- dfl -rrb- , told dpa sunday that both bayern and werder would be asked to make statements about the meeting .
klose has admitted he met bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld and general manager uli hoeness last tuesday in hanover , two days before werder played espanyol in the first leg of the semi-finals of the uefa cup .
under dfl regulations , clubs should not approach players from other clubs without first making an official approach in writing .
werder knew nothing about bayern 's meeting with klose until it was reported afterwards .
both bayern and klose could be fined by the dfl as a result of the meeting .
in a recent similar case in england , chelsea and defender ashley cole were fined a total of 900,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.25 million -rrb- for an unauthorised meeting which led to the player 's transfer from arsenal .
the dfl has decided to launch the investigation although there has been no official complaint from werder bremen .

" turkey is secular and will remain secular , " " neither sharia , nor coup d 'etat , democratic turkey , " they chanted .
police at the scene told reporters that the number of demonstrators was well over one million .
organizers said the rally drew people from all over turkey and abroad .
the istanbul demonstration followed a similar one in ankara on april 14 that attracted up to 1.5 million people , according to some estimates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister erdogan -lrb- r . -rrb- , with abdullah gul tensions rose after foreign minister abdullah gul , a former islamist from the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , narrowly missed becoming the country 's next president in a first round of voting in parliament on friday .
the akp dominates the 550-seat parliament , but does not have the required two-thirds majority to get gul elected in the first two rounds of voting .
the opposition boycotted the vote because of gul 's islamist past and because they were not consulted on his candiacy for the non-partisan post .
army statements cause concerns the army , which has carried out three coups in the past , issued a statement saying it was determined to protect turkey 's secular system and was ready to take action if the need arose , making it clear , according to many analysts , that gul 's candidacy was not welcome .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish army sees itself as the guardian of secularism the government responded by calling the army to order and gul on sunday ruled out withdrawing his presidential bid .
" it is out of the question for me to withdraw my candidacy in any way , " he told reporters in ankara .
the prospect of gul becoming head of state has alarmed secularists who fear the strict separation of state and religion will be eroded and islam will creep into all fields of life if he is elected .
court to decide on next round of voting the main opposition republican people 's party has asked the constitutional court to cancel friday 's presidential vote in parliament , arguing that the assembly did not have the necessary quorum to open the voting session .
if the court annuls the vote , general elections set for november 4 could be brought forward .
if does not , gul could be elected president in a third round of voting on may 9 , when an absolute majority of 276 votes would suffice , compared to the two-thirds majority of 367 required for the first two rounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a court decision may decide which president leads turkey " we all need to await the decision of the constitutional court , " gul said .
" the court will undoubtedly make the best evaluation and reach the right decision . "
gul and prime minister recep tayyip erdogan served in now-defunct islamist parties before setting up the akp in 2001 .
they say they have disawoved their islamist roots and are now committed to secular principles .
fear of an islamist agenda but secularists suspect the akp of harbouring a secret islamic agenda , citing its unsuccessful attempts to criminalise adultery , restrict alcohol sales and lift a ban on islamic headscarves in government offices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many turks fear the introduction of sharia law they fear the government will have a free hand to implement islamist policies if the party controls the presidency .
the turkish press on sunday was unanimous in calling on the government and the army to resolve their differences democratically and said early elections were the only way to prevent the country from plunging into chaos .
" turkey either giving up on secularism or suspending democracy are two doomsday scenarios impossible to choose between , " the popular daily vatan said .

meanwhile title-holders bayern munich , beaten at home 2-1 by sv hamburg on saturday , have slipped out of the picture - now eight points behind stuttgart in fourth place .
veh and his stuttgart players had never considered themselves as title contenders until now , always maintaining their main ambition was perhaps to qualify for the champions league next season .
a first league title since 1992 was never a serious proposition .
but after the tight 1-0 win saturday at relegation-doomed bottom club borussia mönchengladbach , veh said : " we have the chance to reach first place .
it 's been a super season which we now want to top . "
" thankless " win puts title in sight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was all huff and puff in gladbach but vfb got the win veh was delighted by his side 's " thankless " 1-0 victory at mönchengladbach , achieved through midfielder roberto hilbert 's 53rd minute goal .
" that was a thankless win , " said veh .
" playing the league 's bottom side really puts you under pressure and you feel the expectation to get three points .
gladbach stood up very well in defence and were very hard to break down .
" but after we got the crucial goal , we really turned it on in the second half and were a pleasure to watch , " the coach purred .
stuttgart , who have only led the table once this season , also have the german cup in their sights after reaching the final against nuremberg , and an unlikely double is now very much a possibility .
veh 's young team has been under no pressure at all this season - unlike rivals bayern or schalke - and have impressed in attack where young german striker mario gomez and the brazilian cacau have scored 25 goals between them .
pressure taking toll on tightly-packed rivals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke were undone by a committed bochum team friday meanwhile their rivals are showing signs of cracking .
schalke slid to a 2-1 defeat at bochum on friday , while werder are out of sorts following a 3-0 defeat against espanyol in the uefa cup on thursday and news that striker miroslav klose has met bayern munich officials to sound out a possible transfer .
schalke coach mirko slomka said : " perhaps it was good that we lost .
in any case better than losing on the last day of the season .
we have to win our remaining three games and hope that the others also slip up . "
record title-holders bayern are now writing off a season which seems to be going from bad to worse after a 10th league defeat , at home to a hamburg side who now look to have pulled themselves out of relegation trouble .
" if i really said what i am thinking then the club would suspend me , so i am keeping my thoughts to myself , " said a clearly frustrated goalkeeper oliver kahn after the 2-1 defeat .
bayern 's peruvian claudio pizarro gave the home side the lead after 35 minutes , but hamburg 's dutch midfielder rafael van der vaart , who is being courted by bayern , cancelled out the advantage with a 71st minute goal .
hsv 's jose paolo guerrero grabbed the 76th-minute winner .
apoplectic bayern hierarchy to sell team bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness and hitzfeld coach ottmar hitzfeld was left lamenting a " lack of professional attitude " .
the bayern coach added : " the disappointment is huge .
we did n't work hard enough and we were not firm enough in attack , while in midfield we lost too many personal battles .
hamburg were more determined and that was the difference . "
bayern 's general manager uli hoeness could barely contain his wrath .
" all our energy is now going into getting a new team on the pitch next season which will have nothing in common with this team , " he said .
" this team has had its chance .
if you have a whole year to take your chance and do n't use it then you do n't deserve a second one . "
bayern were jeered off the pitch after another lacklustre display which means the team have missed out on the champions league - qualifying instead for the uefa cup - for the first time since 1996 .
" it 's clear to everyone that this team needs fresh players and we will get them , " said hoeness .
" we have enough money for new players . "
according to italy 's la gazzetta dello sport newspaper , italy striker luca toni will be one of the newcomers , but there has so far been no confirmation of the report from bayern .

a first league title since 1992 was never a serious proposition .
but after the tight 1-0 win saturday at relegation-doomed bottom club borussia mönchengladbach , veh said : " we have the chance to reach first place .
it 's been a super season which we now want to top . "
" thankless " win puts title in sight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was all huff and puff in gladbach but vfb got the win veh was delighted by his side 's " thankless " 1-0 victory at mönchengladbach , achieved through midfielder roberto hilbert 's 53rd minute goal .
" that was a thankless win , " said veh .
" playing the league 's bottom side really puts you under pressure and you feel the expectation to get three points .
gladbach stood up very well in defence and were very hard to break down .
" but after we got the crucial goal , we really turned it on in the second half and were a pleasure to watch , " the coach purred .
stuttgart , who have only led the table once this season , also have the german cup in their sights after reaching the final against nuremberg , and an unlikely double is now very much a possibility .
veh 's young team has been under no pressure at all this season - unlike rivals bayern or schalke - and have impressed in attack where young german striker mario gomez and the brazilian cacau have scored 25 goals between them .
pressure taking toll on tightly-packed rivals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke were undone by a committed bochum team friday meanwhile their rivals are showing signs of cracking .
schalke slid to a 2-1 defeat at bochum on friday , while werder are out of sorts following a 3-0 defeat against espanyol in the uefa cup on thursday and news that striker miroslav klose has met bayern munich officials to sound out a possible transfer .
schalke coach mirko slomka said : " perhaps it was good that we lost .
in any case better than losing on the last day of the season .
we have to win our remaining three games and hope that the others also slip up . "
record title-holders bayern are now writing off a season which seems to be going from bad to worse after a 10th league defeat , at home to a hamburg side who now look to have pulled themselves out of relegation trouble .
" if i really said what i am thinking then the club would suspend me , so i am keeping my thoughts to myself , " said a clearly frustrated goalkeeper oliver kahn after the 2-1 defeat .
bayern 's peruvian claudio pizarro gave the home side the lead after 35 minutes , but hamburg 's dutch midfielder rafael van der vaart , who is being courted by bayern , cancelled out the advantage with a 71st minute goal .
hsv 's jose paolo guerrero grabbed the 76th-minute winner .
apoplectic bayern hierarchy to sell team bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness and hitzfeld coach ottmar hitzfeld was left lamenting a " lack of professional attitude " .
the bayern coach added : " the disappointment is huge .
we did n't work hard enough and we were not firm enough in attack , while in midfield we lost too many personal battles .
hamburg were more determined and that was the difference . "
bayern 's general manager uli hoeness could barely contain his wrath .
" all our energy is now going into getting a new team on the pitch next season which will have nothing in common with this team , " he said .
" this team has had its chance .
if you have a whole year to take your chance and do n't use it then you do n't deserve a second one . "
bayern were jeered off the pitch after another lacklustre display which means the team have missed out on the champions league - qualifying instead for the uefa cup - for the first time since 1996 .
" it 's clear to everyone that this team needs fresh players and we will get them , " said hoeness .
" we have enough money for new players . "
according to italy 's la gazzetta dello sport newspaper , italy striker luca toni will be one of the newcomers , but there has so far been no confirmation of the report from bayern .

berlin striker christian gimenez grabbed a second three minutes after the break to make it 2-0 , before marko pantelic and yildiray basturk grabbed two late goals .
meanwhile , vfl wolfsburg drew 1-1 at nuremberg after polish midfielder jacek krzynowek slotted home a left-footed shot after a 40-metre run on 18 minutes for the guests .
but the home side were back level just five minutes later when defender andreas wolf headed them on level terms .
mid-table hanover had dutch midfielder arnold jan bruggink 's right-footed shot to thank for their opening goal in their 2-1 win at second-from-bottom mainz 05 .

thomas doll 's borussia dortmund moved away from the relegation dog-fight after swiss international alexander frei gave them a 2-0 win at home to eintracht frankfurt with two well-struck free-kicks either side of half-time .

bayern 's peruvian claudio pizarro gave the home side the lead after 35 minutes , but hamburg 's dutch midfielder rafael van der vaart , who is being courted by bayern , cancelled out the advantage with a 71st minute goal .
hsv 's jose paolo guerrero grabbed the 76th-minute winner .
apoplectic bayern hierarchy to sell team bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness and hitzfeld coach ottmar hitzfeld was left lamenting a " lack of professional attitude " .
the bayern coach added : " the disappointment is huge .
we did n't work hard enough and we were not firm enough in attack , while in midfield we lost too many personal battles .
hamburg were more determined and that was the difference . "
bayern 's general manager uli hoeness could barely contain his wrath .
" all our energy is now going into getting a new team on the pitch next season which will have nothing in common with this team , " he said .
" this team has had its chance .
if you have a whole year to take your chance and do n't use it then you do n't deserve a second one . "
bayern were jeered off the pitch after another lacklustre display which means the team have missed out on the champions league - qualifying instead for the uefa cup - for the first time since 1996 .
" it 's clear to everyone that this team needs fresh players and we will get them , " said hoeness .
" we have enough money for new players . "
according to italy 's la gazzetta dello sport newspaper , italy striker luca toni will be one of the newcomers , but there has so far been no confirmation of the report from bayern .

" turkey is secular and will remain secular , " " neither sharia , nor coup d 'etat , democratic turkey , " they chanted .
police at the scene told reporters that the number of demonstrators was well over one million .
organizers said the rally drew people from all over turkey and abroad .
the istanbul demonstration followed a similar one in ankara on april 14 that attracted up to 1.5 million people , according to some estimates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister erdogan -lrb- r . -rrb- , with abdullah gul tensions rose after foreign minister abdullah gul , a former islamist from the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , narrowly missed becoming the country 's next president in a first round of voting in parliament on friday .
the akp dominates the 550-seat parliament , but does not have the required two-thirds majority to get gul elected in the first two rounds of voting .
the opposition boycotted the vote because of gul 's islamist past and because they were not consulted on his candiacy for the non-partisan post .
army statements cause concerns the army , which has carried out three coups in the past , issued a statement saying it was determined to protect turkey 's secular system and was ready to take action if the need arose , making it clear , according to many analysts , that gul 's candidacy was not welcome .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish army sees itself as the guardian of secularism the government responded by calling the army to order and gul on sunday ruled out withdrawing his presidential bid .
" it is out of the question for me to withdraw my candidacy in any way , " he told reporters in ankara .
the prospect of gul becoming head of state has alarmed secularists who fear the strict separation of state and religion will be eroded and islam will creep into all fields of life if he is elected .
court to decide on next round of voting the main opposition republican people 's party has asked the constitutional court to cancel friday 's presidential vote in parliament , arguing that the assembly did not have the necessary quorum to open the voting session .
if the court annuls the vote , general elections set for november 4 could be brought forward .
if does not , gul could be elected president in a third round of voting on may 9 , when an absolute majority of 276 votes would suffice , compared to the two-thirds majority of 367 required for the first two rounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a court decision may decide which president leads turkey " we all need to await the decision of the constitutional court , " gul said .
" the court will undoubtedly make the best evaluation and reach the right decision . "
gul and prime minister recep tayyip erdogan served in now-defunct islamist parties before setting up the akp in 2001 .
they say they have disawoved their islamist roots and are now committed to secular principles .
fear of an islamist agenda but secularists suspect the akp of harbouring a secret islamic agenda , citing its unsuccessful attempts to criminalise adultery , restrict alcohol sales and lift a ban on islamic headscarves in government offices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many turks fear the introduction of sharia law they fear the government will have a free hand to implement islamist policies if the party controls the presidency .
the turkish press on sunday was unanimous in calling on the government and the army to resolve their differences democratically and said early elections were the only way to prevent the country from plunging into chaos .
" turkey either giving up on secularism or suspending democracy are two doomsday scenarios impossible to choose between , " the popular daily vatan said .
the liberal daily milliyet said the army 's warning had " cast a shadow on the credibility and respectability of civilian institutions . "
" the latest developments show that the current term of parliament has reached the end of its natural life .
elections should be held at once , " it added . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu warns turkish army about meddling in presidential elections the european union warned the turkish army on saturday not to interfere in the country 's democratic process amid a dispute over the ruling party 's islamist-rooted candidate to be turkey 's next president .

" turkey is secular and will remain secular , " " neither sharia , nor coup d 'etat , democratic turkey , " they chanted .
police at the scene told reporters that the number of demonstrators was well over one million .
organizers said the rally drew people from all over turkey and abroad .
the istanbul demonstration followed a similar one in ankara on april 14 that attracted up to 1.5 million people , according to some estimates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister erdogan -lrb- r . -rrb- , with abdullah gul tensions rose after foreign minister abdullah gul , a former islamist from the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , narrowly missed becoming the country 's next president in a first round of voting in parliament on friday .
the akp dominates the 550-seat parliament , but does not have the required two-thirds majority to get gul elected in the first two rounds of voting .
the opposition boycotted the vote because of gul 's islamist past and because they were not consulted on his candiacy for the non-partisan post .
army statements cause concerns the army , which has carried out three coups in the past , issued a statement saying it was determined to protect turkey 's secular system and was ready to take action if the need arose , making it clear , according to many analysts , that gul 's candidacy was not welcome .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish army sees itself as the guardian of secularism the government responded by calling the army to order and gul on sunday ruled out withdrawing his presidential bid .
" it is out of the question for me to withdraw my candidacy in any way , " he told reporters in ankara .
the prospect of gul becoming head of state has alarmed secularists who fear the strict separation of state and religion will be eroded and islam will creep into all fields of life if he is elected .
court to decide on next round of voting the main opposition republican people 's party has asked the constitutional court to cancel friday 's presidential vote in parliament , arguing that the assembly did not have the necessary quorum to open the voting session .
if the court annuls the vote , general elections set for november 4 could be brought forward .
if does not , gul could be elected president in a third round of voting on may 9 , when an absolute majority of 276 votes would suffice , compared to the two-thirds majority of 367 required for the first two rounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a court decision may decide which president leads turkey " we all need to await the decision of the constitutional court , " gul said .
" the court will undoubtedly make the best evaluation and reach the right decision . "
gul and prime minister recep tayyip erdogan served in now-defunct islamist parties before setting up the akp in 2001 .
they say they have disawoved their islamist roots and are now committed to secular principles .
fear of an islamist agenda but secularists suspect the akp of harbouring a secret islamic agenda , citing its unsuccessful attempts to criminalise adultery , restrict alcohol sales and lift a ban on islamic headscarves in government offices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many turks fear the introduction of sharia law they fear the government will have a free hand to implement islamist policies if the party controls the presidency .
the turkish press on sunday was unanimous in calling on the government and the army to resolve their differences democratically and said early elections were the only way to prevent the country from plunging into chaos .
" turkey either giving up on secularism or suspending democracy are two doomsday scenarios impossible to choose between , " the popular daily vatan said .
the liberal daily milliyet said the army 's warning had " cast a shadow on the credibility and respectability of civilian institutions . "

now , a government crackdown is forcing many coffee shops out of business . a dense , sweet-smelling smoke fills the room in the de molen coffee shop .
here in the dutch city of enschede , the streets are littered with places like de molen , which openly sell soft drugs such as hashish or marijuana . but dozens of coffee shops have had to close shop in recent months , reflecting a growing consensus in the netherlands that the country 's notoriously liberal drug policy is currently doing more harm than good . enschede has been particularly problematic for local authorities , because of its immediate proximity to the german border .
thousands of drug tourists , mainly from germany , pour across the border each year for a taste of legal marijuana , a controlled substance in almost every country of the world - including , technically , the netherlands . " many germans come to visit enschede just because of our coffee shops - that is a fact , " says enschede city spokesman michael haase .
indeed , the nearest coffee shop is located just 300 meters beyond the border checkpoint . the limits of tolerance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a girl smokes up in a dutch coffee shop the dutch ministry of foreign affairs has published a brochure complaining that shops located along the german border " frequently " cause trouble .
and haase says local residents are sometimes harassed by glassy-eyed drug tourists . enschede 's drug trade has also become a liability for the border police , as drug tourists are regularly caught trying to smuggle the lucrative weed back into their home country . but the last decade has seen a steady decline in the number of coffee shops , according to city officials .
eight years ago , enschede counted 17 coffee shops ; today , only 9 remain to serve the city 's population of 155,000 . the number of coffee shops has declined nationally , as well , with nearly 740 coffee shops in 2004 compared to 1180 in 1997 .
rather than a result of market realities , the decline stems from a concerted political effort to put a lid on the legal drug trade . " dutch local politicians have watched the drug tourism critically and have tightened the reins , " says christoph boenig , spokesman for the cross-border network euregio .
and michael haase , the city spokesman , says " there is a consensus amongst all political parties " concerning drug policy . since 1999 , local politicians in enschede have had the authority to shut down coffee shops , even if there were no reports of trouble or disturbances . business as usual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch labor party 's wouter bos campaigned in enschede last year but it is unclear whether the reduction in the number of coffee shops has actually resulted in a decrease in drug consumption and drug tourism ; and not all the coffee shops have closed down .
in the de molen coffee shop , it is business as usual . the de molen serves fifty customers on a normal day , and twice as many on weekends and holidays .
the staff there reports that the number of german and dutch customers is about equal . each customer is allowed to buy up to five grams of soft drugs , ranging from cannabis products like hashish or marijuana to psilocybin mushrooms , a psychoactive drug that can lead to hours of hallucinations .
the de molen , like most of its competitors , offers several different varieties of marijuana . " you can choose from many different flavors and strengths , " a saleswoman explains .
the cheapest is called " ketama , " and 0.8 grams cost five euros -lrb- ca. seven dollars -rrb- . but other varieties , such as " white widow , " have been engineered for maximum strength , containing as much as 25 percent tetrahydrocannabinol -lrb- thc -rrb- , the active ingredient in the cannabis plant .
a few decades ago , cannabis varieties rarely contained more than 10 percent thc . revising the drug policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a typical marijuana plant this increased effectiveness has caused policymakers to reconsider the definition of " soft " drugs .
some have advocated to bring dutch policy in line with international standards by completely banning all drugs , soft or hard .
but others say the current policy of tolerance is inconsistent , and that soft drugs should be legalized on the books as well as in practice . the netherlands effectively decriminalized soft drugs a few decades ago when it introduced a policy of " non-enforcement . "
although possession and cultivation of cannabis remains technically illegal in holland , law enforcement has systematically turned a blind eye , and the courts usually rule in favor of individual defendants . two years ago , gerd leers , mayor of the border city of maastricht , criticized this government policy .
leers said that by allowing possession and retail sales of cannabis but not cultivation or wholesale , the government creates problems of crime and public safety . the de molen coffee shop has survived the wave of closures - and so has another legal curiosity of the dutch penal code .

german soccer authorities will investigate a " secret " meeting between bayern munich and werder bremen 's striker miroslav klose to see if any of the strict rules concerning approaches to contracted players were breached . holger hieronymus , deputy chief executive of the german football league -lrb- dfl -rrb- , told dpa sunday that both bayern and werder would be asked to make statements about the meeting .
klose has admitted he met bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld and general manager uli hoeness last tuesday in hanover , two days before werder played espanyol in the first leg of the semi-finals of the uefa cup .

meanwhile title-holders bayern munich , beaten at home 2-1 by sv hamburg on saturday , have slipped out of the picture - now eight points behind stuttgart in fourth place .
veh and his stuttgart players had never considered themselves as title contenders until now , always maintaining their main ambition was perhaps to qualify for the champions league next season .
a first league title since 1992 was never a serious proposition .
but after the tight 1-0 win saturday at relegation-doomed bottom club borussia mönchengladbach , veh said : " we have the chance to reach first place .
it 's been a super season which we now want to top . "
" thankless " win puts title in sight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was all huff and puff in gladbach but vfb got the win veh was delighted by his side 's " thankless " 1-0 victory at mönchengladbach , achieved through midfielder roberto hilbert 's 53rd minute goal .
" that was a thankless win , " said veh .
" playing the league 's bottom side really puts you under pressure and you feel the expectation to get three points .
gladbach stood up very well in defence and were very hard to break down .
" but after we got the crucial goal , we really turned it on in the second half and were a pleasure to watch , " the coach purred .
stuttgart , who have only led the table once this season , also have the german cup in their sights after reaching the final against nuremberg , and an unlikely double is now very much a possibility .
veh 's young team has been under no pressure at all this season - unlike rivals bayern or schalke - and have impressed in attack where young german striker mario gomez and the brazilian cacau have scored 25 goals between them .
pressure taking toll on tightly-packed rivals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke were undone by a committed bochum team friday meanwhile their rivals are showing signs of cracking .
schalke slid to a 2-1 defeat at bochum on friday , while werder are out of sorts following a 3-0 defeat against espanyol in the uefa cup on thursday and news that striker miroslav klose has met bayern munich officials to sound out a possible transfer .
schalke coach mirko slomka said : " perhaps it was good that we lost .
in any case better than losing on the last day of the season .
we have to win our remaining three games and hope that the others also slip up . "
record title-holders bayern are now writing off a season which seems to be going from bad to worse after a 10th league defeat , at home to a hamburg side who now look to have pulled themselves out of relegation trouble .
" if i really said what i am thinking then the club would suspend me , so i am keeping my thoughts to myself , " said a clearly frustrated goalkeeper oliver kahn after the 2-1 defeat .
bayern 's peruvian claudio pizarro gave the home side the lead after 35 minutes , but hamburg 's dutch midfielder rafael van der vaart , who is being courted by bayern , cancelled out the advantage with a 71st minute goal .
hsv 's jose paolo guerrero grabbed the 76th-minute winner .
apoplectic bayern hierarchy to sell team bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness and hitzfeld coach ottmar hitzfeld was left lamenting a " lack of professional attitude " .
the bayern coach added : " the disappointment is huge .
we did n't work hard enough and we were not firm enough in attack , while in midfield we lost too many personal battles .
hamburg were more determined and that was the difference . "
bayern 's general manager uli hoeness could barely contain his wrath .
" all our energy is now going into getting a new team on the pitch next season which will have nothing in common with this team , " he said .
" this team has had its chance .
if you have a whole year to take your chance and do n't use it then you do n't deserve a second one . "
bayern were jeered off the pitch after another lacklustre display which means the team have missed out on the champions league - qualifying instead for the uefa cup - for the first time since 1996 .
" it 's clear to everyone that this team needs fresh players and we will get them , " said hoeness .
" we have enough money for new players . "
according to italy 's la gazzetta dello sport newspaper , italy striker luca toni will be one of the newcomers , but there has so far been no confirmation of the report from bayern .
relegation conundrum unraveling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's gilberto opens the floodgates for the 4-0 elsewhere , hertha berlin trounced hosts alemannia aachen 4-0 to go seventh in the league as brazilian midfielder gilberto opened the scoring with a goal after just seven minutes .
berlin striker christian gimenez grabbed a second three minutes after the break to make it 2-0 , before marko pantelic and yildiray basturk grabbed two late goals .
meanwhile , vfl wolfsburg drew 1-1 at nuremberg after polish midfielder jacek krzynowek slotted home a left-footed shot after a 40-metre run on 18 minutes for the guests .
but the home side were back level just five minutes later when defender andreas wolf headed them on level terms .
mid-table hanover had dutch midfielder arnold jan bruggink 's right-footed shot to thank for their opening goal in their 2-1 win at second-from-bottom mainz 05 .
and hanover 's bulgarian midfielder chavdar yankov extended their lead to 2-0 with a right-footed shot from a 50th minute corner before mainz 's egyptian international mohamed zidan grabbed a late consolation goal .
thomas doll 's borussia dortmund moved away from the relegation dog-fight after swiss international alexander frei gave them a 2-0 win at home to eintracht frankfurt with two well-struck free-kicks either side of half-time .
saturday 's results have cleared the relegation picture somewhat , with hanover now safe and hamburg , bochum and borussia dortmund virtually secure .
mainz , alemannia aachen , arminia bielefeld and eintracht frankfurt are the teams most in danger in joining mönchengladbach as the two other clubs to go down . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bochum trip up schalke and cut bundesliga lead to two points the question on everyone 's lips saturday morning was " have schalke blown the bundesliga at bochum again ?

all three treatments are based on replacing human genes , cells or tissues affected by various diseases with healthy ones . the regulation provides for a compulsory centralized procedure to authorize the marketing of innovative medical products and also for the subsequent monitoring of patients and products . ' great economic potential ' it also offers " new hope to thousands of patients and researchers , " the strasbourg-based parliament said in a statement . british mep giles chichester , a member of the parliament 's industry , research and energy committee , strongly supported the measure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vote followed an ethical debate in the eu parliament " i regularly see reports in the press of exciting new therapies and developments in this field .
but usually they are in the usa and not in europe , which is to our loss , " he said . such innovative therapies , which have huge potential for curing ailments such as parkinson 's , alzheimer 's , blindness , spinal cord injury , cancer and heart disease , " have great potential for the european economy , " the parliament said . ethical debate on stem-cell research the parliament assured it " does not interfere with decisions made by member states on whether to allow the use of specific types of cells such as embryonic stem cells in accordance with their ethical choices . " stem-cell therapy is the most controversial emerging medical treatment as it can involve cells extracted from human embryos .
the practice is illegal in some eu countries , including poland and italy . some meps had tabled ethical amendments , but these were mainly rejected .
the opposition came mostly from italian and german members and those from eastern europe , who wanted to exclude from the regulations those treatments deemed to be ethically questionable . polish mep konrad szymanski warned that the new rules " may have serious shortcomings " as " there may not be enough guarantees for human dignities . "
if europe rightly wanted to set human rights standards in the world , he continued , it could not afford to adopt a " passive position " when it comes to advanced therapies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : treatments for diseases like alzheimers and cancer are in play an amendment that proposed the exclusion of embryonic or fetal-cell tissue products from the regulation was defeated by 357 votes to 269 .
the parliament did vote to exclude any products containing non-viable human or animal cells or tissues . regulation offers guarantees to donors , patients the regulation states that the donation of cells and tissues must be voluntary and unpaid and the anonymity of donors and recipients guaranteed .
patients must also have the right to know the origin of any cells or tissues used , subject to respect for donor anonymity . three of the main political groupings in the parliament had agreed a compromise package to allow the regulation to enter into force speedily , probably around mid-2008 . it already has the approval of representatives of the 27 eu member states , despite opposition from the official parliamentary rapporteur , slovak miroslav mikolasic . current rules on the authorization of the so-called ' advanced therapies ' differ widely across the eu 's 27 member states . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversial decision allows women to donate eggs to science the decision by british fertility regulators to pay women to donate eggs to medical research raises tricky questions about the ethics of compromising women 's health in the pursuit of scientific stardom .

" we have all witnessed the dangers of climate change in the last few months .
we only saw winter in the calendar in germany , " he said , alluding to last year 's unusually mild winter . gabriel reminded the mps that germany needs to improve its energy efficiency by three percent per year in order to meet the eu target of reducing carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions by 20 percent below 1990-levels by 2020 . but the environment minister went further , proposing an eight-point plan that includes cutting germany 's co2 emissions by 40 percent within 13 years .
gabriel said he wanted to enlist industry 's help in pursuing this ambitious goal . " we should set ourselves the goal of making germany the most energy-efficient country in the world , " gabriel told the mps in berlin . efficiency from the bottom up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german railways : the better way to travel , says gabriel the action plan also calls on ordinary citizens to contribute to the fight against global warming , and envisions an 11-percent reduction in electricity use by 2020 .
this alone would save 40 million tons of co2 , gabriel said . the social democrat minister also encouraged germans to take the train more often as part of the effort .
gabriel told the german tabloid bild zeitung on thursday that he plans to further subsidize germany 's extensive railway system to lure travellers away from inexpensive short-haul flights with airlines such as germanwings or ryanair . " we must ensure that train services are able to compete with air travel , " gabriel said , and suggested that train tickets should qualify for a sales tax break that would allow the deutsche bahn ag to reduce ticket prices for consumers . " there is no tax on airline fuel , but the rail operator must pay the full value-added tax on the sale of long-distance tickets , " gabriel complained to the bundestag .
" that is unfair and can not remain that way . " green power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the green talk , germany plans to build more coal power plants gabriel also unveiled plans to modernize power stations across germany .
he said he wants to double the number of combined heat and power plants that trap and reuse heat generated in power production instead of releasing it . the german government under chancellor angela merkel has agreed to generate over a quarter of its power from environmentally friendly sources by 2020 , according to gabriel .
wind turbines , photovoltaic -lrb- solar -rrb- panels and biofuels are some of the most common forms of green energy , and they have become a formidable market force in germany . but gabriel criticized the government 's tacit approval of plans to build almost 30 new coal power plants on german soil , and he further attacked the conservative camp for advocating nuclear power as a " green " alternative .
nuclear power plants emit near-zero greenhouse gases , but nuclear waste and the possibility of a meltdown pose a different kind of environmental threat . investing in efficiency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three billion euros is a lot , but still better than constant droughts gabriel 's program would cost the german government three billion euros -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- over the next three years , according to the environment ministry 's own estimates .
the program aims to slash 270 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 . despite the country 's long tradition of progressive green policies , germany currently emits more than one billion tons of carbon dioxide per year , making it the world 's sixth-largest polluter . a german economic think-tank recently calculated that the consequences of unfettered cliamte change would cost germany more than 130 billion euros by the middle of the century .
compared to this sum , gabriel 's request for an additional three billion euros seems like a negligable investment in the future . global deadlock environmental protection groups welcomed gabriel 's plans , which they described as ambitious , but cautioned that words had to be followed by action . but gabriel warned that germany 's best efforts would be useless if the world did not follow suit .
chancellor merkel has made climate change a high priority at the june g8 summit in germany , but us president bush , leader of the world 's heaviest-polluting nation , has been reluctant to sign on to greenhouse gas regulations . " if we succeed in breaking the deadlock between the united states and some industrial countries on the one hand and developing countries on the other , the chances do n't look bad , " gabriel said .

all three treatments are based on replacing human genes , cells or tissues affected by various diseases with healthy ones . the regulation provides for a compulsory centralized procedure to authorize the marketing of innovative medical products and also for the subsequent monitoring of patients and products . ' great economic potential ' it also offers " new hope to thousands of patients and researchers , " the strasbourg-based parliament said in a statement . british mep giles chichester , a member of the parliament 's industry , research and energy committee , strongly supported the measure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vote followed an ethical debate in the eu parliament " i regularly see reports in the press of exciting new therapies and developments in this field .
but usually they are in the usa and not in europe , which is to our loss , " he said . such innovative therapies , which have huge potential for curing ailments such as parkinson 's , alzheimer 's , blindness , spinal cord injury , cancer and heart disease , " have great potential for the european economy , " the parliament said . ethical debate on stem-cell research the parliament assured it " does not interfere with decisions made by member states on whether to allow the use of specific types of cells such as embryonic stem cells in accordance with their ethical choices . " stem-cell therapy is the most controversial emerging medical treatment as it can involve cells extracted from human embryos .
the practice is illegal in some eu countries , including poland and italy . some meps had tabled ethical amendments , but these were mainly rejected .
the opposition came mostly from italian and german members and those from eastern europe , who wanted to exclude from the regulations those treatments deemed to be ethically questionable . polish mep konrad szymanski warned that the new rules " may have serious shortcomings " as " there may not be enough guarantees for human dignities . "
if europe rightly wanted to set human rights standards in the world , he continued , it could not afford to adopt a " passive position " when it comes to advanced therapies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : treatments for diseases like alzheimers and cancer are in play an amendment that proposed the exclusion of embryonic or fetal-cell tissue products from the regulation was defeated by 357 votes to 269 .
the parliament did vote to exclude any products containing non-viable human or animal cells or tissues . regulation offers guarantees to donors , patients the regulation states that the donation of cells and tissues must be voluntary and unpaid and the anonymity of donors and recipients guaranteed .
patients must also have the right to know the origin of any cells or tissues used , subject to respect for donor anonymity . three of the main political groupings in the parliament had agreed a compromise package to allow the regulation to enter into force speedily , probably around mid-2008 . it already has the approval of representatives of the 27 eu member states , despite opposition from the official parliamentary rapporteur , slovak miroslav mikolasic . current rules on the authorization of the so-called ' advanced therapies ' differ widely across the eu 's 27 member states . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversial decision allows women to donate eggs to science the decision by british fertility regulators to pay women to donate eggs to medical research raises tricky questions about the ethics of compromising women 's health in the pursuit of scientific stardom .

now , a government crackdown is forcing many coffee shops out of business . a dense , sweet-smelling smoke fills the room in the de molen coffee shop .
here in the dutch city of enschede , the streets are littered with places like de molen , which openly sell soft drugs such as hashish or marijuana . but dozens of coffee shops have had to close shop in recent months , reflecting a growing consensus in the netherlands that the country 's notoriously liberal drug policy is currently doing more harm than good . enschede has been particularly problematic for local authorities , because of its immediate proximity to the german border .
thousands of drug tourists , mainly from germany , pour across the border each year for a taste of legal marijuana , a controlled substance in almost every country of the world - including , technically , the netherlands . " many germans come to visit enschede just because of our coffee shops - that is a fact , " says enschede city spokesman michael haase .
indeed , the nearest coffee shop is located just 300 meters beyond the border checkpoint . the limits of tolerance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a girl smokes up in a dutch coffee shop the dutch ministry of foreign affairs has published a brochure complaining that shops located along the german border " frequently " cause trouble .
and haase says local residents are sometimes harassed by glassy-eyed drug tourists . enschede 's drug trade has also become a liability for the border police , as drug tourists are regularly caught trying to smuggle the lucrative weed back into their home country . but the last decade has seen a steady decline in the number of coffee shops , according to city officials .
eight years ago , enschede counted 17 coffee shops ; today , only 9 remain to serve the city 's population of 155,000 . the number of coffee shops has declined nationally , as well , with nearly 740 coffee shops in 2004 compared to 1180 in 1997 .
rather than a result of market realities , the decline stems from a concerted political effort to put a lid on the legal drug trade . " dutch local politicians have watched the drug tourism critically and have tightened the reins , " says christoph boenig , spokesman for the cross-border network euregio .
and michael haase , the city spokesman , says " there is a consensus amongst all political parties " concerning drug policy . since 1999 , local politicians in enschede have had the authority to shut down coffee shops , even if there were no reports of trouble or disturbances . business as usual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch labor party 's wouter bos campaigned in enschede last year but it is unclear whether the reduction in the number of coffee shops has actually resulted in a decrease in drug consumption and drug tourism ; and not all the coffee shops have closed down .
in the de molen coffee shop , it is business as usual . the de molen serves fifty customers on a normal day , and twice as many on weekends and holidays .
the staff there reports that the number of german and dutch customers is about equal . each customer is allowed to buy up to five grams of soft drugs , ranging from cannabis products like hashish or marijuana to psilocybin mushrooms , a psychoactive drug that can lead to hours of hallucinations .
the de molen , like most of its competitors , offers several different varieties of marijuana . " you can choose from many different flavors and strengths , " a saleswoman explains .
the cheapest is called " ketama , " and 0.8 grams cost five euros -lrb- ca. seven dollars -rrb- . but other varieties , such as " white widow , " have been engineered for maximum strength , containing as much as 25 percent tetrahydrocannabinol -lrb- thc -rrb- , the active ingredient in the cannabis plant .
a few decades ago , cannabis varieties rarely contained more than 10 percent thc . revising the drug policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a typical marijuana plant this increased effectiveness has caused policymakers to reconsider the definition of " soft " drugs .
some have advocated to bring dutch policy in line with international standards by completely banning all drugs , soft or hard .
but others say the current policy of tolerance is inconsistent , and that soft drugs should be legalized on the books as well as in practice . the netherlands effectively decriminalized soft drugs a few decades ago when it introduced a policy of " non-enforcement . "
although possession and cultivation of cannabis remains technically illegal in holland , law enforcement has systematically turned a blind eye , and the courts usually rule in favor of individual defendants . two years ago , gerd leers , mayor of the border city of maastricht , criticized this government policy .
leers said that by allowing possession and retail sales of cannabis but not cultivation or wholesale , the government creates problems of crime and public safety . the de molen coffee shop has survived the wave of closures - and so has another legal curiosity of the dutch penal code .
shops are barred from transporting drugs to their stores .

meanwhile title-holders bayern munich , beaten at home 2-1 by sv hamburg on saturday , have slipped out of the picture - now eight points behind stuttgart in fourth place .
veh and his stuttgart players had never considered themselves as title contenders until now , always maintaining their main ambition was perhaps to qualify for the champions league next season .
a first league title since 1992 was never a serious proposition .
but after the tight 1-0 win saturday at relegation-doomed bottom club borussia mönchengladbach , veh said : " we have the chance to reach first place .
it 's been a super season which we now want to top . "
" thankless " win puts title in sight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was all huff and puff in gladbach but vfb got the win veh was delighted by his side 's " thankless " 1-0 victory at mönchengladbach , achieved through midfielder roberto hilbert 's 53rd minute goal .
" that was a thankless win , " said veh .
" playing the league 's bottom side really puts you under pressure and you feel the expectation to get three points .
gladbach stood up very well in defence and were very hard to break down .
" but after we got the crucial goal , we really turned it on in the second half and were a pleasure to watch , " the coach purred .
stuttgart , who have only led the table once this season , also have the german cup in their sights after reaching the final against nuremberg , and an unlikely double is now very much a possibility .
veh 's young team has been under no pressure at all this season - unlike rivals bayern or schalke - and have impressed in attack where young german striker mario gomez and the brazilian cacau have scored 25 goals between them .
pressure taking toll on tightly-packed rivals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke were undone by a committed bochum team friday meanwhile their rivals are showing signs of cracking .
schalke slid to a 2-1 defeat at bochum on friday , while werder are out of sorts following a 3-0 defeat against espanyol in the uefa cup on thursday and news that striker miroslav klose has met bayern munich officials to sound out a possible transfer .
schalke coach mirko slomka said : " perhaps it was good that we lost .
in any case better than losing on the last day of the season .
we have to win our remaining three games and hope that the others also slip up . "
record title-holders bayern are now writing off a season which seems to be going from bad to worse after a 10th league defeat , at home to a hamburg side who now look to have pulled themselves out of relegation trouble .
" if i really said what i am thinking then the club would suspend me , so i am keeping my thoughts to myself , " said a clearly frustrated goalkeeper oliver kahn after the 2-1 defeat .
bayern 's peruvian claudio pizarro gave the home side the lead after 35 minutes , but hamburg 's dutch midfielder rafael van der vaart , who is being courted by bayern , cancelled out the advantage with a 71st minute goal .
hsv 's jose paolo guerrero grabbed the 76th-minute winner .

the bayern coach added : " the disappointment is huge .
we did n't work hard enough and we were not firm enough in attack , while in midfield we lost too many personal battles .
hamburg were more determined and that was the difference . "
bayern 's general manager uli hoeness could barely contain his wrath .
" all our energy is now going into getting a new team on the pitch next season which will have nothing in common with this team , " he said .
" this team has had its chance .
if you have a whole year to take your chance and do n't use it then you do n't deserve a second one . "
bayern were jeered off the pitch after another lacklustre display which means the team have missed out on the champions league - qualifying instead for the uefa cup - for the first time since 1996 .
" it 's clear to everyone that this team needs fresh players and we will get them , " said hoeness .
" we have enough money for new players . "
according to italy 's la gazzetta dello sport newspaper , italy striker luca toni will be one of the newcomers , but there has so far been no confirmation of the report from bayern .

" we have all witnessed the dangers of climate change in the last few months .
we only saw winter in the calendar in germany , " he said , alluding to last year 's unusually mild winter . gabriel reminded the mps that germany needs to improve its energy efficiency by three percent per year in order to meet the eu target of reducing carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions by 20 percent below 1990-levels by 2020 . but the environment minister went further , proposing an eight-point plan that includes cutting germany 's co2 emissions by 40 percent within 13 years .
gabriel said he wanted to enlist industry 's help in pursuing this ambitious goal . " we should set ourselves the goal of making germany the most energy-efficient country in the world , " gabriel told the mps in berlin . efficiency from the bottom up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german railways : the better way to travel , says gabriel the action plan also calls on ordinary citizens to contribute to the fight against global warming , and envisions an 11-percent reduction in electricity use by 2020 .
this alone would save 40 million tons of co2 , gabriel said . the social democrat minister also encouraged germans to take the train more often as part of the effort .
gabriel told the german tabloid bild zeitung on thursday that he plans to further subsidize germany 's extensive railway system to lure travellers away from inexpensive short-haul flights with airlines such as germanwings or ryanair . " we must ensure that train services are able to compete with air travel , " gabriel said , and suggested that train tickets should qualify for a sales tax break that would allow the deutsche bahn ag to reduce ticket prices for consumers . " there is no tax on airline fuel , but the rail operator must pay the full value-added tax on the sale of long-distance tickets , " gabriel complained to the bundestag .
" that is unfair and can not remain that way . " green power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the green talk , germany plans to build more coal power plants gabriel also unveiled plans to modernize power stations across germany .
he said he wants to double the number of combined heat and power plants that trap and reuse heat generated in power production instead of releasing it . the german government under chancellor angela merkel has agreed to generate over a quarter of its power from environmentally friendly sources by 2020 , according to gabriel .
wind turbines , photovoltaic -lrb- solar -rrb- panels and biofuels are some of the most common forms of green energy , and they have become a formidable market force in germany . but gabriel criticized the government 's tacit approval of plans to build almost 30 new coal power plants on german soil , and he further attacked the conservative camp for advocating nuclear power as a " green " alternative .
nuclear power plants emit near-zero greenhouse gases , but nuclear waste and the possibility of a meltdown pose a different kind of environmental threat . investing in efficiency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three billion euros is a lot , but still better than constant droughts gabriel 's program would cost the german government three billion euros -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- over the next three years , according to the environment ministry 's own estimates .
the program aims to slash 270 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 . despite the country 's long tradition of progressive green policies , germany currently emits more than one billion tons of carbon dioxide per year , making it the world 's sixth-largest polluter . a german economic think-tank recently calculated that the consequences of unfettered cliamte change would cost germany more than 130 billion euros by the middle of the century .
compared to this sum , gabriel 's request for an additional three billion euros seems like a negligable investment in the future . global deadlock environmental protection groups welcomed gabriel 's plans , which they described as ambitious , but cautioned that words had to be followed by action . but gabriel warned that germany 's best efforts would be useless if the world did not follow suit .
chancellor merkel has made climate change a high priority at the june g8 summit in germany , but us president bush , leader of the world 's heaviest-polluting nation , has been reluctant to sign on to greenhouse gas regulations . " if we succeed in breaking the deadlock between the united states and some industrial countries on the one hand and developing countries on the other , the chances do n't look bad , " gabriel said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 29.04.2007 dutch coffee shops close as authorities weed out drug tourists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joint effort : dutch authorities have come together to reduce smokers ' opportunities each year , thousands of german drug tourists cross the border into the dutch town of enschede , where soft drugs such as marijuana are sold openly .
now , a government crackdown is forcing many coffee shops out of business . a dense , sweet-smelling smoke fills the room in the de molen coffee shop .
here in the dutch city of enschede , the streets are littered with places like de molen , which openly sell soft drugs such as hashish or marijuana . but dozens of coffee shops have had to close shop in recent months , reflecting a growing consensus in the netherlands that the country 's notoriously liberal drug policy is currently doing more harm than good . enschede has been particularly problematic for local authorities , because of its immediate proximity to the german border .
thousands of drug tourists , mainly from germany , pour across the border each year for a taste of legal marijuana , a controlled substance in almost every country of the world - including , technically , the netherlands . " many germans come to visit enschede just because of our coffee shops - that is a fact , " says enschede city spokesman michael haase .
indeed , the nearest coffee shop is located just 300 meters beyond the border checkpoint . the limits of tolerance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a girl smokes up in a dutch coffee shop the dutch ministry of foreign affairs has published a brochure complaining that shops located along the german border " frequently " cause trouble .
and haase says local residents are sometimes harassed by glassy-eyed drug tourists . enschede 's drug trade has also become a liability for the border police , as drug tourists are regularly caught trying to smuggle the lucrative weed back into their home country . but the last decade has seen a steady decline in the number of coffee shops , according to city officials .
eight years ago , enschede counted 17 coffee shops ; today , only 9 remain to serve the city 's population of 155,000 . the number of coffee shops has declined nationally , as well , with nearly 740 coffee shops in 2004 compared to 1180 in 1997 .
rather than a result of market realities , the decline stems from a concerted political effort to put a lid on the legal drug trade . " dutch local politicians have watched the drug tourism critically and have tightened the reins , " says christoph boenig , spokesman for the cross-border network euregio .
and michael haase , the city spokesman , says " there is a consensus amongst all political parties " concerning drug policy . since 1999 , local politicians in enschede have had the authority to shut down coffee shops , even if there were no reports of trouble or disturbances . business as usual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch labor party 's wouter bos campaigned in enschede last year but it is unclear whether the reduction in the number of coffee shops has actually resulted in a decrease in drug consumption and drug tourism ; and not all the coffee shops have closed down .

here in the dutch city of enschede , the streets are littered with places like de molen , which openly sell soft drugs such as hashish or marijuana . but dozens of coffee shops have had to close shop in recent months , reflecting a growing consensus in the netherlands that the country 's notoriously liberal drug policy is currently doing more harm than good . enschede has been particularly problematic for local authorities , because of its immediate proximity to the german border .
thousands of drug tourists , mainly from germany , pour across the border each year for a taste of legal marijuana , a controlled substance in almost every country of the world - including , technically , the netherlands .

the de molen , like most of its competitors , offers several different varieties of marijuana . " you can choose from many different flavors and strengths , " a saleswoman explains .
the cheapest is called " ketama , " and 0.8 grams cost five euros -lrb- ca. seven dollars -rrb- . but other varieties , such as " white widow , " have been engineered for maximum strength , containing as much as 25 percent tetrahydrocannabinol -lrb- thc -rrb- , the active ingredient in the cannabis plant .
a few decades ago , cannabis varieties rarely contained more than 10 percent thc . revising the drug policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a typical marijuana plant this increased effectiveness has caused policymakers to reconsider the definition of " soft " drugs .
some have advocated to bring dutch policy in line with international standards by completely banning all drugs , soft or hard .
but others say the current policy of tolerance is inconsistent , and that soft drugs should be legalized on the books as well as in practice . the netherlands effectively decriminalized soft drugs a few decades ago when it introduced a policy of " non-enforcement . "
although possession and cultivation of cannabis remains technically illegal in holland , law enforcement has systematically turned a blind eye , and the courts usually rule in favor of individual defendants . two years ago , gerd leers , mayor of the border city of maastricht , criticized this government policy .
leers said that by allowing possession and retail sales of cannabis but not cultivation or wholesale , the government creates problems of crime and public safety . the de molen coffee shop has survived the wave of closures - and so has another legal curiosity of the dutch penal code .
shops are barred from transporting drugs to their stores .
" how the stuff gets there remains a mystery , " a customs official says . dw staff -lrb- ab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch benefit from relaxed rules on cannabis the netherlands are reaping rewards from their liberal attitude toward marijuana and hashish consumption in the country 's coffee shops .

but usually they are in the usa and not in europe , which is to our loss , " he said . such innovative therapies , which have huge potential for curing ailments such as parkinson 's , alzheimer 's , blindness , spinal cord injury , cancer and heart disease , " have great potential for the european economy , " the parliament said . ethical debate on stem-cell research the parliament assured it " does not interfere with decisions made by member states on whether to allow the use of specific types of cells such as embryonic stem cells in accordance with their ethical choices . " stem-cell therapy is the most controversial emerging medical treatment as it can involve cells extracted from human embryos .
the practice is illegal in some eu countries , including poland and italy . some meps had tabled ethical amendments , but these were mainly rejected .
the opposition came mostly from italian and german members and those from eastern europe , who wanted to exclude from the regulations those treatments deemed to be ethically questionable . polish mep konrad szymanski warned that the new rules " may have serious shortcomings " as " there may not be enough guarantees for human dignities . "
if europe rightly wanted to set human rights standards in the world , he continued , it could not afford to adopt a " passive position " when it comes to advanced therapies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : treatments for diseases like alzheimers and cancer are in play an amendment that proposed the exclusion of embryonic or fetal-cell tissue products from the regulation was defeated by 357 votes to 269 .
the parliament did vote to exclude any products containing non-viable human or animal cells or tissues . regulation offers guarantees to donors , patients the regulation states that the donation of cells and tissues must be voluntary and unpaid and the anonymity of donors and recipients guaranteed .
patients must also have the right to know the origin of any cells or tissues used , subject to respect for donor anonymity . three of the main political groupings in the parliament had agreed a compromise package to allow the regulation to enter into force speedily , probably around mid-2008 . it already has the approval of representatives of the 27 eu member states , despite opposition from the official parliamentary rapporteur , slovak miroslav mikolasic . current rules on the authorization of the so-called ' advanced therapies ' differ widely across the eu 's 27 member states . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversial decision allows women to donate eggs to science the decision by british fertility regulators to pay women to donate eggs to medical research raises tricky questions about the ethics of compromising women 's health in the pursuit of scientific stardom .

meanwhile title-holders bayern munich , beaten at home 2-1 by sv hamburg on saturday , have slipped out of the picture - now eight points behind stuttgart in fourth place .

meanwhile title-holders bayern munich , beaten at home 2-1 by sv hamburg on saturday , have slipped out of the picture - now eight points behind stuttgart in fourth place .
veh and his stuttgart players had never considered themselves as title contenders until now , always maintaining their main ambition was perhaps to qualify for the champions league next season .
a first league title since 1992 was never a serious proposition .
but after the tight 1-0 win saturday at relegation-doomed bottom club borussia mönchengladbach , veh said : " we have the chance to reach first place .
it 's been a super season which we now want to top . "
" thankless " win puts title in sight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was all huff and puff in gladbach but vfb got the win veh was delighted by his side 's " thankless " 1-0 victory at mönchengladbach , achieved through midfielder roberto hilbert 's 53rd minute goal .
" that was a thankless win , " said veh .
" playing the league 's bottom side really puts you under pressure and you feel the expectation to get three points .
gladbach stood up very well in defence and were very hard to break down .
" but after we got the crucial goal , we really turned it on in the second half and were a pleasure to watch , " the coach purred .
stuttgart , who have only led the table once this season , also have the german cup in their sights after reaching the final against nuremberg , and an unlikely double is now very much a possibility .
veh 's young team has been under no pressure at all this season - unlike rivals bayern or schalke - and have impressed in attack where young german striker mario gomez and the brazilian cacau have scored 25 goals between them .
pressure taking toll on tightly-packed rivals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke were undone by a committed bochum team friday meanwhile their rivals are showing signs of cracking .
schalke slid to a 2-1 defeat at bochum on friday , while werder are out of sorts following a 3-0 defeat against espanyol in the uefa cup on thursday and news that striker miroslav klose has met bayern munich officials to sound out a possible transfer .
schalke coach mirko slomka said : " perhaps it was good that we lost .
in any case better than losing on the last day of the season .
we have to win our remaining three games and hope that the others also slip up . "
record title-holders bayern are now writing off a season which seems to be going from bad to worse after a 10th league defeat , at home to a hamburg side who now look to have pulled themselves out of relegation trouble .
" if i really said what i am thinking then the club would suspend me , so i am keeping my thoughts to myself , " said a clearly frustrated goalkeeper oliver kahn after the 2-1 defeat .
bayern 's peruvian claudio pizarro gave the home side the lead after 35 minutes , but hamburg 's dutch midfielder rafael van der vaart , who is being courted by bayern , cancelled out the advantage with a 71st minute goal .
hsv 's jose paolo guerrero grabbed the 76th-minute winner .
apoplectic bayern hierarchy to sell team bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness and hitzfeld coach ottmar hitzfeld was left lamenting a " lack of professional attitude " .
the bayern coach added : " the disappointment is huge .
we did n't work hard enough and we were not firm enough in attack , while in midfield we lost too many personal battles .
hamburg were more determined and that was the difference . "
bayern 's general manager uli hoeness could barely contain his wrath .
" all our energy is now going into getting a new team on the pitch next season which will have nothing in common with this team , " he said .
" this team has had its chance .
if you have a whole year to take your chance and do n't use it then you do n't deserve a second one . "
bayern were jeered off the pitch after another lacklustre display which means the team have missed out on the champions league - qualifying instead for the uefa cup - for the first time since 1996 .
" it 's clear to everyone that this team needs fresh players and we will get them , " said hoeness .
" we have enough money for new players . "
according to italy 's la gazzetta dello sport newspaper , italy striker luca toni will be one of the newcomers , but there has so far been no confirmation of the report from bayern .
relegation conundrum unraveling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's gilberto opens the floodgates for the 4-0 elsewhere , hertha berlin trounced hosts alemannia aachen 4-0 to go seventh in the league as brazilian midfielder gilberto opened the scoring with a goal after just seven minutes .
berlin striker christian gimenez grabbed a second three minutes after the break to make it 2-0 , before marko pantelic and yildiray basturk grabbed two late goals .
meanwhile , vfl wolfsburg drew 1-1 at nuremberg after polish midfielder jacek krzynowek slotted home a left-footed shot after a 40-metre run on 18 minutes for the guests .
but the home side were back level just five minutes later when defender andreas wolf headed them on level terms .
mid-table hanover had dutch midfielder arnold jan bruggink 's right-footed shot to thank for their opening goal in their 2-1 win at second-from-bottom mainz 05 .
and hanover 's bulgarian midfielder chavdar yankov extended their lead to 2-0 with a right-footed shot from a 50th minute corner before mainz 's egyptian international mohamed zidan grabbed a late consolation goal .
thomas doll 's borussia dortmund moved away from the relegation dog-fight after swiss international alexander frei gave them a 2-0 win at home to eintracht frankfurt with two well-struck free-kicks either side of half-time .
saturday 's results have cleared the relegation picture somewhat , with hanover now safe and hamburg , bochum and borussia dortmund virtually secure .

the akp dominates the 550-seat parliament , but does not have the required two-thirds majority to get gul elected in the first two rounds of voting .

" turkey is secular and will remain secular , " " neither sharia , nor coup d 'etat , democratic turkey , " they chanted .
police at the scene told reporters that the number of demonstrators was well over one million .
organizers said the rally drew people from all over turkey and abroad .
the istanbul demonstration followed a similar one in ankara on april 14 that attracted up to 1.5 million people , according to some estimates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister erdogan -lrb- r . -rrb- , with abdullah gul tensions rose after foreign minister abdullah gul , a former islamist from the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , narrowly missed becoming the country 's next president in a first round of voting in parliament on friday .
the akp dominates the 550-seat parliament , but does not have the required two-thirds majority to get gul elected in the first two rounds of voting .
the opposition boycotted the vote because of gul 's islamist past and because they were not consulted on his candiacy for the non-partisan post .
army statements cause concerns the army , which has carried out three coups in the past , issued a statement saying it was determined to protect turkey 's secular system and was ready to take action if the need arose , making it clear , according to many analysts , that gul 's candidacy was not welcome .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish army sees itself as the guardian of secularism the government responded by calling the army to order and gul on sunday ruled out withdrawing his presidential bid .
" it is out of the question for me to withdraw my candidacy in any way , " he told reporters in ankara .
the prospect of gul becoming head of state has alarmed secularists who fear the strict separation of state and religion will be eroded and islam will creep into all fields of life if he is elected .
court to decide on next round of voting the main opposition republican people 's party has asked the constitutional court to cancel friday 's presidential vote in parliament , arguing that the assembly did not have the necessary quorum to open the voting session .
if the court annuls the vote , general elections set for november 4 could be brought forward .
if does not , gul could be elected president in a third round of voting on may 9 , when an absolute majority of 276 votes would suffice , compared to the two-thirds majority of 367 required for the first two rounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a court decision may decide which president leads turkey " we all need to await the decision of the constitutional court , " gul said .
" the court will undoubtedly make the best evaluation and reach the right decision . "
gul and prime minister recep tayyip erdogan served in now-defunct islamist parties before setting up the akp in 2001 .
they say they have disawoved their islamist roots and are now committed to secular principles .
fear of an islamist agenda but secularists suspect the akp of harbouring a secret islamic agenda , citing its unsuccessful attempts to criminalise adultery , restrict alcohol sales and lift a ban on islamic headscarves in government offices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many turks fear the introduction of sharia law they fear the government will have a free hand to implement islamist policies if the party controls the presidency .
the turkish press on sunday was unanimous in calling on the government and the army to resolve their differences democratically and said early elections were the only way to prevent the country from plunging into chaos .
" turkey either giving up on secularism or suspending democracy are two doomsday scenarios impossible to choose between , " the popular daily vatan said .
the liberal daily milliyet said the army 's warning had " cast a shadow on the credibility and respectability of civilian institutions . "
" the latest developments show that the current term of parliament has reached the end of its natural life .
elections should be held at once , " it added . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu warns turkish army about meddling in presidential elections the european union warned the turkish army on saturday not to interfere in the country 's democratic process amid a dispute over the ruling party 's islamist-rooted candidate to be turkey 's next president .

german soccer authorities will investigate a " secret " meeting between bayern munich and werder bremen 's striker miroslav klose to see if any of the strict rules concerning approaches to contracted players were breached . holger hieronymus , deputy chief executive of the german football league -lrb- dfl -rrb- , told dpa sunday that both bayern and werder would be asked to make statements about the meeting .
klose has admitted he met bayern coach ottmar hitzfeld and general manager uli hoeness last tuesday in hanover , two days before werder played espanyol in the first leg of the semi-finals of the uefa cup .
under dfl regulations , clubs should not approach players from other clubs without first making an official approach in writing .
werder knew nothing about bayern 's meeting with klose until it was reported afterwards .
both bayern and klose could be fined by the dfl as a result of the meeting .
in a recent similar case in england , chelsea and defender ashley cole were fined a total of 900,000 euros -lrb- $ 1.25 million -rrb- for an unauthorised meeting which led to the player 's transfer from arsenal .

" we have all witnessed the dangers of climate change in the last few months .
we only saw winter in the calendar in germany , " he said , alluding to last year 's unusually mild winter . gabriel reminded the mps that germany needs to improve its energy efficiency by three percent per year in order to meet the eu target of reducing carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions by 20 percent below 1990-levels by 2020 . but the environment minister went further , proposing an eight-point plan that includes cutting germany 's co2 emissions by 40 percent within 13 years .
gabriel said he wanted to enlist industry 's help in pursuing this ambitious goal . " we should set ourselves the goal of making germany the most energy-efficient country in the world , " gabriel told the mps in berlin . efficiency from the bottom up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german railways : the better way to travel , says gabriel the action plan also calls on ordinary citizens to contribute to the fight against global warming , and envisions an 11-percent reduction in electricity use by 2020 .
this alone would save 40 million tons of co2 , gabriel said . the social democrat minister also encouraged germans to take the train more often as part of the effort .
gabriel told the german tabloid bild zeitung on thursday that he plans to further subsidize germany 's extensive railway system to lure travellers away from inexpensive short-haul flights with airlines such as germanwings or ryanair . " we must ensure that train services are able to compete with air travel , " gabriel said , and suggested that train tickets should qualify for a sales tax break that would allow the deutsche bahn ag to reduce ticket prices for consumers . " there is no tax on airline fuel , but the rail operator must pay the full value-added tax on the sale of long-distance tickets , " gabriel complained to the bundestag .
" that is unfair and can not remain that way . " green power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the green talk , germany plans to build more coal power plants gabriel also unveiled plans to modernize power stations across germany .
he said he wants to double the number of combined heat and power plants that trap and reuse heat generated in power production instead of releasing it . the german government under chancellor angela merkel has agreed to generate over a quarter of its power from environmentally friendly sources by 2020 , according to gabriel .
wind turbines , photovoltaic -lrb- solar -rrb- panels and biofuels are some of the most common forms of green energy , and they have become a formidable market force in germany . but gabriel criticized the government 's tacit approval of plans to build almost 30 new coal power plants on german soil , and he further attacked the conservative camp for advocating nuclear power as a " green " alternative .
nuclear power plants emit near-zero greenhouse gases , but nuclear waste and the possibility of a meltdown pose a different kind of environmental threat . investing in efficiency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three billion euros is a lot , but still better than constant droughts gabriel 's program would cost the german government three billion euros -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- over the next three years , according to the environment ministry 's own estimates .
the program aims to slash 270 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 . despite the country 's long tradition of progressive green policies , germany currently emits more than one billion tons of carbon dioxide per year , making it the world 's sixth-largest polluter . a german economic think-tank recently calculated that the consequences of unfettered cliamte change would cost germany more than 130 billion euros by the middle of the century .
compared to this sum , gabriel 's request for an additional three billion euros seems like a negligable investment in the future . global deadlock environmental protection groups welcomed gabriel 's plans , which they described as ambitious , but cautioned that words had to be followed by action . but gabriel warned that germany 's best efforts would be useless if the world did not follow suit .
chancellor merkel has made climate change a high priority at the june g8 summit in germany , but us president bush , leader of the world 's heaviest-polluting nation , has been reluctant to sign on to greenhouse gas regulations . " if we succeed in breaking the deadlock between the united states and some industrial countries on the one hand and developing countries on the other , the chances do n't look bad , " gabriel said .

" we have all witnessed the dangers of climate change in the last few months .
we only saw winter in the calendar in germany , " he said , alluding to last year 's unusually mild winter . gabriel reminded the mps that germany needs to improve its energy efficiency by three percent per year in order to meet the eu target of reducing carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions by 20 percent below 1990-levels by 2020 . but the environment minister went further , proposing an eight-point plan that includes cutting germany 's co2 emissions by 40 percent within 13 years .
gabriel said he wanted to enlist industry 's help in pursuing this ambitious goal . " we should set ourselves the goal of making germany the most energy-efficient country in the world , " gabriel told the mps in berlin . efficiency from the bottom up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german railways : the better way to travel , says gabriel the action plan also calls on ordinary citizens to contribute to the fight against global warming , and envisions an 11-percent reduction in electricity use by 2020 .
this alone would save 40 million tons of co2 , gabriel said . the social democrat minister also encouraged germans to take the train more often as part of the effort .
gabriel told the german tabloid bild zeitung on thursday that he plans to further subsidize germany 's extensive railway system to lure travellers away from inexpensive short-haul flights with airlines such as germanwings or ryanair . " we must ensure that train services are able to compete with air travel , " gabriel said , and suggested that train tickets should qualify for a sales tax break that would allow the deutsche bahn ag to reduce ticket prices for consumers . " there is no tax on airline fuel , but the rail operator must pay the full value-added tax on the sale of long-distance tickets , " gabriel complained to the bundestag .
" that is unfair and can not remain that way . " green power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the green talk , germany plans to build more coal power plants gabriel also unveiled plans to modernize power stations across germany .
he said he wants to double the number of combined heat and power plants that trap and reuse heat generated in power production instead of releasing it . the german government under chancellor angela merkel has agreed to generate over a quarter of its power from environmentally friendly sources by 2020 , according to gabriel .
wind turbines , photovoltaic -lrb- solar -rrb- panels and biofuels are some of the most common forms of green energy , and they have become a formidable market force in germany . but gabriel criticized the government 's tacit approval of plans to build almost 30 new coal power plants on german soil , and he further attacked the conservative camp for advocating nuclear power as a " green " alternative .
nuclear power plants emit near-zero greenhouse gases , but nuclear waste and the possibility of a meltdown pose a different kind of environmental threat . investing in efficiency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three billion euros is a lot , but still better than constant droughts gabriel 's program would cost the german government three billion euros -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- over the next three years , according to the environment ministry 's own estimates .
the program aims to slash 270 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 . despite the country 's long tradition of progressive green policies , germany currently emits more than one billion tons of carbon dioxide per year , making it the world 's sixth-largest polluter . a german economic think-tank recently calculated that the consequences of unfettered cliamte change would cost germany more than 130 billion euros by the middle of the century .
compared to this sum , gabriel 's request for an additional three billion euros seems like a negligable investment in the future . global deadlock environmental protection groups welcomed gabriel 's plans , which they described as ambitious , but cautioned that words had to be followed by action . but gabriel warned that germany 's best efforts would be useless if the world did not follow suit .
chancellor merkel has made climate change a high priority at the june g8 summit in germany , but us president bush , leader of the world 's heaviest-polluting nation , has been reluctant to sign on to greenhouse gas regulations . " if we succeed in breaking the deadlock between the united states and some industrial countries on the one hand and developing countries on the other , the chances do n't look bad , " gabriel said .

" we have all witnessed the dangers of climate change in the last few months .
we only saw winter in the calendar in germany , " he said , alluding to last year 's unusually mild winter . gabriel reminded the mps that germany needs to improve its energy efficiency by three percent per year in order to meet the eu target of reducing carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions by 20 percent below 1990-levels by 2020 . but the environment minister went further , proposing an eight-point plan that includes cutting germany 's co2 emissions by 40 percent within 13 years .
gabriel said he wanted to enlist industry 's help in pursuing this ambitious goal . " we should set ourselves the goal of making germany the most energy-efficient country in the world , " gabriel told the mps in berlin . efficiency from the bottom up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german railways : the better way to travel , says gabriel the action plan also calls on ordinary citizens to contribute to the fight against global warming , and envisions an 11-percent reduction in electricity use by 2020 .
this alone would save 40 million tons of co2 , gabriel said . the social democrat minister also encouraged germans to take the train more often as part of the effort .
gabriel told the german tabloid bild zeitung on thursday that he plans to further subsidize germany 's extensive railway system to lure travellers away from inexpensive short-haul flights with airlines such as germanwings or ryanair . " we must ensure that train services are able to compete with air travel , " gabriel said , and suggested that train tickets should qualify for a sales tax break that would allow the deutsche bahn ag to reduce ticket prices for consumers . " there is no tax on airline fuel , but the rail operator must pay the full value-added tax on the sale of long-distance tickets , " gabriel complained to the bundestag .
" that is unfair and can not remain that way . " green power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the green talk , germany plans to build more coal power plants gabriel also unveiled plans to modernize power stations across germany .
he said he wants to double the number of combined heat and power plants that trap and reuse heat generated in power production instead of releasing it . the german government under chancellor angela merkel has agreed to generate over a quarter of its power from environmentally friendly sources by 2020 , according to gabriel .
wind turbines , photovoltaic -lrb- solar -rrb- panels and biofuels are some of the most common forms of green energy , and they have become a formidable market force in germany . but gabriel criticized the government 's tacit approval of plans to build almost 30 new coal power plants on german soil , and he further attacked the conservative camp for advocating nuclear power as a " green " alternative .
nuclear power plants emit near-zero greenhouse gases , but nuclear waste and the possibility of a meltdown pose a different kind of environmental threat . investing in efficiency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three billion euros is a lot , but still better than constant droughts gabriel 's program would cost the german government three billion euros -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- over the next three years , according to the environment ministry 's own estimates .
the program aims to slash 270 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 . despite the country 's long tradition of progressive green policies , germany currently emits more than one billion tons of carbon dioxide per year , making it the world 's sixth-largest polluter . a german economic think-tank recently calculated that the consequences of unfettered cliamte change would cost germany more than 130 billion euros by the middle of the century .
compared to this sum , gabriel 's request for an additional three billion euros seems like a negligable investment in the future . global deadlock environmental protection groups welcomed gabriel 's plans , which they described as ambitious , but cautioned that words had to be followed by action . but gabriel warned that germany 's best efforts would be useless if the world did not follow suit .
chancellor merkel has made climate change a high priority at the june g8 summit in germany , but us president bush , leader of the world 's heaviest-polluting nation , has been reluctant to sign on to greenhouse gas regulations . " if we succeed in breaking the deadlock between the united states and some industrial countries on the one hand and developing countries on the other , the chances do n't look bad , " gabriel said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 29.04.2007 dutch coffee shops close as authorities weed out drug tourists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joint effort : dutch authorities have come together to reduce smokers ' opportunities each year , thousands of german drug tourists cross the border into the dutch town of enschede , where soft drugs such as marijuana are sold openly .
now , a government crackdown is forcing many coffee shops out of business . a dense , sweet-smelling smoke fills the room in the de molen coffee shop .
here in the dutch city of enschede , the streets are littered with places like de molen , which openly sell soft drugs such as hashish or marijuana . but dozens of coffee shops have had to close shop in recent months , reflecting a growing consensus in the netherlands that the country 's notoriously liberal drug policy is currently doing more harm than good . enschede has been particularly problematic for local authorities , because of its immediate proximity to the german border .
thousands of drug tourists , mainly from germany , pour across the border each year for a taste of legal marijuana , a controlled substance in almost every country of the world - including , technically , the netherlands . " many germans come to visit enschede just because of our coffee shops - that is a fact , " says enschede city spokesman michael haase .
indeed , the nearest coffee shop is located just 300 meters beyond the border checkpoint . the limits of tolerance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a girl smokes up in a dutch coffee shop the dutch ministry of foreign affairs has published a brochure complaining that shops located along the german border " frequently " cause trouble .
and haase says local residents are sometimes harassed by glassy-eyed drug tourists . enschede 's drug trade has also become a liability for the border police , as drug tourists are regularly caught trying to smuggle the lucrative weed back into their home country . but the last decade has seen a steady decline in the number of coffee shops , according to city officials .
eight years ago , enschede counted 17 coffee shops ; today , only 9 remain to serve the city 's population of 155,000 . the number of coffee shops has declined nationally , as well , with nearly 740 coffee shops in 2004 compared to 1180 in 1997 .
rather than a result of market realities , the decline stems from a concerted political effort to put a lid on the legal drug trade . " dutch local politicians have watched the drug tourism critically and have tightened the reins , " says christoph boenig , spokesman for the cross-border network euregio .
and michael haase , the city spokesman , says " there is a consensus amongst all political parties " concerning drug policy . since 1999 , local politicians in enschede have had the authority to shut down coffee shops , even if there were no reports of trouble or disturbances . business as usual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch labor party 's wouter bos campaigned in enschede last year but it is unclear whether the reduction in the number of coffee shops has actually resulted in a decrease in drug consumption and drug tourism ; and not all the coffee shops have closed down .
in the de molen coffee shop , it is business as usual . the de molen serves fifty customers on a normal day , and twice as many on weekends and holidays .
the staff there reports that the number of german and dutch customers is about equal . each customer is allowed to buy up to five grams of soft drugs , ranging from cannabis products like hashish or marijuana to psilocybin mushrooms , a psychoactive drug that can lead to hours of hallucinations .
the de molen , like most of its competitors , offers several different varieties of marijuana . " you can choose from many different flavors and strengths , " a saleswoman explains .
the cheapest is called " ketama , " and 0.8 grams cost five euros -lrb- ca. seven dollars -rrb- . but other varieties , such as " white widow , " have been engineered for maximum strength , containing as much as 25 percent tetrahydrocannabinol -lrb- thc -rrb- , the active ingredient in the cannabis plant .
a few decades ago , cannabis varieties rarely contained more than 10 percent thc . revising the drug policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a typical marijuana plant this increased effectiveness has caused policymakers to reconsider the definition of " soft " drugs .
some have advocated to bring dutch policy in line with international standards by completely banning all drugs , soft or hard .
but others say the current policy of tolerance is inconsistent , and that soft drugs should be legalized on the books as well as in practice . the netherlands effectively decriminalized soft drugs a few decades ago when it introduced a policy of " non-enforcement . "
although possession and cultivation of cannabis remains technically illegal in holland , law enforcement has systematically turned a blind eye , and the courts usually rule in favor of individual defendants . two years ago , gerd leers , mayor of the border city of maastricht , criticized this government policy .

now , a government crackdown is forcing many coffee shops out of business . a dense , sweet-smelling smoke fills the room in the de molen coffee shop .
here in the dutch city of enschede , the streets are littered with places like de molen , which openly sell soft drugs such as hashish or marijuana . but dozens of coffee shops have had to close shop in recent months , reflecting a growing consensus in the netherlands that the country 's notoriously liberal drug policy is currently doing more harm than good . enschede has been particularly problematic for local authorities , because of its immediate proximity to the german border .
thousands of drug tourists , mainly from germany , pour across the border each year for a taste of legal marijuana , a controlled substance in almost every country of the world - including , technically , the netherlands . " many germans come to visit enschede just because of our coffee shops - that is a fact , " says enschede city spokesman michael haase .
indeed , the nearest coffee shop is located just 300 meters beyond the border checkpoint . the limits of tolerance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a girl smokes up in a dutch coffee shop the dutch ministry of foreign affairs has published a brochure complaining that shops located along the german border " frequently " cause trouble .
and haase says local residents are sometimes harassed by glassy-eyed drug tourists . enschede 's drug trade has also become a liability for the border police , as drug tourists are regularly caught trying to smuggle the lucrative weed back into their home country . but the last decade has seen a steady decline in the number of coffee shops , according to city officials .
eight years ago , enschede counted 17 coffee shops ; today , only 9 remain to serve the city 's population of 155,000 . the number of coffee shops has declined nationally , as well , with nearly 740 coffee shops in 2004 compared to 1180 in 1997 .
rather than a result of market realities , the decline stems from a concerted political effort to put a lid on the legal drug trade . " dutch local politicians have watched the drug tourism critically and have tightened the reins , " says christoph boenig , spokesman for the cross-border network euregio .
and michael haase , the city spokesman , says " there is a consensus amongst all political parties " concerning drug policy . since 1999 , local politicians in enschede have had the authority to shut down coffee shops , even if there were no reports of trouble or disturbances . business as usual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch labor party 's wouter bos campaigned in enschede last year but it is unclear whether the reduction in the number of coffee shops has actually resulted in a decrease in drug consumption and drug tourism ; and not all the coffee shops have closed down .
in the de molen coffee shop , it is business as usual . the de molen serves fifty customers on a normal day , and twice as many on weekends and holidays .
the staff there reports that the number of german and dutch customers is about equal . each customer is allowed to buy up to five grams of soft drugs , ranging from cannabis products like hashish or marijuana to psilocybin mushrooms , a psychoactive drug that can lead to hours of hallucinations .
the de molen , like most of its competitors , offers several different varieties of marijuana . " you can choose from many different flavors and strengths , " a saleswoman explains .
the cheapest is called " ketama , " and 0.8 grams cost five euros -lrb- ca. seven dollars -rrb- . but other varieties , such as " white widow , " have been engineered for maximum strength , containing as much as 25 percent tetrahydrocannabinol -lrb- thc -rrb- , the active ingredient in the cannabis plant .
a few decades ago , cannabis varieties rarely contained more than 10 percent thc . revising the drug policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a typical marijuana plant this increased effectiveness has caused policymakers to reconsider the definition of " soft " drugs .
some have advocated to bring dutch policy in line with international standards by completely banning all drugs , soft or hard .
but others say the current policy of tolerance is inconsistent , and that soft drugs should be legalized on the books as well as in practice . the netherlands effectively decriminalized soft drugs a few decades ago when it introduced a policy of " non-enforcement . "
although possession and cultivation of cannabis remains technically illegal in holland , law enforcement has systematically turned a blind eye , and the courts usually rule in favor of individual defendants . two years ago , gerd leers , mayor of the border city of maastricht , criticized this government policy .
leers said that by allowing possession and retail sales of cannabis but not cultivation or wholesale , the government creates problems of crime and public safety . the de molen coffee shop has survived the wave of closures - and so has another legal curiosity of the dutch penal code .

" turkey is secular and will remain secular , " " neither sharia , nor coup d 'etat , democratic turkey , " they chanted .
police at the scene told reporters that the number of demonstrators was well over one million .
organizers said the rally drew people from all over turkey and abroad .
the istanbul demonstration followed a similar one in ankara on april 14 that attracted up to 1.5 million people , according to some estimates .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister erdogan -lrb- r . -rrb- , with abdullah gul tensions rose after foreign minister abdullah gul , a former islamist from the ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- , narrowly missed becoming the country 's next president in a first round of voting in parliament on friday .
the akp dominates the 550-seat parliament , but does not have the required two-thirds majority to get gul elected in the first two rounds of voting .
the opposition boycotted the vote because of gul 's islamist past and because they were not consulted on his candiacy for the non-partisan post .
army statements cause concerns the army , which has carried out three coups in the past , issued a statement saying it was determined to protect turkey 's secular system and was ready to take action if the need arose , making it clear , according to many analysts , that gul 's candidacy was not welcome .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish army sees itself as the guardian of secularism the government responded by calling the army to order and gul on sunday ruled out withdrawing his presidential bid .
" it is out of the question for me to withdraw my candidacy in any way , " he told reporters in ankara .
the prospect of gul becoming head of state has alarmed secularists who fear the strict separation of state and religion will be eroded and islam will creep into all fields of life if he is elected .
court to decide on next round of voting the main opposition republican people 's party has asked the constitutional court to cancel friday 's presidential vote in parliament , arguing that the assembly did not have the necessary quorum to open the voting session .
if the court annuls the vote , general elections set for november 4 could be brought forward .
if does not , gul could be elected president in a third round of voting on may 9 , when an absolute majority of 276 votes would suffice , compared to the two-thirds majority of 367 required for the first two rounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a court decision may decide which president leads turkey " we all need to await the decision of the constitutional court , " gul said .
" the court will undoubtedly make the best evaluation and reach the right decision . "
gul and prime minister recep tayyip erdogan served in now-defunct islamist parties before setting up the akp in 2001 .
they say they have disawoved their islamist roots and are now committed to secular principles .
fear of an islamist agenda but secularists suspect the akp of harbouring a secret islamic agenda , citing its unsuccessful attempts to criminalise adultery , restrict alcohol sales and lift a ban on islamic headscarves in government offices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many turks fear the introduction of sharia law they fear the government will have a free hand to implement islamist policies if the party controls the presidency .
the turkish press on sunday was unanimous in calling on the government and the army to resolve their differences democratically and said early elections were the only way to prevent the country from plunging into chaos .
" turkey either giving up on secularism or suspending democracy are two doomsday scenarios impossible to choose between , " the popular daily vatan said .
the liberal daily milliyet said the army 's warning had " cast a shadow on the credibility and respectability of civilian institutions . "
" the latest developments show that the current term of parliament has reached the end of its natural life .
elections should be held at once , " it added . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu warns turkish army about meddling in presidential elections the european union warned the turkish army on saturday not to interfere in the country 's democratic process amid a dispute over the ruling party 's islamist-rooted candidate to be turkey 's next president .

meanwhile title-holders bayern munich , beaten at home 2-1 by sv hamburg on saturday , have slipped out of the picture - now eight points behind stuttgart in fourth place .
veh and his stuttgart players had never considered themselves as title contenders until now , always maintaining their main ambition was perhaps to qualify for the champions league next season .
a first league title since 1992 was never a serious proposition .
but after the tight 1-0 win saturday at relegation-doomed bottom club borussia mönchengladbach , veh said : " we have the chance to reach first place .
it 's been a super season which we now want to top . "
" thankless " win puts title in sight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was all huff and puff in gladbach but vfb got the win veh was delighted by his side 's " thankless " 1-0 victory at mönchengladbach , achieved through midfielder roberto hilbert 's 53rd minute goal .
" that was a thankless win , " said veh .
" playing the league 's bottom side really puts you under pressure and you feel the expectation to get three points .
gladbach stood up very well in defence and were very hard to break down .
" but after we got the crucial goal , we really turned it on in the second half and were a pleasure to watch , " the coach purred .
stuttgart , who have only led the table once this season , also have the german cup in their sights after reaching the final against nuremberg , and an unlikely double is now very much a possibility .
veh 's young team has been under no pressure at all this season - unlike rivals bayern or schalke - and have impressed in attack where young german striker mario gomez and the brazilian cacau have scored 25 goals between them .
pressure taking toll on tightly-packed rivals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke were undone by a committed bochum team friday meanwhile their rivals are showing signs of cracking .
schalke slid to a 2-1 defeat at bochum on friday , while werder are out of sorts following a 3-0 defeat against espanyol in the uefa cup on thursday and news that striker miroslav klose has met bayern munich officials to sound out a possible transfer .
schalke coach mirko slomka said : " perhaps it was good that we lost .
in any case better than losing on the last day of the season .
we have to win our remaining three games and hope that the others also slip up . "
record title-holders bayern are now writing off a season which seems to be going from bad to worse after a 10th league defeat , at home to a hamburg side who now look to have pulled themselves out of relegation trouble .
" if i really said what i am thinking then the club would suspend me , so i am keeping my thoughts to myself , " said a clearly frustrated goalkeeper oliver kahn after the 2-1 defeat .
bayern 's peruvian claudio pizarro gave the home side the lead after 35 minutes , but hamburg 's dutch midfielder rafael van der vaart , who is being courted by bayern , cancelled out the advantage with a 71st minute goal .
hsv 's jose paolo guerrero grabbed the 76th-minute winner .
apoplectic bayern hierarchy to sell team bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness and hitzfeld coach ottmar hitzfeld was left lamenting a " lack of professional attitude " .
the bayern coach added : " the disappointment is huge .
we did n't work hard enough and we were not firm enough in attack , while in midfield we lost too many personal battles .
hamburg were more determined and that was the difference . "
bayern 's general manager uli hoeness could barely contain his wrath .
" all our energy is now going into getting a new team on the pitch next season which will have nothing in common with this team , " he said .
" this team has had its chance .
if you have a whole year to take your chance and do n't use it then you do n't deserve a second one . "
bayern were jeered off the pitch after another lacklustre display which means the team have missed out on the champions league - qualifying instead for the uefa cup - for the first time since 1996 .
" it 's clear to everyone that this team needs fresh players and we will get them , " said hoeness .
" we have enough money for new players . "
according to italy 's la gazzetta dello sport newspaper , italy striker luca toni will be one of the newcomers , but there has so far been no confirmation of the report from bayern .

thomas doll 's borussia dortmund moved away from the relegation dog-fight after swiss international alexander frei gave them a 2-0 win at home to eintracht frankfurt with two well-struck free-kicks either side of half-time .

bayern 's peruvian claudio pizarro gave the home side the lead after 35 minutes , but hamburg 's dutch midfielder rafael van der vaart , who is being courted by bayern , cancelled out the advantage with a 71st minute goal .
hsv 's jose paolo guerrero grabbed the 76th-minute winner .
apoplectic bayern hierarchy to sell team bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoeness and hitzfeld coach ottmar hitzfeld was left lamenting a " lack of professional attitude " .
the bayern coach added : " the disappointment is huge .
we did n't work hard enough and we were not firm enough in attack , while in midfield we lost too many personal battles .
hamburg were more determined and that was the difference . "
bayern 's general manager uli hoeness could barely contain his wrath .
" all our energy is now going into getting a new team on the pitch next season which will have nothing in common with this team , " he said .
" this team has had its chance .
if you have a whole year to take your chance and do n't use it then you do n't deserve a second one . "
bayern were jeered off the pitch after another lacklustre display which means the team have missed out on the champions league - qualifying instead for the uefa cup - for the first time since 1996 .
" it 's clear to everyone that this team needs fresh players and we will get them , " said hoeness .
" we have enough money for new players . "
according to italy 's la gazzetta dello sport newspaper , italy striker luca toni will be one of the newcomers , but there has so far been no confirmation of the report from bayern .
relegation conundrum unraveling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's gilberto opens the floodgates for the 4-0 elsewhere , hertha berlin trounced hosts alemannia aachen 4-0 to go seventh in the league as brazilian midfielder gilberto opened the scoring with a goal after just seven minutes .
berlin striker christian gimenez grabbed a second three minutes after the break to make it 2-0 , before marko pantelic and yildiray basturk grabbed two late goals .
meanwhile , vfl wolfsburg drew 1-1 at nuremberg after polish midfielder jacek krzynowek slotted home a left-footed shot after a 40-metre run on 18 minutes for the guests .
but the home side were back level just five minutes later when defender andreas wolf headed them on level terms .
mid-table hanover had dutch midfielder arnold jan bruggink 's right-footed shot to thank for their opening goal in their 2-1 win at second-from-bottom mainz 05 .
and hanover 's bulgarian midfielder chavdar yankov extended their lead to 2-0 with a right-footed shot from a 50th minute corner before mainz 's egyptian international mohamed zidan grabbed a late consolation goal .
thomas doll 's borussia dortmund moved away from the relegation dog-fight after swiss international alexander frei gave them a 2-0 win at home to eintracht frankfurt with two well-struck free-kicks either side of half-time .
saturday 's results have cleared the relegation picture somewhat , with hanover now safe and hamburg , bochum and borussia dortmund virtually secure .

meanwhile title-holders bayern munich , beaten at home 2-1 by sv hamburg on saturday , have slipped out of the picture - now eight points behind stuttgart in fourth place .
veh and his stuttgart players had never considered themselves as title contenders until now , always maintaining their main ambition was perhaps to qualify for the champions league next season .
a first league title since 1992 was never a serious proposition .
but after the tight 1-0 win saturday at relegation-doomed bottom club borussia mönchengladbach , veh said : " we have the chance to reach first place .
it 's been a super season which we now want to top . "
" thankless " win puts title in sight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was all huff and puff in gladbach but vfb got the win veh was delighted by his side 's " thankless " 1-0 victory at mönchengladbach , achieved through midfielder roberto hilbert 's 53rd minute goal .
" that was a thankless win , " said veh .
" playing the league 's bottom side really puts you under pressure and you feel the expectation to get three points .
gladbach stood up very well in defence and were very hard to break down .
" but after we got the crucial goal , we really turned it on in the second half and were a pleasure to watch , " the coach purred .
stuttgart , who have only led the table once this season , also have the german cup in their sights after reaching the final against nuremberg , and an unlikely double is now very much a possibility .
veh 's young team has been under no pressure at all this season - unlike rivals bayern or schalke - and have impressed in attack where young german striker mario gomez and the brazilian cacau have scored 25 goals between them .
pressure taking toll on tightly-packed rivals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke were undone by a committed bochum team friday meanwhile their rivals are showing signs of cracking .
schalke slid to a 2-1 defeat at bochum on friday , while werder are out of sorts following a 3-0 defeat against espanyol in the uefa cup on thursday and news that striker miroslav klose has met bayern munich officials to sound out a possible transfer .
schalke coach mirko slomka said : " perhaps it was good that we lost .
in any case better than losing on the last day of the season .
we have to win our remaining three games and hope that the others also slip up . "
record title-holders bayern are now writing off a season which seems to be going from bad to worse after a 10th league defeat , at home to a hamburg side who now look to have pulled themselves out of relegation trouble .

now , a government crackdown is forcing many coffee shops out of business . a dense , sweet-smelling smoke fills the room in the de molen coffee shop .
here in the dutch city of enschede , the streets are littered with places like de molen , which openly sell soft drugs such as hashish or marijuana . but dozens of coffee shops have had to close shop in recent months , reflecting a growing consensus in the netherlands that the country 's notoriously liberal drug policy is currently doing more harm than good . enschede has been particularly problematic for local authorities , because of its immediate proximity to the german border .
thousands of drug tourists , mainly from germany , pour across the border each year for a taste of legal marijuana , a controlled substance in almost every country of the world - including , technically , the netherlands . " many germans come to visit enschede just because of our coffee shops - that is a fact , " says enschede city spokesman michael haase .
indeed , the nearest coffee shop is located just 300 meters beyond the border checkpoint . the limits of tolerance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a girl smokes up in a dutch coffee shop the dutch ministry of foreign affairs has published a brochure complaining that shops located along the german border " frequently " cause trouble .
and haase says local residents are sometimes harassed by glassy-eyed drug tourists . enschede 's drug trade has also become a liability for the border police , as drug tourists are regularly caught trying to smuggle the lucrative weed back into their home country . but the last decade has seen a steady decline in the number of coffee shops , according to city officials .
eight years ago , enschede counted 17 coffee shops ; today , only 9 remain to serve the city 's population of 155,000 . the number of coffee shops has declined nationally , as well , with nearly 740 coffee shops in 2004 compared to 1180 in 1997 .
rather than a result of market realities , the decline stems from a concerted political effort to put a lid on the legal drug trade . " dutch local politicians have watched the drug tourism critically and have tightened the reins , " says christoph boenig , spokesman for the cross-border network euregio .

in the de molen coffee shop , it is business as usual . the de molen serves fifty customers on a normal day , and twice as many on weekends and holidays .
the staff there reports that the number of german and dutch customers is about equal . each customer is allowed to buy up to five grams of soft drugs , ranging from cannabis products like hashish or marijuana to psilocybin mushrooms , a psychoactive drug that can lead to hours of hallucinations .
the de molen , like most of its competitors , offers several different varieties of marijuana . " you can choose from many different flavors and strengths , " a saleswoman explains .
the cheapest is called " ketama , " and 0.8 grams cost five euros -lrb- ca. seven dollars -rrb- . but other varieties , such as " white widow , " have been engineered for maximum strength , containing as much as 25 percent tetrahydrocannabinol -lrb- thc -rrb- , the active ingredient in the cannabis plant .
a few decades ago , cannabis varieties rarely contained more than 10 percent thc . revising the drug policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a typical marijuana plant this increased effectiveness has caused policymakers to reconsider the definition of " soft " drugs .
some have advocated to bring dutch policy in line with international standards by completely banning all drugs , soft or hard .
but others say the current policy of tolerance is inconsistent , and that soft drugs should be legalized on the books as well as in practice . the netherlands effectively decriminalized soft drugs a few decades ago when it introduced a policy of " non-enforcement . "
although possession and cultivation of cannabis remains technically illegal in holland , law enforcement has systematically turned a blind eye , and the courts usually rule in favor of individual defendants . two years ago , gerd leers , mayor of the border city of maastricht , criticized this government policy .
leers said that by allowing possession and retail sales of cannabis but not cultivation or wholesale , the government creates problems of crime and public safety . the de molen coffee shop has survived the wave of closures - and so has another legal curiosity of the dutch penal code .

now , a government crackdown is forcing many coffee shops out of business . a dense , sweet-smelling smoke fills the room in the de molen coffee shop .
here in the dutch city of enschede , the streets are littered with places like de molen , which openly sell soft drugs such as hashish or marijuana . but dozens of coffee shops have had to close shop in recent months , reflecting a growing consensus in the netherlands that the country 's notoriously liberal drug policy is currently doing more harm than good . enschede has been particularly problematic for local authorities , because of its immediate proximity to the german border .
thousands of drug tourists , mainly from germany , pour across the border each year for a taste of legal marijuana , a controlled substance in almost every country of the world - including , technically , the netherlands . " many germans come to visit enschede just because of our coffee shops - that is a fact , " says enschede city spokesman michael haase .
indeed , the nearest coffee shop is located just 300 meters beyond the border checkpoint . the limits of tolerance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a girl smokes up in a dutch coffee shop the dutch ministry of foreign affairs has published a brochure complaining that shops located along the german border " frequently " cause trouble .
and haase says local residents are sometimes harassed by glassy-eyed drug tourists . enschede 's drug trade has also become a liability for the border police , as drug tourists are regularly caught trying to smuggle the lucrative weed back into their home country . but the last decade has seen a steady decline in the number of coffee shops , according to city officials .
eight years ago , enschede counted 17 coffee shops ; today , only 9 remain to serve the city 's population of 155,000 . the number of coffee shops has declined nationally , as well , with nearly 740 coffee shops in 2004 compared to 1180 in 1997 .
rather than a result of market realities , the decline stems from a concerted political effort to put a lid on the legal drug trade . " dutch local politicians have watched the drug tourism critically and have tightened the reins , " says christoph boenig , spokesman for the cross-border network euregio .
and michael haase , the city spokesman , says " there is a consensus amongst all political parties " concerning drug policy . since 1999 , local politicians in enschede have had the authority to shut down coffee shops , even if there were no reports of trouble or disturbances . business as usual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch labor party 's wouter bos campaigned in enschede last year but it is unclear whether the reduction in the number of coffee shops has actually resulted in a decrease in drug consumption and drug tourism ; and not all the coffee shops have closed down .
in the de molen coffee shop , it is business as usual . the de molen serves fifty customers on a normal day , and twice as many on weekends and holidays .
the staff there reports that the number of german and dutch customers is about equal . each customer is allowed to buy up to five grams of soft drugs , ranging from cannabis products like hashish or marijuana to psilocybin mushrooms , a psychoactive drug that can lead to hours of hallucinations .
the de molen , like most of its competitors , offers several different varieties of marijuana . " you can choose from many different flavors and strengths , " a saleswoman explains .
the cheapest is called " ketama , " and 0.8 grams cost five euros -lrb- ca. seven dollars -rrb- . but other varieties , such as " white widow , " have been engineered for maximum strength , containing as much as 25 percent tetrahydrocannabinol -lrb- thc -rrb- , the active ingredient in the cannabis plant .
a few decades ago , cannabis varieties rarely contained more than 10 percent thc . revising the drug policy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a typical marijuana plant this increased effectiveness has caused policymakers to reconsider the definition of " soft " drugs .
some have advocated to bring dutch policy in line with international standards by completely banning all drugs , soft or hard .
but others say the current policy of tolerance is inconsistent , and that soft drugs should be legalized on the books as well as in practice . the netherlands effectively decriminalized soft drugs a few decades ago when it introduced a policy of " non-enforcement . "
although possession and cultivation of cannabis remains technically illegal in holland , law enforcement has systematically turned a blind eye , and the courts usually rule in favor of individual defendants . two years ago , gerd leers , mayor of the border city of maastricht , criticized this government policy .
leers said that by allowing possession and retail sales of cannabis but not cultivation or wholesale , the government creates problems of crime and public safety . the de molen coffee shop has survived the wave of closures - and so has another legal curiosity of the dutch penal code .
shops are barred from transporting drugs to their stores .

all three treatments are based on replacing human genes , cells or tissues affected by various diseases with healthy ones . the regulation provides for a compulsory centralized procedure to authorize the marketing of innovative medical products and also for the subsequent monitoring of patients and products .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 29.04.2007 surprise package stuttgart in position to pounce großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sticking their necks out : stuttgart are now daring to dream of bundesliga success vfb stuttgart have been downplaying their title chances all season , but now no one is underestimating armin veh 's team as the bundesliga season reaches its climax with vfb 's nervous rivals coming unstuck around them . with three matches remaining of the season , stuttgart have moved within a point of leaders schalke 04 and could defend their second place in the table if werder bremen slip up at arminia bielefeld in a match later sunday .
meanwhile title-holders bayern munich , beaten at home 2-1 by sv hamburg on saturday , have slipped out of the picture - now eight points behind stuttgart in fourth place .
veh and his stuttgart players had never considered themselves as title contenders until now , always maintaining their main ambition was perhaps to qualify for the champions league next season .
a first league title since 1992 was never a serious proposition .
but after the tight 1-0 win saturday at relegation-doomed bottom club borussia mönchengladbach , veh said : " we have the chance to reach first place .
it 's been a super season which we now want to top . "
" thankless " win puts title in sight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was all huff and puff in gladbach but vfb got the win veh was delighted by his side 's " thankless " 1-0 victory at mönchengladbach , achieved through midfielder roberto hilbert 's 53rd minute goal .
" that was a thankless win , " said veh .
" playing the league 's bottom side really puts you under pressure and you feel the expectation to get three points .
gladbach stood up very well in defence and were very hard to break down .
" but after we got the crucial goal , we really turned it on in the second half and were a pleasure to watch , " the coach purred .
stuttgart , who have only led the table once this season , also have the german cup in their sights after reaching the final against nuremberg , and an unlikely double is now very much a possibility .

schalke coach mirko slomka said : " perhaps it was good that we lost .
in any case better than losing on the last day of the season .
we have to win our remaining three games and hope that the others also slip up . "
record title-holders bayern are now writing off a season which seems to be going from bad to worse after a 10th league defeat , at home to a hamburg side who now look to have pulled themselves out of relegation trouble .
" if i really said what i am thinking then the club would suspend me , so i am keeping my thoughts to myself , " said a clearly frustrated goalkeeper oliver kahn after the 2-1 defeat .

we did n't work hard enough and we were not firm enough in attack , while in midfield we lost too many personal battles .
hamburg were more determined and that was the difference . "
bayern 's general manager uli hoeness could barely contain his wrath .
" all our energy is now going into getting a new team on the pitch next season which will have nothing in common with this team , " he said .
" this team has had its chance .
if you have a whole year to take your chance and do n't use it then you do n't deserve a second one . "
bayern were jeered off the pitch after another lacklustre display which means the team have missed out on the champions league - qualifying instead for the uefa cup - for the first time since 1996 .
" it 's clear to everyone that this team needs fresh players and we will get them , " said hoeness .
" we have enough money for new players . "
according to italy 's la gazzetta dello sport newspaper , italy striker luca toni will be one of the newcomers , but there has so far been no confirmation of the report from bayern .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 29.04.2007 germany to become world 's most energy-efficient country großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environment minister sigmar gabriel tackles the " inconvenient truth " of pollution the german environment ministry this week unveiled a set of highly ambitious proposals that would lead germany to become the world 's most energy-efficient country in the coming years . environment minister sigmar gabriel told the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , that the time had come to act .
" we have all witnessed the dangers of climate change in the last few months .
we only saw winter in the calendar in germany , " he said , alluding to last year 's unusually mild winter . gabriel reminded the mps that germany needs to improve its energy efficiency by three percent per year in order to meet the eu target of reducing carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions by 20 percent below 1990-levels by 2020 . but the environment minister went further , proposing an eight-point plan that includes cutting germany 's co2 emissions by 40 percent within 13 years .
gabriel said he wanted to enlist industry 's help in pursuing this ambitious goal . " we should set ourselves the goal of making germany the most energy-efficient country in the world , " gabriel told the mps in berlin . efficiency from the bottom up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german railways : the better way to travel , says gabriel the action plan also calls on ordinary citizens to contribute to the fight against global warming , and envisions an 11-percent reduction in electricity use by 2020 .
this alone would save 40 million tons of co2 , gabriel said . the social democrat minister also encouraged germans to take the train more often as part of the effort .
gabriel told the german tabloid bild zeitung on thursday that he plans to further subsidize germany 's extensive railway system to lure travellers away from inexpensive short-haul flights with airlines such as germanwings or ryanair . " we must ensure that train services are able to compete with air travel , " gabriel said , and suggested that train tickets should qualify for a sales tax break that would allow the deutsche bahn ag to reduce ticket prices for consumers . " there is no tax on airline fuel , but the rail operator must pay the full value-added tax on the sale of long-distance tickets , " gabriel complained to the bundestag .
" that is unfair and can not remain that way . " green power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the green talk , germany plans to build more coal power plants gabriel also unveiled plans to modernize power stations across germany .
he said he wants to double the number of combined heat and power plants that trap and reuse heat generated in power production instead of releasing it . the german government under chancellor angela merkel has agreed to generate over a quarter of its power from environmentally friendly sources by 2020 , according to gabriel .
wind turbines , photovoltaic -lrb- solar -rrb- panels and biofuels are some of the most common forms of green energy , and they have become a formidable market force in germany . but gabriel criticized the government 's tacit approval of plans to build almost 30 new coal power plants on german soil , and he further attacked the conservative camp for advocating nuclear power as a " green " alternative .
nuclear power plants emit near-zero greenhouse gases , but nuclear waste and the possibility of a meltdown pose a different kind of environmental threat . investing in efficiency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : three billion euros is a lot , but still better than constant droughts gabriel 's program would cost the german government three billion euros -lrb- $ 4.1 billion -rrb- over the next three years , according to the environment ministry 's own estimates .
the program aims to slash 270 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 . despite the country 's long tradition of progressive green policies , germany currently emits more than one billion tons of carbon dioxide per year , making it the world 's sixth-largest polluter . a german economic think-tank recently calculated that the consequences of unfettered cliamte change would cost germany more than 130 billion euros by the middle of the century .
compared to this sum , gabriel 's request for an additional three billion euros seems like a negligable investment in the future . global deadlock environmental protection groups welcomed gabriel 's plans , which they described as ambitious , but cautioned that words had to be followed by action . but gabriel warned that germany 's best efforts would be useless if the world did not follow suit .
chancellor merkel has made climate change a high priority at the june g8 summit in germany , but us president bush , leader of the world 's heaviest-polluting nation , has been reluctant to sign on to greenhouse gas regulations . " if we succeed in breaking the deadlock between the united states and some industrial countries on the one hand and developing countries on the other , the chances do n't look bad , " gabriel said .

the attorney general , lord goldsmith , said the uk had a good record on combating international corruption .
in december , the prime minister said he took full responsibility for the decision to drop the probe and that the move was in the national interest because of britain 's relationship with saudi arabia .
i told the serious fraud office that they must pursue the other bae cases vigorously , and they 're doing that lord goldsmith but the decision was condemned by the anti-bribery watchdog , the organisation for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , which is planning to send inspectors to britain to find out why the sfo investigation was stopped .
in its latest report on human rights , the commons foreign affairs committee called on ministers to explain how they have responded to criticism from the oecd .
it also said the decision to abandon the long-running investigation into the al yamamah deal may have damaged britain 's reputation .
the sfo was investigating claims that britain 's biggest defence firm bae had paid bribes to secure an arms deal with saudi arabia in the 1980s .
bae has always denied the claims .
the committee of mps said : " we conclude that the government 's decision to halt the inquiry into the al yamamah arms deal may have caused severe damage to the reputation of the united kingdom in the fight against corruption . "
' human rights ' it also said the decision may have undermined britain 's ability to tackle the saudi government .
" there may also be an argument that it has weakened the united kingdom 's ability to take firm action against saudi arabia in a range of fields , including human rights , " it said .
the mps called on the government to " set out what steps it had taken " since the decision was made last december to " maintain momentum on international anti-corruption measures " .
lord goldsmith said the sfo were still carrying out investigations .

" they 're actively investigating cases in relation to five different countries . "
the sfo inquiry , which was examining relations between the saudis and bae systems , was stopped after consultations between mr blair and the attorney general lord goldsmith .
it came weeks after reports that the saudis were threatening to pull out of a deal to buy 72 eurofighter jets from bae and deal with france instead .
but the government denied the inquiry was dropped after commercial and political pressure .
last week it emerged that the us made a formal diplomatic protest about the closing down of the inquiry .
iraq ' abuses ' the commons foreign affairs committee also expressed concern about human rights abuses in iraq and afghanistan .
" there has been a further grave deterioration in respect for human rights in iraq , in large part caused by the worsening security situation , " it said .
the mps said they were concerned over allegations some iraqi minister and ministries were involved in human rights abuses and in a " sharp rise " in the number of executions and claims of unfair trials , " including the trial and execution of saddam hussein , " it said .

the serious fraud office 's inquiry into a 1980s deal between bae systems and saudi arabia was stopped last december .
tony blair has said the decision was made in britain 's national interest .
the commons foreign affairs committee has now urged ministers to explain how they responded to criticism from the international anti-bribery watchdog .
the attorney general , lord goldsmith , said the uk had a good record on combating international corruption .
in december , the prime minister said he took full responsibility for the decision to drop the probe and that the move was in the national interest because of britain 's relationship with saudi arabia .
i told the serious fraud office that they must pursue the other bae cases vigorously , and they 're doing that lord goldsmith but the decision was condemned by the anti-bribery watchdog , the organisation for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , which is planning to send inspectors to britain to find out why the sfo investigation was stopped .
in its latest report on human rights , the commons foreign affairs committee called on ministers to explain how they have responded to criticism from the oecd .
it also said the decision to abandon the long-running investigation into the al yamamah deal may have damaged britain 's reputation .
the sfo was investigating claims that britain 's biggest defence firm bae had paid bribes to secure an arms deal with saudi arabia in the 1980s .
bae has always denied the claims .
the committee of mps said : " we conclude that the government 's decision to halt the inquiry into the al yamamah arms deal may have caused severe damage to the reputation of the united kingdom in the fight against corruption . "
' human rights ' it also said the decision may have undermined britain 's ability to tackle the saudi government .
" there may also be an argument that it has weakened the united kingdom 's ability to take firm action against saudi arabia in a range of fields , including human rights , " it said .
the mps called on the government to " set out what steps it had taken " since the decision was made last december to " maintain momentum on international anti-corruption measures " .
lord goldsmith said the sfo were still carrying out investigations .

" they 're actively investigating cases in relation to five different countries . "
the sfo inquiry , which was examining relations between the saudis and bae systems , was stopped after consultations between mr blair and the attorney general lord goldsmith .
it came weeks after reports that the saudis were threatening to pull out of a deal to buy 72 eurofighter jets from bae and deal with france instead .
but the government denied the inquiry was dropped after commercial and political pressure .
last week it emerged that the us made a formal diplomatic protest about the closing down of the inquiry .

the committee of mps said : " we conclude that the government 's decision to halt the inquiry into the al yamamah arms deal may have caused severe damage to the reputation of the united kingdom in the fight against corruption . "
' human rights ' it also said the decision may have undermined britain 's ability to tackle the saudi government .
" there may also be an argument that it has weakened the united kingdom 's ability to take firm action against saudi arabia in a range of fields , including human rights , " it said .
the mps called on the government to " set out what steps it had taken " since the decision was made last december to " maintain momentum on international anti-corruption measures " .
lord goldsmith said the sfo were still carrying out investigations .
" i told the serious fraud office that they must pursue the other bae cases vigorously , and they 're doing that , " he told bbc radio 4 's the world this weekend .
" they 're actively investigating cases in relation to five different countries . "
the sfo inquiry , which was examining relations between the saudis and bae systems , was stopped after consultations between mr blair and the attorney general lord goldsmith .
it came weeks after reports that the saudis were threatening to pull out of a deal to buy 72 eurofighter jets from bae and deal with france instead .
but the government denied the inquiry was dropped after commercial and political pressure .
last week it emerged that the us made a formal diplomatic protest about the closing down of the inquiry .
iraq ' abuses ' the commons foreign affairs committee also expressed concern about human rights abuses in iraq and afghanistan .
" there has been a further grave deterioration in respect for human rights in iraq , in large part caused by the worsening security situation , " it said .
the mps said they were concerned over allegations some iraqi minister and ministries were involved in human rights abuses and in a " sharp rise " in the number of executions and claims of unfair trials , " including the trial and execution of saddam hussein , " it said .
in afghanistan there had been a " lack of progress " in achieving basic human rights in large sections of society , the report said .

" we were also filming albatross who were picking up plastic and feeding it to their chicks and we saw so many suffer a slow and painful death .
" i turned the camera off and just broke down crying . "
when the 33-year-old returned home to modbury , she set out on a mission to turn the town plastic-bag-free and managed to convince each and every trader to get on board .
rod baker from torpoint in cornwall has supplied nearly 2,000 of the large reusable cotton and jute bags2keep to retailers .
six-month trial the reusable bags are imported from a small factory in mumbai and printed in the uk using water-based organic ink .
he was approached by modbury trader helen pickles at a local trade fair and invited to talk to ms hosking and the town 's other retailers .
" i was a bit of a doubting thomas that it would come together , " he told bbc news .
" but all credit to rebecca - she was so strong willed and determined .
" to get a group of independently minded people to come together for a single purpose is no mean feat . "
the plastic bag ban will begin on tuesday , 1 may and continue for a minimum of six months .
