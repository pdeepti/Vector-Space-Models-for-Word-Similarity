11 hijackers to 15 years in prison .
dw 's peter philipp says that , despite the weaknesses of the motassadeq case , the amount of evidence was overwhelming . now that the 32-year-old moroccan mounir el motassadeq was handed for the second time a sentence of 15 years in prison , the german judiciary could pride itself about passing a legally valid verdict on an accomplice of the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 . the case itself , however , does not offer much cause for complacency .
the proceedings went through various twists and turns over a period of four years : the first 15-year sentence was suspended due to procedural errors , whereas the second sentence - 7 years in prison - was eventually deemed too lenient .
now , a 15-year-sentence was passed again . motassadeq 's lawyer has spoken of arbitrariness .
at first glance , these sentences may , indeed , appear arbitrary .
it is more to the point , however , what the german supreme court said during the process : the fight against terrorism should not be a " wild and unregulated war . "
that is why germany 's judiciary had such difficulties with motassadeq 's sentencing and why this verdict so blatantly contradicts the acquittal of another moroccan , abdelghani mzoudi . both defendants belonged to the inner circle of the hamburg students who were behind the attacks of sept .
11 .
both were accused of collaborating or , at least knowing about the planned terrorist attacks and doing nothing to prevent them .
a third moroccan from the perpetrators ' circle - ramzi binalshibh - could have shed light on what roles the two had actually played .
but he is in custody in the united states and not available to the german judiciary . washington was anything but cooperative , supposedly for security reasons .
for all intents and purposes , however , the us position on this matter is baffling in view of its proclaimed cooperation in the war on terror .
it is also surprising because the us actually contributed to mzoudi 's acquittal in 2004 : they faxed an exculpatory transcript of binalshibh 's interrogation to the german authorities .
motassadeq did not get this kind of help . the value of such statements is dubious : no representative of the german judiciary was present when they were made and nothing is known about the circumstances under which they originated .
interrogation methods at guantanamo are in any case incompatible with german laws and statements attained using such methods would not be accepted by german courts . at the same time and despite the recognizable weaknesses of the motassadeq case , the burden of evidence was overwhelming and it made the verdict compelling : the young man belonged to the terrorists ' innermost circle ; he helped them with money transactions and other things .
that 's why it can be justly assumed that he knew at least in general terms that a terrorist attack was being prepared .

" it is not acceptable when there are no consultations about such moves , " merkel told reporters after meeting with european commission president jose manuel barroso in berlin . " that repeatedly destroys confidence and you can not build cooperation based on true mutual trust in this way , " she said . the german cabinet and members of the european commission on tuesday met in berlin to debate issues related to securing europe ’ s energy supply .
the meeting had been planned with a view to coordinating activities within the current german presidency of the 27-member bloc , but took on added urgency because of the ongoing spat between moscow and minsk , which on monday led to the disruption of gas supplies to poland and germany . barroso : " unacceptable " move barroso too criticized russia for its role in the oil crisis and urged moscow and minsk to find a quick solution to their dispute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil tanks of the druzhba pipeline in the southeastern belarusian city of mozyr " it is unacceptable for either supplier or transit countries to take measures that impact on partner countries without consultation , " barroso said .
" it once again demonstrates that we need a common energy policy . " russian president vladimir putin said tuesday that western consumers must be shielded from the effects of an oil transit row with belarus that has hit supplies to the eu . putin told government ministers it was " necessary to continue negotiations with our belarusian partners " and to " do everything to secure the interests of western consumers . " however , he said that it might be necessary to cut russian oil production due to the shutdown of the druzhba pipeline through belarus in a tariff dispute .
the pipeline accounts for a third of russia 's total oil exports . negotiations to restart supplies showed no sign of making headway in moscow . merkel urges energy diversity merkel said the current row over oil supplies between russia and belarus made it abundantly clear that the 27-nation bloc needed to drastically reduce its dependence on russian energy sources . russian oil and gas supplies currently make up about one third of all energy imports in germany , and there ’ s a growing sense of unease over the kremlin ’ s potential ability to use western energy dependence as a sharp political weapon . " we ’ re in agreement with the european commission that every member country will be given the same amount of assistance and solidarity when it comes to energy supply problems , " merkel said .
" but the current crisis also shows that in order to become more independent , we first have to redouble our own efforts to achieve higher energy efficiency and arrive at a more competitive energy market . " merkel said that europe needed to draw its energy from a varied mix of sources with particular emphasis on renewable energy in order to improve efficiency . earlier , merkel also indicated in an interview that she may rethink germany 's long-planned nuclear phase-out plan which foresees shutting down all the country 's nuclear plants by 2020 . eu energy plan already controversial the european commission has long been seeking instruments to secure energy safety and decrease the eu ’ s dependence on gas and oil .
in a new policy strategy to be unveiled on wednesday , the european commission will call for " a new industrial revolution " in the energy sector to boost competition , protect the climate and ensure security of supply . the policy blueprint however is likely to cause controversy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's promotion of nuclear energy in its draft policy remains controversial according to media reports , the eu 's new energy policy will call for building " cleaner " coal plants .
it will also promote the use of nuclear energy as an alternative to fossil fuels because of the lower greenhouse emissions generated by nuclear plants .
the draft policy will however stress that it is up to national governments to decide whether to produce nuclear energy . critics in germany , particularly those from the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- who are against extending the lifespan for nuclear plants , have already panned the eu 's draft policy on energy . " it belongs in the dustbin , " hans-josef fell , spd spokesman on energy affairs told news agency ap . in addition , the draft policy 's recommendations for boosting competition in the energy sector are also under fire from germany and france .

czinczoll creates modern kindergartens that stay open 12 hours a day .
and he chooses sites that are close to many workplaces . czinczoll sees himself as a service provider who works closely with companies .
the companies spend nothing on the kindergartens , but donated space and furniture is welcome .
parents pay by the hour ; but the longer the child is in the kindergarten , the lower the hourly rate .
long opening hours mean the kindergartens get plenty of use .
and that is important to czinczoll .
an attorney in his mid-30s , he is convinced : " even in kindergartens , you need an economics-oriented person at the top . "
and the project 's success proves he is right .
his current six day-care centers will see at least 11 sister centers open next year .
demand from companies and parents is huge . - bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new toys have finally arrived , and björn czinczoll is delighted to see it .
a car park with lots of gadgets .
the youngest ones here are just three months old .
björn czinczoll 's childcare centre in the industrial area of the bavarian city of regensburg is open from seven am to seven pm .
children can come here on an hourly basis for as long as their parents need .
czinczoll 's concept offers the flexibility that state childcare centres ca n't provide .
the 34 year old is a qualified lawyer , but instead of sitting in an office he builds kindergardens for a living : " i wanted to do something positive , something useful for children .
this rewards you daily .
i have no regretts – not for a single moment .
i like being in the kindergardens .
i really like being surrounded by so many children . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's already worked out his next project .
all he has to do now is to convince the board members at the regensburg university clinic .
the hospital needs a daycare centre for the children of its employees and björn czinczoll is prepared to set it up .
he finances his projects with state subsidies and contributions from the parents .
he approaches companies for donations , and takes care of all the red tape and deals with the local authorities : " if a hospital that does n't know anything about child care approaches the city council it is easy to turn it down .
we are different. we know what we want , we are more obstinate and we get what we want .
sure they do n't turn me down .
we just keep on insisting .
balancing work and family is an important issue these days and we want to make that possible – for the parents , the employees and the employers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction work at this site has already started .
still czinczoll needs nerves of steel .
the numerous regulations makes building kindergardens a tiresome business .
suddenly he gets a call about the university clinic .
things are looking good .
but progress on the building site is being hampered by red tape .
the first children are scheduled to move in by august , if everything goes according to plan : " we live in germany and that means progress is very slow .
sometimes we start planning two years in advance before the children can finally move in .
especially with new buildings because so many different authorities are involved and unfortunately communication between them is so poor . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this kindergarden in a villa in munich has just recently opened .
czinczoll 's latest facility is open 13 hours a day six days a week .
a co-operative provided the house at low cost to create kindergarden placements .
one-year-old mena will soon be coming here quite often .
her mum pays 4 euros an hour , but if she stays for longer periods the hourly rate decreases .
menas mother : this facility is certainly a great help .
i work a lot from home but that was n't easy .
looking after a child is really a full time job .
i do n't think i could have carried on working without this kindergarden . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : björn czinczoll already runs a total of 6 kindergardens .
he plans to open another 11 next year .
demand is huge , and czinczoll has dicovered a niche market : " if child care is organised properly to suit their needs then you see that a lot of parents think about having a second or third child .
they no longer have to choose between a career or a family because they can have both . "
so is he creating a small scale baby boom ?
björn czinczoll : " a small one , perhaps .
but that 's the way it should be .
the current problem is that germany 's population is growing older and there are n't enough children .
so we are doing what we can to rectify that . "

now a new pan-european green card scheme is reportedly in the pipeline . the european commission is planning to launch a green card that would give highly skilled migrants easier access to all 27 european union states , according to a report by the reuters news agency .
the initiative is likely to face strong resistance from a number of states . reuters says the eu executive intends to present the proposal as early as the second half of 2007 .
the exact details of the european scheme are still being hammered out . the us green card is a highly sought-after identification card that allows immigrants to live and work in the united states and eventually apply for citizenship .
unlike a work visa , such green cards are not attached to a specific job or employer . can one size fit all ? up to now germany , which currently holds the six-month rotating eu presidency , is one of the countries that has spearheaded the opposition to any cross-border policy on legal migration , saying its labor market is a purely domestic matter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this indonesian computer specialist was the first to get a german green card a number of other countries have also been sceptical about the suitability of a one-size-fits-all approach . chancellor gerhard schröder 's government launched a green card program in germany in 2000 in a bid to attract computer specialists from countries , such as india , and plug skills shortages in that sector .
but the take-up was poorer than expected for a variety of reasons . too restricted many criticised the limited five-year duration of the german green card and the bureaucracy involved in applying for one .
but the economic slowdown also played a role .
when the technology sector fell on hard times , there was a reduction in demand for it experts . in the european union , immigration regulations vary from country to country .
the majority only permit restricted new immigration and work permits for people with a job contract and specific skills . patchwork of laws within the eu itself , movement between some old and new member states also remains subject to restrictions .
on the doorstep of many of the poorer ex-communist states which joined the bloc in 2004 and with just below four million unemployed of its own , germany has restricted access to its labor market , fearing it could be swamped by workers from those countries . in contrast , the more economically buoyant united kingdom invited in workers from the 10 states who gained accession at that time .
but romania and bulgaria , who joined on jan .
1 this year , are being treated differently . citizens of these countries will have the same freedom of movement as the others , but not all of them will not be allowed to seek work .
poorly skilled migrants , in particular , will be hit by the uk restrictions . dw staff -lrb- jeg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de green card numbers below target germany 's much-touted green card program launched four years ago to meet the need for qualified it workers from abroad has been given to only 17,000 people .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 09.01.2007 opinion : " german judiciary has little reason for complacency " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german court has sentenced a friend of the sept .
11 hijackers to 15 years in prison .
dw 's peter philipp says that , despite the weaknesses of the motassadeq case , the amount of evidence was overwhelming . now that the 32-year-old moroccan mounir el motassadeq was handed for the second time a sentence of 15 years in prison , the german judiciary could pride itself about passing a legally valid verdict on an accomplice of the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 . the case itself , however , does not offer much cause for complacency .
the proceedings went through various twists and turns over a period of four years : the first 15-year sentence was suspended due to procedural errors , whereas the second sentence - 7 years in prison - was eventually deemed too lenient .
now , a 15-year-sentence was passed again . motassadeq 's lawyer has spoken of arbitrariness .
at first glance , these sentences may , indeed , appear arbitrary .
it is more to the point , however , what the german supreme court said during the process : the fight against terrorism should not be a " wild and unregulated war . "
that is why germany 's judiciary had such difficulties with motassadeq 's sentencing and why this verdict so blatantly contradicts the acquittal of another moroccan , abdelghani mzoudi . both defendants belonged to the inner circle of the hamburg students who were behind the attacks of sept .
11 .
both were accused of collaborating or , at least knowing about the planned terrorist attacks and doing nothing to prevent them .
a third moroccan from the perpetrators ' circle - ramzi binalshibh - could have shed light on what roles the two had actually played .
but he is in custody in the united states and not available to the german judiciary . washington was anything but cooperative , supposedly for security reasons .
for all intents and purposes , however , the us position on this matter is baffling in view of its proclaimed cooperation in the war on terror .
it is also surprising because the us actually contributed to mzoudi 's acquittal in 2004 : they faxed an exculpatory transcript of binalshibh 's interrogation to the german authorities .
motassadeq did not get this kind of help . the value of such statements is dubious : no representative of the german judiciary was present when they were made and nothing is known about the circumstances under which they originated .
interrogation methods at guantanamo are in any case incompatible with german laws and statements attained using such methods would not be accepted by german courts . at the same time and despite the recognizable weaknesses of the motassadeq case , the burden of evidence was overwhelming and it made the verdict compelling : the young man belonged to the terrorists ' innermost circle ; he helped them with money transactions and other things .
that 's why it can be justly assumed that he knew at least in general terms that a terrorist attack was being prepared .
the line between tacit assent and complicity is crossed all too easily .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 09.01.2007 hitler comedy breaks german taboos großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler appears as an absurd and pathetic figure in levy 's film is it really all right for germans to laugh about hitler and nazi germany ?
director dani levy 's " mein führer : the truly truest truth about adolf hitler " tests the limits . a new film comedy about hitler is starting in german cinemas this week .
" mein führer : the truly truest truth about adolf hitler " has unleashed a storm of media interest . more than 60 years after charlie chaplin 's " the great dictator " appeared in cinemas , this is the first humorous film production about the nazi leader to be made in germany .
the question everyone is asking is whether it is actually acceptable to laugh about hitler and the nazis - especially if you are german . in the film , hitler is a physical wreck who has been psychologically damaged by his authoritarian upbringing and is an impotent , bed-wetting , whimpering drug addict .
he plays with a toy battleship in his bath and trains his beloved german shepherd dog blondi , dressed in a mini ss uniform , to perform the nazi salute . an absurd figure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crimes of the nazis make laughing about hitler out of bounds for many germans " the figure of adolf hitler was a pathetic figure and also pitiable and ridiculous , " said levy .
" just like nazism as a whole .
if you think that a whole nation used to shout ' heil hitler , ' that is cabaret of the most profound kind . " levy , however , also said he realizes the crimes of the nazi regime could make laughing at his film 's satire difficult for some . " it would have been funny and people would have been able to laugh about the whole thing over the last few years if the nazis had not done what they did , " he said .

director dani levy 's " mein führer : the truly truest truth about adolf hitler " tests the limits . a new film comedy about hitler is starting in german cinemas this week .
" mein führer : the truly truest truth about adolf hitler " has unleashed a storm of media interest . more than 60 years after charlie chaplin 's " the great dictator " appeared in cinemas , this is the first humorous film production about the nazi leader to be made in germany .
the question everyone is asking is whether it is actually acceptable to laugh about hitler and the nazis - especially if you are german . in the film , hitler is a physical wreck who has been psychologically damaged by his authoritarian upbringing and is an impotent , bed-wetting , whimpering drug addict .
he plays with a toy battleship in his bath and trains his beloved german shepherd dog blondi , dressed in a mini ss uniform , to perform the nazi salute . an absurd figure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crimes of the nazis make laughing about hitler out of bounds for many germans " the figure of adolf hitler was a pathetic figure and also pitiable and ridiculous , " said levy .
" just like nazism as a whole .
if you think that a whole nation used to shout ' heil hitler , ' that is cabaret of the most profound kind . " levy , however , also said he realizes the crimes of the nazi regime could make laughing at his film 's satire difficult for some . " it would have been funny and people would have been able to laugh about the whole thing over the last few years if the nazis had not done what they did , " he said .

director dani levy 's " mein führer : the truly truest truth about adolf hitler " tests the limits . a new film comedy about hitler is starting in german cinemas this week .
" mein führer : the truly truest truth about adolf hitler " has unleashed a storm of media interest . more than 60 years after charlie chaplin 's " the great dictator " appeared in cinemas , this is the first humorous film production about the nazi leader to be made in germany .
the question everyone is asking is whether it is actually acceptable to laugh about hitler and the nazis - especially if you are german . in the film , hitler is a physical wreck who has been psychologically damaged by his authoritarian upbringing and is an impotent , bed-wetting , whimpering drug addict .
he plays with a toy battleship in his bath and trains his beloved german shepherd dog blondi , dressed in a mini ss uniform , to perform the nazi salute . an absurd figure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crimes of the nazis make laughing about hitler out of bounds for many germans " the figure of adolf hitler was a pathetic figure and also pitiable and ridiculous , " said levy .
" just like nazism as a whole .
if you think that a whole nation used to shout ' heil hitler , ' that is cabaret of the most profound kind . " levy , however , also said he realizes the crimes of the nazi regime could make laughing at his film 's satire difficult for some . " it would have been funny and people would have been able to laugh about the whole thing over the last few years if the nazis had not done what they did , " he said .
" if this endless destruction , the biggest crime against humanity that there has ever been , had not happened . " " mein führer " is set in the final weeks of 1944 when germany was clearly losing the war and shows hitler on the verge of a nervous breakdown while propaganda minister joseph goebbels decides to appoint a linguistic coach to help the dictator prepare to give a morale-boosting speech to the people . a jewish actor , the fictional adolf grünbaum , is released from a concentration camp to do the job and puts hitler through a series of exercises .
most of the film 's humor arises during these training sessions - for example the slapstick scene when the dictator gets knocked out during a boxing match or ends up crawling around on the floor barking like a dog . close to the bone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film downfall also portrayed hitler in a ' human " manner but there are also a number of exaggerated , part comic , part demonic performances from the coterie of figures who surround hitler , such as goebbels and ss-leader heinrich himmler , hitler 's architect albert speer and mistress eva braun .
some of the comedy goes pretty close to the bone , for example when goebbels tells grünbaum that he should not take the final solution personally . in recent years in germany there has been a controversial move away from a simple deionization of the figure of hitler .
the director of the taboo-busting oscar-nominated 2004 film " downfall " created an intentionally human portrayal of hitler , reaping criticism along the way . counting on germans ' sense of humor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : levy is entering new territory in germany with this comedy dani levy , swiss-born jewish director , has also said his film aims to remove the figure of hitler from its pedestal .
his film , too , has already received both brickbats and bouquets .
but it adopts a very different approach from the serious " downfall . "
levy said he is confident that the comedy will be successful . " i 'm trusting that the germans have more humor than they are credited with - otherwise i would be lost as a jewish filmmaker with a jewish comedy about hitler , " he said .
" i think that , as is frequently the case at this time , that there is a feeling under the surface that there is a need to laugh about things that up to now had been exclusively consigned to seriousness .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 09.01.2007 kassel breaks ground for documenta expo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : work has begun in kassel ion the documenta exhibition hall despite uncertain funding , preparations for the international art expo documenta 12 are now underway in the city of kassel .
meanwhile , a parallel exhibit in hanover is planning to draw documenta visitors up north . on monday , tillers began tearing out large sections of grass in the downtown kassel 's french garden .
it was n't just ordinary park maintenance - workers were ripping off the top soil in the name of modern art . five months before the june 16 start of documenta , organizers have begun creating the expo location .
since it kicked off in 1955 , kassel has hosted all 11 previous documenta modern art exhibits , which are now held every five years . by the end of april , a 12,000 square-meter -lrb- 129,000 square-foot -rrb- glass building should be in place , where about three-quarters of the documenta exhibition pieces will be housed .
shortly after the 100-day event , the structure will be torn down , the grass replanted , allowing kassel 's downtown to return to normal . sponsors still needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as documenta 's artistic director , roger buergel is busy recruiting sponsors but the tight timeframe is not the only concern documenta 's artistic director roger buergel has to worry about .
financing for the short-lived building is also not yet secure , though he added that he has no doubts the exhibit will take place . " documenta will take place no matter what , " buergel said .
" even if only the asphalt surface is there , then we 'll show the exhibit on that . " nevertheless , the director is optimistic about finding sponsors to cover the cost of the glass exhibition hall , estimated to cost three million euros . sponsors , marketing and ticket sales will have to cover the building 's costs and provide half of the exhibit 's 19 million euro budget .
public funds will cover the other half of the budget but can not be spent on construction . competition in the art arena buergel will also have to contend with a number of concurrent major art highlight in germany this summer that will also be vying for visitors . three museums in hanover , for example , plan to profit from the influx of art-lovers with a project called " made in germany . "
the show , scheduled from may 25 to aug .
26 , will feature works by 50 young artists from germany , who have yet to make names for themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bodys isek kingelez showed " new manhattan city " at documenta in 2002 " we do n't want to pit ourselves against documenta and we do n't want to be a new documenta , " said beate anspach , spokesperson for the " made in germany " exhibit .

i 'm burning , " friends who accompanied her told the newspaper . she then fell into a coma but it took another 38 minutes before she was pronounced dead , the paper reported . dignitas declined to discuss the allegations on monday . " we have no comment on any reports by the tamedia house in zurich , " dignitas head ludwig minelli told the afp news agency in an email .
tamedia publishes the sonntagszeitung . another german client of the organization , a stroke victim identified as peter a. , spent three days in a coma before dying in august 2004 after taking a fatal dose of medication , the sonntagszeitung reported .
this contrasted with the quick and dignified death that dignitas promises , the paper added . liberal swiss law a spokeswoman for the zurich canton prosecutor 's office said it was too early to say whether a probe would be launched into the reported incidents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an assisted suicide in italy has sparked controversy in a speech to britain 's liberal democrat party in september 2006 , 74-year-old lawyer minelli said that since its creation in may 1998 , dignitas had " helped 619 members to end their lives without any complication . " " we help our members to make a risk and pain-free suicide , " he said . swiss law on assisted suicide is amongst the most liberal in the world .
it authorizes passive assistance for suicide , allowing a doctor to supply a terminally ill person with a fatal dose of a drug , although the patient must take the dose without the doctor 's help . it is illegal in switzerland to actively help someone to die , such as by administering an injection . dignitas attracts terminally ill patients from all over europe as laws in most eu member states are either ambiguous on assisted suicide or outlaws it as a last resort for long-suffering people . in 2005 , the organization sparked opposition from many german politicians and church leaders when it opened an office in the german city of hanover . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de serial-killer nurse gets life for 28 deaths the " angel of death , " as he has been dubbed in the press , will spend the rest of his life behind bars for killing 28 patients at the hospital where he worked as a nurse , a district court decided monday .

a new scientology headquarters in berlin has prompted calls for city authorities to put the organization under surveillance .
but berlin 's interior minister says the issue should be dealt with in the open . the opening of a large modern scientology center in the german capital berlin is causing political waves in the city with members of the local christian democratic party calling for the organization to be once again placed under surveillance .
but berlin 's interior minister , ehrhart körting , says that the issue should be dealt with openly . körting told a local radio station that it had to be made public what kind of ideology was behind scientology and what awaited potential members . the social democratic politician also said a court ruling prevented the berlin office for the protection of the constitution , which tracks extremist groups , from monitoring the activities of the center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are estimated to be some 30,000 scientologists in germany the state of berlin is the only one in germany where the scientologists are not under surveillance .
in 2001 and 2003 judges in the city decided there was insufficient evidence of any unconstitutional ambitions and banned the state from any further monitoring . but the state interior minister indicated this could change . " if new activities gave rise to fresh evidence , then we would look into this and discuss it with the federal authorities , " körting said . the cdu and the free democrats are calling for a change of the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us actor tom cruise is one of the famous scientologists who could be among the guests at the opening .
tom cruise could attend up to 10,000 guests are expected to attend the official opening of the new center on this coming saturday .
they could even include celebrity members of the organization , such as hollywood actors tom cruise and john travolta .
the scientologists say they have more than 1,000 members in the city .
other reports put the figure somewhere between 150 and 200 . the modern building in the central district of charlottenburg includes a church , an information center and a bookshop and replaces much smaller premises in another part of the city . the scientologists have confirmed that the building will be their german headquarters .
this would be their fourth center in a european capital after madrid , london and brussels . scientology is viewed with mistrust by many who say the organization pursues commercial interests and makes it difficult for its members to leave .
it has been accused of working like a sect by making people psychologically dependent and then exploiting them financially .
these accusations have repeatedly been rejected by the group itself , who say they suffer religious persecution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the organization founded by l. ron hubbard continues to provoke mistrust anti-democratic ? scientology was set up by l. ron hubbard in 1954 in the united states .
the organization 's official web site describes its aims as seeking " only evolution to higher states of being for the individual and for society . " but the german interior ministry is critical of the organization , which has an estimated 30,000 members in the country .
the latest report released by the extremist monitoring office said there were indications that scientology was aiming to achieve " a society without general and egalitarian elections . " the report also said that the writings of the organization 's founder contained " passages that defamed the principles of the free democratic order and which called for its abolition in favor of the building of a new civilization .

a new scientology headquarters in berlin has prompted calls for city authorities to put the organization under surveillance .
but berlin 's interior minister says the issue should be dealt with in the open . the opening of a large modern scientology center in the german capital berlin is causing political waves in the city with members of the local christian democratic party calling for the organization to be once again placed under surveillance .
but berlin 's interior minister , ehrhart körting , says that the issue should be dealt with openly . körting told a local radio station that it had to be made public what kind of ideology was behind scientology and what awaited potential members . the social democratic politician also said a court ruling prevented the berlin office for the protection of the constitution , which tracks extremist groups , from monitoring the activities of the center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are estimated to be some 30,000 scientologists in germany the state of berlin is the only one in germany where the scientologists are not under surveillance .
in 2001 and 2003 judges in the city decided there was insufficient evidence of any unconstitutional ambitions and banned the state from any further monitoring . but the state interior minister indicated this could change . " if new activities gave rise to fresh evidence , then we would look into this and discuss it with the federal authorities , " körting said . the cdu and the free democrats are calling for a change of the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us actor tom cruise is one of the famous scientologists who could be among the guests at the opening .
tom cruise could attend up to 10,000 guests are expected to attend the official opening of the new center on this coming saturday .
they could even include celebrity members of the organization , such as hollywood actors tom cruise and john travolta .
the scientologists say they have more than 1,000 members in the city .
other reports put the figure somewhere between 150 and 200 . the modern building in the central district of charlottenburg includes a church , an information center and a bookshop and replaces much smaller premises in another part of the city . the scientologists have confirmed that the building will be their german headquarters .
this would be their fourth center in a european capital after madrid , london and brussels . scientology is viewed with mistrust by many who say the organization pursues commercial interests and makes it difficult for its members to leave .
it has been accused of working like a sect by making people psychologically dependent and then exploiting them financially .
these accusations have repeatedly been rejected by the group itself , who say they suffer religious persecution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the organization founded by l. ron hubbard continues to provoke mistrust anti-democratic ? scientology was set up by l. ron hubbard in 1954 in the united states .
the organization 's official web site describes its aims as seeking " only evolution to higher states of being for the individual and for society . " but the german interior ministry is critical of the organization , which has an estimated 30,000 members in the country .
the latest report released by the extremist monitoring office said there were indications that scientology was aiming to achieve " a society without general and egalitarian elections . " the report also said that the writings of the organization 's founder contained " passages that defamed the principles of the free democratic order and which called for its abolition in favor of the building of a new civilization .

czinczoll creates modern kindergartens that stay open 12 hours a day .
and he chooses sites that are close to many workplaces . czinczoll sees himself as a service provider who works closely with companies .
the companies spend nothing on the kindergartens , but donated space and furniture is welcome .
parents pay by the hour ; but the longer the child is in the kindergarten , the lower the hourly rate .
long opening hours mean the kindergartens get plenty of use .
and that is important to czinczoll .
an attorney in his mid-30s , he is convinced : " even in kindergartens , you need an economics-oriented person at the top . "
and the project 's success proves he is right .
his current six day-care centers will see at least 11 sister centers open next year .
demand from companies and parents is huge . - bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new toys have finally arrived , and björn czinczoll is delighted to see it .
a car park with lots of gadgets .
the youngest ones here are just three months old .
björn czinczoll 's childcare centre in the industrial area of the bavarian city of regensburg is open from seven am to seven pm .
children can come here on an hourly basis for as long as their parents need .
czinczoll 's concept offers the flexibility that state childcare centres ca n't provide .
the 34 year old is a qualified lawyer , but instead of sitting in an office he builds kindergardens for a living : " i wanted to do something positive , something useful for children .
this rewards you daily .
i have no regretts – not for a single moment .
i like being in the kindergardens .
i really like being surrounded by so many children . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's already worked out his next project .
all he has to do now is to convince the board members at the regensburg university clinic .
the hospital needs a daycare centre for the children of its employees and björn czinczoll is prepared to set it up .
he finances his projects with state subsidies and contributions from the parents .
he approaches companies for donations , and takes care of all the red tape and deals with the local authorities : " if a hospital that does n't know anything about child care approaches the city council it is easy to turn it down .
we are different. we know what we want , we are more obstinate and we get what we want .
sure they do n't turn me down .
we just keep on insisting .
balancing work and family is an important issue these days and we want to make that possible – for the parents , the employees and the employers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction work at this site has already started .
still czinczoll needs nerves of steel .
the numerous regulations makes building kindergardens a tiresome business .
suddenly he gets a call about the university clinic .
things are looking good .
but progress on the building site is being hampered by red tape .
the first children are scheduled to move in by august , if everything goes according to plan : " we live in germany and that means progress is very slow .
sometimes we start planning two years in advance before the children can finally move in .
especially with new buildings because so many different authorities are involved and unfortunately communication between them is so poor . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this kindergarden in a villa in munich has just recently opened .

her mum pays 4 euros an hour , but if she stays for longer periods the hourly rate decreases .
menas mother : this facility is certainly a great help .
i work a lot from home but that was n't easy .
looking after a child is really a full time job .
i do n't think i could have carried on working without this kindergarden . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : björn czinczoll already runs a total of 6 kindergardens .
he plans to open another 11 next year .
demand is huge , and czinczoll has dicovered a niche market : " if child care is organised properly to suit their needs then you see that a lot of parents think about having a second or third child .
they no longer have to choose between a career or a family because they can have both . "
so is he creating a small scale baby boom ?
björn czinczoll : " a small one , perhaps .
but that 's the way it should be .
the current problem is that germany 's population is growing older and there are n't enough children .
so we are doing what we can to rectify that . "

czinczoll creates modern kindergartens that stay open 12 hours a day .
and he chooses sites that are close to many workplaces . czinczoll sees himself as a service provider who works closely with companies .
the companies spend nothing on the kindergartens , but donated space and furniture is welcome .
parents pay by the hour ; but the longer the child is in the kindergarten , the lower the hourly rate .
long opening hours mean the kindergartens get plenty of use .
and that is important to czinczoll .
an attorney in his mid-30s , he is convinced : " even in kindergartens , you need an economics-oriented person at the top . "
and the project 's success proves he is right .
his current six day-care centers will see at least 11 sister centers open next year .

björn czinczoll 's childcare centre in the industrial area of the bavarian city of regensburg is open from seven am to seven pm .
children can come here on an hourly basis for as long as their parents need .
czinczoll 's concept offers the flexibility that state childcare centres ca n't provide .
the 34 year old is a qualified lawyer , but instead of sitting in an office he builds kindergardens for a living : " i wanted to do something positive , something useful for children .
this rewards you daily .
i have no regretts – not for a single moment .
i like being in the kindergardens .
i really like being surrounded by so many children . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's already worked out his next project .

her comments come a day before the eu unveils its official energy strategy . german chancellor angela merkel appeared to take a dim view of russia on tuesday following its suspension of oil deliveries through the druzhba pipeline in belarus which hit supplies in germany and poland . merkel said the move destroyed confidence in russia as an energy supplier . " it is not acceptable when there are no consultations about such moves , " merkel told reporters after meeting with european commission president jose manuel barroso in berlin . " that repeatedly destroys confidence and you can not build cooperation based on true mutual trust in this way , " she said . the german cabinet and members of the european commission on tuesday met in berlin to debate issues related to securing europe ’ s energy supply .
the meeting had been planned with a view to coordinating activities within the current german presidency of the 27-member bloc , but took on added urgency because of the ongoing spat between moscow and minsk , which on monday led to the disruption of gas supplies to poland and germany . barroso : " unacceptable " move barroso too criticized russia for its role in the oil crisis and urged moscow and minsk to find a quick solution to their dispute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil tanks of the druzhba pipeline in the southeastern belarusian city of mozyr " it is unacceptable for either supplier or transit countries to take measures that impact on partner countries without consultation , " barroso said .

" however , he said that it might be necessary to cut russian oil production due to the shutdown of the druzhba pipeline through belarus in a tariff dispute .
the pipeline accounts for a third of russia 's total oil exports . negotiations to restart supplies showed no sign of making headway in moscow . merkel urges energy diversity merkel said the current row over oil supplies between russia and belarus made it abundantly clear that the 27-nation bloc needed to drastically reduce its dependence on russian energy sources . russian oil and gas supplies currently make up about one third of all energy imports in germany , and there ’ s a growing sense of unease over the kremlin ’ s potential ability to use western energy dependence as a sharp political weapon . " we ’ re in agreement with the european commission that every member country will be given the same amount of assistance and solidarity when it comes to energy supply problems , " merkel said .
" but the current crisis also shows that in order to become more independent , we first have to redouble our own efforts to achieve higher energy efficiency and arrive at a more competitive energy market . " merkel said that europe needed to draw its energy from a varied mix of sources with particular emphasis on renewable energy in order to improve efficiency . earlier , merkel also indicated in an interview that she may rethink germany 's long-planned nuclear phase-out plan which foresees shutting down all the country 's nuclear plants by 2020 . eu energy plan already controversial the european commission has long been seeking instruments to secure energy safety and decrease the eu ’ s dependence on gas and oil .

it will also promote the use of nuclear energy as an alternative to fossil fuels because of the lower greenhouse emissions generated by nuclear plants .
the draft policy will however stress that it is up to national governments to decide whether to produce nuclear energy . critics in germany , particularly those from the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- who are against extending the lifespan for nuclear plants , have already panned the eu 's draft policy on energy .

11 hijackers to 15 years in prison .
dw 's peter philipp says that , despite the weaknesses of the motassadeq case , the amount of evidence was overwhelming . now that the 32-year-old moroccan mounir el motassadeq was handed for the second time a sentence of 15 years in prison , the german judiciary could pride itself about passing a legally valid verdict on an accomplice of the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 . the case itself , however , does not offer much cause for complacency .
the proceedings went through various twists and turns over a period of four years : the first 15-year sentence was suspended due to procedural errors , whereas the second sentence - 7 years in prison - was eventually deemed too lenient .
now , a 15-year-sentence was passed again . motassadeq 's lawyer has spoken of arbitrariness .
at first glance , these sentences may , indeed , appear arbitrary .
it is more to the point , however , what the german supreme court said during the process : the fight against terrorism should not be a " wild and unregulated war . "
that is why germany 's judiciary had such difficulties with motassadeq 's sentencing and why this verdict so blatantly contradicts the acquittal of another moroccan , abdelghani mzoudi . both defendants belonged to the inner circle of the hamburg students who were behind the attacks of sept .
11 .
both were accused of collaborating or , at least knowing about the planned terrorist attacks and doing nothing to prevent them .
a third moroccan from the perpetrators ' circle - ramzi binalshibh - could have shed light on what roles the two had actually played .
but he is in custody in the united states and not available to the german judiciary . washington was anything but cooperative , supposedly for security reasons .
for all intents and purposes , however , the us position on this matter is baffling in view of its proclaimed cooperation in the war on terror .
it is also surprising because the us actually contributed to mzoudi 's acquittal in 2004 : they faxed an exculpatory transcript of binalshibh 's interrogation to the german authorities .
motassadeq did not get this kind of help . the value of such statements is dubious : no representative of the german judiciary was present when they were made and nothing is known about the circumstances under which they originated .
interrogation methods at guantanamo are in any case incompatible with german laws and statements attained using such methods would not be accepted by german courts . at the same time and despite the recognizable weaknesses of the motassadeq case , the burden of evidence was overwhelming and it made the verdict compelling : the young man belonged to the terrorists ' innermost circle ; he helped them with money transactions and other things .
that 's why it can be justly assumed that he knew at least in general terms that a terrorist attack was being prepared .

a new scientology headquarters in berlin has prompted calls for city authorities to put the organization under surveillance .
but berlin 's interior minister says the issue should be dealt with in the open . the opening of a large modern scientology center in the german capital berlin is causing political waves in the city with members of the local christian democratic party calling for the organization to be once again placed under surveillance .
but berlin 's interior minister , ehrhart körting , says that the issue should be dealt with openly . körting told a local radio station that it had to be made public what kind of ideology was behind scientology and what awaited potential members . the social democratic politician also said a court ruling prevented the berlin office for the protection of the constitution , which tracks extremist groups , from monitoring the activities of the center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are estimated to be some 30,000 scientologists in germany the state of berlin is the only one in germany where the scientologists are not under surveillance .
in 2001 and 2003 judges in the city decided there was insufficient evidence of any unconstitutional ambitions and banned the state from any further monitoring . but the state interior minister indicated this could change .

director dani levy 's " mein führer : the truly truest truth about adolf hitler " tests the limits . a new film comedy about hitler is starting in german cinemas this week .
" mein führer : the truly truest truth about adolf hitler " has unleashed a storm of media interest . more than 60 years after charlie chaplin 's " the great dictator " appeared in cinemas , this is the first humorous film production about the nazi leader to be made in germany .
the question everyone is asking is whether it is actually acceptable to laugh about hitler and the nazis - especially if you are german . in the film , hitler is a physical wreck who has been psychologically damaged by his authoritarian upbringing and is an impotent , bed-wetting , whimpering drug addict .
he plays with a toy battleship in his bath and trains his beloved german shepherd dog blondi , dressed in a mini ss uniform , to perform the nazi salute . an absurd figure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crimes of the nazis make laughing about hitler out of bounds for many germans " the figure of adolf hitler was a pathetic figure and also pitiable and ridiculous , " said levy .
" just like nazism as a whole .
if you think that a whole nation used to shout ' heil hitler , ' that is cabaret of the most profound kind . " levy , however , also said he realizes the crimes of the nazi regime could make laughing at his film 's satire difficult for some . " it would have been funny and people would have been able to laugh about the whole thing over the last few years if the nazis had not done what they did , " he said .
" if this endless destruction , the biggest crime against humanity that there has ever been , had not happened . " " mein führer " is set in the final weeks of 1944 when germany was clearly losing the war and shows hitler on the verge of a nervous breakdown while propaganda minister joseph goebbels decides to appoint a linguistic coach to help the dictator prepare to give a morale-boosting speech to the people . a jewish actor , the fictional adolf grünbaum , is released from a concentration camp to do the job and puts hitler through a series of exercises .
most of the film 's humor arises during these training sessions - for example the slapstick scene when the dictator gets knocked out during a boxing match or ends up crawling around on the floor barking like a dog . close to the bone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film downfall also portrayed hitler in a ' human " manner but there are also a number of exaggerated , part comic , part demonic performances from the coterie of figures who surround hitler , such as goebbels and ss-leader heinrich himmler , hitler 's architect albert speer and mistress eva braun .
some of the comedy goes pretty close to the bone , for example when goebbels tells grünbaum that he should not take the final solution personally . in recent years in germany there has been a controversial move away from a simple deionization of the figure of hitler .
the director of the taboo-busting oscar-nominated 2004 film " downfall " created an intentionally human portrayal of hitler , reaping criticism along the way . counting on germans ' sense of humor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : levy is entering new territory in germany with this comedy dani levy , swiss-born jewish director , has also said his film aims to remove the figure of hitler from its pedestal .
his film , too , has already received both brickbats and bouquets .
but it adopts a very different approach from the serious " downfall . "
levy said he is confident that the comedy will be successful . " i 'm trusting that the germans have more humor than they are credited with - otherwise i would be lost as a jewish filmmaker with a jewish comedy about hitler , " he said .
" i think that , as is frequently the case at this time , that there is a feeling under the surface that there is a need to laugh about things that up to now had been exclusively consigned to seriousness .

the question everyone is asking is whether it is actually acceptable to laugh about hitler and the nazis - especially if you are german . in the film , hitler is a physical wreck who has been psychologically damaged by his authoritarian upbringing and is an impotent , bed-wetting , whimpering drug addict .
he plays with a toy battleship in his bath and trains his beloved german shepherd dog blondi , dressed in a mini ss uniform , to perform the nazi salute . an absurd figure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crimes of the nazis make laughing about hitler out of bounds for many germans " the figure of adolf hitler was a pathetic figure and also pitiable and ridiculous , " said levy .
" just like nazism as a whole .
if you think that a whole nation used to shout ' heil hitler , ' that is cabaret of the most profound kind . " levy , however , also said he realizes the crimes of the nazi regime could make laughing at his film 's satire difficult for some . " it would have been funny and people would have been able to laugh about the whole thing over the last few years if the nazis had not done what they did , " he said .
" if this endless destruction , the biggest crime against humanity that there has ever been , had not happened . " " mein führer " is set in the final weeks of 1944 when germany was clearly losing the war and shows hitler on the verge of a nervous breakdown while propaganda minister joseph goebbels decides to appoint a linguistic coach to help the dictator prepare to give a morale-boosting speech to the people . a jewish actor , the fictional adolf grünbaum , is released from a concentration camp to do the job and puts hitler through a series of exercises .
most of the film 's humor arises during these training sessions - for example the slapstick scene when the dictator gets knocked out during a boxing match or ends up crawling around on the floor barking like a dog . close to the bone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film downfall also portrayed hitler in a ' human " manner but there are also a number of exaggerated , part comic , part demonic performances from the coterie of figures who surround hitler , such as goebbels and ss-leader heinrich himmler , hitler 's architect albert speer and mistress eva braun .
some of the comedy goes pretty close to the bone , for example when goebbels tells grünbaum that he should not take the final solution personally . in recent years in germany there has been a controversial move away from a simple deionization of the figure of hitler .
the director of the taboo-busting oscar-nominated 2004 film " downfall " created an intentionally human portrayal of hitler , reaping criticism along the way . counting on germans ' sense of humor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : levy is entering new territory in germany with this comedy dani levy , swiss-born jewish director , has also said his film aims to remove the figure of hitler from its pedestal .
his film , too , has already received both brickbats and bouquets .
but it adopts a very different approach from the serious " downfall . "
levy said he is confident that the comedy will be successful . " i 'm trusting that the germans have more humor than they are credited with - otherwise i would be lost as a jewish filmmaker with a jewish comedy about hitler , " he said .
" i think that , as is frequently the case at this time , that there is a feeling under the surface that there is a need to laugh about things that up to now had been exclusively consigned to seriousness .

czinczoll creates modern kindergartens that stay open 12 hours a day .
and he chooses sites that are close to many workplaces . czinczoll sees himself as a service provider who works closely with companies .
the companies spend nothing on the kindergartens , but donated space and furniture is welcome .
parents pay by the hour ; but the longer the child is in the kindergarten , the lower the hourly rate .
long opening hours mean the kindergartens get plenty of use .
and that is important to czinczoll .
an attorney in his mid-30s , he is convinced : " even in kindergartens , you need an economics-oriented person at the top . "
and the project 's success proves he is right .
his current six day-care centers will see at least 11 sister centers open next year .
demand from companies and parents is huge . - bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new toys have finally arrived , and björn czinczoll is delighted to see it .
a car park with lots of gadgets .
the youngest ones here are just three months old .
björn czinczoll 's childcare centre in the industrial area of the bavarian city of regensburg is open from seven am to seven pm .
children can come here on an hourly basis for as long as their parents need .
czinczoll 's concept offers the flexibility that state childcare centres ca n't provide .
the 34 year old is a qualified lawyer , but instead of sitting in an office he builds kindergardens for a living : " i wanted to do something positive , something useful for children .
this rewards you daily .
i have no regretts – not for a single moment .
i like being in the kindergardens .
i really like being surrounded by so many children . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's already worked out his next project .
all he has to do now is to convince the board members at the regensburg university clinic .
the hospital needs a daycare centre for the children of its employees and björn czinczoll is prepared to set it up .
he finances his projects with state subsidies and contributions from the parents .
he approaches companies for donations , and takes care of all the red tape and deals with the local authorities : " if a hospital that does n't know anything about child care approaches the city council it is easy to turn it down .
we are different. we know what we want , we are more obstinate and we get what we want .
sure they do n't turn me down .
we just keep on insisting .
balancing work and family is an important issue these days and we want to make that possible – for the parents , the employees and the employers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction work at this site has already started .
still czinczoll needs nerves of steel .
the numerous regulations makes building kindergardens a tiresome business .
suddenly he gets a call about the university clinic .
things are looking good .
but progress on the building site is being hampered by red tape .
the first children are scheduled to move in by august , if everything goes according to plan : " we live in germany and that means progress is very slow .
sometimes we start planning two years in advance before the children can finally move in .
especially with new buildings because so many different authorities are involved and unfortunately communication between them is so poor . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this kindergarden in a villa in munich has just recently opened .
czinczoll 's latest facility is open 13 hours a day six days a week .
a co-operative provided the house at low cost to create kindergarden placements .
one-year-old mena will soon be coming here quite often .
her mum pays 4 euros an hour , but if she stays for longer periods the hourly rate decreases .
menas mother : this facility is certainly a great help .
i work a lot from home but that was n't easy .
looking after a child is really a full time job .
i do n't think i could have carried on working without this kindergarden . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : björn czinczoll already runs a total of 6 kindergardens .
he plans to open another 11 next year .
demand is huge , and czinczoll has dicovered a niche market : " if child care is organised properly to suit their needs then you see that a lot of parents think about having a second or third child .
they no longer have to choose between a career or a family because they can have both . "
so is he creating a small scale baby boom ?
björn czinczoll : " a small one , perhaps .
but that 's the way it should be .
the current problem is that germany 's population is growing older and there are n't enough children .
so we are doing what we can to rectify that . "

" we must think about the consequences of shutting down nuclear power plants , " merkel said on tuesday in an interview with germany 's public broadcaster ard . the gradual shutdown of all germany 's nuclear power plants was agreed upon in 2000 by the government of former social democratic chancellor gerhard schröder and his coalition partners at the time , the greens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said she is against the eu getting too much energy from one source according to merkel , however , the latest incident regarding the transit of russian oil supplies through belarus demonstrated " that we need a comprehensive , balanced energy mix in germany . " merkel did not directly criticize moscow but said berlin would engage in " intensive discussions " about the energy issue . " i will travel to moscow on jan .
21 and will discuss this issue with the russian president , " merkel added . the german chancellor , who is presiding over germany 's six-month eu presidency , said berlin would play a key role in eu talks with moscow regarding a new partnership and co-operation agreement with russia . a divided coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear energy is a contested topic in germany merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their coalition partners , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , have been divided over nuclear power .
while conservatives near merkel have repeatedly demanded that germany slash a scheduled nuclear energy phase-out , the spd remains in favor of the plan to close nuclear power plants . " those who use oil shortages in order to propagate nuclear energy are not capable of intellectually comprehending the topic of energy supplies , " said ulrich kelber , deputy president of the spd parliamentary bloc . members of the opposition greens also protested the idea of making changes to the planned nuclear phase-out . " with uranium , you can neither heat your homes nor fuel your cars , " said green politician jürgen trittin . belarus ready to negotiate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian oil exports to europe via neighboring belarus were halted on monday meanwhile , a delegation headed by belarus ' deputy prime minister , andrei kobyakov , joined other officials , including deputy economic development minister vladimir naidunov , who arrived in moscow late monday , the belarus embassy told the afp news agency . belarus says it is ready to negotiate over a demand that russia pay $ 45 dollars -lrb- 35.50 euros -rrb- per ton transit fees on oil sent through its territory to eu countries .
moscow has refused to pay and on monday supplies to germany , poland and slovakia were interrupted . russian officials have not yet confirmed they are ready to negotiate and insist that the transit tax is illegal . belarus has long maintained close ties with its giant eastern neighbor russia .
the two countries have officially been building a " union state , " and moscow has seen belarus as a buffer against the expansion of the nato military alliance . strained relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they wanted a political union , but now they have a trade war : putin -lrb- left -rrb- and lukashenko but recently relations have become strained , particularly since moscow decided to double the price it charges belarus for natural gas from the start of this year . russia also introduced a tariff on oil exports to belarus , which refined the cheap oil and sold it to western countries .
in retaliation , belarus imposed the oil transit tax . the russian newspaper gazeta voiced sympathy for belarusian president alexander lukashenko , saying that the introduction of the oil transit fee was a " symmetrical " step in response to " severe political pressure " from moscow . the paper noted however that lukashenko lacked the western backing given to another russian neighbor , ukraine , during an energy dispute last year , and said , " it would be better for everyone if the war finished " on wednesday , when , belarusian prime minister sergei sidorsky is due in moscow . germany 's reliance on russian energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is becoming increasingly involved in energy disputes with its neigbors the druzhba pipeline supplies about 20 percent of germany 's annual oil imports , or 23.4 million tons in 2005 , according to the german oil industry federation -lrb- mwv -rrb- . russia has reduced the amount of oil it transits through western neighbors belarus and the baltic states , preferring to send oil via a new terminal near saint petersburg as well as around the coast of norway - in spite of less favorable climatic conditions . meanwhile on monday the energy-rich state of azerbaijan said it had stopped exporting oil to southern russia due to a natural gas price dispute with the russian gas giant gazprom . mukhtar babayev , an official with azerbaijan 's state oil firm socar , said azerbaijan was using oil previously exported to russia - about 4.2 million tons in 2006 - to fuel power stations that could no longer run on russian natural gas following a breakdown in the pricing talks . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hit as russia halts oil exports to belarus russia has halted oil exports passing through belarus , threatening wider disruptions in europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 09.01.2007 hitler comedy breaks german taboos großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler appears as an absurd and pathetic figure in levy 's film is it really all right for germans to laugh about hitler and nazi germany ?
director dani levy 's " mein führer : the truly truest truth about adolf hitler " tests the limits . a new film comedy about hitler is starting in german cinemas this week .
" mein führer : the truly truest truth about adolf hitler " has unleashed a storm of media interest . more than 60 years after charlie chaplin 's " the great dictator " appeared in cinemas , this is the first humorous film production about the nazi leader to be made in germany .
the question everyone is asking is whether it is actually acceptable to laugh about hitler and the nazis - especially if you are german . in the film , hitler is a physical wreck who has been psychologically damaged by his authoritarian upbringing and is an impotent , bed-wetting , whimpering drug addict .
he plays with a toy battleship in his bath and trains his beloved german shepherd dog blondi , dressed in a mini ss uniform , to perform the nazi salute . an absurd figure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crimes of the nazis make laughing about hitler out of bounds for many germans " the figure of adolf hitler was a pathetic figure and also pitiable and ridiculous , " said levy .
" just like nazism as a whole .
if you think that a whole nation used to shout ' heil hitler , ' that is cabaret of the most profound kind . " levy , however , also said he realizes the crimes of the nazi regime could make laughing at his film 's satire difficult for some . " it would have been funny and people would have been able to laugh about the whole thing over the last few years if the nazis had not done what they did , " he said .
" if this endless destruction , the biggest crime against humanity that there has ever been , had not happened . " " mein führer " is set in the final weeks of 1944 when germany was clearly losing the war and shows hitler on the verge of a nervous breakdown while propaganda minister joseph goebbels decides to appoint a linguistic coach to help the dictator prepare to give a morale-boosting speech to the people . a jewish actor , the fictional adolf grünbaum , is released from a concentration camp to do the job and puts hitler through a series of exercises .
most of the film 's humor arises during these training sessions - for example the slapstick scene when the dictator gets knocked out during a boxing match or ends up crawling around on the floor barking like a dog . close to the bone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film downfall also portrayed hitler in a ' human " manner but there are also a number of exaggerated , part comic , part demonic performances from the coterie of figures who surround hitler , such as goebbels and ss-leader heinrich himmler , hitler 's architect albert speer and mistress eva braun .
some of the comedy goes pretty close to the bone , for example when goebbels tells grünbaum that he should not take the final solution personally . in recent years in germany there has been a controversial move away from a simple deionization of the figure of hitler .
the director of the taboo-busting oscar-nominated 2004 film " downfall " created an intentionally human portrayal of hitler , reaping criticism along the way . counting on germans ' sense of humor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : levy is entering new territory in germany with this comedy dani levy , swiss-born jewish director , has also said his film aims to remove the figure of hitler from its pedestal .
his film , too , has already received both brickbats and bouquets .
but it adopts a very different approach from the serious " downfall . "
levy said he is confident that the comedy will be successful . " i 'm trusting that the germans have more humor than they are credited with - otherwise i would be lost as a jewish filmmaker with a jewish comedy about hitler , " he said .
" i think that , as is frequently the case at this time , that there is a feeling under the surface that there is a need to laugh about things that up to now had been exclusively consigned to seriousness .

i 'm burning , " friends who accompanied her told the newspaper . she then fell into a coma but it took another 38 minutes before she was pronounced dead , the paper reported . dignitas declined to discuss the allegations on monday . " we have no comment on any reports by the tamedia house in zurich , " dignitas head ludwig minelli told the afp news agency in an email .
tamedia publishes the sonntagszeitung . another german client of the organization , a stroke victim identified as peter a. , spent three days in a coma before dying in august 2004 after taking a fatal dose of medication , the sonntagszeitung reported .
this contrasted with the quick and dignified death that dignitas promises , the paper added . liberal swiss law a spokeswoman for the zurich canton prosecutor 's office said it was too early to say whether a probe would be launched into the reported incidents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an assisted suicide in italy has sparked controversy in a speech to britain 's liberal democrat party in september 2006 , 74-year-old lawyer minelli said that since its creation in may 1998 , dignitas had " helped 619 members to end their lives without any complication . " " we help our members to make a risk and pain-free suicide , " he said . swiss law on assisted suicide is amongst the most liberal in the world .
it authorizes passive assistance for suicide , allowing a doctor to supply a terminally ill person with a fatal dose of a drug , although the patient must take the dose without the doctor 's help . it is illegal in switzerland to actively help someone to die , such as by administering an injection . dignitas attracts terminally ill patients from all over europe as laws in most eu member states are either ambiguous on assisted suicide or outlaws it as a last resort for long-suffering people . in 2005 , the organization sparked opposition from many german politicians and church leaders when it opened an office in the german city of hanover . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de serial-killer nurse gets life for 28 deaths the " angel of death , " as he has been dubbed in the press , will spend the rest of his life behind bars for killing 28 patients at the hospital where he worked as a nurse , a district court decided monday .

" we both recognize that the best way to help impoverished nations is to complete this doha round and to encourage the spread of wealth and opportunity through open and reasonable and fair trade , " bush said , referring to the capital of qatar , which hosted the first round of the world trade organization negotiations in 2001 . barroso emphasized the need to move quickly on reaching deal and said he and bush ordered their negotiators to reach a " solution as soon as possible . "
barroso appeared upbeat after meeting with bush for about an hour , saying the two sides had realized action had to be taken . " we are really at defining moment , " barroso said . the ill-starred pact , which seeks to make it easier for developing countries to export products to richer nations like the united states and those in europe , was launched in 2001 but has repeatedly stalled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doha , qatar - where the trade talk began agriculture has been a main sticking point for the agreement and despite monday 's positive talk , there is still deep-seated discord over farm subsidies .
us subsidies now top $ 20 billion -lrb- 15.3 billion euros -rrb- a year , which displeases the europeans . however , subsidy reform is a sensitive proposition for american farmers .
they say they want to see tariffs fall in europe as well as in key developing countries like india and brazil . breakthrough still possible the current dispute led to a suspension in july of the talks .
earlier monday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in berlin that he believes there is still a chance of a breakthrough . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world trade organization , director general pascal lamy " despite all the difficulties , we have embarked on a path that makes an agreement appear possible , " steinmeier said after talks with the director general of the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , pascal lamy . steinmeier said germany would use its role as current eu president to work for a resumption of the talks . " we need to take advantage of the window of opportunity in the weeks ahead in order to make concrete progress that could lead to a breakthrough , " the foreign minister added . european trade commissioner peter mandelson was quoted monday as saying the doha round was on the brink of failure and will only succeed with bush 's support . during barroso 's washington visit , he and bush also discussed the israel-palestinian conflict , iran , syria , iraq and the ethnic conflict in sudan 's darfur region . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mandelson seeks new eu and us effort to unlock wto talks eu trade commissioner peter mandelson called on saturday for a " new political commitment " between europe and the united states to revive the stalled doha round of world trade talks .
-lrb- 06.01.2007 -rrb- failure of doha talks disappoints germans germans have blamed the us for not budging on subsidy cuts and are apprehensive about what monday 's fruitless doha talks will mean for poorer nations and german commerce .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 09.01.2007 kassel breaks ground for documenta expo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : work has begun in kassel ion the documenta exhibition hall despite uncertain funding , preparations for the international art expo documenta 12 are now underway in the city of kassel .
meanwhile , a parallel exhibit in hanover is planning to draw documenta visitors up north . on monday , tillers began tearing out large sections of grass in the downtown kassel 's french garden .
it was n't just ordinary park maintenance - workers were ripping off the top soil in the name of modern art . five months before the june 16 start of documenta , organizers have begun creating the expo location .
since it kicked off in 1955 , kassel has hosted all 11 previous documenta modern art exhibits , which are now held every five years . by the end of april , a 12,000 square-meter -lrb- 129,000 square-foot -rrb- glass building should be in place , where about three-quarters of the documenta exhibition pieces will be housed .
shortly after the 100-day event , the structure will be torn down , the grass replanted , allowing kassel 's downtown to return to normal . sponsors still needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as documenta 's artistic director , roger buergel is busy recruiting sponsors but the tight timeframe is not the only concern documenta 's artistic director roger buergel has to worry about .
financing for the short-lived building is also not yet secure , though he added that he has no doubts the exhibit will take place . " documenta will take place no matter what , " buergel said .
" even if only the asphalt surface is there , then we 'll show the exhibit on that . " nevertheless , the director is optimistic about finding sponsors to cover the cost of the glass exhibition hall , estimated to cost three million euros . sponsors , marketing and ticket sales will have to cover the building 's costs and provide half of the exhibit 's 19 million euro budget .
public funds will cover the other half of the budget but can not be spent on construction . competition in the art arena buergel will also have to contend with a number of concurrent major art highlight in germany this summer that will also be vying for visitors . three museums in hanover , for example , plan to profit from the influx of art-lovers with a project called " made in germany . "
the show , scheduled from may 25 to aug .

11 hijackers to 15 years in prison .
dw 's peter philipp says that , despite the weaknesses of the motassadeq case , the amount of evidence was overwhelming . now that the 32-year-old moroccan mounir el motassadeq was handed for the second time a sentence of 15 years in prison , the german judiciary could pride itself about passing a legally valid verdict on an accomplice of the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 . the case itself , however , does not offer much cause for complacency .
the proceedings went through various twists and turns over a period of four years : the first 15-year sentence was suspended due to procedural errors , whereas the second sentence - 7 years in prison - was eventually deemed too lenient .
now , a 15-year-sentence was passed again . motassadeq 's lawyer has spoken of arbitrariness .
at first glance , these sentences may , indeed , appear arbitrary .
it is more to the point , however , what the german supreme court said during the process : the fight against terrorism should not be a " wild and unregulated war . "
that is why germany 's judiciary had such difficulties with motassadeq 's sentencing and why this verdict so blatantly contradicts the acquittal of another moroccan , abdelghani mzoudi . both defendants belonged to the inner circle of the hamburg students who were behind the attacks of sept .
11 .
both were accused of collaborating or , at least knowing about the planned terrorist attacks and doing nothing to prevent them .
a third moroccan from the perpetrators ' circle - ramzi binalshibh - could have shed light on what roles the two had actually played .
but he is in custody in the united states and not available to the german judiciary . washington was anything but cooperative , supposedly for security reasons .
for all intents and purposes , however , the us position on this matter is baffling in view of its proclaimed cooperation in the war on terror .
it is also surprising because the us actually contributed to mzoudi 's acquittal in 2004 : they faxed an exculpatory transcript of binalshibh 's interrogation to the german authorities .
motassadeq did not get this kind of help . the value of such statements is dubious : no representative of the german judiciary was present when they were made and nothing is known about the circumstances under which they originated .
interrogation methods at guantanamo are in any case incompatible with german laws and statements attained using such methods would not be accepted by german courts . at the same time and despite the recognizable weaknesses of the motassadeq case , the burden of evidence was overwhelming and it made the verdict compelling : the young man belonged to the terrorists ' innermost circle ; he helped them with money transactions and other things .
that 's why it can be justly assumed that he knew at least in general terms that a terrorist attack was being prepared .
the line between tacit assent and complicity is crossed all too easily .

11 hijackers to 15 years in prison .
dw 's peter philipp says that , despite the weaknesses of the motassadeq case , the amount of evidence was overwhelming . now that the 32-year-old moroccan mounir el motassadeq was handed for the second time a sentence of 15 years in prison , the german judiciary could pride itself about passing a legally valid verdict on an accomplice of the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 . the case itself , however , does not offer much cause for complacency .
the proceedings went through various twists and turns over a period of four years : the first 15-year sentence was suspended due to procedural errors , whereas the second sentence - 7 years in prison - was eventually deemed too lenient .
now , a 15-year-sentence was passed again . motassadeq 's lawyer has spoken of arbitrariness .
at first glance , these sentences may , indeed , appear arbitrary .
it is more to the point , however , what the german supreme court said during the process : the fight against terrorism should not be a " wild and unregulated war . "
that is why germany 's judiciary had such difficulties with motassadeq 's sentencing and why this verdict so blatantly contradicts the acquittal of another moroccan , abdelghani mzoudi . both defendants belonged to the inner circle of the hamburg students who were behind the attacks of sept .
11 .
both were accused of collaborating or , at least knowing about the planned terrorist attacks and doing nothing to prevent them .
a third moroccan from the perpetrators ' circle - ramzi binalshibh - could have shed light on what roles the two had actually played .
but he is in custody in the united states and not available to the german judiciary . washington was anything but cooperative , supposedly for security reasons .
for all intents and purposes , however , the us position on this matter is baffling in view of its proclaimed cooperation in the war on terror .
it is also surprising because the us actually contributed to mzoudi 's acquittal in 2004 : they faxed an exculpatory transcript of binalshibh 's interrogation to the german authorities .
motassadeq did not get this kind of help . the value of such statements is dubious : no representative of the german judiciary was present when they were made and nothing is known about the circumstances under which they originated .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 09.01.2007 opening of new scientology center in berlin greeted with alarm großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the large new scientology center in berlin is due to open next saturday .
a new scientology headquarters in berlin has prompted calls for city authorities to put the organization under surveillance .
but berlin 's interior minister says the issue should be dealt with in the open . the opening of a large modern scientology center in the german capital berlin is causing political waves in the city with members of the local christian democratic party calling for the organization to be once again placed under surveillance .
but berlin 's interior minister , ehrhart körting , says that the issue should be dealt with openly . körting told a local radio station that it had to be made public what kind of ideology was behind scientology and what awaited potential members . the social democratic politician also said a court ruling prevented the berlin office for the protection of the constitution , which tracks extremist groups , from monitoring the activities of the center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are estimated to be some 30,000 scientologists in germany the state of berlin is the only one in germany where the scientologists are not under surveillance .
in 2001 and 2003 judges in the city decided there was insufficient evidence of any unconstitutional ambitions and banned the state from any further monitoring . but the state interior minister indicated this could change . " if new activities gave rise to fresh evidence , then we would look into this and discuss it with the federal authorities , " körting said . the cdu and the free democrats are calling for a change of the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us actor tom cruise is one of the famous scientologists who could be among the guests at the opening .
tom cruise could attend up to 10,000 guests are expected to attend the official opening of the new center on this coming saturday .
they could even include celebrity members of the organization , such as hollywood actors tom cruise and john travolta .
the scientologists say they have more than 1,000 members in the city .
other reports put the figure somewhere between 150 and 200 . the modern building in the central district of charlottenburg includes a church , an information center and a bookshop and replaces much smaller premises in another part of the city . the scientologists have confirmed that the building will be their german headquarters .
this would be their fourth center in a european capital after madrid , london and brussels . scientology is viewed with mistrust by many who say the organization pursues commercial interests and makes it difficult for its members to leave .
it has been accused of working like a sect by making people psychologically dependent and then exploiting them financially .
these accusations have repeatedly been rejected by the group itself , who say they suffer religious persecution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the organization founded by l. ron hubbard continues to provoke mistrust anti-democratic ? scientology was set up by l. ron hubbard in 1954 in the united states .
the organization 's official web site describes its aims as seeking " only evolution to higher states of being for the individual and for society . " but the german interior ministry is critical of the organization , which has an estimated 30,000 members in the country .
the latest report released by the extremist monitoring office said there were indications that scientology was aiming to achieve " a society without general and egalitarian elections . " the report also said that the writings of the organization 's founder contained " passages that defamed the principles of the free democratic order and which called for its abolition in favor of the building of a new civilization .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 09.01.2007 opening of new scientology center in berlin greeted with alarm großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the large new scientology center in berlin is due to open next saturday .
a new scientology headquarters in berlin has prompted calls for city authorities to put the organization under surveillance .
but berlin 's interior minister says the issue should be dealt with in the open . the opening of a large modern scientology center in the german capital berlin is causing political waves in the city with members of the local christian democratic party calling for the organization to be once again placed under surveillance .
but berlin 's interior minister , ehrhart körting , says that the issue should be dealt with openly . körting told a local radio station that it had to be made public what kind of ideology was behind scientology and what awaited potential members . the social democratic politician also said a court ruling prevented the berlin office for the protection of the constitution , which tracks extremist groups , from monitoring the activities of the center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are estimated to be some 30,000 scientologists in germany the state of berlin is the only one in germany where the scientologists are not under surveillance .
in 2001 and 2003 judges in the city decided there was insufficient evidence of any unconstitutional ambitions and banned the state from any further monitoring . but the state interior minister indicated this could change . " if new activities gave rise to fresh evidence , then we would look into this and discuss it with the federal authorities , " körting said . the cdu and the free democrats are calling for a change of the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us actor tom cruise is one of the famous scientologists who could be among the guests at the opening .
tom cruise could attend up to 10,000 guests are expected to attend the official opening of the new center on this coming saturday .
they could even include celebrity members of the organization , such as hollywood actors tom cruise and john travolta .
the scientologists say they have more than 1,000 members in the city .
other reports put the figure somewhere between 150 and 200 . the modern building in the central district of charlottenburg includes a church , an information center and a bookshop and replaces much smaller premises in another part of the city . the scientologists have confirmed that the building will be their german headquarters .
this would be their fourth center in a european capital after madrid , london and brussels . scientology is viewed with mistrust by many who say the organization pursues commercial interests and makes it difficult for its members to leave .
it has been accused of working like a sect by making people psychologically dependent and then exploiting them financially .
these accusations have repeatedly been rejected by the group itself , who say they suffer religious persecution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the organization founded by l. ron hubbard continues to provoke mistrust anti-democratic ? scientology was set up by l. ron hubbard in 1954 in the united states .
the organization 's official web site describes its aims as seeking " only evolution to higher states of being for the individual and for society . " but the german interior ministry is critical of the organization , which has an estimated 30,000 members in the country .
the latest report released by the extremist monitoring office said there were indications that scientology was aiming to achieve " a society without general and egalitarian elections . " the report also said that the writings of the organization 's founder contained " passages that defamed the principles of the free democratic order and which called for its abolition in favor of the building of a new civilization .

a new scientology headquarters in berlin has prompted calls for city authorities to put the organization under surveillance .
but berlin 's interior minister says the issue should be dealt with in the open . the opening of a large modern scientology center in the german capital berlin is causing political waves in the city with members of the local christian democratic party calling for the organization to be once again placed under surveillance .
but berlin 's interior minister , ehrhart körting , says that the issue should be dealt with openly . körting told a local radio station that it had to be made public what kind of ideology was behind scientology and what awaited potential members . the social democratic politician also said a court ruling prevented the berlin office for the protection of the constitution , which tracks extremist groups , from monitoring the activities of the center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are estimated to be some 30,000 scientologists in germany the state of berlin is the only one in germany where the scientologists are not under surveillance .
in 2001 and 2003 judges in the city decided there was insufficient evidence of any unconstitutional ambitions and banned the state from any further monitoring . but the state interior minister indicated this could change . " if new activities gave rise to fresh evidence , then we would look into this and discuss it with the federal authorities , " körting said . the cdu and the free democrats are calling for a change of the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us actor tom cruise is one of the famous scientologists who could be among the guests at the opening .
tom cruise could attend up to 10,000 guests are expected to attend the official opening of the new center on this coming saturday .
they could even include celebrity members of the organization , such as hollywood actors tom cruise and john travolta .
the scientologists say they have more than 1,000 members in the city .
other reports put the figure somewhere between 150 and 200 . the modern building in the central district of charlottenburg includes a church , an information center and a bookshop and replaces much smaller premises in another part of the city . the scientologists have confirmed that the building will be their german headquarters .
this would be their fourth center in a european capital after madrid , london and brussels . scientology is viewed with mistrust by many who say the organization pursues commercial interests and makes it difficult for its members to leave .
it has been accused of working like a sect by making people psychologically dependent and then exploiting them financially .
these accusations have repeatedly been rejected by the group itself , who say they suffer religious persecution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the organization founded by l. ron hubbard continues to provoke mistrust anti-democratic ? scientology was set up by l. ron hubbard in 1954 in the united states .
the organization 's official web site describes its aims as seeking " only evolution to higher states of being for the individual and for society . " but the german interior ministry is critical of the organization , which has an estimated 30,000 members in the country .
the latest report released by the extremist monitoring office said there were indications that scientology was aiming to achieve " a society without general and egalitarian elections . " the report also said that the writings of the organization 's founder contained " passages that defamed the principles of the free democratic order and which called for its abolition in favor of the building of a new civilization .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 09.01.2007 opinion : " german judiciary has little reason for complacency " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german court has sentenced a friend of the sept .
11 hijackers to 15 years in prison .
dw 's peter philipp says that , despite the weaknesses of the motassadeq case , the amount of evidence was overwhelming . now that the 32-year-old moroccan mounir el motassadeq was handed for the second time a sentence of 15 years in prison , the german judiciary could pride itself about passing a legally valid verdict on an accomplice of the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 . the case itself , however , does not offer much cause for complacency .
the proceedings went through various twists and turns over a period of four years : the first 15-year sentence was suspended due to procedural errors , whereas the second sentence - 7 years in prison - was eventually deemed too lenient .
now , a 15-year-sentence was passed again . motassadeq 's lawyer has spoken of arbitrariness .
at first glance , these sentences may , indeed , appear arbitrary .
it is more to the point , however , what the german supreme court said during the process : the fight against terrorism should not be a " wild and unregulated war . "
that is why germany 's judiciary had such difficulties with motassadeq 's sentencing and why this verdict so blatantly contradicts the acquittal of another moroccan , abdelghani mzoudi . both defendants belonged to the inner circle of the hamburg students who were behind the attacks of sept .
11 .
both were accused of collaborating or , at least knowing about the planned terrorist attacks and doing nothing to prevent them .
a third moroccan from the perpetrators ' circle - ramzi binalshibh - could have shed light on what roles the two had actually played .
but he is in custody in the united states and not available to the german judiciary . washington was anything but cooperative , supposedly for security reasons .
for all intents and purposes , however , the us position on this matter is baffling in view of its proclaimed cooperation in the war on terror .
it is also surprising because the us actually contributed to mzoudi 's acquittal in 2004 : they faxed an exculpatory transcript of binalshibh 's interrogation to the german authorities .
motassadeq did not get this kind of help . the value of such statements is dubious : no representative of the german judiciary was present when they were made and nothing is known about the circumstances under which they originated .
interrogation methods at guantanamo are in any case incompatible with german laws and statements attained using such methods would not be accepted by german courts . at the same time and despite the recognizable weaknesses of the motassadeq case , the burden of evidence was overwhelming and it made the verdict compelling : the young man belonged to the terrorists ' innermost circle ; he helped them with money transactions and other things .
that 's why it can be justly assumed that he knew at least in general terms that a terrorist attack was being prepared .
the line between tacit assent and complicity is crossed all too easily .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 09.01.2007 opinion : " german judiciary has little reason for complacency " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german court has sentenced a friend of the sept .
11 hijackers to 15 years in prison .
dw 's peter philipp says that , despite the weaknesses of the motassadeq case , the amount of evidence was overwhelming . now that the 32-year-old moroccan mounir el motassadeq was handed for the second time a sentence of 15 years in prison , the german judiciary could pride itself about passing a legally valid verdict on an accomplice of the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 . the case itself , however , does not offer much cause for complacency .
the proceedings went through various twists and turns over a period of four years : the first 15-year sentence was suspended due to procedural errors , whereas the second sentence - 7 years in prison - was eventually deemed too lenient .
now , a 15-year-sentence was passed again . motassadeq 's lawyer has spoken of arbitrariness .
at first glance , these sentences may , indeed , appear arbitrary .
it is more to the point , however , what the german supreme court said during the process : the fight against terrorism should not be a " wild and unregulated war . "
that is why germany 's judiciary had such difficulties with motassadeq 's sentencing and why this verdict so blatantly contradicts the acquittal of another moroccan , abdelghani mzoudi . both defendants belonged to the inner circle of the hamburg students who were behind the attacks of sept .
11 .
both were accused of collaborating or , at least knowing about the planned terrorist attacks and doing nothing to prevent them .
a third moroccan from the perpetrators ' circle - ramzi binalshibh - could have shed light on what roles the two had actually played .
but he is in custody in the united states and not available to the german judiciary . washington was anything but cooperative , supposedly for security reasons .
for all intents and purposes , however , the us position on this matter is baffling in view of its proclaimed cooperation in the war on terror .
it is also surprising because the us actually contributed to mzoudi 's acquittal in 2004 : they faxed an exculpatory transcript of binalshibh 's interrogation to the german authorities .
motassadeq did not get this kind of help . the value of such statements is dubious : no representative of the german judiciary was present when they were made and nothing is known about the circumstances under which they originated .
interrogation methods at guantanamo are in any case incompatible with german laws and statements attained using such methods would not be accepted by german courts . at the same time and despite the recognizable weaknesses of the motassadeq case , the burden of evidence was overwhelming and it made the verdict compelling : the young man belonged to the terrorists ' innermost circle ; he helped them with money transactions and other things .
that 's why it can be justly assumed that he knew at least in general terms that a terrorist attack was being prepared .
the line between tacit assent and complicity is crossed all too easily .

a new scientology headquarters in berlin has prompted calls for city authorities to put the organization under surveillance .
but berlin 's interior minister says the issue should be dealt with in the open . the opening of a large modern scientology center in the german capital berlin is causing political waves in the city with members of the local christian democratic party calling for the organization to be once again placed under surveillance .
but berlin 's interior minister , ehrhart körting , says that the issue should be dealt with openly . körting told a local radio station that it had to be made public what kind of ideology was behind scientology and what awaited potential members . the social democratic politician also said a court ruling prevented the berlin office for the protection of the constitution , which tracks extremist groups , from monitoring the activities of the center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are estimated to be some 30,000 scientologists in germany the state of berlin is the only one in germany where the scientologists are not under surveillance .
in 2001 and 2003 judges in the city decided there was insufficient evidence of any unconstitutional ambitions and banned the state from any further monitoring . but the state interior minister indicated this could change . " if new activities gave rise to fresh evidence , then we would look into this and discuss it with the federal authorities , " körting said . the cdu and the free democrats are calling for a change of the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us actor tom cruise is one of the famous scientologists who could be among the guests at the opening .
tom cruise could attend up to 10,000 guests are expected to attend the official opening of the new center on this coming saturday .
they could even include celebrity members of the organization , such as hollywood actors tom cruise and john travolta .
the scientologists say they have more than 1,000 members in the city .
other reports put the figure somewhere between 150 and 200 . the modern building in the central district of charlottenburg includes a church , an information center and a bookshop and replaces much smaller premises in another part of the city . the scientologists have confirmed that the building will be their german headquarters .
this would be their fourth center in a european capital after madrid , london and brussels . scientology is viewed with mistrust by many who say the organization pursues commercial interests and makes it difficult for its members to leave .
it has been accused of working like a sect by making people psychologically dependent and then exploiting them financially .
these accusations have repeatedly been rejected by the group itself , who say they suffer religious persecution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the organization founded by l. ron hubbard continues to provoke mistrust anti-democratic ? scientology was set up by l. ron hubbard in 1954 in the united states .
the organization 's official web site describes its aims as seeking " only evolution to higher states of being for the individual and for society . " but the german interior ministry is critical of the organization , which has an estimated 30,000 members in the country .
the latest report released by the extremist monitoring office said there were indications that scientology was aiming to achieve " a society without general and egalitarian elections . " the report also said that the writings of the organization 's founder contained " passages that defamed the principles of the free democratic order and which called for its abolition in favor of the building of a new civilization .

a new scientology headquarters in berlin has prompted calls for city authorities to put the organization under surveillance .
but berlin 's interior minister says the issue should be dealt with in the open . the opening of a large modern scientology center in the german capital berlin is causing political waves in the city with members of the local christian democratic party calling for the organization to be once again placed under surveillance .
but berlin 's interior minister , ehrhart körting , says that the issue should be dealt with openly . körting told a local radio station that it had to be made public what kind of ideology was behind scientology and what awaited potential members . the social democratic politician also said a court ruling prevented the berlin office for the protection of the constitution , which tracks extremist groups , from monitoring the activities of the center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are estimated to be some 30,000 scientologists in germany the state of berlin is the only one in germany where the scientologists are not under surveillance .
in 2001 and 2003 judges in the city decided there was insufficient evidence of any unconstitutional ambitions and banned the state from any further monitoring . but the state interior minister indicated this could change . " if new activities gave rise to fresh evidence , then we would look into this and discuss it with the federal authorities , " körting said . the cdu and the free democrats are calling for a change of the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us actor tom cruise is one of the famous scientologists who could be among the guests at the opening .
tom cruise could attend up to 10,000 guests are expected to attend the official opening of the new center on this coming saturday .

director dani levy 's " mein führer : the truly truest truth about adolf hitler " tests the limits . a new film comedy about hitler is starting in german cinemas this week .
" mein führer : the truly truest truth about adolf hitler " has unleashed a storm of media interest . more than 60 years after charlie chaplin 's " the great dictator " appeared in cinemas , this is the first humorous film production about the nazi leader to be made in germany .
the question everyone is asking is whether it is actually acceptable to laugh about hitler and the nazis - especially if you are german . in the film , hitler is a physical wreck who has been psychologically damaged by his authoritarian upbringing and is an impotent , bed-wetting , whimpering drug addict .
he plays with a toy battleship in his bath and trains his beloved german shepherd dog blondi , dressed in a mini ss uniform , to perform the nazi salute . an absurd figure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crimes of the nazis make laughing about hitler out of bounds for many germans " the figure of adolf hitler was a pathetic figure and also pitiable and ridiculous , " said levy .
" just like nazism as a whole .
if you think that a whole nation used to shout ' heil hitler , ' that is cabaret of the most profound kind . " levy , however , also said he realizes the crimes of the nazi regime could make laughing at his film 's satire difficult for some . " it would have been funny and people would have been able to laugh about the whole thing over the last few years if the nazis had not done what they did , " he said .
" if this endless destruction , the biggest crime against humanity that there has ever been , had not happened . " " mein führer " is set in the final weeks of 1944 when germany was clearly losing the war and shows hitler on the verge of a nervous breakdown while propaganda minister joseph goebbels decides to appoint a linguistic coach to help the dictator prepare to give a morale-boosting speech to the people . a jewish actor , the fictional adolf grünbaum , is released from a concentration camp to do the job and puts hitler through a series of exercises .
most of the film 's humor arises during these training sessions - for example the slapstick scene when the dictator gets knocked out during a boxing match or ends up crawling around on the floor barking like a dog . close to the bone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film downfall also portrayed hitler in a ' human " manner but there are also a number of exaggerated , part comic , part demonic performances from the coterie of figures who surround hitler , such as goebbels and ss-leader heinrich himmler , hitler 's architect albert speer and mistress eva braun .
some of the comedy goes pretty close to the bone , for example when goebbels tells grünbaum that he should not take the final solution personally . in recent years in germany there has been a controversial move away from a simple deionization of the figure of hitler .
the director of the taboo-busting oscar-nominated 2004 film " downfall " created an intentionally human portrayal of hitler , reaping criticism along the way . counting on germans ' sense of humor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : levy is entering new territory in germany with this comedy dani levy , swiss-born jewish director , has also said his film aims to remove the figure of hitler from its pedestal .
his film , too , has already received both brickbats and bouquets .
but it adopts a very different approach from the serious " downfall . "
levy said he is confident that the comedy will be successful . " i 'm trusting that the germans have more humor than they are credited with - otherwise i would be lost as a jewish filmmaker with a jewish comedy about hitler , " he said .
" i think that , as is frequently the case at this time , that there is a feeling under the surface that there is a need to laugh about things that up to now had been exclusively consigned to seriousness .

director dani levy 's " mein führer : the truly truest truth about adolf hitler " tests the limits . a new film comedy about hitler is starting in german cinemas this week .
" mein führer : the truly truest truth about adolf hitler " has unleashed a storm of media interest . more than 60 years after charlie chaplin 's " the great dictator " appeared in cinemas , this is the first humorous film production about the nazi leader to be made in germany .
the question everyone is asking is whether it is actually acceptable to laugh about hitler and the nazis - especially if you are german . in the film , hitler is a physical wreck who has been psychologically damaged by his authoritarian upbringing and is an impotent , bed-wetting , whimpering drug addict .
he plays with a toy battleship in his bath and trains his beloved german shepherd dog blondi , dressed in a mini ss uniform , to perform the nazi salute . an absurd figure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crimes of the nazis make laughing about hitler out of bounds for many germans " the figure of adolf hitler was a pathetic figure and also pitiable and ridiculous , " said levy .
" just like nazism as a whole .
if you think that a whole nation used to shout ' heil hitler , ' that is cabaret of the most profound kind . " levy , however , also said he realizes the crimes of the nazi regime could make laughing at his film 's satire difficult for some . " it would have been funny and people would have been able to laugh about the whole thing over the last few years if the nazis had not done what they did , " he said .
" if this endless destruction , the biggest crime against humanity that there has ever been , had not happened . " " mein führer " is set in the final weeks of 1944 when germany was clearly losing the war and shows hitler on the verge of a nervous breakdown while propaganda minister joseph goebbels decides to appoint a linguistic coach to help the dictator prepare to give a morale-boosting speech to the people . a jewish actor , the fictional adolf grünbaum , is released from a concentration camp to do the job and puts hitler through a series of exercises .
most of the film 's humor arises during these training sessions - for example the slapstick scene when the dictator gets knocked out during a boxing match or ends up crawling around on the floor barking like a dog . close to the bone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film downfall also portrayed hitler in a ' human " manner but there are also a number of exaggerated , part comic , part demonic performances from the coterie of figures who surround hitler , such as goebbels and ss-leader heinrich himmler , hitler 's architect albert speer and mistress eva braun .
some of the comedy goes pretty close to the bone , for example when goebbels tells grünbaum that he should not take the final solution personally . in recent years in germany there has been a controversial move away from a simple deionization of the figure of hitler .
the director of the taboo-busting oscar-nominated 2004 film " downfall " created an intentionally human portrayal of hitler , reaping criticism along the way . counting on germans ' sense of humor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : levy is entering new territory in germany with this comedy dani levy , swiss-born jewish director , has also said his film aims to remove the figure of hitler from its pedestal .
his film , too , has already received both brickbats and bouquets .
but it adopts a very different approach from the serious " downfall . "
levy said he is confident that the comedy will be successful . " i 'm trusting that the germans have more humor than they are credited with - otherwise i would be lost as a jewish filmmaker with a jewish comedy about hitler , " he said .
" i think that , as is frequently the case at this time , that there is a feeling under the surface that there is a need to laugh about things that up to now had been exclusively consigned to seriousness .

" we must think about the consequences of shutting down nuclear power plants , " merkel said on tuesday in an interview with germany 's public broadcaster ard . the gradual shutdown of all germany 's nuclear power plants was agreed upon in 2000 by the government of former social democratic chancellor gerhard schröder and his coalition partners at the time , the greens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said she is against the eu getting too much energy from one source according to merkel , however , the latest incident regarding the transit of russian oil supplies through belarus demonstrated " that we need a comprehensive , balanced energy mix in germany . " merkel did not directly criticize moscow but said berlin would engage in " intensive discussions " about the energy issue . " i will travel to moscow on jan .
21 and will discuss this issue with the russian president , " merkel added . the german chancellor , who is presiding over germany 's six-month eu presidency , said berlin would play a key role in eu talks with moscow regarding a new partnership and co-operation agreement with russia . a divided coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear energy is a contested topic in germany merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their coalition partners , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , have been divided over nuclear power .
while conservatives near merkel have repeatedly demanded that germany slash a scheduled nuclear energy phase-out , the spd remains in favor of the plan to close nuclear power plants . " those who use oil shortages in order to propagate nuclear energy are not capable of intellectually comprehending the topic of energy supplies , " said ulrich kelber , deputy president of the spd parliamentary bloc . members of the opposition greens also protested the idea of making changes to the planned nuclear phase-out . " with uranium , you can neither heat your homes nor fuel your cars , " said green politician jürgen trittin . belarus ready to negotiate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian oil exports to europe via neighboring belarus were halted on monday meanwhile , a delegation headed by belarus ' deputy prime minister , andrei kobyakov , joined other officials , including deputy economic development minister vladimir naidunov , who arrived in moscow late monday , the belarus embassy told the afp news agency . belarus says it is ready to negotiate over a demand that russia pay $ 45 dollars -lrb- 35.50 euros -rrb- per ton transit fees on oil sent through its territory to eu countries .
moscow has refused to pay and on monday supplies to germany , poland and slovakia were interrupted . russian officials have not yet confirmed they are ready to negotiate and insist that the transit tax is illegal . belarus has long maintained close ties with its giant eastern neighbor russia .
the two countries have officially been building a " union state , " and moscow has seen belarus as a buffer against the expansion of the nato military alliance . strained relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they wanted a political union , but now they have a trade war : putin -lrb- left -rrb- and lukashenko but recently relations have become strained , particularly since moscow decided to double the price it charges belarus for natural gas from the start of this year . russia also introduced a tariff on oil exports to belarus , which refined the cheap oil and sold it to western countries .
in retaliation , belarus imposed the oil transit tax . the russian newspaper gazeta voiced sympathy for belarusian president alexander lukashenko , saying that the introduction of the oil transit fee was a " symmetrical " step in response to " severe political pressure " from moscow . the paper noted however that lukashenko lacked the western backing given to another russian neighbor , ukraine , during an energy dispute last year , and said , " it would be better for everyone if the war finished " on wednesday , when , belarusian prime minister sergei sidorsky is due in moscow . germany 's reliance on russian energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is becoming increasingly involved in energy disputes with its neigbors the druzhba pipeline supplies about 20 percent of germany 's annual oil imports , or 23.4 million tons in 2005 , according to the german oil industry federation -lrb- mwv -rrb- . russia has reduced the amount of oil it transits through western neighbors belarus and the baltic states , preferring to send oil via a new terminal near saint petersburg as well as around the coast of norway - in spite of less favorable climatic conditions . meanwhile on monday the energy-rich state of azerbaijan said it had stopped exporting oil to southern russia due to a natural gas price dispute with the russian gas giant gazprom . mukhtar babayev , an official with azerbaijan 's state oil firm socar , said azerbaijan was using oil previously exported to russia - about 4.2 million tons in 2006 - to fuel power stations that could no longer run on russian natural gas following a breakdown in the pricing talks . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hit as russia halts oil exports to belarus russia has halted oil exports passing through belarus , threatening wider disruptions in europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 09.01.2007 opinion : " german judiciary has little reason for complacency " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german court has sentenced a friend of the sept .
11 hijackers to 15 years in prison .
dw 's peter philipp says that , despite the weaknesses of the motassadeq case , the amount of evidence was overwhelming . now that the 32-year-old moroccan mounir el motassadeq was handed for the second time a sentence of 15 years in prison , the german judiciary could pride itself about passing a legally valid verdict on an accomplice of the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 . the case itself , however , does not offer much cause for complacency .
the proceedings went through various twists and turns over a period of four years : the first 15-year sentence was suspended due to procedural errors , whereas the second sentence - 7 years in prison - was eventually deemed too lenient .
now , a 15-year-sentence was passed again . motassadeq 's lawyer has spoken of arbitrariness .
at first glance , these sentences may , indeed , appear arbitrary .
it is more to the point , however , what the german supreme court said during the process : the fight against terrorism should not be a " wild and unregulated war . "
that is why germany 's judiciary had such difficulties with motassadeq 's sentencing and why this verdict so blatantly contradicts the acquittal of another moroccan , abdelghani mzoudi . both defendants belonged to the inner circle of the hamburg students who were behind the attacks of sept .
11 .
both were accused of collaborating or , at least knowing about the planned terrorist attacks and doing nothing to prevent them .
a third moroccan from the perpetrators ' circle - ramzi binalshibh - could have shed light on what roles the two had actually played .
but he is in custody in the united states and not available to the german judiciary . washington was anything but cooperative , supposedly for security reasons .
for all intents and purposes , however , the us position on this matter is baffling in view of its proclaimed cooperation in the war on terror .
it is also surprising because the us actually contributed to mzoudi 's acquittal in 2004 : they faxed an exculpatory transcript of binalshibh 's interrogation to the german authorities .
motassadeq did not get this kind of help . the value of such statements is dubious : no representative of the german judiciary was present when they were made and nothing is known about the circumstances under which they originated .
interrogation methods at guantanamo are in any case incompatible with german laws and statements attained using such methods would not be accepted by german courts . at the same time and despite the recognizable weaknesses of the motassadeq case , the burden of evidence was overwhelming and it made the verdict compelling : the young man belonged to the terrorists ' innermost circle ; he helped them with money transactions and other things .
that 's why it can be justly assumed that he knew at least in general terms that a terrorist attack was being prepared .
the line between tacit assent and complicity is crossed all too easily .

" we both recognize that the best way to help impoverished nations is to complete this doha round and to encourage the spread of wealth and opportunity through open and reasonable and fair trade , " bush said , referring to the capital of qatar , which hosted the first round of the world trade organization negotiations in 2001 . barroso emphasized the need to move quickly on reaching deal and said he and bush ordered their negotiators to reach a " solution as soon as possible . "
barroso appeared upbeat after meeting with bush for about an hour , saying the two sides had realized action had to be taken . " we are really at defining moment , " barroso said . the ill-starred pact , which seeks to make it easier for developing countries to export products to richer nations like the united states and those in europe , was launched in 2001 but has repeatedly stalled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doha , qatar - where the trade talk began agriculture has been a main sticking point for the agreement and despite monday 's positive talk , there is still deep-seated discord over farm subsidies .
us subsidies now top $ 20 billion -lrb- 15.3 billion euros -rrb- a year , which displeases the europeans . however , subsidy reform is a sensitive proposition for american farmers .
they say they want to see tariffs fall in europe as well as in key developing countries like india and brazil . breakthrough still possible the current dispute led to a suspension in july of the talks .
earlier monday , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said in berlin that he believes there is still a chance of a breakthrough . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world trade organization , director general pascal lamy " despite all the difficulties , we have embarked on a path that makes an agreement appear possible , " steinmeier said after talks with the director general of the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , pascal lamy . steinmeier said germany would use its role as current eu president to work for a resumption of the talks . " we need to take advantage of the window of opportunity in the weeks ahead in order to make concrete progress that could lead to a breakthrough , " the foreign minister added . european trade commissioner peter mandelson was quoted monday as saying the doha round was on the brink of failure and will only succeed with bush 's support . during barroso 's washington visit , he and bush also discussed the israel-palestinian conflict , iran , syria , iraq and the ethnic conflict in sudan 's darfur region . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mandelson seeks new eu and us effort to unlock wto talks eu trade commissioner peter mandelson called on saturday for a " new political commitment " between europe and the united states to revive the stalled doha round of world trade talks .
-lrb- 06.01.2007 -rrb- failure of doha talks disappoints germans germans have blamed the us for not budging on subsidy cuts and are apprehensive about what monday 's fruitless doha talks will mean for poorer nations and german commerce .
-lrb- 26.07.2006 -rrb- eu says wto talks going backwards global trade talks are going in the wrong direction , the european union warned friday , as it continued to exchange barbs with the united states amid fears that the wto meeting could unravel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 09.01.2007 merkel puts germany 's nuclear phase-out in question großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel believes that germany needs to diversify its energy resources as senior belarusian officials arrived in moscow tuesday for crisis talks with russia regarding disrupted oil transit through belarus , german chancellor merkel stressed the need for diversifying energy resources . " we must think about the consequences of shutting down nuclear power plants , " merkel said on tuesday in an interview with germany 's public broadcaster ard . the gradual shutdown of all germany 's nuclear power plants was agreed upon in 2000 by the government of former social democratic chancellor gerhard schröder and his coalition partners at the time , the greens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said she is against the eu getting too much energy from one source according to merkel , however , the latest incident regarding the transit of russian oil supplies through belarus demonstrated " that we need a comprehensive , balanced energy mix in germany . " merkel did not directly criticize moscow but said berlin would engage in " intensive discussions " about the energy issue . " i will travel to moscow on jan .
21 and will discuss this issue with the russian president , " merkel added . the german chancellor , who is presiding over germany 's six-month eu presidency , said berlin would play a key role in eu talks with moscow regarding a new partnership and co-operation agreement with russia . a divided coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear energy is a contested topic in germany merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their coalition partners , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , have been divided over nuclear power .
while conservatives near merkel have repeatedly demanded that germany slash a scheduled nuclear energy phase-out , the spd remains in favor of the plan to close nuclear power plants . " those who use oil shortages in order to propagate nuclear energy are not capable of intellectually comprehending the topic of energy supplies , " said ulrich kelber , deputy president of the spd parliamentary bloc . members of the opposition greens also protested the idea of making changes to the planned nuclear phase-out . " with uranium , you can neither heat your homes nor fuel your cars , " said green politician jürgen trittin . belarus ready to negotiate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian oil exports to europe via neighboring belarus were halted on monday meanwhile , a delegation headed by belarus ' deputy prime minister , andrei kobyakov , joined other officials , including deputy economic development minister vladimir naidunov , who arrived in moscow late monday , the belarus embassy told the afp news agency . belarus says it is ready to negotiate over a demand that russia pay $ 45 dollars -lrb- 35.50 euros -rrb- per ton transit fees on oil sent through its territory to eu countries .
moscow has refused to pay and on monday supplies to germany , poland and slovakia were interrupted . russian officials have not yet confirmed they are ready to negotiate and insist that the transit tax is illegal . belarus has long maintained close ties with its giant eastern neighbor russia .
the two countries have officially been building a " union state , " and moscow has seen belarus as a buffer against the expansion of the nato military alliance . strained relations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they wanted a political union , but now they have a trade war : putin -lrb- left -rrb- and lukashenko but recently relations have become strained , particularly since moscow decided to double the price it charges belarus for natural gas from the start of this year . russia also introduced a tariff on oil exports to belarus , which refined the cheap oil and sold it to western countries .
in retaliation , belarus imposed the oil transit tax . the russian newspaper gazeta voiced sympathy for belarusian president alexander lukashenko , saying that the introduction of the oil transit fee was a " symmetrical " step in response to " severe political pressure " from moscow . the paper noted however that lukashenko lacked the western backing given to another russian neighbor , ukraine , during an energy dispute last year , and said , " it would be better for everyone if the war finished " on wednesday , when , belarusian prime minister sergei sidorsky is due in moscow . germany 's reliance on russian energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is becoming increasingly involved in energy disputes with its neigbors the druzhba pipeline supplies about 20 percent of germany 's annual oil imports , or 23.4 million tons in 2005 , according to the german oil industry federation -lrb- mwv -rrb- . russia has reduced the amount of oil it transits through western neighbors belarus and the baltic states , preferring to send oil via a new terminal near saint petersburg as well as around the coast of norway - in spite of less favorable climatic conditions . meanwhile on monday the energy-rich state of azerbaijan said it had stopped exporting oil to southern russia due to a natural gas price dispute with the russian gas giant gazprom . mukhtar babayev , an official with azerbaijan 's state oil firm socar , said azerbaijan was using oil previously exported to russia - about 4.2 million tons in 2006 - to fuel power stations that could no longer run on russian natural gas following a breakdown in the pricing talks . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hit as russia halts oil exports to belarus russia has halted oil exports passing through belarus , threatening wider disruptions in europe .

director dani levy 's " mein führer : the truly truest truth about adolf hitler " tests the limits . a new film comedy about hitler is starting in german cinemas this week .
" mein führer : the truly truest truth about adolf hitler " has unleashed a storm of media interest . more than 60 years after charlie chaplin 's " the great dictator " appeared in cinemas , this is the first humorous film production about the nazi leader to be made in germany .
the question everyone is asking is whether it is actually acceptable to laugh about hitler and the nazis - especially if you are german . in the film , hitler is a physical wreck who has been psychologically damaged by his authoritarian upbringing and is an impotent , bed-wetting , whimpering drug addict .
he plays with a toy battleship in his bath and trains his beloved german shepherd dog blondi , dressed in a mini ss uniform , to perform the nazi salute . an absurd figure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crimes of the nazis make laughing about hitler out of bounds for many germans " the figure of adolf hitler was a pathetic figure and also pitiable and ridiculous , " said levy .
" just like nazism as a whole .
if you think that a whole nation used to shout ' heil hitler , ' that is cabaret of the most profound kind . " levy , however , also said he realizes the crimes of the nazi regime could make laughing at his film 's satire difficult for some . " it would have been funny and people would have been able to laugh about the whole thing over the last few years if the nazis had not done what they did , " he said .
" if this endless destruction , the biggest crime against humanity that there has ever been , had not happened . " " mein führer " is set in the final weeks of 1944 when germany was clearly losing the war and shows hitler on the verge of a nervous breakdown while propaganda minister joseph goebbels decides to appoint a linguistic coach to help the dictator prepare to give a morale-boosting speech to the people . a jewish actor , the fictional adolf grünbaum , is released from a concentration camp to do the job and puts hitler through a series of exercises .
most of the film 's humor arises during these training sessions - for example the slapstick scene when the dictator gets knocked out during a boxing match or ends up crawling around on the floor barking like a dog . close to the bone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film downfall also portrayed hitler in a ' human " manner but there are also a number of exaggerated , part comic , part demonic performances from the coterie of figures who surround hitler , such as goebbels and ss-leader heinrich himmler , hitler 's architect albert speer and mistress eva braun .
some of the comedy goes pretty close to the bone , for example when goebbels tells grünbaum that he should not take the final solution personally . in recent years in germany there has been a controversial move away from a simple deionization of the figure of hitler .
the director of the taboo-busting oscar-nominated 2004 film " downfall " created an intentionally human portrayal of hitler , reaping criticism along the way . counting on germans ' sense of humor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : levy is entering new territory in germany with this comedy dani levy , swiss-born jewish director , has also said his film aims to remove the figure of hitler from its pedestal .
his film , too , has already received both brickbats and bouquets .
but it adopts a very different approach from the serious " downfall . "
levy said he is confident that the comedy will be successful . " i 'm trusting that the germans have more humor than they are credited with - otherwise i would be lost as a jewish filmmaker with a jewish comedy about hitler , " he said .
" i think that , as is frequently the case at this time , that there is a feeling under the surface that there is a need to laugh about things that up to now had been exclusively consigned to seriousness .

director dani levy 's " mein führer : the truly truest truth about adolf hitler " tests the limits . a new film comedy about hitler is starting in german cinemas this week .
" mein führer : the truly truest truth about adolf hitler " has unleashed a storm of media interest . more than 60 years after charlie chaplin 's " the great dictator " appeared in cinemas , this is the first humorous film production about the nazi leader to be made in germany .
the question everyone is asking is whether it is actually acceptable to laugh about hitler and the nazis - especially if you are german . in the film , hitler is a physical wreck who has been psychologically damaged by his authoritarian upbringing and is an impotent , bed-wetting , whimpering drug addict .
he plays with a toy battleship in his bath and trains his beloved german shepherd dog blondi , dressed in a mini ss uniform , to perform the nazi salute . an absurd figure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crimes of the nazis make laughing about hitler out of bounds for many germans " the figure of adolf hitler was a pathetic figure and also pitiable and ridiculous , " said levy .
" just like nazism as a whole .
if you think that a whole nation used to shout ' heil hitler , ' that is cabaret of the most profound kind . " levy , however , also said he realizes the crimes of the nazi regime could make laughing at his film 's satire difficult for some . " it would have been funny and people would have been able to laugh about the whole thing over the last few years if the nazis had not done what they did , " he said .
" if this endless destruction , the biggest crime against humanity that there has ever been , had not happened . " " mein führer " is set in the final weeks of 1944 when germany was clearly losing the war and shows hitler on the verge of a nervous breakdown while propaganda minister joseph goebbels decides to appoint a linguistic coach to help the dictator prepare to give a morale-boosting speech to the people . a jewish actor , the fictional adolf grünbaum , is released from a concentration camp to do the job and puts hitler through a series of exercises .
most of the film 's humor arises during these training sessions - for example the slapstick scene when the dictator gets knocked out during a boxing match or ends up crawling around on the floor barking like a dog . close to the bone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film downfall also portrayed hitler in a ' human " manner but there are also a number of exaggerated , part comic , part demonic performances from the coterie of figures who surround hitler , such as goebbels and ss-leader heinrich himmler , hitler 's architect albert speer and mistress eva braun .
some of the comedy goes pretty close to the bone , for example when goebbels tells grünbaum that he should not take the final solution personally . in recent years in germany there has been a controversial move away from a simple deionization of the figure of hitler .
the director of the taboo-busting oscar-nominated 2004 film " downfall " created an intentionally human portrayal of hitler , reaping criticism along the way . counting on germans ' sense of humor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : levy is entering new territory in germany with this comedy dani levy , swiss-born jewish director , has also said his film aims to remove the figure of hitler from its pedestal .
his film , too , has already received both brickbats and bouquets .
but it adopts a very different approach from the serious " downfall . "
levy said he is confident that the comedy will be successful . " i 'm trusting that the germans have more humor than they are credited with - otherwise i would be lost as a jewish filmmaker with a jewish comedy about hitler , " he said .
" i think that , as is frequently the case at this time , that there is a feeling under the surface that there is a need to laugh about things that up to now had been exclusively consigned to seriousness .

most of the film 's humor arises during these training sessions - for example the slapstick scene when the dictator gets knocked out during a boxing match or ends up crawling around on the floor barking like a dog . close to the bone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film downfall also portrayed hitler in a ' human " manner but there are also a number of exaggerated , part comic , part demonic performances from the coterie of figures who surround hitler , such as goebbels and ss-leader heinrich himmler , hitler 's architect albert speer and mistress eva braun .
some of the comedy goes pretty close to the bone , for example when goebbels tells grünbaum that he should not take the final solution personally . in recent years in germany there has been a controversial move away from a simple deionization of the figure of hitler .
the director of the taboo-busting oscar-nominated 2004 film " downfall " created an intentionally human portrayal of hitler , reaping criticism along the way . counting on germans ' sense of humor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : levy is entering new territory in germany with this comedy dani levy , swiss-born jewish director , has also said his film aims to remove the figure of hitler from its pedestal .
his film , too , has already received both brickbats and bouquets .
but it adopts a very different approach from the serious " downfall . "
levy said he is confident that the comedy will be successful . " i 'm trusting that the germans have more humor than they are credited with - otherwise i would be lost as a jewish filmmaker with a jewish comedy about hitler , " he said .
" i think that , as is frequently the case at this time , that there is a feeling under the surface that there is a need to laugh about things that up to now had been exclusively consigned to seriousness .

a new scientology headquarters in berlin has prompted calls for city authorities to put the organization under surveillance .
but berlin 's interior minister says the issue should be dealt with in the open . the opening of a large modern scientology center in the german capital berlin is causing political waves in the city with members of the local christian democratic party calling for the organization to be once again placed under surveillance .
but berlin 's interior minister , ehrhart körting , says that the issue should be dealt with openly . körting told a local radio station that it had to be made public what kind of ideology was behind scientology and what awaited potential members . the social democratic politician also said a court ruling prevented the berlin office for the protection of the constitution , which tracks extremist groups , from monitoring the activities of the center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are estimated to be some 30,000 scientologists in germany the state of berlin is the only one in germany where the scientologists are not under surveillance .
in 2001 and 2003 judges in the city decided there was insufficient evidence of any unconstitutional ambitions and banned the state from any further monitoring . but the state interior minister indicated this could change . " if new activities gave rise to fresh evidence , then we would look into this and discuss it with the federal authorities , " körting said . the cdu and the free democrats are calling for a change of the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us actor tom cruise is one of the famous scientologists who could be among the guests at the opening .

this would be their fourth center in a european capital after madrid , london and brussels . scientology is viewed with mistrust by many who say the organization pursues commercial interests and makes it difficult for its members to leave .

the organization 's official web site describes its aims as seeking " only evolution to higher states of being for the individual and for society . " but the german interior ministry is critical of the organization , which has an estimated 30,000 members in the country .
the latest report released by the extremist monitoring office said there were indications that scientology was aiming to achieve " a society without general and egalitarian elections .

a new scientology headquarters in berlin has prompted calls for city authorities to put the organization under surveillance .
but berlin 's interior minister says the issue should be dealt with in the open . the opening of a large modern scientology center in the german capital berlin is causing political waves in the city with members of the local christian democratic party calling for the organization to be once again placed under surveillance .
but berlin 's interior minister , ehrhart körting , says that the issue should be dealt with openly . körting told a local radio station that it had to be made public what kind of ideology was behind scientology and what awaited potential members . the social democratic politician also said a court ruling prevented the berlin office for the protection of the constitution , which tracks extremist groups , from monitoring the activities of the center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are estimated to be some 30,000 scientologists in germany the state of berlin is the only one in germany where the scientologists are not under surveillance .
in 2001 and 2003 judges in the city decided there was insufficient evidence of any unconstitutional ambitions and banned the state from any further monitoring . but the state interior minister indicated this could change . " if new activities gave rise to fresh evidence , then we would look into this and discuss it with the federal authorities , " körting said . the cdu and the free democrats are calling for a change of the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us actor tom cruise is one of the famous scientologists who could be among the guests at the opening .
tom cruise could attend up to 10,000 guests are expected to attend the official opening of the new center on this coming saturday .
they could even include celebrity members of the organization , such as hollywood actors tom cruise and john travolta .
the scientologists say they have more than 1,000 members in the city .
other reports put the figure somewhere between 150 and 200 . the modern building in the central district of charlottenburg includes a church , an information center and a bookshop and replaces much smaller premises in another part of the city . the scientologists have confirmed that the building will be their german headquarters .
this would be their fourth center in a european capital after madrid , london and brussels . scientology is viewed with mistrust by many who say the organization pursues commercial interests and makes it difficult for its members to leave .
it has been accused of working like a sect by making people psychologically dependent and then exploiting them financially .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 09.01.2007 opinion : " german judiciary has little reason for complacency " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german court has sentenced a friend of the sept .
11 hijackers to 15 years in prison .
dw 's peter philipp says that , despite the weaknesses of the motassadeq case , the amount of evidence was overwhelming . now that the 32-year-old moroccan mounir el motassadeq was handed for the second time a sentence of 15 years in prison , the german judiciary could pride itself about passing a legally valid verdict on an accomplice of the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 . the case itself , however , does not offer much cause for complacency .
the proceedings went through various twists and turns over a period of four years : the first 15-year sentence was suspended due to procedural errors , whereas the second sentence - 7 years in prison - was eventually deemed too lenient .
now , a 15-year-sentence was passed again . motassadeq 's lawyer has spoken of arbitrariness .
at first glance , these sentences may , indeed , appear arbitrary .
it is more to the point , however , what the german supreme court said during the process : the fight against terrorism should not be a " wild and unregulated war . "
that is why germany 's judiciary had such difficulties with motassadeq 's sentencing and why this verdict so blatantly contradicts the acquittal of another moroccan , abdelghani mzoudi . both defendants belonged to the inner circle of the hamburg students who were behind the attacks of sept .
11 .
both were accused of collaborating or , at least knowing about the planned terrorist attacks and doing nothing to prevent them .
a third moroccan from the perpetrators ' circle - ramzi binalshibh - could have shed light on what roles the two had actually played .
but he is in custody in the united states and not available to the german judiciary . washington was anything but cooperative , supposedly for security reasons .
for all intents and purposes , however , the us position on this matter is baffling in view of its proclaimed cooperation in the war on terror .
it is also surprising because the us actually contributed to mzoudi 's acquittal in 2004 : they faxed an exculpatory transcript of binalshibh 's interrogation to the german authorities .
motassadeq did not get this kind of help . the value of such statements is dubious : no representative of the german judiciary was present when they were made and nothing is known about the circumstances under which they originated .

11 hijackers to 15 years in prison .
dw 's peter philipp says that , despite the weaknesses of the motassadeq case , the amount of evidence was overwhelming . now that the 32-year-old moroccan mounir el motassadeq was handed for the second time a sentence of 15 years in prison , the german judiciary could pride itself about passing a legally valid verdict on an accomplice of the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 . the case itself , however , does not offer much cause for complacency .
the proceedings went through various twists and turns over a period of four years : the first 15-year sentence was suspended due to procedural errors , whereas the second sentence - 7 years in prison - was eventually deemed too lenient .
now , a 15-year-sentence was passed again . motassadeq 's lawyer has spoken of arbitrariness .
at first glance , these sentences may , indeed , appear arbitrary .
it is more to the point , however , what the german supreme court said during the process : the fight against terrorism should not be a " wild and unregulated war . "
that is why germany 's judiciary had such difficulties with motassadeq 's sentencing and why this verdict so blatantly contradicts the acquittal of another moroccan , abdelghani mzoudi . both defendants belonged to the inner circle of the hamburg students who were behind the attacks of sept .
11 .
both were accused of collaborating or , at least knowing about the planned terrorist attacks and doing nothing to prevent them .
a third moroccan from the perpetrators ' circle - ramzi binalshibh - could have shed light on what roles the two had actually played .
but he is in custody in the united states and not available to the german judiciary . washington was anything but cooperative , supposedly for security reasons .
for all intents and purposes , however , the us position on this matter is baffling in view of its proclaimed cooperation in the war on terror .
it is also surprising because the us actually contributed to mzoudi 's acquittal in 2004 : they faxed an exculpatory transcript of binalshibh 's interrogation to the german authorities .
motassadeq did not get this kind of help . the value of such statements is dubious : no representative of the german judiciary was present when they were made and nothing is known about the circumstances under which they originated .
interrogation methods at guantanamo are in any case incompatible with german laws and statements attained using such methods would not be accepted by german courts . at the same time and despite the recognizable weaknesses of the motassadeq case , the burden of evidence was overwhelming and it made the verdict compelling : the young man belonged to the terrorists ' innermost circle ; he helped them with money transactions and other things .

11 hijackers to 15 years in prison .
dw 's peter philipp says that , despite the weaknesses of the motassadeq case , the amount of evidence was overwhelming . now that the 32-year-old moroccan mounir el motassadeq was handed for the second time a sentence of 15 years in prison , the german judiciary could pride itself about passing a legally valid verdict on an accomplice of the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 . the case itself , however , does not offer much cause for complacency .
the proceedings went through various twists and turns over a period of four years : the first 15-year sentence was suspended due to procedural errors , whereas the second sentence - 7 years in prison - was eventually deemed too lenient .
now , a 15-year-sentence was passed again . motassadeq 's lawyer has spoken of arbitrariness .
at first glance , these sentences may , indeed , appear arbitrary .
it is more to the point , however , what the german supreme court said during the process : the fight against terrorism should not be a " wild and unregulated war . "
that is why germany 's judiciary had such difficulties with motassadeq 's sentencing and why this verdict so blatantly contradicts the acquittal of another moroccan , abdelghani mzoudi . both defendants belonged to the inner circle of the hamburg students who were behind the attacks of sept .
11 .
both were accused of collaborating or , at least knowing about the planned terrorist attacks and doing nothing to prevent them .
a third moroccan from the perpetrators ' circle - ramzi binalshibh - could have shed light on what roles the two had actually played .
but he is in custody in the united states and not available to the german judiciary . washington was anything but cooperative , supposedly for security reasons .
for all intents and purposes , however , the us position on this matter is baffling in view of its proclaimed cooperation in the war on terror .
it is also surprising because the us actually contributed to mzoudi 's acquittal in 2004 : they faxed an exculpatory transcript of binalshibh 's interrogation to the german authorities .
motassadeq did not get this kind of help . the value of such statements is dubious : no representative of the german judiciary was present when they were made and nothing is known about the circumstances under which they originated .
interrogation methods at guantanamo are in any case incompatible with german laws and statements attained using such methods would not be accepted by german courts . at the same time and despite the recognizable weaknesses of the motassadeq case , the burden of evidence was overwhelming and it made the verdict compelling : the young man belonged to the terrorists ' innermost circle ; he helped them with money transactions and other things .
that 's why it can be justly assumed that he knew at least in general terms that a terrorist attack was being prepared .
the line between tacit assent and complicity is crossed all too easily .

her comments come a day before the eu unveils its official energy strategy . german chancellor angela merkel appeared to take a dim view of russia on tuesday following its suspension of oil deliveries through the druzhba pipeline in belarus which hit supplies in germany and poland . merkel said the move destroyed confidence in russia as an energy supplier . " it is not acceptable when there are no consultations about such moves , " merkel told reporters after meeting with european commission president jose manuel barroso in berlin . " that repeatedly destroys confidence and you can not build cooperation based on true mutual trust in this way , " she said . the german cabinet and members of the european commission on tuesday met in berlin to debate issues related to securing europe ’ s energy supply .
the meeting had been planned with a view to coordinating activities within the current german presidency of the 27-member bloc , but took on added urgency because of the ongoing spat between moscow and minsk , which on monday led to the disruption of gas supplies to poland and germany . barroso : " unacceptable " move barroso too criticized russia for its role in the oil crisis and urged moscow and minsk to find a quick solution to their dispute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil tanks of the druzhba pipeline in the southeastern belarusian city of mozyr " it is unacceptable for either supplier or transit countries to take measures that impact on partner countries without consultation , " barroso said .
" it once again demonstrates that we need a common energy policy . " russian president vladimir putin said tuesday that western consumers must be shielded from the effects of an oil transit row with belarus that has hit supplies to the eu . putin told government ministers it was " necessary to continue negotiations with our belarusian partners " and to " do everything to secure the interests of western consumers . " however , he said that it might be necessary to cut russian oil production due to the shutdown of the druzhba pipeline through belarus in a tariff dispute .
the pipeline accounts for a third of russia 's total oil exports . negotiations to restart supplies showed no sign of making headway in moscow . merkel urges energy diversity merkel said the current row over oil supplies between russia and belarus made it abundantly clear that the 27-nation bloc needed to drastically reduce its dependence on russian energy sources . russian oil and gas supplies currently make up about one third of all energy imports in germany , and there ’ s a growing sense of unease over the kremlin ’ s potential ability to use western energy dependence as a sharp political weapon . " we ’ re in agreement with the european commission that every member country will be given the same amount of assistance and solidarity when it comes to energy supply problems , " merkel said .
" but the current crisis also shows that in order to become more independent , we first have to redouble our own efforts to achieve higher energy efficiency and arrive at a more competitive energy market . " merkel said that europe needed to draw its energy from a varied mix of sources with particular emphasis on renewable energy in order to improve efficiency . earlier , merkel also indicated in an interview that she may rethink germany 's long-planned nuclear phase-out plan which foresees shutting down all the country 's nuclear plants by 2020 . eu energy plan already controversial the european commission has long been seeking instruments to secure energy safety and decrease the eu ’ s dependence on gas and oil .
in a new policy strategy to be unveiled on wednesday , the european commission will call for " a new industrial revolution " in the energy sector to boost competition , protect the climate and ensure security of supply . the policy blueprint however is likely to cause controversy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's promotion of nuclear energy in its draft policy remains controversial according to media reports , the eu 's new energy policy will call for building " cleaner " coal plants .
it will also promote the use of nuclear energy as an alternative to fossil fuels because of the lower greenhouse emissions generated by nuclear plants .
the draft policy will however stress that it is up to national governments to decide whether to produce nuclear energy . critics in germany , particularly those from the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- who are against extending the lifespan for nuclear plants , have already panned the eu 's draft policy on energy . " it belongs in the dustbin , " hans-josef fell , spd spokesman on energy affairs told news agency ap . in addition , the draft policy 's recommendations for boosting competition in the energy sector are also under fire from germany and france .

her comments come a day before the eu unveils its official energy strategy . german chancellor angela merkel appeared to take a dim view of russia on tuesday following its suspension of oil deliveries through the druzhba pipeline in belarus which hit supplies in germany and poland . merkel said the move destroyed confidence in russia as an energy supplier .

" that repeatedly destroys confidence and you can not build cooperation based on true mutual trust in this way , " she said . the german cabinet and members of the european commission on tuesday met in berlin to debate issues related to securing europe ’ s energy supply .
the meeting had been planned with a view to coordinating activities within the current german presidency of the 27-member bloc , but took on added urgency because of the ongoing spat between moscow and minsk , which on monday led to the disruption of gas supplies to poland and germany . barroso : " unacceptable " move barroso too criticized russia for its role in the oil crisis and urged moscow and minsk to find a quick solution to their dispute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil tanks of the druzhba pipeline in the southeastern belarusian city of mozyr " it is unacceptable for either supplier or transit countries to take measures that impact on partner countries without consultation , " barroso said .

the youngest ones here are just three months old .
björn czinczoll 's childcare centre in the industrial area of the bavarian city of regensburg is open from seven am to seven pm .
children can come here on an hourly basis for as long as their parents need .
czinczoll 's concept offers the flexibility that state childcare centres ca n't provide .
the 34 year old is a qualified lawyer , but instead of sitting in an office he builds kindergardens for a living : " i wanted to do something positive , something useful for children .
this rewards you daily .
i have no regretts – not for a single moment .
i like being in the kindergardens .
i really like being surrounded by so many children . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's already worked out his next project .
all he has to do now is to convince the board members at the regensburg university clinic .
the hospital needs a daycare centre for the children of its employees and björn czinczoll is prepared to set it up .
he finances his projects with state subsidies and contributions from the parents .
he approaches companies for donations , and takes care of all the red tape and deals with the local authorities : " if a hospital that does n't know anything about child care approaches the city council it is easy to turn it down .
we are different. we know what we want , we are more obstinate and we get what we want .
sure they do n't turn me down .
we just keep on insisting .
balancing work and family is an important issue these days and we want to make that possible – for the parents , the employees and the employers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction work at this site has already started .
still czinczoll needs nerves of steel .
the numerous regulations makes building kindergardens a tiresome business .
suddenly he gets a call about the university clinic .
things are looking good .
but progress on the building site is being hampered by red tape .
the first children are scheduled to move in by august , if everything goes according to plan : " we live in germany and that means progress is very slow .
sometimes we start planning two years in advance before the children can finally move in .
especially with new buildings because so many different authorities are involved and unfortunately communication between them is so poor . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this kindergarden in a villa in munich has just recently opened .
czinczoll 's latest facility is open 13 hours a day six days a week .
a co-operative provided the house at low cost to create kindergarden placements .
one-year-old mena will soon be coming here quite often .
her mum pays 4 euros an hour , but if she stays for longer periods the hourly rate decreases .
menas mother : this facility is certainly a great help .
i work a lot from home but that was n't easy .
looking after a child is really a full time job .
i do n't think i could have carried on working without this kindergarden . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : björn czinczoll already runs a total of 6 kindergardens .
he plans to open another 11 next year .
demand is huge , and czinczoll has dicovered a niche market : " if child care is organised properly to suit their needs then you see that a lot of parents think about having a second or third child .
they no longer have to choose between a career or a family because they can have both . "
so is he creating a small scale baby boom ?
björn czinczoll : " a small one , perhaps .
but that 's the way it should be .
the current problem is that germany 's population is growing older and there are n't enough children .
so we are doing what we can to rectify that . "

czinczoll creates modern kindergartens that stay open 12 hours a day .
and he chooses sites that are close to many workplaces . czinczoll sees himself as a service provider who works closely with companies .
the companies spend nothing on the kindergartens , but donated space and furniture is welcome .
parents pay by the hour ; but the longer the child is in the kindergarten , the lower the hourly rate .
long opening hours mean the kindergartens get plenty of use .
and that is important to czinczoll .
an attorney in his mid-30s , he is convinced : " even in kindergartens , you need an economics-oriented person at the top . "
and the project 's success proves he is right .

björn czinczoll 's childcare centre in the industrial area of the bavarian city of regensburg is open from seven am to seven pm .
children can come here on an hourly basis for as long as their parents need .
czinczoll 's concept offers the flexibility that state childcare centres ca n't provide .
the 34 year old is a qualified lawyer , but instead of sitting in an office he builds kindergardens for a living : " i wanted to do something positive , something useful for children .
this rewards you daily .
i have no regretts – not for a single moment .
i like being in the kindergardens .
i really like being surrounded by so many children . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's already worked out his next project .
all he has to do now is to convince the board members at the regensburg university clinic .
the hospital needs a daycare centre for the children of its employees and björn czinczoll is prepared to set it up .
he finances his projects with state subsidies and contributions from the parents .
he approaches companies for donations , and takes care of all the red tape and deals with the local authorities : " if a hospital that does n't know anything about child care approaches the city council it is easy to turn it down .
we are different. we know what we want , we are more obstinate and we get what we want .

we just keep on insisting .
balancing work and family is an important issue these days and we want to make that possible – for the parents , the employees and the employers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction work at this site has already started .

but progress on the building site is being hampered by red tape .
the first children are scheduled to move in by august , if everything goes according to plan : " we live in germany and that means progress is very slow .
sometimes we start planning two years in advance before the children can finally move in .

" we must think about the consequences of shutting down nuclear power plants , " merkel said on tuesday in an interview with germany 's public broadcaster ard . the gradual shutdown of all germany 's nuclear power plants was agreed upon in 2000 by the government of former social democratic chancellor gerhard schröder and his coalition partners at the time , the greens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said she is against the eu getting too much energy from one source according to merkel , however , the latest incident regarding the transit of russian oil supplies through belarus demonstrated " that we need a comprehensive , balanced energy mix in germany . " merkel did not directly criticize moscow but said berlin would engage in " intensive discussions " about the energy issue . " i will travel to moscow on jan .
21 and will discuss this issue with the russian president , " merkel added . the german chancellor , who is presiding over germany 's six-month eu presidency , said berlin would play a key role in eu talks with moscow regarding a new partnership and co-operation agreement with russia . a divided coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear energy is a contested topic in germany merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their coalition partners , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , have been divided over nuclear power .
while conservatives near merkel have repeatedly demanded that germany slash a scheduled nuclear energy phase-out , the spd remains in favor of the plan to close nuclear power plants . " those who use oil shortages in order to propagate nuclear energy are not capable of intellectually comprehending the topic of energy supplies , " said ulrich kelber , deputy president of the spd parliamentary bloc . members of the opposition greens also protested the idea of making changes to the planned nuclear phase-out . " with uranium , you can neither heat your homes nor fuel your cars , " said green politician jürgen trittin . belarus ready to negotiate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian oil exports to europe via neighboring belarus were halted on monday meanwhile , a delegation headed by belarus ' deputy prime minister , andrei kobyakov , joined other officials , including deputy economic development minister vladimir naidunov , who arrived in moscow late monday , the belarus embassy told the afp news agency . belarus says it is ready to negotiate over a demand that russia pay $ 45 dollars -lrb- 35.50 euros -rrb- per ton transit fees on oil sent through its territory to eu countries .

" we both recognize that the best way to help impoverished nations is to complete this doha round and to encourage the spread of wealth and opportunity through open and reasonable and fair trade , " bush said , referring to the capital of qatar , which hosted the first round of the world trade organization negotiations in 2001 . barroso emphasized the need to move quickly on reaching deal and said he and bush ordered their negotiators to reach a " solution as soon as possible .

" we need to take advantage of the window of opportunity in the weeks ahead in order to make concrete progress that could lead to a breakthrough , " the foreign minister added . european trade commissioner peter mandelson was quoted monday as saying the doha round was on the brink of failure and will only succeed with bush 's support . during barroso 's washington visit , he and bush also discussed the israel-palestinian conflict , iran , syria , iraq and the ethnic conflict in sudan 's darfur region . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mandelson seeks new eu and us effort to unlock wto talks eu trade commissioner peter mandelson called on saturday for a " new political commitment " between europe and the united states to revive the stalled doha round of world trade talks .

meanwhile , a parallel exhibit in hanover is planning to draw documenta visitors up north . on monday , tillers began tearing out large sections of grass in the downtown kassel 's french garden .
it was n't just ordinary park maintenance - workers were ripping off the top soil in the name of modern art . five months before the june 16 start of documenta , organizers have begun creating the expo location .
since it kicked off in 1955 , kassel has hosted all 11 previous documenta modern art exhibits , which are now held every five years . by the end of april , a 12,000 square-meter -lrb- 129,000 square-foot -rrb- glass building should be in place , where about three-quarters of the documenta exhibition pieces will be housed .
shortly after the 100-day event , the structure will be torn down , the grass replanted , allowing kassel 's downtown to return to normal . sponsors still needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as documenta 's artistic director , roger buergel is busy recruiting sponsors but the tight timeframe is not the only concern documenta 's artistic director roger buergel has to worry about .
financing for the short-lived building is also not yet secure , though he added that he has no doubts the exhibit will take place . " documenta will take place no matter what , " buergel said .
" even if only the asphalt surface is there , then we 'll show the exhibit on that . " nevertheless , the director is optimistic about finding sponsors to cover the cost of the glass exhibition hall , estimated to cost three million euros . sponsors , marketing and ticket sales will have to cover the building 's costs and provide half of the exhibit 's 19 million euro budget .
public funds will cover the other half of the budget but can not be spent on construction . competition in the art arena buergel will also have to contend with a number of concurrent major art highlight in germany this summer that will also be vying for visitors . three museums in hanover , for example , plan to profit from the influx of art-lovers with a project called " made in germany . "
the show , scheduled from may 25 to aug .
26 , will feature works by 50 young artists from germany , who have yet to make names for themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bodys isek kingelez showed " new manhattan city " at documenta in 2002 " we do n't want to pit ourselves against documenta and we do n't want to be a new documenta , " said beate anspach , spokesperson for the " made in germany " exhibit .
" our goal is to reach the international art scene . " similar to documenta , " made in germany " organizers are planning an exhibition catalogue in both german and english in order to cater to international guests and to make " germany 's artistic landscape more accessible , " said veit görner , director of the kestner society , one of the three participating hanover museums . while around 650,000 visitors are expected to attend documenta , " made in germany " is hoping to draw 35,000 to 40,000 art enthusiasts to hanover . dw staff -lrb- mas / kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german art experts meet for restitution round-table in berlin german culture officials vowed to step up research to settle jewish restitution claims for dozens of valuable artworks , sold under duress in the nazi era , at crisis talks monday in berlin .

czinczoll creates modern kindergartens that stay open 12 hours a day .
and he chooses sites that are close to many workplaces . czinczoll sees himself as a service provider who works closely with companies .
the companies spend nothing on the kindergartens , but donated space and furniture is welcome .
parents pay by the hour ; but the longer the child is in the kindergarten , the lower the hourly rate .
long opening hours mean the kindergartens get plenty of use .
and that is important to czinczoll .
an attorney in his mid-30s , he is convinced : " even in kindergartens , you need an economics-oriented person at the top . "
and the project 's success proves he is right .
his current six day-care centers will see at least 11 sister centers open next year .
demand from companies and parents is huge . - bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new toys have finally arrived , and björn czinczoll is delighted to see it .
a car park with lots of gadgets .
the youngest ones here are just three months old .
björn czinczoll 's childcare centre in the industrial area of the bavarian city of regensburg is open from seven am to seven pm .
children can come here on an hourly basis for as long as their parents need .
czinczoll 's concept offers the flexibility that state childcare centres ca n't provide .
the 34 year old is a qualified lawyer , but instead of sitting in an office he builds kindergardens for a living : " i wanted to do something positive , something useful for children .
this rewards you daily .
i have no regretts – not for a single moment .
i like being in the kindergardens .
i really like being surrounded by so many children . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's already worked out his next project .
all he has to do now is to convince the board members at the regensburg university clinic .
the hospital needs a daycare centre for the children of its employees and björn czinczoll is prepared to set it up .
he finances his projects with state subsidies and contributions from the parents .
he approaches companies for donations , and takes care of all the red tape and deals with the local authorities : " if a hospital that does n't know anything about child care approaches the city council it is easy to turn it down .
we are different. we know what we want , we are more obstinate and we get what we want .
sure they do n't turn me down .
we just keep on insisting .
balancing work and family is an important issue these days and we want to make that possible – for the parents , the employees and the employers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction work at this site has already started .
still czinczoll needs nerves of steel .
the numerous regulations makes building kindergardens a tiresome business .
suddenly he gets a call about the university clinic .
things are looking good .
but progress on the building site is being hampered by red tape .
the first children are scheduled to move in by august , if everything goes according to plan : " we live in germany and that means progress is very slow .
sometimes we start planning two years in advance before the children can finally move in .
especially with new buildings because so many different authorities are involved and unfortunately communication between them is so poor . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this kindergarden in a villa in munich has just recently opened .
czinczoll 's latest facility is open 13 hours a day six days a week .
a co-operative provided the house at low cost to create kindergarden placements .
one-year-old mena will soon be coming here quite often .
her mum pays 4 euros an hour , but if she stays for longer periods the hourly rate decreases .
menas mother : this facility is certainly a great help .
i work a lot from home but that was n't easy .
looking after a child is really a full time job .
i do n't think i could have carried on working without this kindergarden . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : björn czinczoll already runs a total of 6 kindergardens .
he plans to open another 11 next year .
demand is huge , and czinczoll has dicovered a niche market : " if child care is organised properly to suit their needs then you see that a lot of parents think about having a second or third child .
they no longer have to choose between a career or a family because they can have both . "
so is he creating a small scale baby boom ?
björn czinczoll : " a small one , perhaps .
but that 's the way it should be .
the current problem is that germany 's population is growing older and there are n't enough children .
so we are doing what we can to rectify that . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : björn czinczoll does n't have children of his own , by the way – he says he does n't have the time - but of course it 's always possible that that might one day change . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic the report as video on demand www-links www.kinderzentren.de -lrb- in german -rrb- www.schwabfound.org feedback send us an e-mail .

sure they do n't turn me down .
we just keep on insisting .
balancing work and family is an important issue these days and we want to make that possible – for the parents , the employees and the employers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction work at this site has already started .
still czinczoll needs nerves of steel .
the numerous regulations makes building kindergardens a tiresome business .
suddenly he gets a call about the university clinic .
things are looking good .
but progress on the building site is being hampered by red tape .
the first children are scheduled to move in by august , if everything goes according to plan : " we live in germany and that means progress is very slow .
sometimes we start planning two years in advance before the children can finally move in .
especially with new buildings because so many different authorities are involved and unfortunately communication between them is so poor . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this kindergarden in a villa in munich has just recently opened .
czinczoll 's latest facility is open 13 hours a day six days a week .
a co-operative provided the house at low cost to create kindergarden placements .
one-year-old mena will soon be coming here quite often .
her mum pays 4 euros an hour , but if she stays for longer periods the hourly rate decreases .
menas mother : this facility is certainly a great help .
i work a lot from home but that was n't easy .
looking after a child is really a full time job .
i do n't think i could have carried on working without this kindergarden . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : björn czinczoll already runs a total of 6 kindergardens .
he plans to open another 11 next year .
demand is huge , and czinczoll has dicovered a niche market : " if child care is organised properly to suit their needs then you see that a lot of parents think about having a second or third child .
they no longer have to choose between a career or a family because they can have both . "
so is he creating a small scale baby boom ?
björn czinczoll : " a small one , perhaps .
but that 's the way it should be .
the current problem is that germany 's population is growing older and there are n't enough children .
so we are doing what we can to rectify that . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : björn czinczoll does n't have children of his own , by the way – he says he does n't have the time - but of course it 's always possible that that might one day change . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic the report as video on demand www-links www.kinderzentren.de -lrb- in german -rrb- www.schwabfound.org feedback send us an e-mail .

her comments come a day before the eu unveils its official energy strategy . german chancellor angela merkel appeared to take a dim view of russia on tuesday following its suspension of oil deliveries through the druzhba pipeline in belarus which hit supplies in germany and poland . merkel said the move destroyed confidence in russia as an energy supplier . " it is not acceptable when there are no consultations about such moves , " merkel told reporters after meeting with european commission president jose manuel barroso in berlin . " that repeatedly destroys confidence and you can not build cooperation based on true mutual trust in this way , " she said . the german cabinet and members of the european commission on tuesday met in berlin to debate issues related to securing europe ’ s energy supply .
the meeting had been planned with a view to coordinating activities within the current german presidency of the 27-member bloc , but took on added urgency because of the ongoing spat between moscow and minsk , which on monday led to the disruption of gas supplies to poland and germany . barroso : " unacceptable " move barroso too criticized russia for its role in the oil crisis and urged moscow and minsk to find a quick solution to their dispute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil tanks of the druzhba pipeline in the southeastern belarusian city of mozyr " it is unacceptable for either supplier or transit countries to take measures that impact on partner countries without consultation , " barroso said .

" however , he said that it might be necessary to cut russian oil production due to the shutdown of the druzhba pipeline through belarus in a tariff dispute .
the pipeline accounts for a third of russia 's total oil exports . negotiations to restart supplies showed no sign of making headway in moscow . merkel urges energy diversity merkel said the current row over oil supplies between russia and belarus made it abundantly clear that the 27-nation bloc needed to drastically reduce its dependence on russian energy sources . russian oil and gas supplies currently make up about one third of all energy imports in germany , and there ’ s a growing sense of unease over the kremlin ’ s potential ability to use western energy dependence as a sharp political weapon . " we ’ re in agreement with the european commission that every member country will be given the same amount of assistance and solidarity when it comes to energy supply problems , " merkel said .
" but the current crisis also shows that in order to become more independent , we first have to redouble our own efforts to achieve higher energy efficiency and arrive at a more competitive energy market . " merkel said that europe needed to draw its energy from a varied mix of sources with particular emphasis on renewable energy in order to improve efficiency . earlier , merkel also indicated in an interview that she may rethink germany 's long-planned nuclear phase-out plan which foresees shutting down all the country 's nuclear plants by 2020 . eu energy plan already controversial the european commission has long been seeking instruments to secure energy safety and decrease the eu ’ s dependence on gas and oil .
in a new policy strategy to be unveiled on wednesday , the european commission will call for " a new industrial revolution " in the energy sector to boost competition , protect the climate and ensure security of supply . the policy blueprint however is likely to cause controversy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's promotion of nuclear energy in its draft policy remains controversial according to media reports , the eu 's new energy policy will call for building " cleaner " coal plants .
it will also promote the use of nuclear energy as an alternative to fossil fuels because of the lower greenhouse emissions generated by nuclear plants .
the draft policy will however stress that it is up to national governments to decide whether to produce nuclear energy . critics in germany , particularly those from the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- who are against extending the lifespan for nuclear plants , have already panned the eu 's draft policy on energy .

director dani levy 's " mein führer : the truly truest truth about adolf hitler " tests the limits . a new film comedy about hitler is starting in german cinemas this week .
" mein führer : the truly truest truth about adolf hitler " has unleashed a storm of media interest . more than 60 years after charlie chaplin 's " the great dictator " appeared in cinemas , this is the first humorous film production about the nazi leader to be made in germany .
the question everyone is asking is whether it is actually acceptable to laugh about hitler and the nazis - especially if you are german . in the film , hitler is a physical wreck who has been psychologically damaged by his authoritarian upbringing and is an impotent , bed-wetting , whimpering drug addict .
he plays with a toy battleship in his bath and trains his beloved german shepherd dog blondi , dressed in a mini ss uniform , to perform the nazi salute . an absurd figure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crimes of the nazis make laughing about hitler out of bounds for many germans " the figure of adolf hitler was a pathetic figure and also pitiable and ridiculous , " said levy .
" just like nazism as a whole .
if you think that a whole nation used to shout ' heil hitler , ' that is cabaret of the most profound kind . " levy , however , also said he realizes the crimes of the nazi regime could make laughing at his film 's satire difficult for some . " it would have been funny and people would have been able to laugh about the whole thing over the last few years if the nazis had not done what they did , " he said .
" if this endless destruction , the biggest crime against humanity that there has ever been , had not happened . " " mein führer " is set in the final weeks of 1944 when germany was clearly losing the war and shows hitler on the verge of a nervous breakdown while propaganda minister joseph goebbels decides to appoint a linguistic coach to help the dictator prepare to give a morale-boosting speech to the people . a jewish actor , the fictional adolf grünbaum , is released from a concentration camp to do the job and puts hitler through a series of exercises .
most of the film 's humor arises during these training sessions - for example the slapstick scene when the dictator gets knocked out during a boxing match or ends up crawling around on the floor barking like a dog . close to the bone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film downfall also portrayed hitler in a ' human " manner but there are also a number of exaggerated , part comic , part demonic performances from the coterie of figures who surround hitler , such as goebbels and ss-leader heinrich himmler , hitler 's architect albert speer and mistress eva braun .
some of the comedy goes pretty close to the bone , for example when goebbels tells grünbaum that he should not take the final solution personally . in recent years in germany there has been a controversial move away from a simple deionization of the figure of hitler .
the director of the taboo-busting oscar-nominated 2004 film " downfall " created an intentionally human portrayal of hitler , reaping criticism along the way . counting on germans ' sense of humor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : levy is entering new territory in germany with this comedy dani levy , swiss-born jewish director , has also said his film aims to remove the figure of hitler from its pedestal .
his film , too , has already received both brickbats and bouquets .
but it adopts a very different approach from the serious " downfall . "
levy said he is confident that the comedy will be successful . " i 'm trusting that the germans have more humor than they are credited with - otherwise i would be lost as a jewish filmmaker with a jewish comedy about hitler , " he said .
" i think that , as is frequently the case at this time , that there is a feeling under the surface that there is a need to laugh about things that up to now had been exclusively consigned to seriousness .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 09.01.2007 russia faces angry eu in energy dispute großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both merkel and barroso gave russia a poor report card on tuesday german chancellor merkel said tuesday that disruption of oil supplies to europe was destroying confidence in moscow .
her comments come a day before the eu unveils its official energy strategy . german chancellor angela merkel appeared to take a dim view of russia on tuesday following its suspension of oil deliveries through the druzhba pipeline in belarus which hit supplies in germany and poland . merkel said the move destroyed confidence in russia as an energy supplier . " it is not acceptable when there are no consultations about such moves , " merkel told reporters after meeting with european commission president jose manuel barroso in berlin . " that repeatedly destroys confidence and you can not build cooperation based on true mutual trust in this way , " she said . the german cabinet and members of the european commission on tuesday met in berlin to debate issues related to securing europe ’ s energy supply .
the meeting had been planned with a view to coordinating activities within the current german presidency of the 27-member bloc , but took on added urgency because of the ongoing spat between moscow and minsk , which on monday led to the disruption of gas supplies to poland and germany . barroso : " unacceptable " move barroso too criticized russia for its role in the oil crisis and urged moscow and minsk to find a quick solution to their dispute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil tanks of the druzhba pipeline in the southeastern belarusian city of mozyr " it is unacceptable for either supplier or transit countries to take measures that impact on partner countries without consultation , " barroso said .
" it once again demonstrates that we need a common energy policy . " russian president vladimir putin said tuesday that western consumers must be shielded from the effects of an oil transit row with belarus that has hit supplies to the eu . putin told government ministers it was " necessary to continue negotiations with our belarusian partners " and to " do everything to secure the interests of western consumers . " however , he said that it might be necessary to cut russian oil production due to the shutdown of the druzhba pipeline through belarus in a tariff dispute .
the pipeline accounts for a third of russia 's total oil exports . negotiations to restart supplies showed no sign of making headway in moscow . merkel urges energy diversity merkel said the current row over oil supplies between russia and belarus made it abundantly clear that the 27-nation bloc needed to drastically reduce its dependence on russian energy sources . russian oil and gas supplies currently make up about one third of all energy imports in germany , and there ’ s a growing sense of unease over the kremlin ’ s potential ability to use western energy dependence as a sharp political weapon . " we ’ re in agreement with the european commission that every member country will be given the same amount of assistance and solidarity when it comes to energy supply problems , " merkel said .
" but the current crisis also shows that in order to become more independent , we first have to redouble our own efforts to achieve higher energy efficiency and arrive at a more competitive energy market . " merkel said that europe needed to draw its energy from a varied mix of sources with particular emphasis on renewable energy in order to improve efficiency . earlier , merkel also indicated in an interview that she may rethink germany 's long-planned nuclear phase-out plan which foresees shutting down all the country 's nuclear plants by 2020 . eu energy plan already controversial the european commission has long been seeking instruments to secure energy safety and decrease the eu ’ s dependence on gas and oil .
in a new policy strategy to be unveiled on wednesday , the european commission will call for " a new industrial revolution " in the energy sector to boost competition , protect the climate and ensure security of supply . the policy blueprint however is likely to cause controversy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's promotion of nuclear energy in its draft policy remains controversial according to media reports , the eu 's new energy policy will call for building " cleaner " coal plants .
it will also promote the use of nuclear energy as an alternative to fossil fuels because of the lower greenhouse emissions generated by nuclear plants .
the draft policy will however stress that it is up to national governments to decide whether to produce nuclear energy . critics in germany , particularly those from the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- who are against extending the lifespan for nuclear plants , have already panned the eu 's draft policy on energy . " it belongs in the dustbin , " hans-josef fell , spd spokesman on energy affairs told news agency ap . in addition , the draft policy 's recommendations for boosting competition in the energy sector are also under fire from germany and france .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 09.01.2007 hitler comedy breaks german taboos großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler appears as an absurd and pathetic figure in levy 's film is it really all right for germans to laugh about hitler and nazi germany ?
director dani levy 's " mein führer : the truly truest truth about adolf hitler " tests the limits . a new film comedy about hitler is starting in german cinemas this week .
" mein führer : the truly truest truth about adolf hitler " has unleashed a storm of media interest . more than 60 years after charlie chaplin 's " the great dictator " appeared in cinemas , this is the first humorous film production about the nazi leader to be made in germany .
the question everyone is asking is whether it is actually acceptable to laugh about hitler and the nazis - especially if you are german . in the film , hitler is a physical wreck who has been psychologically damaged by his authoritarian upbringing and is an impotent , bed-wetting , whimpering drug addict .
he plays with a toy battleship in his bath and trains his beloved german shepherd dog blondi , dressed in a mini ss uniform , to perform the nazi salute . an absurd figure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crimes of the nazis make laughing about hitler out of bounds for many germans " the figure of adolf hitler was a pathetic figure and also pitiable and ridiculous , " said levy .
" just like nazism as a whole .
if you think that a whole nation used to shout ' heil hitler , ' that is cabaret of the most profound kind . " levy , however , also said he realizes the crimes of the nazi regime could make laughing at his film 's satire difficult for some . " it would have been funny and people would have been able to laugh about the whole thing over the last few years if the nazis had not done what they did , " he said .
" if this endless destruction , the biggest crime against humanity that there has ever been , had not happened . " " mein führer " is set in the final weeks of 1944 when germany was clearly losing the war and shows hitler on the verge of a nervous breakdown while propaganda minister joseph goebbels decides to appoint a linguistic coach to help the dictator prepare to give a morale-boosting speech to the people . a jewish actor , the fictional adolf grünbaum , is released from a concentration camp to do the job and puts hitler through a series of exercises .
most of the film 's humor arises during these training sessions - for example the slapstick scene when the dictator gets knocked out during a boxing match or ends up crawling around on the floor barking like a dog . close to the bone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film downfall also portrayed hitler in a ' human " manner but there are also a number of exaggerated , part comic , part demonic performances from the coterie of figures who surround hitler , such as goebbels and ss-leader heinrich himmler , hitler 's architect albert speer and mistress eva braun .
some of the comedy goes pretty close to the bone , for example when goebbels tells grünbaum that he should not take the final solution personally . in recent years in germany there has been a controversial move away from a simple deionization of the figure of hitler .
the director of the taboo-busting oscar-nominated 2004 film " downfall " created an intentionally human portrayal of hitler , reaping criticism along the way . counting on germans ' sense of humor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : levy is entering new territory in germany with this comedy dani levy , swiss-born jewish director , has also said his film aims to remove the figure of hitler from its pedestal .
his film , too , has already received both brickbats and bouquets .
but it adopts a very different approach from the serious " downfall . "
levy said he is confident that the comedy will be successful . " i 'm trusting that the germans have more humor than they are credited with - otherwise i would be lost as a jewish filmmaker with a jewish comedy about hitler , " he said .
" i think that , as is frequently the case at this time , that there is a feeling under the surface that there is a need to laugh about things that up to now had been exclusively consigned to seriousness .

i 'm burning , " friends who accompanied her told the newspaper . she then fell into a coma but it took another 38 minutes before she was pronounced dead , the paper reported . dignitas declined to discuss the allegations on monday . " we have no comment on any reports by the tamedia house in zurich , " dignitas head ludwig minelli told the afp news agency in an email .
tamedia publishes the sonntagszeitung . another german client of the organization , a stroke victim identified as peter a. , spent three days in a coma before dying in august 2004 after taking a fatal dose of medication , the sonntagszeitung reported .
this contrasted with the quick and dignified death that dignitas promises , the paper added . liberal swiss law a spokeswoman for the zurich canton prosecutor 's office said it was too early to say whether a probe would be launched into the reported incidents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an assisted suicide in italy has sparked controversy in a speech to britain 's liberal democrat party in september 2006 , 74-year-old lawyer minelli said that since its creation in may 1998 , dignitas had " helped 619 members to end their lives without any complication . " " we help our members to make a risk and pain-free suicide , " he said . swiss law on assisted suicide is amongst the most liberal in the world .
it authorizes passive assistance for suicide , allowing a doctor to supply a terminally ill person with a fatal dose of a drug , although the patient must take the dose without the doctor 's help . it is illegal in switzerland to actively help someone to die , such as by administering an injection . dignitas attracts terminally ill patients from all over europe as laws in most eu member states are either ambiguous on assisted suicide or outlaws it as a last resort for long-suffering people . in 2005 , the organization sparked opposition from many german politicians and church leaders when it opened an office in the german city of hanover . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de serial-killer nurse gets life for 28 deaths the " angel of death , " as he has been dubbed in the press , will spend the rest of his life behind bars for killing 28 patients at the hospital where he worked as a nurse , a district court decided monday .

i 'm burning , " friends who accompanied her told the newspaper . she then fell into a coma but it took another 38 minutes before she was pronounced dead , the paper reported . dignitas declined to discuss the allegations on monday . " we have no comment on any reports by the tamedia house in zurich , " dignitas head ludwig minelli told the afp news agency in an email .
tamedia publishes the sonntagszeitung . another german client of the organization , a stroke victim identified as peter a. , spent three days in a coma before dying in august 2004 after taking a fatal dose of medication , the sonntagszeitung reported .
this contrasted with the quick and dignified death that dignitas promises , the paper added . liberal swiss law a spokeswoman for the zurich canton prosecutor 's office said it was too early to say whether a probe would be launched into the reported incidents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an assisted suicide in italy has sparked controversy in a speech to britain 's liberal democrat party in september 2006 , 74-year-old lawyer minelli said that since its creation in may 1998 , dignitas had " helped 619 members to end their lives without any complication . " " we help our members to make a risk and pain-free suicide , " he said . swiss law on assisted suicide is amongst the most liberal in the world .
it authorizes passive assistance for suicide , allowing a doctor to supply a terminally ill person with a fatal dose of a drug , although the patient must take the dose without the doctor 's help . it is illegal in switzerland to actively help someone to die , such as by administering an injection . dignitas attracts terminally ill patients from all over europe as laws in most eu member states are either ambiguous on assisted suicide or outlaws it as a last resort for long-suffering people . in 2005 , the organization sparked opposition from many german politicians and church leaders when it opened an office in the german city of hanover . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de serial-killer nurse gets life for 28 deaths the " angel of death , " as he has been dubbed in the press , will spend the rest of his life behind bars for killing 28 patients at the hospital where he worked as a nurse , a district court decided monday .

" we both recognize that the best way to help impoverished nations is to complete this doha round and to encourage the spread of wealth and opportunity through open and reasonable and fair trade , " bush said , referring to the capital of qatar , which hosted the first round of the world trade organization negotiations in 2001 . barroso emphasized the need to move quickly on reaching deal and said he and bush ordered their negotiators to reach a " solution as soon as possible . "
barroso appeared upbeat after meeting with bush for about an hour , saying the two sides had realized action had to be taken . " we are really at defining moment , " barroso said . the ill-starred pact , which seeks to make it easier for developing countries to export products to richer nations like the united states and those in europe , was launched in 2001 but has repeatedly stalled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doha , qatar - where the trade talk began agriculture has been a main sticking point for the agreement and despite monday 's positive talk , there is still deep-seated discord over farm subsidies .
us subsidies now top $ 20 billion -lrb- 15.3 billion euros -rrb- a year , which displeases the europeans . however , subsidy reform is a sensitive proposition for american farmers .
they say they want to see tariffs fall in europe as well as in key developing countries like india and brazil . breakthrough still possible the current dispute led to a suspension in july of the talks .

" we need to take advantage of the window of opportunity in the weeks ahead in order to make concrete progress that could lead to a breakthrough , " the foreign minister added . european trade commissioner peter mandelson was quoted monday as saying the doha round was on the brink of failure and will only succeed with bush 's support . during barroso 's washington visit , he and bush also discussed the israel-palestinian conflict , iran , syria , iraq and the ethnic conflict in sudan 's darfur region . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mandelson seeks new eu and us effort to unlock wto talks eu trade commissioner peter mandelson called on saturday for a " new political commitment " between europe and the united states to revive the stalled doha round of world trade talks .

now a new pan-european green card scheme is reportedly in the pipeline . the european commission is planning to launch a green card that would give highly skilled migrants easier access to all 27 european union states , according to a report by the reuters news agency .
the initiative is likely to face strong resistance from a number of states . reuters says the eu executive intends to present the proposal as early as the second half of 2007 .
the exact details of the european scheme are still being hammered out . the us green card is a highly sought-after identification card that allows immigrants to live and work in the united states and eventually apply for citizenship .
unlike a work visa , such green cards are not attached to a specific job or employer . can one size fit all ? up to now germany , which currently holds the six-month rotating eu presidency , is one of the countries that has spearheaded the opposition to any cross-border policy on legal migration , saying its labor market is a purely domestic matter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this indonesian computer specialist was the first to get a german green card a number of other countries have also been sceptical about the suitability of a one-size-fits-all approach . chancellor gerhard schröder 's government launched a green card program in germany in 2000 in a bid to attract computer specialists from countries , such as india , and plug skills shortages in that sector .
but the take-up was poorer than expected for a variety of reasons . too restricted many criticised the limited five-year duration of the german green card and the bureaucracy involved in applying for one .
but the economic slowdown also played a role .
when the technology sector fell on hard times , there was a reduction in demand for it experts . in the european union , immigration regulations vary from country to country .
the majority only permit restricted new immigration and work permits for people with a job contract and specific skills . patchwork of laws within the eu itself , movement between some old and new member states also remains subject to restrictions .
on the doorstep of many of the poorer ex-communist states which joined the bloc in 2004 and with just below four million unemployed of its own , germany has restricted access to its labor market , fearing it could be swamped by workers from those countries . in contrast , the more economically buoyant united kingdom invited in workers from the 10 states who gained accession at that time .
but romania and bulgaria , who joined on jan .
1 this year , are being treated differently . citizens of these countries will have the same freedom of movement as the others , but not all of them will not be allowed to seek work .
poorly skilled migrants , in particular , will be hit by the uk restrictions . dw staff -lrb- jeg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de green card numbers below target germany 's much-touted green card program launched four years ago to meet the need for qualified it workers from abroad has been given to only 17,000 people .

director dani levy 's " mein führer : the truly truest truth about adolf hitler " tests the limits . a new film comedy about hitler is starting in german cinemas this week .
" mein führer : the truly truest truth about adolf hitler " has unleashed a storm of media interest . more than 60 years after charlie chaplin 's " the great dictator " appeared in cinemas , this is the first humorous film production about the nazi leader to be made in germany .
the question everyone is asking is whether it is actually acceptable to laugh about hitler and the nazis - especially if you are german . in the film , hitler is a physical wreck who has been psychologically damaged by his authoritarian upbringing and is an impotent , bed-wetting , whimpering drug addict .
he plays with a toy battleship in his bath and trains his beloved german shepherd dog blondi , dressed in a mini ss uniform , to perform the nazi salute . an absurd figure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crimes of the nazis make laughing about hitler out of bounds for many germans " the figure of adolf hitler was a pathetic figure and also pitiable and ridiculous , " said levy .
" just like nazism as a whole .
if you think that a whole nation used to shout ' heil hitler , ' that is cabaret of the most profound kind . " levy , however , also said he realizes the crimes of the nazi regime could make laughing at his film 's satire difficult for some . " it would have been funny and people would have been able to laugh about the whole thing over the last few years if the nazis had not done what they did , " he said .
" if this endless destruction , the biggest crime against humanity that there has ever been , had not happened . " " mein führer " is set in the final weeks of 1944 when germany was clearly losing the war and shows hitler on the verge of a nervous breakdown while propaganda minister joseph goebbels decides to appoint a linguistic coach to help the dictator prepare to give a morale-boosting speech to the people . a jewish actor , the fictional adolf grünbaum , is released from a concentration camp to do the job and puts hitler through a series of exercises .
most of the film 's humor arises during these training sessions - for example the slapstick scene when the dictator gets knocked out during a boxing match or ends up crawling around on the floor barking like a dog . close to the bone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film downfall also portrayed hitler in a ' human " manner but there are also a number of exaggerated , part comic , part demonic performances from the coterie of figures who surround hitler , such as goebbels and ss-leader heinrich himmler , hitler 's architect albert speer and mistress eva braun .
some of the comedy goes pretty close to the bone , for example when goebbels tells grünbaum that he should not take the final solution personally . in recent years in germany there has been a controversial move away from a simple deionization of the figure of hitler .
the director of the taboo-busting oscar-nominated 2004 film " downfall " created an intentionally human portrayal of hitler , reaping criticism along the way . counting on germans ' sense of humor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : levy is entering new territory in germany with this comedy dani levy , swiss-born jewish director , has also said his film aims to remove the figure of hitler from its pedestal .
his film , too , has already received both brickbats and bouquets .
but it adopts a very different approach from the serious " downfall . "
levy said he is confident that the comedy will be successful . " i 'm trusting that the germans have more humor than they are credited with - otherwise i would be lost as a jewish filmmaker with a jewish comedy about hitler , " he said .
" i think that , as is frequently the case at this time , that there is a feeling under the surface that there is a need to laugh about things that up to now had been exclusively consigned to seriousness .

now a new pan-european green card scheme is reportedly in the pipeline . the european commission is planning to launch a green card that would give highly skilled migrants easier access to all 27 european union states , according to a report by the reuters news agency .
the initiative is likely to face strong resistance from a number of states . reuters says the eu executive intends to present the proposal as early as the second half of 2007 .
the exact details of the european scheme are still being hammered out . the us green card is a highly sought-after identification card that allows immigrants to live and work in the united states and eventually apply for citizenship .
unlike a work visa , such green cards are not attached to a specific job or employer . can one size fit all ? up to now germany , which currently holds the six-month rotating eu presidency , is one of the countries that has spearheaded the opposition to any cross-border policy on legal migration , saying its labor market is a purely domestic matter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this indonesian computer specialist was the first to get a german green card a number of other countries have also been sceptical about the suitability of a one-size-fits-all approach . chancellor gerhard schröder 's government launched a green card program in germany in 2000 in a bid to attract computer specialists from countries , such as india , and plug skills shortages in that sector .
but the take-up was poorer than expected for a variety of reasons . too restricted many criticised the limited five-year duration of the german green card and the bureaucracy involved in applying for one .
but the economic slowdown also played a role .
when the technology sector fell on hard times , there was a reduction in demand for it experts . in the european union , immigration regulations vary from country to country .
the majority only permit restricted new immigration and work permits for people with a job contract and specific skills . patchwork of laws within the eu itself , movement between some old and new member states also remains subject to restrictions .
on the doorstep of many of the poorer ex-communist states which joined the bloc in 2004 and with just below four million unemployed of its own , germany has restricted access to its labor market , fearing it could be swamped by workers from those countries . in contrast , the more economically buoyant united kingdom invited in workers from the 10 states who gained accession at that time .
but romania and bulgaria , who joined on jan .
1 this year , are being treated differently . citizens of these countries will have the same freedom of movement as the others , but not all of them will not be allowed to seek work .

i 'm burning , " friends who accompanied her told the newspaper . she then fell into a coma but it took another 38 minutes before she was pronounced dead , the paper reported . dignitas declined to discuss the allegations on monday . " we have no comment on any reports by the tamedia house in zurich , " dignitas head ludwig minelli told the afp news agency in an email .
tamedia publishes the sonntagszeitung . another german client of the organization , a stroke victim identified as peter a. , spent three days in a coma before dying in august 2004 after taking a fatal dose of medication , the sonntagszeitung reported .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 09.01.2007 opening of new scientology center in berlin greeted with alarm großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the large new scientology center in berlin is due to open next saturday .
a new scientology headquarters in berlin has prompted calls for city authorities to put the organization under surveillance .
but berlin 's interior minister says the issue should be dealt with in the open . the opening of a large modern scientology center in the german capital berlin is causing political waves in the city with members of the local christian democratic party calling for the organization to be once again placed under surveillance .
but berlin 's interior minister , ehrhart körting , says that the issue should be dealt with openly . körting told a local radio station that it had to be made public what kind of ideology was behind scientology and what awaited potential members . the social democratic politician also said a court ruling prevented the berlin office for the protection of the constitution , which tracks extremist groups , from monitoring the activities of the center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are estimated to be some 30,000 scientologists in germany the state of berlin is the only one in germany where the scientologists are not under surveillance .
in 2001 and 2003 judges in the city decided there was insufficient evidence of any unconstitutional ambitions and banned the state from any further monitoring . but the state interior minister indicated this could change . " if new activities gave rise to fresh evidence , then we would look into this and discuss it with the federal authorities , " körting said . the cdu and the free democrats are calling for a change of the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us actor tom cruise is one of the famous scientologists who could be among the guests at the opening .
tom cruise could attend up to 10,000 guests are expected to attend the official opening of the new center on this coming saturday .
they could even include celebrity members of the organization , such as hollywood actors tom cruise and john travolta .
the scientologists say they have more than 1,000 members in the city .
other reports put the figure somewhere between 150 and 200 . the modern building in the central district of charlottenburg includes a church , an information center and a bookshop and replaces much smaller premises in another part of the city . the scientologists have confirmed that the building will be their german headquarters .
this would be their fourth center in a european capital after madrid , london and brussels . scientology is viewed with mistrust by many who say the organization pursues commercial interests and makes it difficult for its members to leave .
it has been accused of working like a sect by making people psychologically dependent and then exploiting them financially .

a new scientology headquarters in berlin has prompted calls for city authorities to put the organization under surveillance .
but berlin 's interior minister says the issue should be dealt with in the open . the opening of a large modern scientology center in the german capital berlin is causing political waves in the city with members of the local christian democratic party calling for the organization to be once again placed under surveillance .
but berlin 's interior minister , ehrhart körting , says that the issue should be dealt with openly . körting told a local radio station that it had to be made public what kind of ideology was behind scientology and what awaited potential members . the social democratic politician also said a court ruling prevented the berlin office for the protection of the constitution , which tracks extremist groups , from monitoring the activities of the center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are estimated to be some 30,000 scientologists in germany the state of berlin is the only one in germany where the scientologists are not under surveillance .
in 2001 and 2003 judges in the city decided there was insufficient evidence of any unconstitutional ambitions and banned the state from any further monitoring . but the state interior minister indicated this could change .

tom cruise could attend up to 10,000 guests are expected to attend the official opening of the new center on this coming saturday .
they could even include celebrity members of the organization , such as hollywood actors tom cruise and john travolta .
the scientologists say they have more than 1,000 members in the city .
other reports put the figure somewhere between 150 and 200 . the modern building in the central district of charlottenburg includes a church , an information center and a bookshop and replaces much smaller premises in another part of the city . the scientologists have confirmed that the building will be their german headquarters .
this would be their fourth center in a european capital after madrid , london and brussels . scientology is viewed with mistrust by many who say the organization pursues commercial interests and makes it difficult for its members to leave .

11 hijackers to 15 years in prison .
dw 's peter philipp says that , despite the weaknesses of the motassadeq case , the amount of evidence was overwhelming . now that the 32-year-old moroccan mounir el motassadeq was handed for the second time a sentence of 15 years in prison , the german judiciary could pride itself about passing a legally valid verdict on an accomplice of the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 . the case itself , however , does not offer much cause for complacency .
the proceedings went through various twists and turns over a period of four years : the first 15-year sentence was suspended due to procedural errors , whereas the second sentence - 7 years in prison - was eventually deemed too lenient .
now , a 15-year-sentence was passed again . motassadeq 's lawyer has spoken of arbitrariness .
at first glance , these sentences may , indeed , appear arbitrary .
it is more to the point , however , what the german supreme court said during the process : the fight against terrorism should not be a " wild and unregulated war . "
that is why germany 's judiciary had such difficulties with motassadeq 's sentencing and why this verdict so blatantly contradicts the acquittal of another moroccan , abdelghani mzoudi . both defendants belonged to the inner circle of the hamburg students who were behind the attacks of sept .
11 .
both were accused of collaborating or , at least knowing about the planned terrorist attacks and doing nothing to prevent them .
a third moroccan from the perpetrators ' circle - ramzi binalshibh - could have shed light on what roles the two had actually played .
but he is in custody in the united states and not available to the german judiciary . washington was anything but cooperative , supposedly for security reasons .
for all intents and purposes , however , the us position on this matter is baffling in view of its proclaimed cooperation in the war on terror .
it is also surprising because the us actually contributed to mzoudi 's acquittal in 2004 : they faxed an exculpatory transcript of binalshibh 's interrogation to the german authorities .
motassadeq did not get this kind of help . the value of such statements is dubious : no representative of the german judiciary was present when they were made and nothing is known about the circumstances under which they originated .
interrogation methods at guantanamo are in any case incompatible with german laws and statements attained using such methods would not be accepted by german courts . at the same time and despite the recognizable weaknesses of the motassadeq case , the burden of evidence was overwhelming and it made the verdict compelling : the young man belonged to the terrorists ' innermost circle ; he helped them with money transactions and other things .
that 's why it can be justly assumed that he knew at least in general terms that a terrorist attack was being prepared .

czinczoll creates modern kindergartens that stay open 12 hours a day .
and he chooses sites that are close to many workplaces . czinczoll sees himself as a service provider who works closely with companies .
the companies spend nothing on the kindergartens , but donated space and furniture is welcome .
parents pay by the hour ; but the longer the child is in the kindergarten , the lower the hourly rate .
long opening hours mean the kindergartens get plenty of use .
and that is important to czinczoll .
an attorney in his mid-30s , he is convinced : " even in kindergartens , you need an economics-oriented person at the top . "
and the project 's success proves he is right .
his current six day-care centers will see at least 11 sister centers open next year .
demand from companies and parents is huge . - bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new toys have finally arrived , and björn czinczoll is delighted to see it .
a car park with lots of gadgets .
the youngest ones here are just three months old .
björn czinczoll 's childcare centre in the industrial area of the bavarian city of regensburg is open from seven am to seven pm .
children can come here on an hourly basis for as long as their parents need .
czinczoll 's concept offers the flexibility that state childcare centres ca n't provide .
the 34 year old is a qualified lawyer , but instead of sitting in an office he builds kindergardens for a living : " i wanted to do something positive , something useful for children .
this rewards you daily .
i have no regretts – not for a single moment .
i like being in the kindergardens .
i really like being surrounded by so many children . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's already worked out his next project .
all he has to do now is to convince the board members at the regensburg university clinic .
the hospital needs a daycare centre for the children of its employees and björn czinczoll is prepared to set it up .
he finances his projects with state subsidies and contributions from the parents .
he approaches companies for donations , and takes care of all the red tape and deals with the local authorities : " if a hospital that does n't know anything about child care approaches the city council it is easy to turn it down .
we are different. we know what we want , we are more obstinate and we get what we want .
sure they do n't turn me down .
we just keep on insisting .
balancing work and family is an important issue these days and we want to make that possible – for the parents , the employees and the employers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction work at this site has already started .
still czinczoll needs nerves of steel .
the numerous regulations makes building kindergardens a tiresome business .
suddenly he gets a call about the university clinic .
things are looking good .
but progress on the building site is being hampered by red tape .
the first children are scheduled to move in by august , if everything goes according to plan : " we live in germany and that means progress is very slow .
sometimes we start planning two years in advance before the children can finally move in .
especially with new buildings because so many different authorities are involved and unfortunately communication between them is so poor . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this kindergarden in a villa in munich has just recently opened .
czinczoll 's latest facility is open 13 hours a day six days a week .
a co-operative provided the house at low cost to create kindergarden placements .
one-year-old mena will soon be coming here quite often .
her mum pays 4 euros an hour , but if she stays for longer periods the hourly rate decreases .
menas mother : this facility is certainly a great help .
i work a lot from home but that was n't easy .
looking after a child is really a full time job .
i do n't think i could have carried on working without this kindergarden . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : björn czinczoll already runs a total of 6 kindergardens .
he plans to open another 11 next year .
demand is huge , and czinczoll has dicovered a niche market : " if child care is organised properly to suit their needs then you see that a lot of parents think about having a second or third child .
they no longer have to choose between a career or a family because they can have both . "
so is he creating a small scale baby boom ?
björn czinczoll : " a small one , perhaps .
but that 's the way it should be .
the current problem is that germany 's population is growing older and there are n't enough children .
so we are doing what we can to rectify that . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : björn czinczoll does n't have children of his own , by the way – he says he does n't have the time - but of course it 's always possible that that might one day change . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic the report as video on demand www-links www.kinderzentren.de -lrb- in german -rrb- www.schwabfound.org feedback send us an e-mail .

while conservatives near merkel have repeatedly demanded that germany slash a scheduled nuclear energy phase-out , the spd remains in favor of the plan to close nuclear power plants . " those who use oil shortages in order to propagate nuclear energy are not capable of intellectually comprehending the topic of energy supplies , " said ulrich kelber , deputy president of the spd parliamentary bloc . members of the opposition greens also protested the idea of making changes to the planned nuclear phase-out .

moscow has refused to pay and on monday supplies to germany , poland and slovakia were interrupted . russian officials have not yet confirmed they are ready to negotiate and insist that the transit tax is illegal . belarus has long maintained close ties with its giant eastern neighbor russia .

in retaliation , belarus imposed the oil transit tax . the russian newspaper gazeta voiced sympathy for belarusian president alexander lukashenko , saying that the introduction of the oil transit fee was a " symmetrical " step in response to " severe political pressure " from moscow . the paper noted however that lukashenko lacked the western backing given to another russian neighbor , ukraine , during an energy dispute last year , and said , " it would be better for everyone if the war finished " on wednesday , when , belarusian prime minister sergei sidorsky is due in moscow . germany 's reliance on russian energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is becoming increasingly involved in energy disputes with its neigbors the druzhba pipeline supplies about 20 percent of germany 's annual oil imports , or 23.4 million tons in 2005 , according to the german oil industry federation -lrb- mwv -rrb- . russia has reduced the amount of oil it transits through western neighbors belarus and the baltic states , preferring to send oil via a new terminal near saint petersburg as well as around the coast of norway - in spite of less favorable climatic conditions . meanwhile on monday the energy-rich state of azerbaijan said it had stopped exporting oil to southern russia due to a natural gas price dispute with the russian gas giant gazprom . mukhtar babayev , an official with azerbaijan 's state oil firm socar , said azerbaijan was using oil previously exported to russia - about 4.2 million tons in 2006 - to fuel power stations that could no longer run on russian natural gas following a breakdown in the pricing talks . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany hit as russia halts oil exports to belarus russia has halted oil exports passing through belarus , threatening wider disruptions in europe .

a new scientology headquarters in berlin has prompted calls for city authorities to put the organization under surveillance .
but berlin 's interior minister says the issue should be dealt with in the open . the opening of a large modern scientology center in the german capital berlin is causing political waves in the city with members of the local christian democratic party calling for the organization to be once again placed under surveillance .
but berlin 's interior minister , ehrhart körting , says that the issue should be dealt with openly . körting told a local radio station that it had to be made public what kind of ideology was behind scientology and what awaited potential members . the social democratic politician also said a court ruling prevented the berlin office for the protection of the constitution , which tracks extremist groups , from monitoring the activities of the center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are estimated to be some 30,000 scientologists in germany the state of berlin is the only one in germany where the scientologists are not under surveillance .
in 2001 and 2003 judges in the city decided there was insufficient evidence of any unconstitutional ambitions and banned the state from any further monitoring . but the state interior minister indicated this could change . " if new activities gave rise to fresh evidence , then we would look into this and discuss it with the federal authorities , " körting said . the cdu and the free democrats are calling for a change of the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us actor tom cruise is one of the famous scientologists who could be among the guests at the opening .
tom cruise could attend up to 10,000 guests are expected to attend the official opening of the new center on this coming saturday .
they could even include celebrity members of the organization , such as hollywood actors tom cruise and john travolta .
the scientologists say they have more than 1,000 members in the city .
other reports put the figure somewhere between 150 and 200 . the modern building in the central district of charlottenburg includes a church , an information center and a bookshop and replaces much smaller premises in another part of the city . the scientologists have confirmed that the building will be their german headquarters .
this would be their fourth center in a european capital after madrid , london and brussels . scientology is viewed with mistrust by many who say the organization pursues commercial interests and makes it difficult for its members to leave .
it has been accused of working like a sect by making people psychologically dependent and then exploiting them financially .
these accusations have repeatedly been rejected by the group itself , who say they suffer religious persecution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the organization founded by l. ron hubbard continues to provoke mistrust anti-democratic ? scientology was set up by l. ron hubbard in 1954 in the united states .
the organization 's official web site describes its aims as seeking " only evolution to higher states of being for the individual and for society . " but the german interior ministry is critical of the organization , which has an estimated 30,000 members in the country .
the latest report released by the extremist monitoring office said there were indications that scientology was aiming to achieve " a society without general and egalitarian elections . " the report also said that the writings of the organization 's founder contained " passages that defamed the principles of the free democratic order and which called for its abolition in favor of the building of a new civilization .

" we both recognize that the best way to help impoverished nations is to complete this doha round and to encourage the spread of wealth and opportunity through open and reasonable and fair trade , " bush said , referring to the capital of qatar , which hosted the first round of the world trade organization negotiations in 2001 . barroso emphasized the need to move quickly on reaching deal and said he and bush ordered their negotiators to reach a " solution as soon as possible . "
barroso appeared upbeat after meeting with bush for about an hour , saying the two sides had realized action had to be taken . " we are really at defining moment , " barroso said . the ill-starred pact , which seeks to make it easier for developing countries to export products to richer nations like the united states and those in europe , was launched in 2001 but has repeatedly stalled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doha , qatar - where the trade talk began agriculture has been a main sticking point for the agreement and despite monday 's positive talk , there is still deep-seated discord over farm subsidies .

they say they want to see tariffs fall in europe as well as in key developing countries like india and brazil . breakthrough still possible the current dispute led to a suspension in july of the talks .

" we need to take advantage of the window of opportunity in the weeks ahead in order to make concrete progress that could lead to a breakthrough , " the foreign minister added . european trade commissioner peter mandelson was quoted monday as saying the doha round was on the brink of failure and will only succeed with bush 's support . during barroso 's washington visit , he and bush also discussed the israel-palestinian conflict , iran , syria , iraq and the ethnic conflict in sudan 's darfur region . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mandelson seeks new eu and us effort to unlock wto talks eu trade commissioner peter mandelson called on saturday for a " new political commitment " between europe and the united states to revive the stalled doha round of world trade talks .

11 hijackers to 15 years in prison .
dw 's peter philipp says that , despite the weaknesses of the motassadeq case , the amount of evidence was overwhelming . now that the 32-year-old moroccan mounir el motassadeq was handed for the second time a sentence of 15 years in prison , the german judiciary could pride itself about passing a legally valid verdict on an accomplice of the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 . the case itself , however , does not offer much cause for complacency .
the proceedings went through various twists and turns over a period of four years : the first 15-year sentence was suspended due to procedural errors , whereas the second sentence - 7 years in prison - was eventually deemed too lenient .
now , a 15-year-sentence was passed again . motassadeq 's lawyer has spoken of arbitrariness .
at first glance , these sentences may , indeed , appear arbitrary .
it is more to the point , however , what the german supreme court said during the process : the fight against terrorism should not be a " wild and unregulated war . "
that is why germany 's judiciary had such difficulties with motassadeq 's sentencing and why this verdict so blatantly contradicts the acquittal of another moroccan , abdelghani mzoudi . both defendants belonged to the inner circle of the hamburg students who were behind the attacks of sept .
11 .
both were accused of collaborating or , at least knowing about the planned terrorist attacks and doing nothing to prevent them .
a third moroccan from the perpetrators ' circle - ramzi binalshibh - could have shed light on what roles the two had actually played .
but he is in custody in the united states and not available to the german judiciary . washington was anything but cooperative , supposedly for security reasons .
for all intents and purposes , however , the us position on this matter is baffling in view of its proclaimed cooperation in the war on terror .
it is also surprising because the us actually contributed to mzoudi 's acquittal in 2004 : they faxed an exculpatory transcript of binalshibh 's interrogation to the german authorities .
motassadeq did not get this kind of help . the value of such statements is dubious : no representative of the german judiciary was present when they were made and nothing is known about the circumstances under which they originated .
interrogation methods at guantanamo are in any case incompatible with german laws and statements attained using such methods would not be accepted by german courts . at the same time and despite the recognizable weaknesses of the motassadeq case , the burden of evidence was overwhelming and it made the verdict compelling : the young man belonged to the terrorists ' innermost circle ; he helped them with money transactions and other things .
that 's why it can be justly assumed that he knew at least in general terms that a terrorist attack was being prepared .
the line between tacit assent and complicity is crossed all too easily .

11 hijackers to 15 years in prison .
dw 's peter philipp says that , despite the weaknesses of the motassadeq case , the amount of evidence was overwhelming . now that the 32-year-old moroccan mounir el motassadeq was handed for the second time a sentence of 15 years in prison , the german judiciary could pride itself about passing a legally valid verdict on an accomplice of the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 . the case itself , however , does not offer much cause for complacency .
the proceedings went through various twists and turns over a period of four years : the first 15-year sentence was suspended due to procedural errors , whereas the second sentence - 7 years in prison - was eventually deemed too lenient .
now , a 15-year-sentence was passed again . motassadeq 's lawyer has spoken of arbitrariness .
at first glance , these sentences may , indeed , appear arbitrary .
it is more to the point , however , what the german supreme court said during the process : the fight against terrorism should not be a " wild and unregulated war . "
that is why germany 's judiciary had such difficulties with motassadeq 's sentencing and why this verdict so blatantly contradicts the acquittal of another moroccan , abdelghani mzoudi . both defendants belonged to the inner circle of the hamburg students who were behind the attacks of sept .
11 .
both were accused of collaborating or , at least knowing about the planned terrorist attacks and doing nothing to prevent them .
a third moroccan from the perpetrators ' circle - ramzi binalshibh - could have shed light on what roles the two had actually played .
but he is in custody in the united states and not available to the german judiciary . washington was anything but cooperative , supposedly for security reasons .
for all intents and purposes , however , the us position on this matter is baffling in view of its proclaimed cooperation in the war on terror .
it is also surprising because the us actually contributed to mzoudi 's acquittal in 2004 : they faxed an exculpatory transcript of binalshibh 's interrogation to the german authorities .
motassadeq did not get this kind of help . the value of such statements is dubious : no representative of the german judiciary was present when they were made and nothing is known about the circumstances under which they originated .
interrogation methods at guantanamo are in any case incompatible with german laws and statements attained using such methods would not be accepted by german courts . at the same time and despite the recognizable weaknesses of the motassadeq case , the burden of evidence was overwhelming and it made the verdict compelling : the young man belonged to the terrorists ' innermost circle ; he helped them with money transactions and other things .
that 's why it can be justly assumed that he knew at least in general terms that a terrorist attack was being prepared .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 09.01.2007 russia faces angry eu in energy dispute großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both merkel and barroso gave russia a poor report card on tuesday german chancellor merkel said tuesday that disruption of oil supplies to europe was destroying confidence in moscow .
her comments come a day before the eu unveils its official energy strategy . german chancellor angela merkel appeared to take a dim view of russia on tuesday following its suspension of oil deliveries through the druzhba pipeline in belarus which hit supplies in germany and poland . merkel said the move destroyed confidence in russia as an energy supplier . " it is not acceptable when there are no consultations about such moves , " merkel told reporters after meeting with european commission president jose manuel barroso in berlin . " that repeatedly destroys confidence and you can not build cooperation based on true mutual trust in this way , " she said . the german cabinet and members of the european commission on tuesday met in berlin to debate issues related to securing europe ’ s energy supply .
the meeting had been planned with a view to coordinating activities within the current german presidency of the 27-member bloc , but took on added urgency because of the ongoing spat between moscow and minsk , which on monday led to the disruption of gas supplies to poland and germany . barroso : " unacceptable " move barroso too criticized russia for its role in the oil crisis and urged moscow and minsk to find a quick solution to their dispute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil tanks of the druzhba pipeline in the southeastern belarusian city of mozyr " it is unacceptable for either supplier or transit countries to take measures that impact on partner countries without consultation , " barroso said .
" it once again demonstrates that we need a common energy policy . " russian president vladimir putin said tuesday that western consumers must be shielded from the effects of an oil transit row with belarus that has hit supplies to the eu . putin told government ministers it was " necessary to continue negotiations with our belarusian partners " and to " do everything to secure the interests of western consumers . " however , he said that it might be necessary to cut russian oil production due to the shutdown of the druzhba pipeline through belarus in a tariff dispute .
the pipeline accounts for a third of russia 's total oil exports . negotiations to restart supplies showed no sign of making headway in moscow . merkel urges energy diversity merkel said the current row over oil supplies between russia and belarus made it abundantly clear that the 27-nation bloc needed to drastically reduce its dependence on russian energy sources . russian oil and gas supplies currently make up about one third of all energy imports in germany , and there ’ s a growing sense of unease over the kremlin ’ s potential ability to use western energy dependence as a sharp political weapon . " we ’ re in agreement with the european commission that every member country will be given the same amount of assistance and solidarity when it comes to energy supply problems , " merkel said .
" but the current crisis also shows that in order to become more independent , we first have to redouble our own efforts to achieve higher energy efficiency and arrive at a more competitive energy market . " merkel said that europe needed to draw its energy from a varied mix of sources with particular emphasis on renewable energy in order to improve efficiency . earlier , merkel also indicated in an interview that she may rethink germany 's long-planned nuclear phase-out plan which foresees shutting down all the country 's nuclear plants by 2020 . eu energy plan already controversial the european commission has long been seeking instruments to secure energy safety and decrease the eu ’ s dependence on gas and oil .
in a new policy strategy to be unveiled on wednesday , the european commission will call for " a new industrial revolution " in the energy sector to boost competition , protect the climate and ensure security of supply . the policy blueprint however is likely to cause controversy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's promotion of nuclear energy in its draft policy remains controversial according to media reports , the eu 's new energy policy will call for building " cleaner " coal plants .
it will also promote the use of nuclear energy as an alternative to fossil fuels because of the lower greenhouse emissions generated by nuclear plants .
the draft policy will however stress that it is up to national governments to decide whether to produce nuclear energy . critics in germany , particularly those from the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- who are against extending the lifespan for nuclear plants , have already panned the eu 's draft policy on energy . " it belongs in the dustbin , " hans-josef fell , spd spokesman on energy affairs told news agency ap . in addition , the draft policy 's recommendations for boosting competition in the energy sector are also under fire from germany and france .
plans foresee reducing the might of big european utilities by either breaking up companies that own power stations and distribution grids such as e.on or rwe in germany and france 's edf . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel puts germany 's nuclear phase-out in question as senior belarusian officials arrived in moscow tuesday for crisis talks with russia regarding disrupted oil transit through belarus , german chancellor merkel stressed the need for diversifying energy resources .

her comments come a day before the eu unveils its official energy strategy . german chancellor angela merkel appeared to take a dim view of russia on tuesday following its suspension of oil deliveries through the druzhba pipeline in belarus which hit supplies in germany and poland . merkel said the move destroyed confidence in russia as an energy supplier . " it is not acceptable when there are no consultations about such moves , " merkel told reporters after meeting with european commission president jose manuel barroso in berlin . " that repeatedly destroys confidence and you can not build cooperation based on true mutual trust in this way , " she said . the german cabinet and members of the european commission on tuesday met in berlin to debate issues related to securing europe ’ s energy supply .
the meeting had been planned with a view to coordinating activities within the current german presidency of the 27-member bloc , but took on added urgency because of the ongoing spat between moscow and minsk , which on monday led to the disruption of gas supplies to poland and germany . barroso : " unacceptable " move barroso too criticized russia for its role in the oil crisis and urged moscow and minsk to find a quick solution to their dispute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil tanks of the druzhba pipeline in the southeastern belarusian city of mozyr " it is unacceptable for either supplier or transit countries to take measures that impact on partner countries without consultation , " barroso said .
" it once again demonstrates that we need a common energy policy . " russian president vladimir putin said tuesday that western consumers must be shielded from the effects of an oil transit row with belarus that has hit supplies to the eu . putin told government ministers it was " necessary to continue negotiations with our belarusian partners " and to " do everything to secure the interests of western consumers . " however , he said that it might be necessary to cut russian oil production due to the shutdown of the druzhba pipeline through belarus in a tariff dispute .
the pipeline accounts for a third of russia 's total oil exports . negotiations to restart supplies showed no sign of making headway in moscow . merkel urges energy diversity merkel said the current row over oil supplies between russia and belarus made it abundantly clear that the 27-nation bloc needed to drastically reduce its dependence on russian energy sources . russian oil and gas supplies currently make up about one third of all energy imports in germany , and there ’ s a growing sense of unease over the kremlin ’ s potential ability to use western energy dependence as a sharp political weapon . " we ’ re in agreement with the european commission that every member country will be given the same amount of assistance and solidarity when it comes to energy supply problems , " merkel said .
" but the current crisis also shows that in order to become more independent , we first have to redouble our own efforts to achieve higher energy efficiency and arrive at a more competitive energy market . " merkel said that europe needed to draw its energy from a varied mix of sources with particular emphasis on renewable energy in order to improve efficiency . earlier , merkel also indicated in an interview that she may rethink germany 's long-planned nuclear phase-out plan which foresees shutting down all the country 's nuclear plants by 2020 . eu energy plan already controversial the european commission has long been seeking instruments to secure energy safety and decrease the eu ’ s dependence on gas and oil .
in a new policy strategy to be unveiled on wednesday , the european commission will call for " a new industrial revolution " in the energy sector to boost competition , protect the climate and ensure security of supply . the policy blueprint however is likely to cause controversy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's promotion of nuclear energy in its draft policy remains controversial according to media reports , the eu 's new energy policy will call for building " cleaner " coal plants .
it will also promote the use of nuclear energy as an alternative to fossil fuels because of the lower greenhouse emissions generated by nuclear plants .
the draft policy will however stress that it is up to national governments to decide whether to produce nuclear energy . critics in germany , particularly those from the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- who are against extending the lifespan for nuclear plants , have already panned the eu 's draft policy on energy . " it belongs in the dustbin , " hans-josef fell , spd spokesman on energy affairs told news agency ap . in addition , the draft policy 's recommendations for boosting competition in the energy sector are also under fire from germany and france .
plans foresee reducing the might of big european utilities by either breaking up companies that own power stations and distribution grids such as e.on or rwe in germany and france 's edf . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel puts germany 's nuclear phase-out in question as senior belarusian officials arrived in moscow tuesday for crisis talks with russia regarding disrupted oil transit through belarus , german chancellor merkel stressed the need for diversifying energy resources .

her comments come a day before the eu unveils its official energy strategy . german chancellor angela merkel appeared to take a dim view of russia on tuesday following its suspension of oil deliveries through the druzhba pipeline in belarus which hit supplies in germany and poland . merkel said the move destroyed confidence in russia as an energy supplier . " it is not acceptable when there are no consultations about such moves , " merkel told reporters after meeting with european commission president jose manuel barroso in berlin . " that repeatedly destroys confidence and you can not build cooperation based on true mutual trust in this way , " she said . the german cabinet and members of the european commission on tuesday met in berlin to debate issues related to securing europe ’ s energy supply .
the meeting had been planned with a view to coordinating activities within the current german presidency of the 27-member bloc , but took on added urgency because of the ongoing spat between moscow and minsk , which on monday led to the disruption of gas supplies to poland and germany . barroso : " unacceptable " move barroso too criticized russia for its role in the oil crisis and urged moscow and minsk to find a quick solution to their dispute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil tanks of the druzhba pipeline in the southeastern belarusian city of mozyr " it is unacceptable for either supplier or transit countries to take measures that impact on partner countries without consultation , " barroso said .
" it once again demonstrates that we need a common energy policy . " russian president vladimir putin said tuesday that western consumers must be shielded from the effects of an oil transit row with belarus that has hit supplies to the eu . putin told government ministers it was " necessary to continue negotiations with our belarusian partners " and to " do everything to secure the interests of western consumers . " however , he said that it might be necessary to cut russian oil production due to the shutdown of the druzhba pipeline through belarus in a tariff dispute .
the pipeline accounts for a third of russia 's total oil exports . negotiations to restart supplies showed no sign of making headway in moscow . merkel urges energy diversity merkel said the current row over oil supplies between russia and belarus made it abundantly clear that the 27-nation bloc needed to drastically reduce its dependence on russian energy sources . russian oil and gas supplies currently make up about one third of all energy imports in germany , and there ’ s a growing sense of unease over the kremlin ’ s potential ability to use western energy dependence as a sharp political weapon . " we ’ re in agreement with the european commission that every member country will be given the same amount of assistance and solidarity when it comes to energy supply problems , " merkel said .
" but the current crisis also shows that in order to become more independent , we first have to redouble our own efforts to achieve higher energy efficiency and arrive at a more competitive energy market . " merkel said that europe needed to draw its energy from a varied mix of sources with particular emphasis on renewable energy in order to improve efficiency . earlier , merkel also indicated in an interview that she may rethink germany 's long-planned nuclear phase-out plan which foresees shutting down all the country 's nuclear plants by 2020 . eu energy plan already controversial the european commission has long been seeking instruments to secure energy safety and decrease the eu ’ s dependence on gas and oil .
in a new policy strategy to be unveiled on wednesday , the european commission will call for " a new industrial revolution " in the energy sector to boost competition , protect the climate and ensure security of supply . the policy blueprint however is likely to cause controversy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's promotion of nuclear energy in its draft policy remains controversial according to media reports , the eu 's new energy policy will call for building " cleaner " coal plants .
it will also promote the use of nuclear energy as an alternative to fossil fuels because of the lower greenhouse emissions generated by nuclear plants .
the draft policy will however stress that it is up to national governments to decide whether to produce nuclear energy . critics in germany , particularly those from the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- who are against extending the lifespan for nuclear plants , have already panned the eu 's draft policy on energy . " it belongs in the dustbin , " hans-josef fell , spd spokesman on energy affairs told news agency ap . in addition , the draft policy 's recommendations for boosting competition in the energy sector are also under fire from germany and france .
plans foresee reducing the might of big european utilities by either breaking up companies that own power stations and distribution grids such as e.on or rwe in germany and france 's edf . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel puts germany 's nuclear phase-out in question as senior belarusian officials arrived in moscow tuesday for crisis talks with russia regarding disrupted oil transit through belarus , german chancellor merkel stressed the need for diversifying energy resources .

program guide programs made in germany video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de home / dw-tv arabia : made in germany in focus : raising a family : germany debates daycare options school in the afternoon is new to germany , but catching on value of women at heart of childcare debate reformist family minister raises hackles in conservative ranks new year babies bring extra prosperity in germany social entrepreneurs -pipe- 09.01.2007 björn czinczoll : a kindergarten founder from germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : björn czinczoll , the german social entrepreneur of the year 2006 .
czinczoll creates modern kindergartens that stay open 12 hours a day .
and he chooses sites that are close to many workplaces . czinczoll sees himself as a service provider who works closely with companies .
the companies spend nothing on the kindergartens , but donated space and furniture is welcome .
parents pay by the hour ; but the longer the child is in the kindergarten , the lower the hourly rate .
long opening hours mean the kindergartens get plenty of use .
and that is important to czinczoll .
an attorney in his mid-30s , he is convinced : " even in kindergartens , you need an economics-oriented person at the top . "
and the project 's success proves he is right .
his current six day-care centers will see at least 11 sister centers open next year .
demand from companies and parents is huge . - bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new toys have finally arrived , and björn czinczoll is delighted to see it .
a car park with lots of gadgets .
the youngest ones here are just three months old .
björn czinczoll 's childcare centre in the industrial area of the bavarian city of regensburg is open from seven am to seven pm .
children can come here on an hourly basis for as long as their parents need .
czinczoll 's concept offers the flexibility that state childcare centres ca n't provide .
the 34 year old is a qualified lawyer , but instead of sitting in an office he builds kindergardens for a living : " i wanted to do something positive , something useful for children .
this rewards you daily .
i have no regretts – not for a single moment .
i like being in the kindergardens .
i really like being surrounded by so many children . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's already worked out his next project .
all he has to do now is to convince the board members at the regensburg university clinic .
the hospital needs a daycare centre for the children of its employees and björn czinczoll is prepared to set it up .
he finances his projects with state subsidies and contributions from the parents .
he approaches companies for donations , and takes care of all the red tape and deals with the local authorities : " if a hospital that does n't know anything about child care approaches the city council it is easy to turn it down .
we are different. we know what we want , we are more obstinate and we get what we want .
sure they do n't turn me down .
we just keep on insisting .
balancing work and family is an important issue these days and we want to make that possible – for the parents , the employees and the employers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction work at this site has already started .
still czinczoll needs nerves of steel .
the numerous regulations makes building kindergardens a tiresome business .
suddenly he gets a call about the university clinic .
things are looking good .
but progress on the building site is being hampered by red tape .
the first children are scheduled to move in by august , if everything goes according to plan : " we live in germany and that means progress is very slow .
sometimes we start planning two years in advance before the children can finally move in .
especially with new buildings because so many different authorities are involved and unfortunately communication between them is so poor . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this kindergarden in a villa in munich has just recently opened .
czinczoll 's latest facility is open 13 hours a day six days a week .
a co-operative provided the house at low cost to create kindergarden placements .
one-year-old mena will soon be coming here quite often .
her mum pays 4 euros an hour , but if she stays for longer periods the hourly rate decreases .
menas mother : this facility is certainly a great help .
i work a lot from home but that was n't easy .
looking after a child is really a full time job .
i do n't think i could have carried on working without this kindergarden . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : björn czinczoll already runs a total of 6 kindergardens .
he plans to open another 11 next year .
demand is huge , and czinczoll has dicovered a niche market : " if child care is organised properly to suit their needs then you see that a lot of parents think about having a second or third child .

czinczoll creates modern kindergartens that stay open 12 hours a day .
and he chooses sites that are close to many workplaces . czinczoll sees himself as a service provider who works closely with companies .
the companies spend nothing on the kindergartens , but donated space and furniture is welcome .
parents pay by the hour ; but the longer the child is in the kindergarten , the lower the hourly rate .
long opening hours mean the kindergartens get plenty of use .
and that is important to czinczoll .
an attorney in his mid-30s , he is convinced : " even in kindergartens , you need an economics-oriented person at the top . "
and the project 's success proves he is right .
his current six day-care centers will see at least 11 sister centers open next year .
demand from companies and parents is huge . - bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new toys have finally arrived , and björn czinczoll is delighted to see it .
a car park with lots of gadgets .
the youngest ones here are just three months old .
björn czinczoll 's childcare centre in the industrial area of the bavarian city of regensburg is open from seven am to seven pm .
children can come here on an hourly basis for as long as their parents need .
czinczoll 's concept offers the flexibility that state childcare centres ca n't provide .
the 34 year old is a qualified lawyer , but instead of sitting in an office he builds kindergardens for a living : " i wanted to do something positive , something useful for children .
this rewards you daily .
i have no regretts – not for a single moment .
i like being in the kindergardens .
i really like being surrounded by so many children . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's already worked out his next project .
all he has to do now is to convince the board members at the regensburg university clinic .
the hospital needs a daycare centre for the children of its employees and björn czinczoll is prepared to set it up .
he finances his projects with state subsidies and contributions from the parents .
he approaches companies for donations , and takes care of all the red tape and deals with the local authorities : " if a hospital that does n't know anything about child care approaches the city council it is easy to turn it down .
we are different. we know what we want , we are more obstinate and we get what we want .
sure they do n't turn me down .
we just keep on insisting .
balancing work and family is an important issue these days and we want to make that possible – for the parents , the employees and the employers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction work at this site has already started .
still czinczoll needs nerves of steel .
the numerous regulations makes building kindergardens a tiresome business .
suddenly he gets a call about the university clinic .
things are looking good .
but progress on the building site is being hampered by red tape .
the first children are scheduled to move in by august , if everything goes according to plan : " we live in germany and that means progress is very slow .
sometimes we start planning two years in advance before the children can finally move in .
especially with new buildings because so many different authorities are involved and unfortunately communication between them is so poor . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this kindergarden in a villa in munich has just recently opened .
czinczoll 's latest facility is open 13 hours a day six days a week .
a co-operative provided the house at low cost to create kindergarden placements .
one-year-old mena will soon be coming here quite often .
her mum pays 4 euros an hour , but if she stays for longer periods the hourly rate decreases .
menas mother : this facility is certainly a great help .
i work a lot from home but that was n't easy .
looking after a child is really a full time job .
i do n't think i could have carried on working without this kindergarden . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : björn czinczoll already runs a total of 6 kindergardens .
he plans to open another 11 next year .
demand is huge , and czinczoll has dicovered a niche market : " if child care is organised properly to suit their needs then you see that a lot of parents think about having a second or third child .

czinczoll creates modern kindergartens that stay open 12 hours a day .
and he chooses sites that are close to many workplaces . czinczoll sees himself as a service provider who works closely with companies .
the companies spend nothing on the kindergartens , but donated space and furniture is welcome .
parents pay by the hour ; but the longer the child is in the kindergarten , the lower the hourly rate .
long opening hours mean the kindergartens get plenty of use .
and that is important to czinczoll .
an attorney in his mid-30s , he is convinced : " even in kindergartens , you need an economics-oriented person at the top . "
and the project 's success proves he is right .
his current six day-care centers will see at least 11 sister centers open next year .
demand from companies and parents is huge . - bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new toys have finally arrived , and björn czinczoll is delighted to see it .
a car park with lots of gadgets .
the youngest ones here are just three months old .
björn czinczoll 's childcare centre in the industrial area of the bavarian city of regensburg is open from seven am to seven pm .
children can come here on an hourly basis for as long as their parents need .
czinczoll 's concept offers the flexibility that state childcare centres ca n't provide .
the 34 year old is a qualified lawyer , but instead of sitting in an office he builds kindergardens for a living : " i wanted to do something positive , something useful for children .
this rewards you daily .
i have no regretts – not for a single moment .
i like being in the kindergardens .
i really like being surrounded by so many children . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's already worked out his next project .
all he has to do now is to convince the board members at the regensburg university clinic .
the hospital needs a daycare centre for the children of its employees and björn czinczoll is prepared to set it up .
he finances his projects with state subsidies and contributions from the parents .
he approaches companies for donations , and takes care of all the red tape and deals with the local authorities : " if a hospital that does n't know anything about child care approaches the city council it is easy to turn it down .
we are different. we know what we want , we are more obstinate and we get what we want .
sure they do n't turn me down .
we just keep on insisting .
balancing work and family is an important issue these days and we want to make that possible – for the parents , the employees and the employers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction work at this site has already started .
still czinczoll needs nerves of steel .
the numerous regulations makes building kindergardens a tiresome business .
suddenly he gets a call about the university clinic .
things are looking good .
but progress on the building site is being hampered by red tape .
the first children are scheduled to move in by august , if everything goes according to plan : " we live in germany and that means progress is very slow .
sometimes we start planning two years in advance before the children can finally move in .
especially with new buildings because so many different authorities are involved and unfortunately communication between them is so poor . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this kindergarden in a villa in munich has just recently opened .
czinczoll 's latest facility is open 13 hours a day six days a week .
a co-operative provided the house at low cost to create kindergarden placements .
one-year-old mena will soon be coming here quite often .
her mum pays 4 euros an hour , but if she stays for longer periods the hourly rate decreases .
menas mother : this facility is certainly a great help .
i work a lot from home but that was n't easy .
looking after a child is really a full time job .
i do n't think i could have carried on working without this kindergarden . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : björn czinczoll already runs a total of 6 kindergardens .
he plans to open another 11 next year .
demand is huge , and czinczoll has dicovered a niche market : " if child care is organised properly to suit their needs then you see that a lot of parents think about having a second or third child .
they no longer have to choose between a career or a family because they can have both . "
so is he creating a small scale baby boom ?
björn czinczoll : " a small one , perhaps .
but that 's the way it should be .
the current problem is that germany 's population is growing older and there are n't enough children .
so we are doing what we can to rectify that . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : björn czinczoll does n't have children of his own , by the way – he says he does n't have the time - but of course it 's always possible that that might one day change . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic the report as video on demand www-links www.kinderzentren.de -lrb- in german -rrb- www.schwabfound.org feedback send us an e-mail .

her comments come a day before the eu unveils its official energy strategy . german chancellor angela merkel appeared to take a dim view of russia on tuesday following its suspension of oil deliveries through the druzhba pipeline in belarus which hit supplies in germany and poland . merkel said the move destroyed confidence in russia as an energy supplier . " it is not acceptable when there are no consultations about such moves , " merkel told reporters after meeting with european commission president jose manuel barroso in berlin . " that repeatedly destroys confidence and you can not build cooperation based on true mutual trust in this way , " she said . the german cabinet and members of the european commission on tuesday met in berlin to debate issues related to securing europe ’ s energy supply .
the meeting had been planned with a view to coordinating activities within the current german presidency of the 27-member bloc , but took on added urgency because of the ongoing spat between moscow and minsk , which on monday led to the disruption of gas supplies to poland and germany . barroso : " unacceptable " move barroso too criticized russia for its role in the oil crisis and urged moscow and minsk to find a quick solution to their dispute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil tanks of the druzhba pipeline in the southeastern belarusian city of mozyr " it is unacceptable for either supplier or transit countries to take measures that impact on partner countries without consultation , " barroso said .
" it once again demonstrates that we need a common energy policy . " russian president vladimir putin said tuesday that western consumers must be shielded from the effects of an oil transit row with belarus that has hit supplies to the eu . putin told government ministers it was " necessary to continue negotiations with our belarusian partners " and to " do everything to secure the interests of western consumers . " however , he said that it might be necessary to cut russian oil production due to the shutdown of the druzhba pipeline through belarus in a tariff dispute .
the pipeline accounts for a third of russia 's total oil exports . negotiations to restart supplies showed no sign of making headway in moscow . merkel urges energy diversity merkel said the current row over oil supplies between russia and belarus made it abundantly clear that the 27-nation bloc needed to drastically reduce its dependence on russian energy sources . russian oil and gas supplies currently make up about one third of all energy imports in germany , and there ’ s a growing sense of unease over the kremlin ’ s potential ability to use western energy dependence as a sharp political weapon . " we ’ re in agreement with the european commission that every member country will be given the same amount of assistance and solidarity when it comes to energy supply problems , " merkel said .
" but the current crisis also shows that in order to become more independent , we first have to redouble our own efforts to achieve higher energy efficiency and arrive at a more competitive energy market . " merkel said that europe needed to draw its energy from a varied mix of sources with particular emphasis on renewable energy in order to improve efficiency . earlier , merkel also indicated in an interview that she may rethink germany 's long-planned nuclear phase-out plan which foresees shutting down all the country 's nuclear plants by 2020 . eu energy plan already controversial the european commission has long been seeking instruments to secure energy safety and decrease the eu ’ s dependence on gas and oil .
in a new policy strategy to be unveiled on wednesday , the european commission will call for " a new industrial revolution " in the energy sector to boost competition , protect the climate and ensure security of supply . the policy blueprint however is likely to cause controversy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's promotion of nuclear energy in its draft policy remains controversial according to media reports , the eu 's new energy policy will call for building " cleaner " coal plants .
it will also promote the use of nuclear energy as an alternative to fossil fuels because of the lower greenhouse emissions generated by nuclear plants .
the draft policy will however stress that it is up to national governments to decide whether to produce nuclear energy . critics in germany , particularly those from the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- who are against extending the lifespan for nuclear plants , have already panned the eu 's draft policy on energy . " it belongs in the dustbin , " hans-josef fell , spd spokesman on energy affairs told news agency ap . in addition , the draft policy 's recommendations for boosting competition in the energy sector are also under fire from germany and france .

the meeting had been planned with a view to coordinating activities within the current german presidency of the 27-member bloc , but took on added urgency because of the ongoing spat between moscow and minsk , which on monday led to the disruption of gas supplies to poland and germany . barroso : " unacceptable " move barroso too criticized russia for its role in the oil crisis and urged moscow and minsk to find a quick solution to their dispute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil tanks of the druzhba pipeline in the southeastern belarusian city of mozyr " it is unacceptable for either supplier or transit countries to take measures that impact on partner countries without consultation , " barroso said .
" it once again demonstrates that we need a common energy policy . " russian president vladimir putin said tuesday that western consumers must be shielded from the effects of an oil transit row with belarus that has hit supplies to the eu . putin told government ministers it was " necessary to continue negotiations with our belarusian partners " and to " do everything to secure the interests of western consumers . " however , he said that it might be necessary to cut russian oil production due to the shutdown of the druzhba pipeline through belarus in a tariff dispute .
the pipeline accounts for a third of russia 's total oil exports . negotiations to restart supplies showed no sign of making headway in moscow . merkel urges energy diversity merkel said the current row over oil supplies between russia and belarus made it abundantly clear that the 27-nation bloc needed to drastically reduce its dependence on russian energy sources . russian oil and gas supplies currently make up about one third of all energy imports in germany , and there ’ s a growing sense of unease over the kremlin ’ s potential ability to use western energy dependence as a sharp political weapon . " we ’ re in agreement with the european commission that every member country will be given the same amount of assistance and solidarity when it comes to energy supply problems , " merkel said .
" but the current crisis also shows that in order to become more independent , we first have to redouble our own efforts to achieve higher energy efficiency and arrive at a more competitive energy market . " merkel said that europe needed to draw its energy from a varied mix of sources with particular emphasis on renewable energy in order to improve efficiency . earlier , merkel also indicated in an interview that she may rethink germany 's long-planned nuclear phase-out plan which foresees shutting down all the country 's nuclear plants by 2020 . eu energy plan already controversial the european commission has long been seeking instruments to secure energy safety and decrease the eu ’ s dependence on gas and oil .
in a new policy strategy to be unveiled on wednesday , the european commission will call for " a new industrial revolution " in the energy sector to boost competition , protect the climate and ensure security of supply . the policy blueprint however is likely to cause controversy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's promotion of nuclear energy in its draft policy remains controversial according to media reports , the eu 's new energy policy will call for building " cleaner " coal plants .
it will also promote the use of nuclear energy as an alternative to fossil fuels because of the lower greenhouse emissions generated by nuclear plants .
the draft policy will however stress that it is up to national governments to decide whether to produce nuclear energy . critics in germany , particularly those from the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- who are against extending the lifespan for nuclear plants , have already panned the eu 's draft policy on energy . " it belongs in the dustbin , " hans-josef fell , spd spokesman on energy affairs told news agency ap . in addition , the draft policy 's recommendations for boosting competition in the energy sector are also under fire from germany and france .
plans foresee reducing the might of big european utilities by either breaking up companies that own power stations and distribution grids such as e.on or rwe in germany and france 's edf . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel puts germany 's nuclear phase-out in question as senior belarusian officials arrived in moscow tuesday for crisis talks with russia regarding disrupted oil transit through belarus , german chancellor merkel stressed the need for diversifying energy resources .

director dani levy 's " mein führer : the truly truest truth about adolf hitler " tests the limits . a new film comedy about hitler is starting in german cinemas this week .
" mein führer : the truly truest truth about adolf hitler " has unleashed a storm of media interest . more than 60 years after charlie chaplin 's " the great dictator " appeared in cinemas , this is the first humorous film production about the nazi leader to be made in germany .
the question everyone is asking is whether it is actually acceptable to laugh about hitler and the nazis - especially if you are german . in the film , hitler is a physical wreck who has been psychologically damaged by his authoritarian upbringing and is an impotent , bed-wetting , whimpering drug addict .
he plays with a toy battleship in his bath and trains his beloved german shepherd dog blondi , dressed in a mini ss uniform , to perform the nazi salute . an absurd figure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crimes of the nazis make laughing about hitler out of bounds for many germans " the figure of adolf hitler was a pathetic figure and also pitiable and ridiculous , " said levy .
" just like nazism as a whole .
if you think that a whole nation used to shout ' heil hitler , ' that is cabaret of the most profound kind . " levy , however , also said he realizes the crimes of the nazi regime could make laughing at his film 's satire difficult for some . " it would have been funny and people would have been able to laugh about the whole thing over the last few years if the nazis had not done what they did , " he said .
" if this endless destruction , the biggest crime against humanity that there has ever been , had not happened . " " mein führer " is set in the final weeks of 1944 when germany was clearly losing the war and shows hitler on the verge of a nervous breakdown while propaganda minister joseph goebbels decides to appoint a linguistic coach to help the dictator prepare to give a morale-boosting speech to the people . a jewish actor , the fictional adolf grünbaum , is released from a concentration camp to do the job and puts hitler through a series of exercises .
most of the film 's humor arises during these training sessions - for example the slapstick scene when the dictator gets knocked out during a boxing match or ends up crawling around on the floor barking like a dog . close to the bone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film downfall also portrayed hitler in a ' human " manner but there are also a number of exaggerated , part comic , part demonic performances from the coterie of figures who surround hitler , such as goebbels and ss-leader heinrich himmler , hitler 's architect albert speer and mistress eva braun .
some of the comedy goes pretty close to the bone , for example when goebbels tells grünbaum that he should not take the final solution personally . in recent years in germany there has been a controversial move away from a simple deionization of the figure of hitler .
the director of the taboo-busting oscar-nominated 2004 film " downfall " created an intentionally human portrayal of hitler , reaping criticism along the way . counting on germans ' sense of humor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : levy is entering new territory in germany with this comedy dani levy , swiss-born jewish director , has also said his film aims to remove the figure of hitler from its pedestal .
his film , too , has already received both brickbats and bouquets .
but it adopts a very different approach from the serious " downfall . "
levy said he is confident that the comedy will be successful . " i 'm trusting that the germans have more humor than they are credited with - otherwise i would be lost as a jewish filmmaker with a jewish comedy about hitler , " he said .
" i think that , as is frequently the case at this time , that there is a feeling under the surface that there is a need to laugh about things that up to now had been exclusively consigned to seriousness .

i 'm burning , " friends who accompanied her told the newspaper . she then fell into a coma but it took another 38 minutes before she was pronounced dead , the paper reported . dignitas declined to discuss the allegations on monday . " we have no comment on any reports by the tamedia house in zurich , " dignitas head ludwig minelli told the afp news agency in an email .
tamedia publishes the sonntagszeitung . another german client of the organization , a stroke victim identified as peter a. , spent three days in a coma before dying in august 2004 after taking a fatal dose of medication , the sonntagszeitung reported .

" " we help our members to make a risk and pain-free suicide , " he said . swiss law on assisted suicide is amongst the most liberal in the world .
it authorizes passive assistance for suicide , allowing a doctor to supply a terminally ill person with a fatal dose of a drug , although the patient must take the dose without the doctor 's help . it is illegal in switzerland to actively help someone to die , such as by administering an injection . dignitas attracts terminally ill patients from all over europe as laws in most eu member states are either ambiguous on assisted suicide or outlaws it as a last resort for long-suffering people . in 2005 , the organization sparked opposition from many german politicians and church leaders when it opened an office in the german city of hanover . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de serial-killer nurse gets life for 28 deaths the " angel of death , " as he has been dubbed in the press , will spend the rest of his life behind bars for killing 28 patients at the hospital where he worked as a nurse , a district court decided monday .

a new scientology headquarters in berlin has prompted calls for city authorities to put the organization under surveillance .
but berlin 's interior minister says the issue should be dealt with in the open . the opening of a large modern scientology center in the german capital berlin is causing political waves in the city with members of the local christian democratic party calling for the organization to be once again placed under surveillance .
but berlin 's interior minister , ehrhart körting , says that the issue should be dealt with openly . körting told a local radio station that it had to be made public what kind of ideology was behind scientology and what awaited potential members . the social democratic politician also said a court ruling prevented the berlin office for the protection of the constitution , which tracks extremist groups , from monitoring the activities of the center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are estimated to be some 30,000 scientologists in germany the state of berlin is the only one in germany where the scientologists are not under surveillance .
in 2001 and 2003 judges in the city decided there was insufficient evidence of any unconstitutional ambitions and banned the state from any further monitoring . but the state interior minister indicated this could change . " if new activities gave rise to fresh evidence , then we would look into this and discuss it with the federal authorities , " körting said . the cdu and the free democrats are calling for a change of the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us actor tom cruise is one of the famous scientologists who could be among the guests at the opening .

this would be their fourth center in a european capital after madrid , london and brussels . scientology is viewed with mistrust by many who say the organization pursues commercial interests and makes it difficult for its members to leave .
it has been accused of working like a sect by making people psychologically dependent and then exploiting them financially .
these accusations have repeatedly been rejected by the group itself , who say they suffer religious persecution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the organization founded by l. ron hubbard continues to provoke mistrust anti-democratic ? scientology was set up by l. ron hubbard in 1954 in the united states .
the organization 's official web site describes its aims as seeking " only evolution to higher states of being for the individual and for society . " but the german interior ministry is critical of the organization , which has an estimated 30,000 members in the country .
the latest report released by the extremist monitoring office said there were indications that scientology was aiming to achieve " a society without general and egalitarian elections .

a new scientology headquarters in berlin has prompted calls for city authorities to put the organization under surveillance .
but berlin 's interior minister says the issue should be dealt with in the open . the opening of a large modern scientology center in the german capital berlin is causing political waves in the city with members of the local christian democratic party calling for the organization to be once again placed under surveillance .
but berlin 's interior minister , ehrhart körting , says that the issue should be dealt with openly . körting told a local radio station that it had to be made public what kind of ideology was behind scientology and what awaited potential members . the social democratic politician also said a court ruling prevented the berlin office for the protection of the constitution , which tracks extremist groups , from monitoring the activities of the center . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are estimated to be some 30,000 scientologists in germany the state of berlin is the only one in germany where the scientologists are not under surveillance .
in 2001 and 2003 judges in the city decided there was insufficient evidence of any unconstitutional ambitions and banned the state from any further monitoring . but the state interior minister indicated this could change . " if new activities gave rise to fresh evidence , then we would look into this and discuss it with the federal authorities , " körting said . the cdu and the free democrats are calling for a change of the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us actor tom cruise is one of the famous scientologists who could be among the guests at the opening .
tom cruise could attend up to 10,000 guests are expected to attend the official opening of the new center on this coming saturday .
they could even include celebrity members of the organization , such as hollywood actors tom cruise and john travolta .
the scientologists say they have more than 1,000 members in the city .
other reports put the figure somewhere between 150 and 200 . the modern building in the central district of charlottenburg includes a church , an information center and a bookshop and replaces much smaller premises in another part of the city . the scientologists have confirmed that the building will be their german headquarters .
this would be their fourth center in a european capital after madrid , london and brussels . scientology is viewed with mistrust by many who say the organization pursues commercial interests and makes it difficult for its members to leave .
it has been accused of working like a sect by making people psychologically dependent and then exploiting them financially .
these accusations have repeatedly been rejected by the group itself , who say they suffer religious persecution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the organization founded by l. ron hubbard continues to provoke mistrust anti-democratic ? scientology was set up by l. ron hubbard in 1954 in the united states .
the organization 's official web site describes its aims as seeking " only evolution to higher states of being for the individual and for society . " but the german interior ministry is critical of the organization , which has an estimated 30,000 members in the country .
the latest report released by the extremist monitoring office said there were indications that scientology was aiming to achieve " a society without general and egalitarian elections . " the report also said that the writings of the organization 's founder contained " passages that defamed the principles of the free democratic order and which called for its abolition in favor of the building of a new civilization .

11 hijackers to 15 years in prison .
dw 's peter philipp says that , despite the weaknesses of the motassadeq case , the amount of evidence was overwhelming . now that the 32-year-old moroccan mounir el motassadeq was handed for the second time a sentence of 15 years in prison , the german judiciary could pride itself about passing a legally valid verdict on an accomplice of the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 . the case itself , however , does not offer much cause for complacency .
the proceedings went through various twists and turns over a period of four years : the first 15-year sentence was suspended due to procedural errors , whereas the second sentence - 7 years in prison - was eventually deemed too lenient .
now , a 15-year-sentence was passed again . motassadeq 's lawyer has spoken of arbitrariness .
at first glance , these sentences may , indeed , appear arbitrary .
it is more to the point , however , what the german supreme court said during the process : the fight against terrorism should not be a " wild and unregulated war . "
that is why germany 's judiciary had such difficulties with motassadeq 's sentencing and why this verdict so blatantly contradicts the acquittal of another moroccan , abdelghani mzoudi . both defendants belonged to the inner circle of the hamburg students who were behind the attacks of sept .
11 .
both were accused of collaborating or , at least knowing about the planned terrorist attacks and doing nothing to prevent them .
a third moroccan from the perpetrators ' circle - ramzi binalshibh - could have shed light on what roles the two had actually played .
but he is in custody in the united states and not available to the german judiciary . washington was anything but cooperative , supposedly for security reasons .
for all intents and purposes , however , the us position on this matter is baffling in view of its proclaimed cooperation in the war on terror .
it is also surprising because the us actually contributed to mzoudi 's acquittal in 2004 : they faxed an exculpatory transcript of binalshibh 's interrogation to the german authorities .
motassadeq did not get this kind of help . the value of such statements is dubious : no representative of the german judiciary was present when they were made and nothing is known about the circumstances under which they originated .
interrogation methods at guantanamo are in any case incompatible with german laws and statements attained using such methods would not be accepted by german courts . at the same time and despite the recognizable weaknesses of the motassadeq case , the burden of evidence was overwhelming and it made the verdict compelling : the young man belonged to the terrorists ' innermost circle ; he helped them with money transactions and other things .
that 's why it can be justly assumed that he knew at least in general terms that a terrorist attack was being prepared .

11 hijackers to 15 years in prison .
dw 's peter philipp says that , despite the weaknesses of the motassadeq case , the amount of evidence was overwhelming . now that the 32-year-old moroccan mounir el motassadeq was handed for the second time a sentence of 15 years in prison , the german judiciary could pride itself about passing a legally valid verdict on an accomplice of the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 . the case itself , however , does not offer much cause for complacency .
the proceedings went through various twists and turns over a period of four years : the first 15-year sentence was suspended due to procedural errors , whereas the second sentence - 7 years in prison - was eventually deemed too lenient .
now , a 15-year-sentence was passed again . motassadeq 's lawyer has spoken of arbitrariness .
at first glance , these sentences may , indeed , appear arbitrary .
it is more to the point , however , what the german supreme court said during the process : the fight against terrorism should not be a " wild and unregulated war . "
that is why germany 's judiciary had such difficulties with motassadeq 's sentencing and why this verdict so blatantly contradicts the acquittal of another moroccan , abdelghani mzoudi . both defendants belonged to the inner circle of the hamburg students who were behind the attacks of sept .
11 .
both were accused of collaborating or , at least knowing about the planned terrorist attacks and doing nothing to prevent them .
a third moroccan from the perpetrators ' circle - ramzi binalshibh - could have shed light on what roles the two had actually played .
but he is in custody in the united states and not available to the german judiciary . washington was anything but cooperative , supposedly for security reasons .
for all intents and purposes , however , the us position on this matter is baffling in view of its proclaimed cooperation in the war on terror .
it is also surprising because the us actually contributed to mzoudi 's acquittal in 2004 : they faxed an exculpatory transcript of binalshibh 's interrogation to the german authorities .
motassadeq did not get this kind of help . the value of such statements is dubious : no representative of the german judiciary was present when they were made and nothing is known about the circumstances under which they originated .
interrogation methods at guantanamo are in any case incompatible with german laws and statements attained using such methods would not be accepted by german courts . at the same time and despite the recognizable weaknesses of the motassadeq case , the burden of evidence was overwhelming and it made the verdict compelling : the young man belonged to the terrorists ' innermost circle ; he helped them with money transactions and other things .
that 's why it can be justly assumed that he knew at least in general terms that a terrorist attack was being prepared .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 09.01.2007 russia faces angry eu in energy dispute großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both merkel and barroso gave russia a poor report card on tuesday german chancellor merkel said tuesday that disruption of oil supplies to europe was destroying confidence in moscow .
her comments come a day before the eu unveils its official energy strategy . german chancellor angela merkel appeared to take a dim view of russia on tuesday following its suspension of oil deliveries through the druzhba pipeline in belarus which hit supplies in germany and poland . merkel said the move destroyed confidence in russia as an energy supplier . " it is not acceptable when there are no consultations about such moves , " merkel told reporters after meeting with european commission president jose manuel barroso in berlin . " that repeatedly destroys confidence and you can not build cooperation based on true mutual trust in this way , " she said . the german cabinet and members of the european commission on tuesday met in berlin to debate issues related to securing europe ’ s energy supply .
the meeting had been planned with a view to coordinating activities within the current german presidency of the 27-member bloc , but took on added urgency because of the ongoing spat between moscow and minsk , which on monday led to the disruption of gas supplies to poland and germany . barroso : " unacceptable " move barroso too criticized russia for its role in the oil crisis and urged moscow and minsk to find a quick solution to their dispute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil tanks of the druzhba pipeline in the southeastern belarusian city of mozyr " it is unacceptable for either supplier or transit countries to take measures that impact on partner countries without consultation , " barroso said .
" it once again demonstrates that we need a common energy policy . " russian president vladimir putin said tuesday that western consumers must be shielded from the effects of an oil transit row with belarus that has hit supplies to the eu . putin told government ministers it was " necessary to continue negotiations with our belarusian partners " and to " do everything to secure the interests of western consumers . " however , he said that it might be necessary to cut russian oil production due to the shutdown of the druzhba pipeline through belarus in a tariff dispute .
the pipeline accounts for a third of russia 's total oil exports . negotiations to restart supplies showed no sign of making headway in moscow . merkel urges energy diversity merkel said the current row over oil supplies between russia and belarus made it abundantly clear that the 27-nation bloc needed to drastically reduce its dependence on russian energy sources . russian oil and gas supplies currently make up about one third of all energy imports in germany , and there ’ s a growing sense of unease over the kremlin ’ s potential ability to use western energy dependence as a sharp political weapon . " we ’ re in agreement with the european commission that every member country will be given the same amount of assistance and solidarity when it comes to energy supply problems , " merkel said .
" but the current crisis also shows that in order to become more independent , we first have to redouble our own efforts to achieve higher energy efficiency and arrive at a more competitive energy market . " merkel said that europe needed to draw its energy from a varied mix of sources with particular emphasis on renewable energy in order to improve efficiency . earlier , merkel also indicated in an interview that she may rethink germany 's long-planned nuclear phase-out plan which foresees shutting down all the country 's nuclear plants by 2020 . eu energy plan already controversial the european commission has long been seeking instruments to secure energy safety and decrease the eu ’ s dependence on gas and oil .
in a new policy strategy to be unveiled on wednesday , the european commission will call for " a new industrial revolution " in the energy sector to boost competition , protect the climate and ensure security of supply . the policy blueprint however is likely to cause controversy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's promotion of nuclear energy in its draft policy remains controversial according to media reports , the eu 's new energy policy will call for building " cleaner " coal plants .
it will also promote the use of nuclear energy as an alternative to fossil fuels because of the lower greenhouse emissions generated by nuclear plants .
the draft policy will however stress that it is up to national governments to decide whether to produce nuclear energy . critics in germany , particularly those from the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- who are against extending the lifespan for nuclear plants , have already panned the eu 's draft policy on energy . " it belongs in the dustbin , " hans-josef fell , spd spokesman on energy affairs told news agency ap . in addition , the draft policy 's recommendations for boosting competition in the energy sector are also under fire from germany and france .
plans foresee reducing the might of big european utilities by either breaking up companies that own power stations and distribution grids such as e.on or rwe in germany and france 's edf . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel puts germany 's nuclear phase-out in question as senior belarusian officials arrived in moscow tuesday for crisis talks with russia regarding disrupted oil transit through belarus , german chancellor merkel stressed the need for diversifying energy resources .

her comments come a day before the eu unveils its official energy strategy . german chancellor angela merkel appeared to take a dim view of russia on tuesday following its suspension of oil deliveries through the druzhba pipeline in belarus which hit supplies in germany and poland . merkel said the move destroyed confidence in russia as an energy supplier . " it is not acceptable when there are no consultations about such moves , " merkel told reporters after meeting with european commission president jose manuel barroso in berlin . " that repeatedly destroys confidence and you can not build cooperation based on true mutual trust in this way , " she said . the german cabinet and members of the european commission on tuesday met in berlin to debate issues related to securing europe ’ s energy supply .
the meeting had been planned with a view to coordinating activities within the current german presidency of the 27-member bloc , but took on added urgency because of the ongoing spat between moscow and minsk , which on monday led to the disruption of gas supplies to poland and germany . barroso : " unacceptable " move barroso too criticized russia for its role in the oil crisis and urged moscow and minsk to find a quick solution to their dispute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil tanks of the druzhba pipeline in the southeastern belarusian city of mozyr " it is unacceptable for either supplier or transit countries to take measures that impact on partner countries without consultation , " barroso said .
" it once again demonstrates that we need a common energy policy . " russian president vladimir putin said tuesday that western consumers must be shielded from the effects of an oil transit row with belarus that has hit supplies to the eu . putin told government ministers it was " necessary to continue negotiations with our belarusian partners " and to " do everything to secure the interests of western consumers . " however , he said that it might be necessary to cut russian oil production due to the shutdown of the druzhba pipeline through belarus in a tariff dispute .
the pipeline accounts for a third of russia 's total oil exports . negotiations to restart supplies showed no sign of making headway in moscow . merkel urges energy diversity merkel said the current row over oil supplies between russia and belarus made it abundantly clear that the 27-nation bloc needed to drastically reduce its dependence on russian energy sources . russian oil and gas supplies currently make up about one third of all energy imports in germany , and there ’ s a growing sense of unease over the kremlin ’ s potential ability to use western energy dependence as a sharp political weapon . " we ’ re in agreement with the european commission that every member country will be given the same amount of assistance and solidarity when it comes to energy supply problems , " merkel said .
" but the current crisis also shows that in order to become more independent , we first have to redouble our own efforts to achieve higher energy efficiency and arrive at a more competitive energy market . " merkel said that europe needed to draw its energy from a varied mix of sources with particular emphasis on renewable energy in order to improve efficiency . earlier , merkel also indicated in an interview that she may rethink germany 's long-planned nuclear phase-out plan which foresees shutting down all the country 's nuclear plants by 2020 . eu energy plan already controversial the european commission has long been seeking instruments to secure energy safety and decrease the eu ’ s dependence on gas and oil .
in a new policy strategy to be unveiled on wednesday , the european commission will call for " a new industrial revolution " in the energy sector to boost competition , protect the climate and ensure security of supply . the policy blueprint however is likely to cause controversy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu 's promotion of nuclear energy in its draft policy remains controversial according to media reports , the eu 's new energy policy will call for building " cleaner " coal plants .
it will also promote the use of nuclear energy as an alternative to fossil fuels because of the lower greenhouse emissions generated by nuclear plants .
the draft policy will however stress that it is up to national governments to decide whether to produce nuclear energy . critics in germany , particularly those from the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- who are against extending the lifespan for nuclear plants , have already panned the eu 's draft policy on energy . " it belongs in the dustbin , " hans-josef fell , spd spokesman on energy affairs told news agency ap . in addition , the draft policy 's recommendations for boosting competition in the energy sector are also under fire from germany and france .

czinczoll creates modern kindergartens that stay open 12 hours a day .
and he chooses sites that are close to many workplaces . czinczoll sees himself as a service provider who works closely with companies .
the companies spend nothing on the kindergartens , but donated space and furniture is welcome .
parents pay by the hour ; but the longer the child is in the kindergarten , the lower the hourly rate .
long opening hours mean the kindergartens get plenty of use .
and that is important to czinczoll .
an attorney in his mid-30s , he is convinced : " even in kindergartens , you need an economics-oriented person at the top . "
and the project 's success proves he is right .
his current six day-care centers will see at least 11 sister centers open next year .
demand from companies and parents is huge . - bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new toys have finally arrived , and björn czinczoll is delighted to see it .
a car park with lots of gadgets .
the youngest ones here are just three months old .
björn czinczoll 's childcare centre in the industrial area of the bavarian city of regensburg is open from seven am to seven pm .
children can come here on an hourly basis for as long as their parents need .
czinczoll 's concept offers the flexibility that state childcare centres ca n't provide .
the 34 year old is a qualified lawyer , but instead of sitting in an office he builds kindergardens for a living : " i wanted to do something positive , something useful for children .
this rewards you daily .
i have no regretts – not for a single moment .
i like being in the kindergardens .
i really like being surrounded by so many children . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's already worked out his next project .
all he has to do now is to convince the board members at the regensburg university clinic .
the hospital needs a daycare centre for the children of its employees and björn czinczoll is prepared to set it up .
he finances his projects with state subsidies and contributions from the parents .
he approaches companies for donations , and takes care of all the red tape and deals with the local authorities : " if a hospital that does n't know anything about child care approaches the city council it is easy to turn it down .
we are different. we know what we want , we are more obstinate and we get what we want .
sure they do n't turn me down .
we just keep on insisting .
balancing work and family is an important issue these days and we want to make that possible – for the parents , the employees and the employers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction work at this site has already started .
still czinczoll needs nerves of steel .
the numerous regulations makes building kindergardens a tiresome business .
suddenly he gets a call about the university clinic .
things are looking good .
but progress on the building site is being hampered by red tape .
the first children are scheduled to move in by august , if everything goes according to plan : " we live in germany and that means progress is very slow .
sometimes we start planning two years in advance before the children can finally move in .
especially with new buildings because so many different authorities are involved and unfortunately communication between them is so poor . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this kindergarden in a villa in munich has just recently opened .
czinczoll 's latest facility is open 13 hours a day six days a week .
a co-operative provided the house at low cost to create kindergarden placements .
one-year-old mena will soon be coming here quite often .
her mum pays 4 euros an hour , but if she stays for longer periods the hourly rate decreases .
menas mother : this facility is certainly a great help .
i work a lot from home but that was n't easy .
looking after a child is really a full time job .
i do n't think i could have carried on working without this kindergarden . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : björn czinczoll already runs a total of 6 kindergardens .
he plans to open another 11 next year .
demand is huge , and czinczoll has dicovered a niche market : " if child care is organised properly to suit their needs then you see that a lot of parents think about having a second or third child .
they no longer have to choose between a career or a family because they can have both . "
so is he creating a small scale baby boom ?
björn czinczoll : " a small one , perhaps .
but that 's the way it should be .
the current problem is that germany 's population is growing older and there are n't enough children .
so we are doing what we can to rectify that . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 09.01.2007 hitler comedy breaks german taboos großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler appears as an absurd and pathetic figure in levy 's film is it really all right for germans to laugh about hitler and nazi germany ?
director dani levy 's " mein führer : the truly truest truth about adolf hitler " tests the limits . a new film comedy about hitler is starting in german cinemas this week .
" mein führer : the truly truest truth about adolf hitler " has unleashed a storm of media interest . more than 60 years after charlie chaplin 's " the great dictator " appeared in cinemas , this is the first humorous film production about the nazi leader to be made in germany .
the question everyone is asking is whether it is actually acceptable to laugh about hitler and the nazis - especially if you are german . in the film , hitler is a physical wreck who has been psychologically damaged by his authoritarian upbringing and is an impotent , bed-wetting , whimpering drug addict .
he plays with a toy battleship in his bath and trains his beloved german shepherd dog blondi , dressed in a mini ss uniform , to perform the nazi salute . an absurd figure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crimes of the nazis make laughing about hitler out of bounds for many germans " the figure of adolf hitler was a pathetic figure and also pitiable and ridiculous , " said levy .
" just like nazism as a whole .
if you think that a whole nation used to shout ' heil hitler , ' that is cabaret of the most profound kind . " levy , however , also said he realizes the crimes of the nazi regime could make laughing at his film 's satire difficult for some . " it would have been funny and people would have been able to laugh about the whole thing over the last few years if the nazis had not done what they did , " he said .
" if this endless destruction , the biggest crime against humanity that there has ever been , had not happened . " " mein führer " is set in the final weeks of 1944 when germany was clearly losing the war and shows hitler on the verge of a nervous breakdown while propaganda minister joseph goebbels decides to appoint a linguistic coach to help the dictator prepare to give a morale-boosting speech to the people . a jewish actor , the fictional adolf grünbaum , is released from a concentration camp to do the job and puts hitler through a series of exercises .
most of the film 's humor arises during these training sessions - for example the slapstick scene when the dictator gets knocked out during a boxing match or ends up crawling around on the floor barking like a dog . close to the bone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film downfall also portrayed hitler in a ' human " manner but there are also a number of exaggerated , part comic , part demonic performances from the coterie of figures who surround hitler , such as goebbels and ss-leader heinrich himmler , hitler 's architect albert speer and mistress eva braun .
some of the comedy goes pretty close to the bone , for example when goebbels tells grünbaum that he should not take the final solution personally . in recent years in germany there has been a controversial move away from a simple deionization of the figure of hitler .
the director of the taboo-busting oscar-nominated 2004 film " downfall " created an intentionally human portrayal of hitler , reaping criticism along the way . counting on germans ' sense of humor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : levy is entering new territory in germany with this comedy dani levy , swiss-born jewish director , has also said his film aims to remove the figure of hitler from its pedestal .
his film , too , has already received both brickbats and bouquets .
but it adopts a very different approach from the serious " downfall . "
levy said he is confident that the comedy will be successful . " i 'm trusting that the germans have more humor than they are credited with - otherwise i would be lost as a jewish filmmaker with a jewish comedy about hitler , " he said .
" i think that , as is frequently the case at this time , that there is a feeling under the surface that there is a need to laugh about things that up to now had been exclusively consigned to seriousness .

director dani levy 's " mein führer : the truly truest truth about adolf hitler " tests the limits . a new film comedy about hitler is starting in german cinemas this week .
" mein führer : the truly truest truth about adolf hitler " has unleashed a storm of media interest . more than 60 years after charlie chaplin 's " the great dictator " appeared in cinemas , this is the first humorous film production about the nazi leader to be made in germany .
the question everyone is asking is whether it is actually acceptable to laugh about hitler and the nazis - especially if you are german . in the film , hitler is a physical wreck who has been psychologically damaged by his authoritarian upbringing and is an impotent , bed-wetting , whimpering drug addict .
he plays with a toy battleship in his bath and trains his beloved german shepherd dog blondi , dressed in a mini ss uniform , to perform the nazi salute . an absurd figure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crimes of the nazis make laughing about hitler out of bounds for many germans " the figure of adolf hitler was a pathetic figure and also pitiable and ridiculous , " said levy .
" just like nazism as a whole .
if you think that a whole nation used to shout ' heil hitler , ' that is cabaret of the most profound kind . " levy , however , also said he realizes the crimes of the nazi regime could make laughing at his film 's satire difficult for some . " it would have been funny and people would have been able to laugh about the whole thing over the last few years if the nazis had not done what they did , " he said .
" if this endless destruction , the biggest crime against humanity that there has ever been , had not happened . " " mein führer " is set in the final weeks of 1944 when germany was clearly losing the war and shows hitler on the verge of a nervous breakdown while propaganda minister joseph goebbels decides to appoint a linguistic coach to help the dictator prepare to give a morale-boosting speech to the people . a jewish actor , the fictional adolf grünbaum , is released from a concentration camp to do the job and puts hitler through a series of exercises .
most of the film 's humor arises during these training sessions - for example the slapstick scene when the dictator gets knocked out during a boxing match or ends up crawling around on the floor barking like a dog . close to the bone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film downfall also portrayed hitler in a ' human " manner but there are also a number of exaggerated , part comic , part demonic performances from the coterie of figures who surround hitler , such as goebbels and ss-leader heinrich himmler , hitler 's architect albert speer and mistress eva braun .
some of the comedy goes pretty close to the bone , for example when goebbels tells grünbaum that he should not take the final solution personally . in recent years in germany there has been a controversial move away from a simple deionization of the figure of hitler .
the director of the taboo-busting oscar-nominated 2004 film " downfall " created an intentionally human portrayal of hitler , reaping criticism along the way . counting on germans ' sense of humor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : levy is entering new territory in germany with this comedy dani levy , swiss-born jewish director , has also said his film aims to remove the figure of hitler from its pedestal .
his film , too , has already received both brickbats and bouquets .
but it adopts a very different approach from the serious " downfall . "
levy said he is confident that the comedy will be successful . " i 'm trusting that the germans have more humor than they are credited with - otherwise i would be lost as a jewish filmmaker with a jewish comedy about hitler , " he said .
" i think that , as is frequently the case at this time , that there is a feeling under the surface that there is a need to laugh about things that up to now had been exclusively consigned to seriousness .

most of the film 's humor arises during these training sessions - for example the slapstick scene when the dictator gets knocked out during a boxing match or ends up crawling around on the floor barking like a dog . close to the bone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film downfall also portrayed hitler in a ' human " manner but there are also a number of exaggerated , part comic , part demonic performances from the coterie of figures who surround hitler , such as goebbels and ss-leader heinrich himmler , hitler 's architect albert speer and mistress eva braun .
some of the comedy goes pretty close to the bone , for example when goebbels tells grünbaum that he should not take the final solution personally . in recent years in germany there has been a controversial move away from a simple deionization of the figure of hitler .
the director of the taboo-busting oscar-nominated 2004 film " downfall " created an intentionally human portrayal of hitler , reaping criticism along the way . counting on germans ' sense of humor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : levy is entering new territory in germany with this comedy dani levy , swiss-born jewish director , has also said his film aims to remove the figure of hitler from its pedestal .
his film , too , has already received both brickbats and bouquets .
but it adopts a very different approach from the serious " downfall . "
levy said he is confident that the comedy will be successful . " i 'm trusting that the germans have more humor than they are credited with - otherwise i would be lost as a jewish filmmaker with a jewish comedy about hitler , " he said .
" i think that , as is frequently the case at this time , that there is a feeling under the surface that there is a need to laugh about things that up to now had been exclusively consigned to seriousness .

czinczoll creates modern kindergartens that stay open 12 hours a day .
and he chooses sites that are close to many workplaces . czinczoll sees himself as a service provider who works closely with companies .
the companies spend nothing on the kindergartens , but donated space and furniture is welcome .
parents pay by the hour ; but the longer the child is in the kindergarten , the lower the hourly rate .
long opening hours mean the kindergartens get plenty of use .
and that is important to czinczoll .
an attorney in his mid-30s , he is convinced : " even in kindergartens , you need an economics-oriented person at the top . "
and the project 's success proves he is right .
his current six day-care centers will see at least 11 sister centers open next year .
demand from companies and parents is huge . - bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new toys have finally arrived , and björn czinczoll is delighted to see it .
a car park with lots of gadgets .
the youngest ones here are just three months old .
björn czinczoll 's childcare centre in the industrial area of the bavarian city of regensburg is open from seven am to seven pm .
children can come here on an hourly basis for as long as their parents need .
czinczoll 's concept offers the flexibility that state childcare centres ca n't provide .
the 34 year old is a qualified lawyer , but instead of sitting in an office he builds kindergardens for a living : " i wanted to do something positive , something useful for children .
this rewards you daily .
i have no regretts – not for a single moment .
i like being in the kindergardens .
i really like being surrounded by so many children . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's already worked out his next project .
all he has to do now is to convince the board members at the regensburg university clinic .
the hospital needs a daycare centre for the children of its employees and björn czinczoll is prepared to set it up .
he finances his projects with state subsidies and contributions from the parents .
he approaches companies for donations , and takes care of all the red tape and deals with the local authorities : " if a hospital that does n't know anything about child care approaches the city council it is easy to turn it down .
we are different. we know what we want , we are more obstinate and we get what we want .
sure they do n't turn me down .
we just keep on insisting .
balancing work and family is an important issue these days and we want to make that possible – for the parents , the employees and the employers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction work at this site has already started .
still czinczoll needs nerves of steel .
the numerous regulations makes building kindergardens a tiresome business .
suddenly he gets a call about the university clinic .
things are looking good .
but progress on the building site is being hampered by red tape .
the first children are scheduled to move in by august , if everything goes according to plan : " we live in germany and that means progress is very slow .
sometimes we start planning two years in advance before the children can finally move in .
especially with new buildings because so many different authorities are involved and unfortunately communication between them is so poor . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this kindergarden in a villa in munich has just recently opened .
czinczoll 's latest facility is open 13 hours a day six days a week .
a co-operative provided the house at low cost to create kindergarden placements .
one-year-old mena will soon be coming here quite often .
her mum pays 4 euros an hour , but if she stays for longer periods the hourly rate decreases .
menas mother : this facility is certainly a great help .
i work a lot from home but that was n't easy .
looking after a child is really a full time job .
i do n't think i could have carried on working without this kindergarden . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : björn czinczoll already runs a total of 6 kindergardens .
he plans to open another 11 next year .
demand is huge , and czinczoll has dicovered a niche market : " if child care is organised properly to suit their needs then you see that a lot of parents think about having a second or third child .
they no longer have to choose between a career or a family because they can have both . "
so is he creating a small scale baby boom ?
björn czinczoll : " a small one , perhaps .
but that 's the way it should be .
the current problem is that germany 's population is growing older and there are n't enough children .
so we are doing what we can to rectify that . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : björn czinczoll does n't have children of his own , by the way – he says he does n't have the time - but of course it 's always possible that that might one day change . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic audios and videos on the topic video : the report as video on demand www-links externer link : www.kinderzentren.de -lrb- in german -rrb- externer link : www.schwabfound.org feedback feedback : send us an e-mail .

the eventual aim is to turn the gathering of video evidence into a third forensic specialism alongside dna analysis and fingerprinting .
there are 4.2 million cameras in the uk but until now there has been no dedicated police unit to deal with the collection and dissemination of cctv evidence .
if the new visual images , identifications and detections office -lrb- viido -rrb- , based at southwark police station , is judged to be a success it could soon lead to the development of specialist cctv units across the country .
specialist knowledge " there 's so much cctv out there that we are simply not using for crime " deputy chief inspector mick neville viido has a small team made up of police officers , civilian staff and members of the public drawn from a metropolitan police volunteering scheme .
although it was only set up in september , deputy chief inspector mick neville , who heads the unit , is pleased with its progress : he says : " we have produced more images of street robbers in one-32nd of metropolitan police than the whole force put together " although gathering cctv might appear no more difficult than programming the video recorder , obtaining images can require specialist knowledge .
dci neville explains : " with all cctv it is not as simple as an officer grabbing a tape .
if it 's not a simple vhs player they may have to get cds , or even worse , a hard-drive has to be recovered .
often footage is in multiplex format where there 'll be 12 or 20 cameras on the same tape . "
new cctv systems on buses which store images on hard drives have been particularly problematic , and the viido team has significantly increased the use of this material .
problems with evidence according to mr neville there have even been issues with playing evidence gathered via cctv in court .
" dna was funded end-to-end with scientists and police officers trained .
with cctv the vast majority of the funding went on producing images and there was very little equipment in the courts , " he says .
" we 've now received home office funding and to put additional dvds and cd players in court . "
viido viido stands for visual images , identifications and detections office there are currently 4.2 million cctv cameras in the uk viido has a small team made up of police officers , civilian staff and public but it is not just the collection of data that 's key to making cctv more effective .
viido 's key role is in establishing procedures for identifying and circulating images .
to this end the viido team ensures that images of suspects are circulated throughout the relevant boroughs and nationally via the police gazette .
if the project is a success it will be duplicated across london and may be adopted uk-wide .
for dci neville the lack of a forensic specialism dealing with cctv represents a missed opportunity .
" at the moment there 's so much cctv out there that we are simply not using for crime , " he says .

japan 's self-defence forces , as they are known , were previously administered by a defence agency with a lower standing than fully-fledged ministries .
the government says the change will enable the troops to respond to " a change in the security environment " .
but the country 's pacifist constitution still forbids it from waging war .
even though ministers want parts of that document re-written , there is no suggestion that the country 's pacifist stance will be changed .
global role japan 's prime minister shinzo abe made the creation of a new defence ministry a priority for his administration when he took office late last year .

he suggested cutting the presidential term from five to four years , and allowing incumbents to seek re-election to serve a maximum of eight years .
president roh said the new system would promote the continuation of policies and increase stability .
any change will not affect mr roh , who must step down in february 2008 .
south korea first adopted a single-term presidency in 1987 , after decades of authoritarian governments .
but there have been increasing calls for the law to be revoked , to allow successful presidents more time in power .
national referendum " the single five-year term adopted in 1987 aimed at preventing long-term rule has served its purpose , " mr roh said .
it " damages presidential responsibility as it is impossible for the president to have his performance evaluated through the next election , " he added .
he said he would collect views from the south korean people and then formally put forward a bill proposing the necessary constitutional amendments .
such bills must be approved by at least two-thirds of members of parliament , and confirmed by a national referendum .
mr roh himself was elected president in late 2002 , but during his term in office his popularity has plummeted .
his approval ratings currently stand at about 10 % , and the opposition grand national party -lrb- gnp -rrb- is seen as more likely to provide his successor than his own ruling uri party .

he suggested cutting the presidential term from five to four years , and allowing incumbents to seek re-election to serve a maximum of eight years .
president roh said the new system would promote the continuation of policies and increase stability .
any change will not affect mr roh , who must step down in february 2008 .
south korea first adopted a single-term presidency in 1987 , after decades of authoritarian governments .
but there have been increasing calls for the law to be revoked , to allow successful presidents more time in power .
national referendum " the single five-year term adopted in 1987 aimed at preventing long-term rule has served its purpose , " mr roh said .
it " damages presidential responsibility as it is impossible for the president to have his performance evaluated through the next election , " he added .
he said he would collect views from the south korean people and then formally put forward a bill proposing the necessary constitutional amendments .
such bills must be approved by at least two-thirds of members of parliament , and confirmed by a national referendum .
mr roh himself was elected president in late 2002 , but during his term in office his popularity has plummeted .
his approval ratings currently stand at about 10 % , and the opposition grand national party -lrb- gnp -rrb- is seen as more likely to provide his successor than his own ruling uri party .

many of the group , who call themselves rising tide , were involved in a protest at the same site in november .
they say the 150-mile -lrb- 241 km -rrb- gas pipeline being built from milford haven to gloucestershire will damage the environment .
contractor the national grid has said it will hold talks with activists .
last november protesters occupied part of the pipeline for more than a week .
the latest site under occupation is one where blasting with explosives was originally planned .
the department of trade and industry -lrb- dti -rrb- refused permission in november , saying it shared residents ' concerns that the route of the pipeline was too close to home .
instead national grid is planning to dig a shaft for the pipeline by mechanical " peckers " .
one group of protesters was camped on a public footpath which crosses an access road , stopping works vehicles getting through .
when you have the lng pipeline actually going past your back door or back garden , then obviously you are going to have a different viewpoint from people who are living in a safer zone rachel evans , trebanos resident another group , who said they were from gloucestershire , was camped higher on the site , by a section of the pipeline .
they were being supported by trebanos villagers who took part in demonstrations last year against the pipeline .
trebanos resident rachel evans said the group were " highlighting an issue that has n't gone away " .
she said : " when you have the lng pipeline actually going past your back door or back garden , then obviously you are going to have a different viewpoint from people who are living in a safer zone . "
' safety paramount ' caroline davidson of the national grid said a " small number " of demonstrators were involved in the latest protest .
" safety is paramount to national grid at all times and in all aspects of our work , " she said .
" however , we will be continuing construction of our essential natural gas pipeline when it is safe to do so . "
some residents opposed the use of explosives at trebanos ms davidson said contractors would be looking to talk to the protesters to discuss what concerns they had .
when complete , the pipeline will carry gas which has been imported as liquefied natural gas -lrb- lng -rrb- at milford haven and will eventually provide 20 % of the uk 's energy supply .
some residents in milford haven formed a campaign group , safe haven , to try to prevent two lng terminal being built in the town , citing concerns over safety .
an offshoot campaign , safe haven network , has also taken part in protests against the pipeline .
in november the protesters occupied a section of the pipeline at trebanos after initially being given permission to go onto the land by the owner .
the group , who said the pipe was not ecologically friendly or safe , lived in the pipeline for over a week , in cramped and wet conditions .
the action received support from many local people and some supplied food and clothes to the campaigners .

many of the group , who call themselves rising tide , were involved in a protest at the same site in november .
they say the 150-mile -lrb- 241 km -rrb- gas pipeline being built from milford haven to gloucestershire will damage the environment .
contractor the national grid has said it will hold talks with activists .
last november protesters occupied part of the pipeline for more than a week .
the latest site under occupation is one where blasting with explosives was originally planned .
the department of trade and industry -lrb- dti -rrb- refused permission in november , saying it shared residents ' concerns that the route of the pipeline was too close to home .
instead national grid is planning to dig a shaft for the pipeline by mechanical " peckers " .
one group of protesters was camped on a public footpath which crosses an access road , stopping works vehicles getting through .
when you have the lng pipeline actually going past your back door or back garden , then obviously you are going to have a different viewpoint from people who are living in a safer zone rachel evans , trebanos resident another group , who said they were from gloucestershire , was camped higher on the site , by a section of the pipeline .
they were being supported by trebanos villagers who took part in demonstrations last year against the pipeline .
trebanos resident rachel evans said the group were " highlighting an issue that has n't gone away " .
she said : " when you have the lng pipeline actually going past your back door or back garden , then obviously you are going to have a different viewpoint from people who are living in a safer zone . "
' safety paramount ' caroline davidson of the national grid said a " small number " of demonstrators were involved in the latest protest .
" safety is paramount to national grid at all times and in all aspects of our work , " she said .
" however , we will be continuing construction of our essential natural gas pipeline when it is safe to do so . "
some residents opposed the use of explosives at trebanos ms davidson said contractors would be looking to talk to the protesters to discuss what concerns they had .
when complete , the pipeline will carry gas which has been imported as liquefied natural gas -lrb- lng -rrb- at milford haven and will eventually provide 20 % of the uk 's energy supply .

the study found people in the uk spend 15 % of disposable income on transport and double the amount on fares spent by those in other european countries .
researchers also found that people spend 20 minutes longer travelling to work each week than 10 years ago .
increases in rail fares in the last few years and high levels of fuel duty are being blamed for the high costs .
fare costs doug mcwilliams , of the centre for economics and research , which carried out the study for bbc radio 4 's today programme , said : " the main thing we have discovered is that we in the uk pay more for our transport than anyone else does in europe .
" we spend 15 % of our disposable income on transport and of that 3.8 % is on fares .
" now , the amount we spend on fares is nearly double what they spend in france , germany and italy , the other main european countries . "
the bbc news website found that a standard off-peak single ticket between london and edinburgh cost £ 97.20 . "
i think we can criticise all governments but particularly the present one for a lack of focus " doug mcwilliams centre for economics and research a similar length journey between paris and bordeaux cost £ 70.75 , while the 310 mile trip between madrid and barcelona cost £ 47.50 .
mr mcwilliams said uk commuters also spent more in money and time than anyone else in europe on getting to work .
" more importantly we spend 20 minutes more travelling every week than we did 10 years ago . "
the government had a good record on investing in transport but had not focused the spending correctly , mr mcwilliams said .
as an example he said buses had been heavily subsidised but had seen a reduction in productivity .
" we are not going to solve the transport problem overnight , " mr mcwilliams said .
" however , i think we can criticise all government 's but particularly the present one for a lack of focus . "
the study comes after train companies introduced above-inflation price rises for rail tickets at the start of the year .
many areas ' regulated fares , which include season tickets and account for 40 % of tickets sold , have risen by 4.3 % - about 1 % above inflation .
meanwhile , the 60 % of fares which are set by private operators increased by up to 7.3 % , which is nearly three times the government 's 2.7 % target rate of inflation .
on many main lines it is the fourth successive year in which tickets have risen by more than inflation .
train companies say the extra money is to pay for service improvements .
the rises were heavily criticised by passenger groups and opposition politicians .
' lightly-taxed ' transport secretary douglas alexander said fares were lower in other european countries because they were subsidised by taxpayers .
he told the today programme : " there 's really two sources of funds for public transport here and across europe .
there 's the taxpayer and the fare-payer and as i understand it , your reports focuses on the fare-payer .
" it does n't recognise , as the oecd -lsb- organisation for economic co-operation and development -rsb- recognises , that the uk is a relatively lightly-taxed economy and if we want to see the kind of investment that 's needed in our public infrastructure , then we 're going to have to pay for it .
" we 're going to have to pay for it as taxpayers or as fare-payers and there 's a balance to be struck there , but historically that balance has been different in the united kingdom from elsewhere in europe . "
he added that commuting times were longer because people were living further away from their work places .

the study found people in the uk spend 15 % of disposable income on transport and double the amount on fares spent by those in other european countries .
researchers also found that people spend 20 minutes longer travelling to work each week than 10 years ago .
increases in rail fares in the last few years and high levels of fuel duty are being blamed for the high costs .
fare costs doug mcwilliams , of the centre for economics and research , which carried out the study for bbc radio 4 's today programme , said : " the main thing we have discovered is that we in the uk pay more for our transport than anyone else does in europe .
" we spend 15 % of our disposable income on transport and of that 3.8 % is on fares .
" now , the amount we spend on fares is nearly double what they spend in france , germany and italy , the other main european countries . "
the bbc news website found that a standard off-peak single ticket between london and edinburgh cost £ 97.20 .
i think we can criticise all governments but particularly the present one for a lack of focus doug mcwilliams centre for economics and research a similar length journey between paris and bordeaux cost £ 70.75 , while the 310 mile trip between madrid and barcelona cost £ 47.50 .
mr mcwilliams said uk commuters also spent more in money and time than anyone else in europe on getting to work .
" more importantly we spend 20 minutes more travelling every week than we did 10 years ago . "
the government had a good record on investing in transport but had not focused the spending correctly , mr mcwilliams said .
as an example he said buses had been heavily subsidised but had seen a reduction in productivity .
" we are not going to solve the transport problem overnight , " mr mcwilliams said .
" however , i think we can criticise all government 's but particularly the present one for a lack of focus . "
first great western was among the train firms which raised fares the study comes after train companies introduced above-inflation price rises for rail tickets at the start of the year .
many areas ' regulated fares , which include season tickets and account for 40 % of tickets sold , have risen by 4.3 % - about 1 % above inflation .
full list of train company fare rises meanwhile , the 60 % of fares which are set by private operators increased by up to 7.3 % , which is nearly three times the government 's 2.7 % target rate of inflation .
on many main lines it is the fourth successive year in which tickets have risen by more than inflation .
train companies say the extra money is to pay for service improvements .
the rises were heavily criticised by passenger groups and opposition politicians .
' lightly-taxed ' transport secretary douglas alexander said fares were lower in other european countries because they were subsidised by taxpayers .
he told the today programme : " there 's really two sources of funds for public transport here and across europe .
there 's the taxpayer and the fare-payer and as i understand it , your reports focuses on the fare-payer .
" it does n't recognise , as the oecd -lsb- organisation for economic co-operation and development -rsb- recognises , that the uk is a relatively lightly-taxed economy and if we want to see the kind of investment that 's needed in our public infrastructure , then we 're going to have to pay for it .
