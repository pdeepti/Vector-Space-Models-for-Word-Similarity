as part of their plan to instigate a communist uprising in what was then west germany , the group murdered hanns martin schleyer , head of the west german employers ' federation , jürgen ponto , head of dresdner bank , and attorney general siegfried buback . raf leader brigitte mohnhaupt was sentenced to five times life in prison plus 15 years .
after serving 24 years , the federal prosecutor 's office proposed monday that she be released early . the court 's decision will be announced in early february and the ex-terrorist could go free as early as march , when her minimum sentence of 24 years is up . " no longer a threat " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early on , mohnhaupt tried to rally raf members from prison , but has since been deemed harmless berlin 's tagesspiegel daily called the situation " an excursion into the paleozoic era of german terrorism that the regional appeals court in stuttgart has to undertake . "
the courts do n't deal with the red army faction very often anymore , wrote the paper .
mohnhaupt is one of four former raf members still serving time . " according to all the parameters that the constitutional state has at its disposal -lrb- she -rrb- has earned a second chance , " continued tagesspiegel .
" the now 57-year-old is no longer a threat to society . " even if mohnhaupt were still harboring extremist sentiment , she could not return to the raf .
it disbanded in 1998 , after having caused 34 deaths .
an additional 27 from the raf 's own ranks had also been killed or died . " let 's look at the issue matter-of-factly : according to criminal law , remorse is not a prerequisite for early release , " commented the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper .
" the main criteria is that the offender no longer poses a threat .
therefore , brigitte mohnhaupt 's case is clear . " " reconciliation takes two " christian klar 's situation is not so easy , continued the paper .
klar , who the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung referred to as the raf 's " cold implementer , " has also served 24 years but has two more to go to fulfill his minimum sentence , which will expire in january 2007 . klar has petitioned president horst köhler for an early pardon , which , for some , makes the question of remorse even more relevant . " for such an act , remorse would be very helpful , " wrote the stuttgarter nachrichten , referring to a possible presidential pardon .
" so far , klar has n't shown any .
reconciliation always takes both parties . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar has not expressed any regret the left-wing parties have shown support for the pardon , continued the paper , which would not be the first among former raf members .
former german presidents richard von weizsäcker , roman herzog and johannes rau have all pardoned raf terrorists . " the state does n't mourn " " the president can and should demand an apology from him - at the very least out of respect for the victim 's families , " wrote the tageszeitung daily .
" if klar is too proud for an apology , then he 'll get the regular court-ordered release - two years from now . " though the tagesspiegel conceded that the president 's decision to pardon klar would be a delicate one , especially considering the approaching 30th anniversary of the murders , the paper added that " it is one of the state 's greatest accomplishments that it can position itself between the offender and the victim . " " it is not the state 's job to mourn , " continued the paper .
" revenge can not be its motive .

" organic markets are global markets , " said gerald wehde , a spokesman for bioland , germany 's largest organic farming association .
" no store can get away with not offering organic products . " demand outpacing supply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain and other countries along the mediterranean supply germany with organic fruit indeed , conventional german shops and supermarkets are adding organic products to their shelves and exclusively organic shops are popping up in small and medium-sized cities so quickly that german farmers can no longer keep up with demand . " it would also be possible to sell many more german organic products if we were able to produce them , " said alexander gerber , general manager of the association of organic food producers and traders . taken by surprise by the organic market 's sudden growth , germany is dependent on imports because fewer local farmers have been choosing to switch from conventional to organic farming methods , gerber added . while no data exists to show what percentage of organic products sold in germany are imported , industry groups estimate between 20 and 30 percent come from outside the country . making the switch to organic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic guidelines regulate the number of animals in a pen and what they eat despite limited supply and increased demand , only small numbers of german farmers are adopting organic methods , gerber said . " the growth that we have in the german organic market is largely due to the fact that existing operations are growing , " he said .
" there are relatively few new farms switching . " the cost of changing over to organic methods and cuts in state support for farms are the main hurdles holding farmers back , wehde said . regulations on the conditions products have to meet to be considered organic also make it nearly impossible for farmers to change their fields over quickly .
it takes two years of production under organic standards before a field that produced conventional products can be certified as organic . trend expected to continue in 2007 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's organic branch has grown to include non-alcoholic drinks like bionade " we expect more german operations to switch in 2007 because there was a long quiet period over the last few years , " wehde said .
" we 'll have to wait and see if farmers think the positive signals coming from the market are enough to switch . " however , german agriculture minister horst seehofer said last week that he did think it was time to subsidize a growing market . " in a free society it should be up to the market to decide , " he said . at the beginning of 2006 there were some 17,000 organic farms on 810,000 hectares in germany , amounting to about 4.3 percent of land used for agricultural purposes . but , according to gerber , the government 's decision to lower aid from 2003 's average of about 160 euros per hectare to some 135 euros is shortsighted and wo n't help german farms compete against imports , especially when other european countries , such as austria , italy and slovenia , offer their farmers higher subsidies to increase exports . agriculture 's environmental impact bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some products , whether organic or not , will have to be imported the benefits of organic farming also go beyond helping german farmers , gerber said . " organic farming is the best way to maintain an environmentally friendly agriculture policy , " he said .
" for this reason there should be concrete incentive for organic practices over conventional farming . " wehde agreed that convincing more german farmers to switch to organic methods would be good for the environment as german and european organic standards apply only to how products are grown , not their environmental impact . " from an ecological point of view it is not just about the organic production but an overall environmental evaluation , " he said , adding that some imports , whether organic or not , could not be avoided .
" we do n't have anything against importing organic bananas , but it is a missed opportunity when milk and grains , which can be produced here in germany , are imported .

as part of their plan to instigate a communist uprising in what was then west germany , the group murdered hanns martin schleyer , head of the west german employers ' federation , jürgen ponto , head of dresdner bank , and attorney general siegfried buback . raf leader brigitte mohnhaupt was sentenced to five times life in prison plus 15 years .
after serving 24 years , the federal prosecutor 's office proposed monday that she be released early . the court 's decision will be announced in early february and the ex-terrorist could go free as early as march , when her minimum sentence of 24 years is up . " no longer a threat " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early on , mohnhaupt tried to rally raf members from prison , but has since been deemed harmless berlin 's tagesspiegel daily called the situation " an excursion into the paleozoic era of german terrorism that the regional appeals court in stuttgart has to undertake . "
the courts do n't deal with the red army faction very often anymore , wrote the paper .
mohnhaupt is one of four former raf members still serving time . " according to all the parameters that the constitutional state has at its disposal -lrb- she -rrb- has earned a second chance , " continued tagesspiegel .
" the now 57-year-old is no longer a threat to society . " even if mohnhaupt were still harboring extremist sentiment , she could not return to the raf .
it disbanded in 1998 , after having caused 34 deaths .
an additional 27 from the raf 's own ranks had also been killed or died . " let 's look at the issue matter-of-factly : according to criminal law , remorse is not a prerequisite for early release , " commented the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper .
" the main criteria is that the offender no longer poses a threat .
therefore , brigitte mohnhaupt 's case is clear . " " reconciliation takes two " christian klar 's situation is not so easy , continued the paper .
klar , who the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung referred to as the raf 's " cold implementer , " has also served 24 years but has two more to go to fulfill his minimum sentence , which will expire in january 2007 . klar has petitioned president horst köhler for an early pardon , which , for some , makes the question of remorse even more relevant . " for such an act , remorse would be very helpful , " wrote the stuttgarter nachrichten , referring to a possible presidential pardon .
" so far , klar has n't shown any .
reconciliation always takes both parties . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar has not expressed any regret the left-wing parties have shown support for the pardon , continued the paper , which would not be the first among former raf members .
former german presidents richard von weizsäcker , roman herzog and johannes rau have all pardoned raf terrorists . " the state does n't mourn " " the president can and should demand an apology from him - at the very least out of respect for the victim 's families , " wrote the tageszeitung daily .
" if klar is too proud for an apology , then he 'll get the regular court-ordered release - two years from now . " though the tagesspiegel conceded that the president 's decision to pardon klar would be a delicate one , especially considering the approaching 30th anniversary of the murders , the paper added that " it is one of the state 's greatest accomplishments that it can position itself between the offender and the victim .

as part of their plan to instigate a communist uprising in what was then west germany , the group murdered hanns martin schleyer , head of the west german employers ' federation , jürgen ponto , head of dresdner bank , and attorney general siegfried buback . raf leader brigitte mohnhaupt was sentenced to five times life in prison plus 15 years .
after serving 24 years , the federal prosecutor 's office proposed monday that she be released early . the court 's decision will be announced in early february and the ex-terrorist could go free as early as march , when her minimum sentence of 24 years is up . " no longer a threat " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early on , mohnhaupt tried to rally raf members from prison , but has since been deemed harmless berlin 's tagesspiegel daily called the situation " an excursion into the paleozoic era of german terrorism that the regional appeals court in stuttgart has to undertake . "
the courts do n't deal with the red army faction very often anymore , wrote the paper .
mohnhaupt is one of four former raf members still serving time . " according to all the parameters that the constitutional state has at its disposal -lrb- she -rrb- has earned a second chance , " continued tagesspiegel .
" the now 57-year-old is no longer a threat to society . " even if mohnhaupt were still harboring extremist sentiment , she could not return to the raf .
it disbanded in 1998 , after having caused 34 deaths .
an additional 27 from the raf 's own ranks had also been killed or died . " let 's look at the issue matter-of-factly : according to criminal law , remorse is not a prerequisite for early release , " commented the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper .
" the main criteria is that the offender no longer poses a threat .
therefore , brigitte mohnhaupt 's case is clear . " " reconciliation takes two " christian klar 's situation is not so easy , continued the paper .

as part of their plan to instigate a communist uprising in what was then west germany , the group murdered hanns martin schleyer , head of the west german employers ' federation , jürgen ponto , head of dresdner bank , and attorney general siegfried buback . raf leader brigitte mohnhaupt was sentenced to five times life in prison plus 15 years .
after serving 24 years , the federal prosecutor 's office proposed monday that she be released early . the court 's decision will be announced in early february and the ex-terrorist could go free as early as march , when her minimum sentence of 24 years is up . " no longer a threat " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early on , mohnhaupt tried to rally raf members from prison , but has since been deemed harmless berlin 's tagesspiegel daily called the situation " an excursion into the paleozoic era of german terrorism that the regional appeals court in stuttgart has to undertake .

mohnhaupt is one of four former raf members still serving time . " according to all the parameters that the constitutional state has at its disposal -lrb- she -rrb- has earned a second chance , " continued tagesspiegel .
" the now 57-year-old is no longer a threat to society . " even if mohnhaupt were still harboring extremist sentiment , she could not return to the raf .
it disbanded in 1998 , after having caused 34 deaths .
an additional 27 from the raf 's own ranks had also been killed or died . " let 's look at the issue matter-of-factly : according to criminal law , remorse is not a prerequisite for early release , " commented the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper .
" the main criteria is that the offender no longer poses a threat .
therefore , brigitte mohnhaupt 's case is clear . " " reconciliation takes two " christian klar 's situation is not so easy , continued the paper .
klar , who the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung referred to as the raf 's " cold implementer , " has also served 24 years but has two more to go to fulfill his minimum sentence , which will expire in january 2007 . klar has petitioned president horst köhler for an early pardon , which , for some , makes the question of remorse even more relevant .

reconciliation always takes both parties . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar has not expressed any regret the left-wing parties have shown support for the pardon , continued the paper , which would not be the first among former raf members .

" if klar is too proud for an apology , then he 'll get the regular court-ordered release - two years from now . " though the tagesspiegel conceded that the president 's decision to pardon klar would be a delicate one , especially considering the approaching 30th anniversary of the murders , the paper added that " it is one of the state 's greatest accomplishments that it can position itself between the offender and the victim .

as part of their plan to instigate a communist uprising in what was then west germany , the group murdered hanns martin schleyer , head of the west german employers ' federation , jürgen ponto , head of dresdner bank , and attorney general siegfried buback . raf leader brigitte mohnhaupt was sentenced to five times life in prison plus 15 years .
after serving 24 years , the federal prosecutor 's office proposed monday that she be released early . the court 's decision will be announced in early february and the ex-terrorist could go free as early as march , when her minimum sentence of 24 years is up . " no longer a threat " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early on , mohnhaupt tried to rally raf members from prison , but has since been deemed harmless berlin 's tagesspiegel daily called the situation " an excursion into the paleozoic era of german terrorism that the regional appeals court in stuttgart has to undertake . "
the courts do n't deal with the red army faction very often anymore , wrote the paper .
mohnhaupt is one of four former raf members still serving time . " according to all the parameters that the constitutional state has at its disposal -lrb- she -rrb- has earned a second chance , " continued tagesspiegel .
" the now 57-year-old is no longer a threat to society . " even if mohnhaupt were still harboring extremist sentiment , she could not return to the raf .
it disbanded in 1998 , after having caused 34 deaths .
an additional 27 from the raf 's own ranks had also been killed or died . " let 's look at the issue matter-of-factly : according to criminal law , remorse is not a prerequisite for early release , " commented the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper .
" the main criteria is that the offender no longer poses a threat .
therefore , brigitte mohnhaupt 's case is clear . " " reconciliation takes two " christian klar 's situation is not so easy , continued the paper .
klar , who the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung referred to as the raf 's " cold implementer , " has also served 24 years but has two more to go to fulfill his minimum sentence , which will expire in january 2007 . klar has petitioned president horst köhler for an early pardon , which , for some , makes the question of remorse even more relevant . " for such an act , remorse would be very helpful , " wrote the stuttgarter nachrichten , referring to a possible presidential pardon .
" so far , klar has n't shown any .
reconciliation always takes both parties . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar has not expressed any regret the left-wing parties have shown support for the pardon , continued the paper , which would not be the first among former raf members .
former german presidents richard von weizsäcker , roman herzog and johannes rau have all pardoned raf terrorists . " the state does n't mourn " " the president can and should demand an apology from him - at the very least out of respect for the victim 's families , " wrote the tageszeitung daily .
" if klar is too proud for an apology , then he 'll get the regular court-ordered release - two years from now . " though the tagesspiegel conceded that the president 's decision to pardon klar would be a delicate one , especially considering the approaching 30th anniversary of the murders , the paper added that " it is one of the state 's greatest accomplishments that it can position itself between the offender and the victim .

" organic markets are global markets , " said gerald wehde , a spokesman for bioland , germany 's largest organic farming association .
" no store can get away with not offering organic products . " demand outpacing supply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain and other countries along the mediterranean supply germany with organic fruit indeed , conventional german shops and supermarkets are adding organic products to their shelves and exclusively organic shops are popping up in small and medium-sized cities so quickly that german farmers can no longer keep up with demand . " it would also be possible to sell many more german organic products if we were able to produce them , " said alexander gerber , general manager of the association of organic food producers and traders . taken by surprise by the organic market 's sudden growth , germany is dependent on imports because fewer local farmers have been choosing to switch from conventional to organic farming methods , gerber added . while no data exists to show what percentage of organic products sold in germany are imported , industry groups estimate between 20 and 30 percent come from outside the country . making the switch to organic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic guidelines regulate the number of animals in a pen and what they eat despite limited supply and increased demand , only small numbers of german farmers are adopting organic methods , gerber said . " the growth that we have in the german organic market is largely due to the fact that existing operations are growing , " he said .
" there are relatively few new farms switching . " the cost of changing over to organic methods and cuts in state support for farms are the main hurdles holding farmers back , wehde said . regulations on the conditions products have to meet to be considered organic also make it nearly impossible for farmers to change their fields over quickly .
it takes two years of production under organic standards before a field that produced conventional products can be certified as organic . trend expected to continue in 2007 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's organic branch has grown to include non-alcoholic drinks like bionade " we expect more german operations to switch in 2007 because there was a long quiet period over the last few years , " wehde said .

dw-world.de 's readers sounded off . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . this galvanizing issue has mostly disappeared in the last few years .
why on earth would -lrb- angela merkel -rrb- want to inject this polarizing issue into a constitutional debate that will be difficult enough ?
she makes such a big mistake with this that my confidence in her political judgment is very shaken . - david sheegog , paoli , oklahoma , us christianity is the root of all of europe 's moral values . - marco gessler if the eu constitution says that europe has christian roots , that will be waving a flag which will only serve to deepen the current polarization between christians and muslims .
if christian origins are mentioned , it should be specified what that means .
tolerance , as angie -lrb- merkel -rrb- said recently ?
solidarity ?
it would be interesting to compare those values with what europe actually reflects today .
will -lrb- merkel -rrb- deny six centuries of harmonious cohabitation with muslims as well as jews ?
for someone who has read the bible and the koran , it is clear that there are no differences between believers .
i still wonder what the differences are between islam and christianity . - claudia molina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has said resolving the constitution issue is a priority during germany 's eu presidency i agree with merkel that the new eu charter should make a reference to europe 's christian roots .
to be quite honest , i do not see why we have to minimize christianity because we are afraid we will exclude secularists . - glenn forsythe it is disappointing that angela merkel is bringing up christianity precisely at a moment in which the world is in desperate need of finding a basis of interrelationship that is different from the traditional exclusiveness of religion - be it judaism , christianity or islam .
if merkel wishes to include a mention of europe 's " christian roots " in the european constitution , then it is fair to ask exactly which " roots " she is referring to .
" love your neighbor as you love yourself ? "
one hardly needs to be a christian to practice this way of life .
or is merkel referring to the christian root that states that only christians are saved and accepted by god ?
if so , then what merkel advocates is no better than what other extremists say . - paulo-juarez pereira i heartily agree with merkel .
others who have chosen to move into europe did so , one presumes , of their own free will and in a belief that it was a better place to live and work .
any adjustments should come from those who came here , not the other way around . - vivla ray hill compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel wants eu charter to make reference to christianity germany 's chancellor and current eu president angela merkel has renewed criticism that the bloc 's constitution does not explicitly refer to europe 's christian roots , in an interview to be published monday .
-lrb- 21.01.2007 -rrb- merkel to european parliament : " europe 's soul is tolerance " in a speech to the eu parliament in strasbourg , angela merkel spelled out her goals for germany 's presidency .
she stressed the need for progress on an eu constitution but also the fight against religious extremism .
-lrb- 17.01.2007 -rrb- eu constitution could make or break german eu presidency german chancellor angela merkel is scheduled to announce germany 's goals for its six-month eu presidency wednesday in strasbourg , but experts says it will be her plans for the eu constitution that get the most attention .

he added that the eu committee had based its findings only on newspaper reports while the confidential government documents available to him spoke a different language .
struck 's view is shared by spd general secretary hubertus heil , who denied that steinmeier should be blamed . speedy resolution ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz " we want to investigate the whole matter without delay , " he said .
" and this has to be done in the appropriate committees of the german parliament .
then everyone will see that there can be no doubt about the foreign minister 's integrity . " a social democratic inquiry panel member , thomas oppermann , also said that any allegation that the former government had actively prevented the release of kurnaz is far from the truth .
he did say , though , that there was an active exchange of views about kurnaz ' future between german and us intelligence officers . " what i can see from the documents made available to me is that there were indeed discussions between german and us intelligence agents about whether or not to release murat kurnaz from guantanamo on condition that he would be planted as a mole in germany 's radical islamic scene , " he said .
" but these discussions alone can not be construed as an official offer by us authorities to release kurnaz . " inhuman attitudes ? next week , the kurnaz case will be debated at length at a special meeting of a german parliamentary committee responsible for checking the intelligence agencies ' activities .
meanwhile germany 's mass circulation tabloid bild has asked why the former government should have cared at all about a turk who had no german citizenship . the chairman of the parliamentary probe , siegfried kauder , was outraged by such comments . " to ask why should we bother about this turk at all is inhuman , " he said .
" after all , kurnaz grew up in germany .
and if the government thought they should n't be concerned , they should have informed kurnaz ' lawyer so that he 'd be able to seek help elsewhere .
but to convey the impression that one cares and then do nothing would be inhuman . " the german public has been hearing about the kurnaz case for many weeks and now there 's an expectation that steinmeier will act to clear up the matter speedily .
however , he 's unlikely to testify to the inquiry panel before march after all witnesses have been heard . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu : germany refused us offer to release guantanamo inmate a german-born turk ended up imprisoned in guantanamo bay for three years longer than necessary after the former german government refused him entry to the country , an eu parliamentary committee said tuesday .

he added that the eu committee had based its findings only on newspaper reports while the confidential government documents available to him spoke a different language .
struck 's view is shared by spd general secretary hubertus heil , who denied that steinmeier should be blamed . speedy resolution ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz " we want to investigate the whole matter without delay , " he said .
" and this has to be done in the appropriate committees of the german parliament .
then everyone will see that there can be no doubt about the foreign minister 's integrity . " a social democratic inquiry panel member , thomas oppermann , also said that any allegation that the former government had actively prevented the release of kurnaz is far from the truth .
he did say , though , that there was an active exchange of views about kurnaz ' future between german and us intelligence officers . " what i can see from the documents made available to me is that there were indeed discussions between german and us intelligence agents about whether or not to release murat kurnaz from guantanamo on condition that he would be planted as a mole in germany 's radical islamic scene , " he said .
" but these discussions alone can not be construed as an official offer by us authorities to release kurnaz . " inhuman attitudes ? next week , the kurnaz case will be debated at length at a special meeting of a german parliamentary committee responsible for checking the intelligence agencies ' activities .
meanwhile germany 's mass circulation tabloid bild has asked why the former government should have cared at all about a turk who had no german citizenship . the chairman of the parliamentary probe , siegfried kauder , was outraged by such comments . " to ask why should we bother about this turk at all is inhuman , " he said .
" after all , kurnaz grew up in germany .
and if the government thought they should n't be concerned , they should have informed kurnaz ' lawyer so that he 'd be able to seek help elsewhere .
but to convey the impression that one cares and then do nothing would be inhuman . " the german public has been hearing about the kurnaz case for many weeks and now there 's an expectation that steinmeier will act to clear up the matter speedily .
however , he 's unlikely to testify to the inquiry panel before march after all witnesses have been heard . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu : germany refused us offer to release guantanamo inmate a german-born turk ended up imprisoned in guantanamo bay for three years longer than necessary after the former german government refused him entry to the country , an eu parliamentary committee said tuesday .

dw-world.de 's readers sounded off . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . this galvanizing issue has mostly disappeared in the last few years .
why on earth would -lrb- angela merkel -rrb- want to inject this polarizing issue into a constitutional debate that will be difficult enough ?
she makes such a big mistake with this that my confidence in her political judgment is very shaken . - david sheegog , paoli , oklahoma , us christianity is the root of all of europe 's moral values . - marco gessler if the eu constitution says that europe has christian roots , that will be waving a flag which will only serve to deepen the current polarization between christians and muslims .
if christian origins are mentioned , it should be specified what that means .
tolerance , as angie -lrb- merkel -rrb- said recently ?
solidarity ?
it would be interesting to compare those values with what europe actually reflects today .
will -lrb- merkel -rrb- deny six centuries of harmonious cohabitation with muslims as well as jews ?
for someone who has read the bible and the koran , it is clear that there are no differences between believers .
i still wonder what the differences are between islam and christianity . - claudia molina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has said resolving the constitution issue is a priority during germany 's eu presidency i agree with merkel that the new eu charter should make a reference to europe 's christian roots .
to be quite honest , i do not see why we have to minimize christianity because we are afraid we will exclude secularists . - glenn forsythe it is disappointing that angela merkel is bringing up christianity precisely at a moment in which the world is in desperate need of finding a basis of interrelationship that is different from the traditional exclusiveness of religion - be it judaism , christianity or islam .
if merkel wishes to include a mention of europe 's " christian roots " in the european constitution , then it is fair to ask exactly which " roots " she is referring to .
" love your neighbor as you love yourself ? "
one hardly needs to be a christian to practice this way of life .
or is merkel referring to the christian root that states that only christians are saved and accepted by god ?
if so , then what merkel advocates is no better than what other extremists say . - paulo-juarez pereira i heartily agree with merkel .
others who have chosen to move into europe did so , one presumes , of their own free will and in a belief that it was a better place to live and work .
any adjustments should come from those who came here , not the other way around . - vivla ray hill compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel wants eu charter to make reference to christianity germany 's chancellor and current eu president angela merkel has renewed criticism that the bloc 's constitution does not explicitly refer to europe 's christian roots , in an interview to be published monday .
-lrb- 21.01.2007 -rrb- merkel to european parliament : " europe 's soul is tolerance " in a speech to the eu parliament in strasbourg , angela merkel spelled out her goals for germany 's presidency .
she stressed the need for progress on an eu constitution but also the fight against religious extremism .
-lrb- 17.01.2007 -rrb- eu constitution could make or break german eu presidency german chancellor angela merkel is scheduled to announce germany 's goals for its six-month eu presidency wednesday in strasbourg , but experts says it will be her plans for the eu constitution that get the most attention .

the report was adopted with 28 in favor , 17 against and three abstentions . the document said britain , poland , italy , germany and seven other eu countries were aware of the secret flights and the us detention program and slammed them for failing to fulfill " the european obligations , such as the respect of human rights . " there were " at least 1,245 cia flight in european airspace " between the end of 2001 and the end of 2005 , including 336 cases of planes making stops in germany , according to the report . the committee 's final conclusions also charged the eu 's foreign policy and security chief javier solana with not cooperating in the investigation and failing to reveal his knowledge about the us detention program . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel backs fm under fire over ex-guantanamo inmate chancellor angela merkel has said she has full trust in foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who is under pressure over allegations he helped block the release of a german-born turk detained at guantanamo .

as part of their plan to instigate a communist uprising in what was then west germany , the group murdered hanns martin schleyer , head of the west german employers ' federation , jürgen ponto , head of dresdner bank , and attorney general siegfried buback . raf leader brigitte mohnhaupt was sentenced to five times life in prison plus 15 years .
after serving 24 years , the federal prosecutor 's office proposed monday that she be released early . the court 's decision will be announced in early february and the ex-terrorist could go free as early as march , when her minimum sentence of 24 years is up . " no longer a threat " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early on , mohnhaupt tried to rally raf members from prison , but has since been deemed harmless berlin 's tagesspiegel daily called the situation " an excursion into the paleozoic era of german terrorism that the regional appeals court in stuttgart has to undertake .

" the now 57-year-old is no longer a threat to society . " even if mohnhaupt were still harboring extremist sentiment , she could not return to the raf .
it disbanded in 1998 , after having caused 34 deaths .
an additional 27 from the raf 's own ranks had also been killed or died . " let 's look at the issue matter-of-factly : according to criminal law , remorse is not a prerequisite for early release , " commented the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper .
" the main criteria is that the offender no longer poses a threat .
therefore , brigitte mohnhaupt 's case is clear . " " reconciliation takes two " christian klar 's situation is not so easy , continued the paper .
klar , who the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung referred to as the raf 's " cold implementer , " has also served 24 years but has two more to go to fulfill his minimum sentence , which will expire in january 2007 . klar has petitioned president horst köhler for an early pardon , which , for some , makes the question of remorse even more relevant . " for such an act , remorse would be very helpful , " wrote the stuttgarter nachrichten , referring to a possible presidential pardon .
" so far , klar has n't shown any .
reconciliation always takes both parties . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar has not expressed any regret the left-wing parties have shown support for the pardon , continued the paper , which would not be the first among former raf members .
former german presidents richard von weizsäcker , roman herzog and johannes rau have all pardoned raf terrorists . " the state does n't mourn " " the president can and should demand an apology from him - at the very least out of respect for the victim 's families , " wrote the tageszeitung daily .
" if klar is too proud for an apology , then he 'll get the regular court-ordered release - two years from now . " though the tagesspiegel conceded that the president 's decision to pardon klar would be a delicate one , especially considering the approaching 30th anniversary of the murders , the paper added that " it is one of the state 's greatest accomplishments that it can position itself between the offender and the victim . " " it is not the state 's job to mourn , " continued the paper .

he added that the eu committee had based its findings only on newspaper reports while the confidential government documents available to him spoke a different language .
struck 's view is shared by spd general secretary hubertus heil , who denied that steinmeier should be blamed . speedy resolution ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz " we want to investigate the whole matter without delay , " he said .
" and this has to be done in the appropriate committees of the german parliament .
then everyone will see that there can be no doubt about the foreign minister 's integrity . " a social democratic inquiry panel member , thomas oppermann , also said that any allegation that the former government had actively prevented the release of kurnaz is far from the truth .
he did say , though , that there was an active exchange of views about kurnaz ' future between german and us intelligence officers . " what i can see from the documents made available to me is that there were indeed discussions between german and us intelligence agents about whether or not to release murat kurnaz from guantanamo on condition that he would be planted as a mole in germany 's radical islamic scene , " he said .
" but these discussions alone can not be construed as an official offer by us authorities to release kurnaz . " inhuman attitudes ? next week , the kurnaz case will be debated at length at a special meeting of a german parliamentary committee responsible for checking the intelligence agencies ' activities .
meanwhile germany 's mass circulation tabloid bild has asked why the former government should have cared at all about a turk who had no german citizenship . the chairman of the parliamentary probe , siegfried kauder , was outraged by such comments . " to ask why should we bother about this turk at all is inhuman , " he said .
" after all , kurnaz grew up in germany .
and if the government thought they should n't be concerned , they should have informed kurnaz ' lawyer so that he 'd be able to seek help elsewhere .
but to convey the impression that one cares and then do nothing would be inhuman . " the german public has been hearing about the kurnaz case for many weeks and now there 's an expectation that steinmeier will act to clear up the matter speedily .
however , he 's unlikely to testify to the inquiry panel before march after all witnesses have been heard . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu : germany refused us offer to release guantanamo inmate a german-born turk ended up imprisoned in guantanamo bay for three years longer than necessary after the former german government refused him entry to the country , an eu parliamentary committee said tuesday .

as part of their plan to instigate a communist uprising in what was then west germany , the group murdered hanns martin schleyer , head of the west german employers ' federation , jürgen ponto , head of dresdner bank , and attorney general siegfried buback . raf leader brigitte mohnhaupt was sentenced to five times life in prison plus 15 years .
after serving 24 years , the federal prosecutor 's office proposed monday that she be released early . the court 's decision will be announced in early february and the ex-terrorist could go free as early as march , when her minimum sentence of 24 years is up . " no longer a threat " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early on , mohnhaupt tried to rally raf members from prison , but has since been deemed harmless berlin 's tagesspiegel daily called the situation " an excursion into the paleozoic era of german terrorism that the regional appeals court in stuttgart has to undertake . "
the courts do n't deal with the red army faction very often anymore , wrote the paper .
mohnhaupt is one of four former raf members still serving time . " according to all the parameters that the constitutional state has at its disposal -lrb- she -rrb- has earned a second chance , " continued tagesspiegel .
" the now 57-year-old is no longer a threat to society . " even if mohnhaupt were still harboring extremist sentiment , she could not return to the raf .
it disbanded in 1998 , after having caused 34 deaths .
an additional 27 from the raf 's own ranks had also been killed or died . " let 's look at the issue matter-of-factly : according to criminal law , remorse is not a prerequisite for early release , " commented the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 23.01.2007 german social democrats question eu report on cia scandal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social democrats are not happy with the eu report members of germany social democratic party on tuesday criticized a report by an eu parliament commission that could damage their party colleague , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier . in its report on cia activities in europe , a special cross-party european committee among other things accuses the former german government under gerhard schröder of not having worked hard enough for the release of a german-born turk from the us prison camp at guantanamo . the report increases the political pressure on steinmeier , who was chief of staff in the chancellery office at the time and whose former activities are currently also being investigated by a parliamentary inquiry in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is facing mounting pressure reacting to the allegations of the european parliament commission , germany 's social democratic parliamentary floor leader peter struck said that he questioned the committee 's allegations that steinmeier had turned down an offer by us authorities to take german-born turk murat kurnaz back to germany in 2002 after he was found innocent during interrogations at the guantanamo prison camp . struck said that he was not aware of any evidence of such an offer ever being made by the united states .
he added that the eu committee had based its findings only on newspaper reports while the confidential government documents available to him spoke a different language .
struck 's view is shared by spd general secretary hubertus heil , who denied that steinmeier should be blamed . speedy resolution ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz " we want to investigate the whole matter without delay , " he said .
" and this has to be done in the appropriate committees of the german parliament .
then everyone will see that there can be no doubt about the foreign minister 's integrity . " a social democratic inquiry panel member , thomas oppermann , also said that any allegation that the former government had actively prevented the release of kurnaz is far from the truth .
he did say , though , that there was an active exchange of views about kurnaz ' future between german and us intelligence officers . " what i can see from the documents made available to me is that there were indeed discussions between german and us intelligence agents about whether or not to release murat kurnaz from guantanamo on condition that he would be planted as a mole in germany 's radical islamic scene , " he said .
" but these discussions alone can not be construed as an official offer by us authorities to release kurnaz . " inhuman attitudes ? next week , the kurnaz case will be debated at length at a special meeting of a german parliamentary committee responsible for checking the intelligence agencies ' activities .
meanwhile germany 's mass circulation tabloid bild has asked why the former government should have cared at all about a turk who had no german citizenship . the chairman of the parliamentary probe , siegfried kauder , was outraged by such comments . " to ask why should we bother about this turk at all is inhuman , " he said .
" after all , kurnaz grew up in germany .
and if the government thought they should n't be concerned , they should have informed kurnaz ' lawyer so that he 'd be able to seek help elsewhere .
but to convey the impression that one cares and then do nothing would be inhuman . " the german public has been hearing about the kurnaz case for many weeks and now there 's an expectation that steinmeier will act to clear up the matter speedily .
however , he 's unlikely to testify to the inquiry panel before march after all witnesses have been heard . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu : germany refused us offer to release guantanamo inmate a german-born turk ended up imprisoned in guantanamo bay for three years longer than necessary after the former german government refused him entry to the country , an eu parliamentary committee said tuesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 23.01.2007 should christianity be mentioned in the eu constitution ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the constitutional treaty back on the table , europe is reflecting on its identity german chancellor angela merkel said she would like the eu 's constitution to make a reference to europe 's christian roots .
dw-world.de 's readers sounded off . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . this galvanizing issue has mostly disappeared in the last few years .
why on earth would -lrb- angela merkel -rrb- want to inject this polarizing issue into a constitutional debate that will be difficult enough ?
she makes such a big mistake with this that my confidence in her political judgment is very shaken . - david sheegog , paoli , oklahoma , us christianity is the root of all of europe 's moral values . - marco gessler if the eu constitution says that europe has christian roots , that will be waving a flag which will only serve to deepen the current polarization between christians and muslims .
if christian origins are mentioned , it should be specified what that means .
tolerance , as angie -lrb- merkel -rrb- said recently ?
solidarity ?
it would be interesting to compare those values with what europe actually reflects today .
will -lrb- merkel -rrb- deny six centuries of harmonious cohabitation with muslims as well as jews ?
for someone who has read the bible and the koran , it is clear that there are no differences between believers .
i still wonder what the differences are between islam and christianity . - claudia molina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has said resolving the constitution issue is a priority during germany 's eu presidency i agree with merkel that the new eu charter should make a reference to europe 's christian roots .
to be quite honest , i do not see why we have to minimize christianity because we are afraid we will exclude secularists . - glenn forsythe it is disappointing that angela merkel is bringing up christianity precisely at a moment in which the world is in desperate need of finding a basis of interrelationship that is different from the traditional exclusiveness of religion - be it judaism , christianity or islam .
if merkel wishes to include a mention of europe 's " christian roots " in the european constitution , then it is fair to ask exactly which " roots " she is referring to .
" love your neighbor as you love yourself ? "
one hardly needs to be a christian to practice this way of life .
or is merkel referring to the christian root that states that only christians are saved and accepted by god ?
if so , then what merkel advocates is no better than what other extremists say . - paulo-juarez pereira i heartily agree with merkel .
others who have chosen to move into europe did so , one presumes , of their own free will and in a belief that it was a better place to live and work .

as part of their plan to instigate a communist uprising in what was then west germany , the group murdered hanns martin schleyer , head of the west german employers ' federation , jürgen ponto , head of dresdner bank , and attorney general siegfried buback . raf leader brigitte mohnhaupt was sentenced to five times life in prison plus 15 years .
after serving 24 years , the federal prosecutor 's office proposed monday that she be released early . the court 's decision will be announced in early february and the ex-terrorist could go free as early as march , when her minimum sentence of 24 years is up . " no longer a threat " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early on , mohnhaupt tried to rally raf members from prison , but has since been deemed harmless berlin 's tagesspiegel daily called the situation " an excursion into the paleozoic era of german terrorism that the regional appeals court in stuttgart has to undertake . "
the courts do n't deal with the red army faction very often anymore , wrote the paper .
mohnhaupt is one of four former raf members still serving time . " according to all the parameters that the constitutional state has at its disposal -lrb- she -rrb- has earned a second chance , " continued tagesspiegel .
" the now 57-year-old is no longer a threat to society . " even if mohnhaupt were still harboring extremist sentiment , she could not return to the raf .
it disbanded in 1998 , after having caused 34 deaths .
an additional 27 from the raf 's own ranks had also been killed or died . " let 's look at the issue matter-of-factly : according to criminal law , remorse is not a prerequisite for early release , " commented the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper .
" the main criteria is that the offender no longer poses a threat .
therefore , brigitte mohnhaupt 's case is clear . " " reconciliation takes two " christian klar 's situation is not so easy , continued the paper .
klar , who the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung referred to as the raf 's " cold implementer , " has also served 24 years but has two more to go to fulfill his minimum sentence , which will expire in january 2007 . klar has petitioned president horst köhler for an early pardon , which , for some , makes the question of remorse even more relevant . " for such an act , remorse would be very helpful , " wrote the stuttgarter nachrichten , referring to a possible presidential pardon .
" so far , klar has n't shown any .
reconciliation always takes both parties . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar has not expressed any regret the left-wing parties have shown support for the pardon , continued the paper , which would not be the first among former raf members .
former german presidents richard von weizsäcker , roman herzog and johannes rau have all pardoned raf terrorists . " the state does n't mourn " " the president can and should demand an apology from him - at the very least out of respect for the victim 's families , " wrote the tageszeitung daily .
" if klar is too proud for an apology , then he 'll get the regular court-ordered release - two years from now . " though the tagesspiegel conceded that the president 's decision to pardon klar would be a delicate one , especially considering the approaching 30th anniversary of the murders , the paper added that " it is one of the state 's greatest accomplishments that it can position itself between the offender and the victim . " " it is not the state 's job to mourn , " continued the paper .

the site crashed quickly under an avalanche of web surfers .

as of tuesday , google and its officers were once again registered as owner and contacts with denic , the german agency that distributes all domains with the suffix " .de.

monday german time .
he apologized and said all applications would be checked in the future . according to heise , goneo told denic to undo the change , but somebody else then secured the rights instead of google until about 9 a.m.

" organic markets are global markets , " said gerald wehde , a spokesman for bioland , germany 's largest organic farming association .
" no store can get away with not offering organic products . " demand outpacing supply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain and other countries along the mediterranean supply germany with organic fruit indeed , conventional german shops and supermarkets are adding organic products to their shelves and exclusively organic shops are popping up in small and medium-sized cities so quickly that german farmers can no longer keep up with demand . " it would also be possible to sell many more german organic products if we were able to produce them , " said alexander gerber , general manager of the association of organic food producers and traders . taken by surprise by the organic market 's sudden growth , germany is dependent on imports because fewer local farmers have been choosing to switch from conventional to organic farming methods , gerber added . while no data exists to show what percentage of organic products sold in germany are imported , industry groups estimate between 20 and 30 percent come from outside the country . making the switch to organic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic guidelines regulate the number of animals in a pen and what they eat despite limited supply and increased demand , only small numbers of german farmers are adopting organic methods , gerber said . " the growth that we have in the german organic market is largely due to the fact that existing operations are growing , " he said .
" there are relatively few new farms switching . " the cost of changing over to organic methods and cuts in state support for farms are the main hurdles holding farmers back , wehde said . regulations on the conditions products have to meet to be considered organic also make it nearly impossible for farmers to change their fields over quickly .
it takes two years of production under organic standards before a field that produced conventional products can be certified as organic . trend expected to continue in 2007 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's organic branch has grown to include non-alcoholic drinks like bionade " we expect more german operations to switch in 2007 because there was a long quiet period over the last few years , " wehde said .
" we 'll have to wait and see if farmers think the positive signals coming from the market are enough to switch . " however , german agriculture minister horst seehofer said last week that he did think it was time to subsidize a growing market . " in a free society it should be up to the market to decide , " he said . at the beginning of 2006 there were some 17,000 organic farms on 810,000 hectares in germany , amounting to about 4.3 percent of land used for agricultural purposes . but , according to gerber , the government 's decision to lower aid from 2003 's average of about 160 euros per hectare to some 135 euros is shortsighted and wo n't help german farms compete against imports , especially when other european countries , such as austria , italy and slovenia , offer their farmers higher subsidies to increase exports . agriculture 's environmental impact bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some products , whether organic or not , will have to be imported the benefits of organic farming also go beyond helping german farmers , gerber said . " organic farming is the best way to maintain an environmentally friendly agriculture policy , " he said .
" for this reason there should be concrete incentive for organic practices over conventional farming . " wehde agreed that convincing more german farmers to switch to organic methods would be good for the environment as german and european organic standards apply only to how products are grown , not their environmental impact . " from an ecological point of view it is not just about the organic production but an overall environmental evaluation , " he said , adding that some imports , whether organic or not , could not be avoided .
" we do n't have anything against importing organic bananas , but it is a missed opportunity when milk and grains , which can be produced here in germany , are imported .

he added that the eu committee had based its findings only on newspaper reports while the confidential government documents available to him spoke a different language .
struck 's view is shared by spd general secretary hubertus heil , who denied that steinmeier should be blamed . speedy resolution ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz " we want to investigate the whole matter without delay , " he said .
" and this has to be done in the appropriate committees of the german parliament .
then everyone will see that there can be no doubt about the foreign minister 's integrity . " a social democratic inquiry panel member , thomas oppermann , also said that any allegation that the former government had actively prevented the release of kurnaz is far from the truth .
he did say , though , that there was an active exchange of views about kurnaz ' future between german and us intelligence officers . " what i can see from the documents made available to me is that there were indeed discussions between german and us intelligence agents about whether or not to release murat kurnaz from guantanamo on condition that he would be planted as a mole in germany 's radical islamic scene , " he said .
" but these discussions alone can not be construed as an official offer by us authorities to release kurnaz . " inhuman attitudes ? next week , the kurnaz case will be debated at length at a special meeting of a german parliamentary committee responsible for checking the intelligence agencies ' activities .
meanwhile germany 's mass circulation tabloid bild has asked why the former government should have cared at all about a turk who had no german citizenship . the chairman of the parliamentary probe , siegfried kauder , was outraged by such comments . " to ask why should we bother about this turk at all is inhuman , " he said .
" after all , kurnaz grew up in germany .
and if the government thought they should n't be concerned , they should have informed kurnaz ' lawyer so that he 'd be able to seek help elsewhere .
but to convey the impression that one cares and then do nothing would be inhuman . " the german public has been hearing about the kurnaz case for many weeks and now there 's an expectation that steinmeier will act to clear up the matter speedily .
however , he 's unlikely to testify to the inquiry panel before march after all witnesses have been heard . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu : germany refused us offer to release guantanamo inmate a german-born turk ended up imprisoned in guantanamo bay for three years longer than necessary after the former german government refused him entry to the country , an eu parliamentary committee said tuesday .

as part of their plan to instigate a communist uprising in what was then west germany , the group murdered hanns martin schleyer , head of the west german employers ' federation , jürgen ponto , head of dresdner bank , and attorney general siegfried buback . raf leader brigitte mohnhaupt was sentenced to five times life in prison plus 15 years .
after serving 24 years , the federal prosecutor 's office proposed monday that she be released early . the court 's decision will be announced in early february and the ex-terrorist could go free as early as march , when her minimum sentence of 24 years is up . " no longer a threat " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early on , mohnhaupt tried to rally raf members from prison , but has since been deemed harmless berlin 's tagesspiegel daily called the situation " an excursion into the paleozoic era of german terrorism that the regional appeals court in stuttgart has to undertake .

the courts do n't deal with the red army faction very often anymore , wrote the paper .
mohnhaupt is one of four former raf members still serving time . " according to all the parameters that the constitutional state has at its disposal -lrb- she -rrb- has earned a second chance , " continued tagesspiegel .
" the now 57-year-old is no longer a threat to society . " even if mohnhaupt were still harboring extremist sentiment , she could not return to the raf .
it disbanded in 1998 , after having caused 34 deaths .
an additional 27 from the raf 's own ranks had also been killed or died . " let 's look at the issue matter-of-factly : according to criminal law , remorse is not a prerequisite for early release , " commented the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper .
" the main criteria is that the offender no longer poses a threat .
therefore , brigitte mohnhaupt 's case is clear . " " reconciliation takes two " christian klar 's situation is not so easy , continued the paper .
klar , who the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung referred to as the raf 's " cold implementer , " has also served 24 years but has two more to go to fulfill his minimum sentence , which will expire in january 2007 . klar has petitioned president horst köhler for an early pardon , which , for some , makes the question of remorse even more relevant . " for such an act , remorse would be very helpful , " wrote the stuttgarter nachrichten , referring to a possible presidential pardon .
" so far , klar has n't shown any .
reconciliation always takes both parties . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar has not expressed any regret the left-wing parties have shown support for the pardon , continued the paper , which would not be the first among former raf members .
former german presidents richard von weizsäcker , roman herzog and johannes rau have all pardoned raf terrorists . " the state does n't mourn " " the president can and should demand an apology from him - at the very least out of respect for the victim 's families , " wrote the tageszeitung daily .
" if klar is too proud for an apology , then he 'll get the regular court-ordered release - two years from now . " though the tagesspiegel conceded that the president 's decision to pardon klar would be a delicate one , especially considering the approaching 30th anniversary of the murders , the paper added that " it is one of the state 's greatest accomplishments that it can position itself between the offender and the victim .

he added that the eu committee had based its findings only on newspaper reports while the confidential government documents available to him spoke a different language .
struck 's view is shared by spd general secretary hubertus heil , who denied that steinmeier should be blamed . speedy resolution ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz " we want to investigate the whole matter without delay , " he said .
" and this has to be done in the appropriate committees of the german parliament .
then everyone will see that there can be no doubt about the foreign minister 's integrity . " a social democratic inquiry panel member , thomas oppermann , also said that any allegation that the former government had actively prevented the release of kurnaz is far from the truth .
he did say , though , that there was an active exchange of views about kurnaz ' future between german and us intelligence officers . " what i can see from the documents made available to me is that there were indeed discussions between german and us intelligence agents about whether or not to release murat kurnaz from guantanamo on condition that he would be planted as a mole in germany 's radical islamic scene , " he said .
" but these discussions alone can not be construed as an official offer by us authorities to release kurnaz . " inhuman attitudes ? next week , the kurnaz case will be debated at length at a special meeting of a german parliamentary committee responsible for checking the intelligence agencies ' activities .
meanwhile germany 's mass circulation tabloid bild has asked why the former government should have cared at all about a turk who had no german citizenship . the chairman of the parliamentary probe , siegfried kauder , was outraged by such comments . " to ask why should we bother about this turk at all is inhuman , " he said .
" after all , kurnaz grew up in germany .
and if the government thought they should n't be concerned , they should have informed kurnaz ' lawyer so that he 'd be able to seek help elsewhere .
but to convey the impression that one cares and then do nothing would be inhuman . " the german public has been hearing about the kurnaz case for many weeks and now there 's an expectation that steinmeier will act to clear up the matter speedily .
however , he 's unlikely to testify to the inquiry panel before march after all witnesses have been heard . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu : germany refused us offer to release guantanamo inmate a german-born turk ended up imprisoned in guantanamo bay for three years longer than necessary after the former german government refused him entry to the country , an eu parliamentary committee said tuesday .

" amicable discussions with man and vw are a priority .
the lapse of the bid provides an opportunity to do so without time pressure , " the statement said . investor ab and the wallenberg foundation , with a combined stake of 30.06 percent of voting rights , are closely linked to the influential swedish wallenberg family . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu approves truck maker man 's buyout of scania the european commission has approved plans by german truck maker and engineering conglomerate man to buy out its swedish rival scania .

he added that the eu committee had based its findings only on newspaper reports while the confidential government documents available to him spoke a different language .
struck 's view is shared by spd general secretary hubertus heil , who denied that steinmeier should be blamed . speedy resolution ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz " we want to investigate the whole matter without delay , " he said .
" and this has to be done in the appropriate committees of the german parliament .
then everyone will see that there can be no doubt about the foreign minister 's integrity . " a social democratic inquiry panel member , thomas oppermann , also said that any allegation that the former government had actively prevented the release of kurnaz is far from the truth .
he did say , though , that there was an active exchange of views about kurnaz ' future between german and us intelligence officers . " what i can see from the documents made available to me is that there were indeed discussions between german and us intelligence agents about whether or not to release murat kurnaz from guantanamo on condition that he would be planted as a mole in germany 's radical islamic scene , " he said .
" but these discussions alone can not be construed as an official offer by us authorities to release kurnaz . " inhuman attitudes ? next week , the kurnaz case will be debated at length at a special meeting of a german parliamentary committee responsible for checking the intelligence agencies ' activities .
meanwhile germany 's mass circulation tabloid bild has asked why the former government should have cared at all about a turk who had no german citizenship . the chairman of the parliamentary probe , siegfried kauder , was outraged by such comments . " to ask why should we bother about this turk at all is inhuman , " he said .
" after all , kurnaz grew up in germany .
and if the government thought they should n't be concerned , they should have informed kurnaz ' lawyer so that he 'd be able to seek help elsewhere .
but to convey the impression that one cares and then do nothing would be inhuman . " the german public has been hearing about the kurnaz case for many weeks and now there 's an expectation that steinmeier will act to clear up the matter speedily .
however , he 's unlikely to testify to the inquiry panel before march after all witnesses have been heard . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu : germany refused us offer to release guantanamo inmate a german-born turk ended up imprisoned in guantanamo bay for three years longer than necessary after the former german government refused him entry to the country , an eu parliamentary committee said tuesday .

swedish stock exchange regulators must concur before the takeover offer becomes void . both scania and its main swedish stakeholder investor ab welcomed the announcement by man . last year , man bid 10.3 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.3 billion -rrb- for the swedish group , saying a merged company would be a european champion of truck making .
it obtained about 15 per cent of scania , but investor flatly refused the offer . an unacceptable offer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen has a significant stake in scania volkswagen of germany , which controls 34 percent of scania voting rights and 20 percent of scania equity , confirmed earlier this month that the terms of the man offer were unacceptable , though it called on both sides to discuss merger alternatives .

" amicable discussions with man and vw are a priority .

as part of their plan to instigate a communist uprising in what was then west germany , the group murdered hanns martin schleyer , head of the west german employers ' federation , jürgen ponto , head of dresdner bank , and attorney general siegfried buback . raf leader brigitte mohnhaupt was sentenced to five times life in prison plus 15 years .
after serving 24 years , the federal prosecutor 's office proposed monday that she be released early . the court 's decision will be announced in early february and the ex-terrorist could go free as early as march , when her minimum sentence of 24 years is up . " no longer a threat " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early on , mohnhaupt tried to rally raf members from prison , but has since been deemed harmless berlin 's tagesspiegel daily called the situation " an excursion into the paleozoic era of german terrorism that the regional appeals court in stuttgart has to undertake . "
the courts do n't deal with the red army faction very often anymore , wrote the paper .
mohnhaupt is one of four former raf members still serving time . " according to all the parameters that the constitutional state has at its disposal -lrb- she -rrb- has earned a second chance , " continued tagesspiegel .
" the now 57-year-old is no longer a threat to society . " even if mohnhaupt were still harboring extremist sentiment , she could not return to the raf .
it disbanded in 1998 , after having caused 34 deaths .
an additional 27 from the raf 's own ranks had also been killed or died . " let 's look at the issue matter-of-factly : according to criminal law , remorse is not a prerequisite for early release , " commented the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper .
" the main criteria is that the offender no longer poses a threat .
therefore , brigitte mohnhaupt 's case is clear . " " reconciliation takes two " christian klar 's situation is not so easy , continued the paper .
klar , who the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung referred to as the raf 's " cold implementer , " has also served 24 years but has two more to go to fulfill his minimum sentence , which will expire in january 2007 . klar has petitioned president horst köhler for an early pardon , which , for some , makes the question of remorse even more relevant . " for such an act , remorse would be very helpful , " wrote the stuttgarter nachrichten , referring to a possible presidential pardon .
" so far , klar has n't shown any .
reconciliation always takes both parties . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar has not expressed any regret the left-wing parties have shown support for the pardon , continued the paper , which would not be the first among former raf members .
former german presidents richard von weizsäcker , roman herzog and johannes rau have all pardoned raf terrorists . " the state does n't mourn " " the president can and should demand an apology from him - at the very least out of respect for the victim 's families , " wrote the tageszeitung daily .
" if klar is too proud for an apology , then he 'll get the regular court-ordered release - two years from now . " though the tagesspiegel conceded that the president 's decision to pardon klar would be a delicate one , especially considering the approaching 30th anniversary of the murders , the paper added that " it is one of the state 's greatest accomplishments that it can position itself between the offender and the victim . " " it is not the state 's job to mourn , " continued the paper .

therefore , brigitte mohnhaupt 's case is clear . " " reconciliation takes two " christian klar 's situation is not so easy , continued the paper .
klar , who the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung referred to as the raf 's " cold implementer , " has also served 24 years but has two more to go to fulfill his minimum sentence , which will expire in january 2007 . klar has petitioned president horst köhler for an early pardon , which , for some , makes the question of remorse even more relevant . " for such an act , remorse would be very helpful , " wrote the stuttgarter nachrichten , referring to a possible presidential pardon .
" so far , klar has n't shown any .
reconciliation always takes both parties . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar has not expressed any regret the left-wing parties have shown support for the pardon , continued the paper , which would not be the first among former raf members .
former german presidents richard von weizsäcker , roman herzog and johannes rau have all pardoned raf terrorists . " the state does n't mourn " " the president can and should demand an apology from him - at the very least out of respect for the victim 's families , " wrote the tageszeitung daily .
" if klar is too proud for an apology , then he 'll get the regular court-ordered release - two years from now . " though the tagesspiegel conceded that the president 's decision to pardon klar would be a delicate one , especially considering the approaching 30th anniversary of the murders , the paper added that " it is one of the state 's greatest accomplishments that it can position itself between the offender and the victim . " " it is not the state 's job to mourn , " continued the paper .
" revenge can not be its motive .

he added that the eu committee had based its findings only on newspaper reports while the confidential government documents available to him spoke a different language .
struck 's view is shared by spd general secretary hubertus heil , who denied that steinmeier should be blamed . speedy resolution ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz " we want to investigate the whole matter without delay , " he said .
" and this has to be done in the appropriate committees of the german parliament .
then everyone will see that there can be no doubt about the foreign minister 's integrity . " a social democratic inquiry panel member , thomas oppermann , also said that any allegation that the former government had actively prevented the release of kurnaz is far from the truth .
he did say , though , that there was an active exchange of views about kurnaz ' future between german and us intelligence officers . " what i can see from the documents made available to me is that there were indeed discussions between german and us intelligence agents about whether or not to release murat kurnaz from guantanamo on condition that he would be planted as a mole in germany 's radical islamic scene , " he said .
" but these discussions alone can not be construed as an official offer by us authorities to release kurnaz . " inhuman attitudes ? next week , the kurnaz case will be debated at length at a special meeting of a german parliamentary committee responsible for checking the intelligence agencies ' activities .
meanwhile germany 's mass circulation tabloid bild has asked why the former government should have cared at all about a turk who had no german citizenship . the chairman of the parliamentary probe , siegfried kauder , was outraged by such comments . " to ask why should we bother about this turk at all is inhuman , " he said .
" after all , kurnaz grew up in germany .
and if the government thought they should n't be concerned , they should have informed kurnaz ' lawyer so that he 'd be able to seek help elsewhere .
but to convey the impression that one cares and then do nothing would be inhuman . " the german public has been hearing about the kurnaz case for many weeks and now there 's an expectation that steinmeier will act to clear up the matter speedily .
however , he 's unlikely to testify to the inquiry panel before march after all witnesses have been heard . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu : germany refused us offer to release guantanamo inmate a german-born turk ended up imprisoned in guantanamo bay for three years longer than necessary after the former german government refused him entry to the country , an eu parliamentary committee said tuesday .

" organic markets are global markets , " said gerald wehde , a spokesman for bioland , germany 's largest organic farming association .
" no store can get away with not offering organic products . " demand outpacing supply bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain and other countries along the mediterranean supply germany with organic fruit indeed , conventional german shops and supermarkets are adding organic products to their shelves and exclusively organic shops are popping up in small and medium-sized cities so quickly that german farmers can no longer keep up with demand . " it would also be possible to sell many more german organic products if we were able to produce them , " said alexander gerber , general manager of the association of organic food producers and traders . taken by surprise by the organic market 's sudden growth , germany is dependent on imports because fewer local farmers have been choosing to switch from conventional to organic farming methods , gerber added . while no data exists to show what percentage of organic products sold in germany are imported , industry groups estimate between 20 and 30 percent come from outside the country . making the switch to organic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic guidelines regulate the number of animals in a pen and what they eat despite limited supply and increased demand , only small numbers of german farmers are adopting organic methods , gerber said . " the growth that we have in the german organic market is largely due to the fact that existing operations are growing , " he said .
" there are relatively few new farms switching . " the cost of changing over to organic methods and cuts in state support for farms are the main hurdles holding farmers back , wehde said . regulations on the conditions products have to meet to be considered organic also make it nearly impossible for farmers to change their fields over quickly .
it takes two years of production under organic standards before a field that produced conventional products can be certified as organic . trend expected to continue in 2007 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's organic branch has grown to include non-alcoholic drinks like bionade " we expect more german operations to switch in 2007 because there was a long quiet period over the last few years , " wehde said .
" we 'll have to wait and see if farmers think the positive signals coming from the market are enough to switch . " however , german agriculture minister horst seehofer said last week that he did think it was time to subsidize a growing market . " in a free society it should be up to the market to decide , " he said . at the beginning of 2006 there were some 17,000 organic farms on 810,000 hectares in germany , amounting to about 4.3 percent of land used for agricultural purposes . but , according to gerber , the government 's decision to lower aid from 2003 's average of about 160 euros per hectare to some 135 euros is shortsighted and wo n't help german farms compete against imports , especially when other european countries , such as austria , italy and slovenia , offer their farmers higher subsidies to increase exports . agriculture 's environmental impact bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some products , whether organic or not , will have to be imported the benefits of organic farming also go beyond helping german farmers , gerber said . " organic farming is the best way to maintain an environmentally friendly agriculture policy , " he said .
" for this reason there should be concrete incentive for organic practices over conventional farming . " wehde agreed that convincing more german farmers to switch to organic methods would be good for the environment as german and european organic standards apply only to how products are grown , not their environmental impact . " from an ecological point of view it is not just about the organic production but an overall environmental evaluation , " he said , adding that some imports , whether organic or not , could not be avoided .
" we do n't have anything against importing organic bananas , but it is a missed opportunity when milk and grains , which can be produced here in germany , are imported .

he added that the eu committee had based its findings only on newspaper reports while the confidential government documents available to him spoke a different language .
struck 's view is shared by spd general secretary hubertus heil , who denied that steinmeier should be blamed . speedy resolution ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz " we want to investigate the whole matter without delay , " he said .
" and this has to be done in the appropriate committees of the german parliament .
then everyone will see that there can be no doubt about the foreign minister 's integrity . " a social democratic inquiry panel member , thomas oppermann , also said that any allegation that the former government had actively prevented the release of kurnaz is far from the truth .
he did say , though , that there was an active exchange of views about kurnaz ' future between german and us intelligence officers . " what i can see from the documents made available to me is that there were indeed discussions between german and us intelligence agents about whether or not to release murat kurnaz from guantanamo on condition that he would be planted as a mole in germany 's radical islamic scene , " he said .
" but these discussions alone can not be construed as an official offer by us authorities to release kurnaz . " inhuman attitudes ? next week , the kurnaz case will be debated at length at a special meeting of a german parliamentary committee responsible for checking the intelligence agencies ' activities .
meanwhile germany 's mass circulation tabloid bild has asked why the former government should have cared at all about a turk who had no german citizenship . the chairman of the parliamentary probe , siegfried kauder , was outraged by such comments . " to ask why should we bother about this turk at all is inhuman , " he said .
" after all , kurnaz grew up in germany .
and if the government thought they should n't be concerned , they should have informed kurnaz ' lawyer so that he 'd be able to seek help elsewhere .
but to convey the impression that one cares and then do nothing would be inhuman . " the german public has been hearing about the kurnaz case for many weeks and now there 's an expectation that steinmeier will act to clear up the matter speedily .
however , he 's unlikely to testify to the inquiry panel before march after all witnesses have been heard . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu : germany refused us offer to release guantanamo inmate a german-born turk ended up imprisoned in guantanamo bay for three years longer than necessary after the former german government refused him entry to the country , an eu parliamentary committee said tuesday .

the site crashed quickly under an avalanche of web surfers .

monday german time .
he apologized and said all applications would be checked in the future . according to heise , goneo told denic to undo the change , but somebody else then secured the rights instead of google until about 9 a.m.

to be quite honest , i do not see why we have to minimize christianity because we are afraid we will exclude secularists . - glenn forsythe it is disappointing that angela merkel is bringing up christianity precisely at a moment in which the world is in desperate need of finding a basis of interrelationship that is different from the traditional exclusiveness of religion - be it judaism , christianity or islam .
if merkel wishes to include a mention of europe 's " christian roots " in the european constitution , then it is fair to ask exactly which " roots " she is referring to .
" love your neighbor as you love yourself ? "
one hardly needs to be a christian to practice this way of life .
or is merkel referring to the christian root that states that only christians are saved and accepted by god ?
if so , then what merkel advocates is no better than what other extremists say . - paulo-juarez pereira i heartily agree with merkel .
others who have chosen to move into europe did so , one presumes , of their own free will and in a belief that it was a better place to live and work .
any adjustments should come from those who came here , not the other way around . - vivla ray hill compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel wants eu charter to make reference to christianity germany 's chancellor and current eu president angela merkel has renewed criticism that the bloc 's constitution does not explicitly refer to europe 's christian roots , in an interview to be published monday .
-lrb- 21.01.2007 -rrb- merkel to european parliament : " europe 's soul is tolerance " in a speech to the eu parliament in strasbourg , angela merkel spelled out her goals for germany 's presidency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press review -pipe- 23.01.2007 german press review : " remorse is not a prerequisite " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red army faction used violence to try to cause an uprising in west germany germany 's newspapers have been debating the possible early release of raf terrorist brigitte mohnhaupt and the petition for pardon that christian klar , another raf terrorist , submitted to the german president . in 1977 , the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- went on the offensive .
as part of their plan to instigate a communist uprising in what was then west germany , the group murdered hanns martin schleyer , head of the west german employers ' federation , jürgen ponto , head of dresdner bank , and attorney general siegfried buback . raf leader brigitte mohnhaupt was sentenced to five times life in prison plus 15 years .
after serving 24 years , the federal prosecutor 's office proposed monday that she be released early . the court 's decision will be announced in early february and the ex-terrorist could go free as early as march , when her minimum sentence of 24 years is up . " no longer a threat " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early on , mohnhaupt tried to rally raf members from prison , but has since been deemed harmless berlin 's tagesspiegel daily called the situation " an excursion into the paleozoic era of german terrorism that the regional appeals court in stuttgart has to undertake . "
the courts do n't deal with the red army faction very often anymore , wrote the paper .
mohnhaupt is one of four former raf members still serving time . " according to all the parameters that the constitutional state has at its disposal -lrb- she -rrb- has earned a second chance , " continued tagesspiegel .
" the now 57-year-old is no longer a threat to society . " even if mohnhaupt were still harboring extremist sentiment , she could not return to the raf .
it disbanded in 1998 , after having caused 34 deaths .
an additional 27 from the raf 's own ranks had also been killed or died . " let 's look at the issue matter-of-factly : according to criminal law , remorse is not a prerequisite for early release , " commented the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper .
" the main criteria is that the offender no longer poses a threat .
therefore , brigitte mohnhaupt 's case is clear . " " reconciliation takes two " christian klar 's situation is not so easy , continued the paper .
klar , who the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung referred to as the raf 's " cold implementer , " has also served 24 years but has two more to go to fulfill his minimum sentence , which will expire in january 2007 . klar has petitioned president horst köhler for an early pardon , which , for some , makes the question of remorse even more relevant . " for such an act , remorse would be very helpful , " wrote the stuttgarter nachrichten , referring to a possible presidential pardon .
" so far , klar has n't shown any .
reconciliation always takes both parties . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar has not expressed any regret the left-wing parties have shown support for the pardon , continued the paper , which would not be the first among former raf members .
former german presidents richard von weizsäcker , roman herzog and johannes rau have all pardoned raf terrorists . " the state does n't mourn " " the president can and should demand an apology from him - at the very least out of respect for the victim 's families , " wrote the tageszeitung daily .
" if klar is too proud for an apology , then he 'll get the regular court-ordered release - two years from now . " though the tagesspiegel conceded that the president 's decision to pardon klar would be a delicate one , especially considering the approaching 30th anniversary of the murders , the paper added that " it is one of the state 's greatest accomplishments that it can position itself between the offender and the victim . " " it is not the state 's job to mourn , " continued the paper .
" revenge can not be its motive .

" the former government of then-chancellor gerhard schröder was accused of abandoning kurnaz even after " us and german intelligence concluded , as early as 2002 , that murat kurnaz had no connection to al qaeda or the taliban and that he posed no terrorist threat . " us forces seized kurnaz in pakistan shortly after the sept .

at the time , steinmeier was schröder 's chief of staff and responsible for secret service activities . steinmeier rejected the european report 's conclusion that the german government prolonged kurnaz ' detention .

" the former government of then-chancellor gerhard schröder was accused of abandoning kurnaz even after " us and german intelligence concluded , as early as 2002 , that murat kurnaz had no connection to al qaeda or the taliban and that he posed no terrorist threat . " us forces seized kurnaz in pakistan shortly after the sept .

at the time , steinmeier was schröder 's chief of staff and responsible for secret service activities . steinmeier rejected the european report 's conclusion that the german government prolonged kurnaz ' detention . " i do not know of any such offer , " he said tuesday in brussels .

the report was adopted with 28 in favor , 17 against and three abstentions . the document said britain , poland , italy , germany and seven other eu countries were aware of the secret flights and the us detention program and slammed them for failing to fulfill " the european obligations , such as the respect of human rights . " there were " at least 1,245 cia flight in european airspace " between the end of 2001 and the end of 2005 , including 336 cases of planes making stops in germany , according to the report . the committee 's final conclusions also charged the eu 's foreign policy and security chief javier solana with not cooperating in the investigation and failing to reveal his knowledge about the us detention program . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel backs fm under fire over ex-guantanamo inmate chancellor angela merkel has said she has full trust in foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who is under pressure over allegations he helped block the release of a german-born turk detained at guantanamo .

" there were " at least 1,245 cia flight in european airspace " between the end of 2001 and the end of 2005 , including 336 cases of planes making stops in germany , according to the report . the committee 's final conclusions also charged the eu 's foreign policy and security chief javier solana with not cooperating in the investigation and failing to reveal his knowledge about the us detention program . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel backs fm under fire over ex-guantanamo inmate chancellor angela merkel has said she has full trust in foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , who is under pressure over allegations he helped block the release of a german-born turk detained at guantanamo .

as part of their plan to instigate a communist uprising in what was then west germany , the group murdered hanns martin schleyer , head of the west german employers ' federation , jürgen ponto , head of dresdner bank , and attorney general siegfried buback . raf leader brigitte mohnhaupt was sentenced to five times life in prison plus 15 years .
after serving 24 years , the federal prosecutor 's office proposed monday that she be released early . the court 's decision will be announced in early february and the ex-terrorist could go free as early as march , when her minimum sentence of 24 years is up . " no longer a threat " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early on , mohnhaupt tried to rally raf members from prison , but has since been deemed harmless berlin 's tagesspiegel daily called the situation " an excursion into the paleozoic era of german terrorism that the regional appeals court in stuttgart has to undertake . "
the courts do n't deal with the red army faction very often anymore , wrote the paper .
mohnhaupt is one of four former raf members still serving time . " according to all the parameters that the constitutional state has at its disposal -lrb- she -rrb- has earned a second chance , " continued tagesspiegel .
" the now 57-year-old is no longer a threat to society . " even if mohnhaupt were still harboring extremist sentiment , she could not return to the raf .
it disbanded in 1998 , after having caused 34 deaths .
an additional 27 from the raf 's own ranks had also been killed or died . " let 's look at the issue matter-of-factly : according to criminal law , remorse is not a prerequisite for early release , " commented the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper .
" the main criteria is that the offender no longer poses a threat .
therefore , brigitte mohnhaupt 's case is clear . " " reconciliation takes two " christian klar 's situation is not so easy , continued the paper .
klar , who the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung referred to as the raf 's " cold implementer , " has also served 24 years but has two more to go to fulfill his minimum sentence , which will expire in january 2007 . klar has petitioned president horst köhler for an early pardon , which , for some , makes the question of remorse even more relevant .

" so far , klar has n't shown any .
reconciliation always takes both parties . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar has not expressed any regret the left-wing parties have shown support for the pardon , continued the paper , which would not be the first among former raf members .
former german presidents richard von weizsäcker , roman herzog and johannes rau have all pardoned raf terrorists . " the state does n't mourn " " the president can and should demand an apology from him - at the very least out of respect for the victim 's families , " wrote the tageszeitung daily .
" if klar is too proud for an apology , then he 'll get the regular court-ordered release - two years from now . " though the tagesspiegel conceded that the president 's decision to pardon klar would be a delicate one , especially considering the approaching 30th anniversary of the murders , the paper added that " it is one of the state 's greatest accomplishments that it can position itself between the offender and the victim .

klar , who the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung referred to as the raf 's " cold implementer , " has also served 24 years but has two more to go to fulfill his minimum sentence , which will expire in january 2007 . klar has petitioned president horst köhler for an early pardon , which , for some , makes the question of remorse even more relevant .

" if klar is too proud for an apology , then he 'll get the regular court-ordered release - two years from now . " though the tagesspiegel conceded that the president 's decision to pardon klar would be a delicate one , especially considering the approaching 30th anniversary of the murders , the paper added that " it is one of the state 's greatest accomplishments that it can position itself between the offender and the victim .

he added that the eu committee had based its findings only on newspaper reports while the confidential government documents available to him spoke a different language .
struck 's view is shared by spd general secretary hubertus heil , who denied that steinmeier should be blamed . speedy resolution ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz " we want to investigate the whole matter without delay , " he said .
" and this has to be done in the appropriate committees of the german parliament .
then everyone will see that there can be no doubt about the foreign minister 's integrity . " a social democratic inquiry panel member , thomas oppermann , also said that any allegation that the former government had actively prevented the release of kurnaz is far from the truth .
he did say , though , that there was an active exchange of views about kurnaz ' future between german and us intelligence officers . " what i can see from the documents made available to me is that there were indeed discussions between german and us intelligence agents about whether or not to release murat kurnaz from guantanamo on condition that he would be planted as a mole in germany 's radical islamic scene , " he said .
" but these discussions alone can not be construed as an official offer by us authorities to release kurnaz . " inhuman attitudes ? next week , the kurnaz case will be debated at length at a special meeting of a german parliamentary committee responsible for checking the intelligence agencies ' activities .
meanwhile germany 's mass circulation tabloid bild has asked why the former government should have cared at all about a turk who had no german citizenship . the chairman of the parliamentary probe , siegfried kauder , was outraged by such comments . " to ask why should we bother about this turk at all is inhuman , " he said .
" after all , kurnaz grew up in germany .
and if the government thought they should n't be concerned , they should have informed kurnaz ' lawyer so that he 'd be able to seek help elsewhere .
but to convey the impression that one cares and then do nothing would be inhuman . " the german public has been hearing about the kurnaz case for many weeks and now there 's an expectation that steinmeier will act to clear up the matter speedily .
however , he 's unlikely to testify to the inquiry panel before march after all witnesses have been heard . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu : germany refused us offer to release guantanamo inmate a german-born turk ended up imprisoned in guantanamo bay for three years longer than necessary after the former german government refused him entry to the country , an eu parliamentary committee said tuesday .

the site crashed quickly under an avalanche of web surfers . " the problem was fixed in a short space of time , " said stefan keuchel , a spokesman for the german branch of the us company , which earns most of its revenues from online advertising . it remained unclear how nobody had noticed the unidentified hijacker when the domain - the ownership of the internet address - was re-registered late monday .
much of the process of registering web addresses is automated .
domains often expire and go to new owners . rightful owners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : whatever happened to google ?
as of tuesday , google and its officers were once again registered as owner and contacts with denic , the german agency that distributes all domains with the suffix " .de. " an online news service , heise , said the hijack lasted about 12 hours , beginning monday evening , and had resembled a 2004 attack in which an individual seized control of the ebay domain . heise quoted goneo 's chief executive marc keilwerth saying one of his customers had used an automated ordering process and secured control of the google.de name as of 8.30 p.m.
monday german time .
he apologized and said all applications would be checked in the future . according to heise , goneo told denic to undo the change , but somebody else then secured the rights instead of google until about 9 a.m.

dw-world.de 's readers sounded off . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . this galvanizing issue has mostly disappeared in the last few years .
why on earth would -lrb- angela merkel -rrb- want to inject this polarizing issue into a constitutional debate that will be difficult enough ?
she makes such a big mistake with this that my confidence in her political judgment is very shaken . - david sheegog , paoli , oklahoma , us christianity is the root of all of europe 's moral values . - marco gessler if the eu constitution says that europe has christian roots , that will be waving a flag which will only serve to deepen the current polarization between christians and muslims .
if christian origins are mentioned , it should be specified what that means .
tolerance , as angie -lrb- merkel -rrb- said recently ?
solidarity ?
it would be interesting to compare those values with what europe actually reflects today .
will -lrb- merkel -rrb- deny six centuries of harmonious cohabitation with muslims as well as jews ?
for someone who has read the bible and the koran , it is clear that there are no differences between believers .
i still wonder what the differences are between islam and christianity . - claudia molina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has said resolving the constitution issue is a priority during germany 's eu presidency i agree with merkel that the new eu charter should make a reference to europe 's christian roots .
to be quite honest , i do not see why we have to minimize christianity because we are afraid we will exclude secularists . - glenn forsythe it is disappointing that angela merkel is bringing up christianity precisely at a moment in which the world is in desperate need of finding a basis of interrelationship that is different from the traditional exclusiveness of religion - be it judaism , christianity or islam .
if merkel wishes to include a mention of europe 's " christian roots " in the european constitution , then it is fair to ask exactly which " roots " she is referring to .
" love your neighbor as you love yourself ? "
one hardly needs to be a christian to practice this way of life .
or is merkel referring to the christian root that states that only christians are saved and accepted by god ?
if so , then what merkel advocates is no better than what other extremists say . - paulo-juarez pereira i heartily agree with merkel .
others who have chosen to move into europe did so , one presumes , of their own free will and in a belief that it was a better place to live and work .
any adjustments should come from those who came here , not the other way around . - vivla ray hill compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel wants eu charter to make reference to christianity germany 's chancellor and current eu president angela merkel has renewed criticism that the bloc 's constitution does not explicitly refer to europe 's christian roots , in an interview to be published monday .
-lrb- 21.01.2007 -rrb- merkel to european parliament : " europe 's soul is tolerance " in a speech to the eu parliament in strasbourg , angela merkel spelled out her goals for germany 's presidency .
she stressed the need for progress on an eu constitution but also the fight against religious extremism .
-lrb- 17.01.2007 -rrb- eu constitution could make or break german eu presidency german chancellor angela merkel is scheduled to announce germany 's goals for its six-month eu presidency wednesday in strasbourg , but experts says it will be her plans for the eu constitution that get the most attention .

" the former government of then-chancellor gerhard schröder was accused of abandoning kurnaz even after " us and german intelligence concluded , as early as 2002 , that murat kurnaz had no connection to al qaeda or the taliban and that he posed no terrorist threat . " us forces seized kurnaz in pakistan shortly after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks in the united states and he was later sent to a us prison in afghanistan before being incarcerated at guantanamo bay in 2002 . he was released last august because of a lack of proof that he had belonged to a terrorist organization , following repeated appeals by current chancellor angela merkel to the us government after she took power in november 2005 . germany also investigating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said he was not aware of an offer to release kurnaz a german parliamentary committee is also investigating the former government 's alleged role in kurnaz ' imprisonment and thursday made similar allegations against the schröder administration , a coalition of social democrats and greens , which included current foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , of refusing kurnaz entry into germany .
at the time , steinmeier was schröder 's chief of staff and responsible for secret service activities . steinmeier rejected the european report 's conclusion that the german government prolonged kurnaz ' detention . " i do not know of any such offer , " he said tuesday in brussels . " mr. kurnaz ' long story of suffering in guantanamo is harrowing , " steinmeier said before adding that the eu 's accusations against him were " first of all false and also simply disgraceful . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said he wants to give testimony in germany soon under pressure to clarify his knowledge of kurnaz ' case , steinmeier said monday he would testify when called on by the german inquiry into the issue . in an interview with rbb radio , the committee 's head , siegfried kauder , said march was the earliest the panel would call on steinmeier .
other committee members , however , said they could imagine hearing his testimony sooner . the social democratic leader in the european investigation , wolfgang kreissl-dörfler , said steinmeier should not wait until being called before the parliamentary committee .

as part of their plan to instigate a communist uprising in what was then west germany , the group murdered hanns martin schleyer , head of the west german employers ' federation , jürgen ponto , head of dresdner bank , and attorney general siegfried buback . raf leader brigitte mohnhaupt was sentenced to five times life in prison plus 15 years .
after serving 24 years , the federal prosecutor 's office proposed monday that she be released early . the court 's decision will be announced in early february and the ex-terrorist could go free as early as march , when her minimum sentence of 24 years is up . " no longer a threat " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : early on , mohnhaupt tried to rally raf members from prison , but has since been deemed harmless berlin 's tagesspiegel daily called the situation " an excursion into the paleozoic era of german terrorism that the regional appeals court in stuttgart has to undertake . "
the courts do n't deal with the red army faction very often anymore , wrote the paper .
mohnhaupt is one of four former raf members still serving time . " according to all the parameters that the constitutional state has at its disposal -lrb- she -rrb- has earned a second chance , " continued tagesspiegel .
" the now 57-year-old is no longer a threat to society . " even if mohnhaupt were still harboring extremist sentiment , she could not return to the raf .
it disbanded in 1998 , after having caused 34 deaths .
an additional 27 from the raf 's own ranks had also been killed or died . " let 's look at the issue matter-of-factly : according to criminal law , remorse is not a prerequisite for early release , " commented the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper .
" the main criteria is that the offender no longer poses a threat .
therefore , brigitte mohnhaupt 's case is clear . " " reconciliation takes two " christian klar 's situation is not so easy , continued the paper .
klar , who the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung referred to as the raf 's " cold implementer , " has also served 24 years but has two more to go to fulfill his minimum sentence , which will expire in january 2007 . klar has petitioned president horst köhler for an early pardon , which , for some , makes the question of remorse even more relevant . " for such an act , remorse would be very helpful , " wrote the stuttgarter nachrichten , referring to a possible presidential pardon .
" so far , klar has n't shown any .
reconciliation always takes both parties . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar has not expressed any regret the left-wing parties have shown support for the pardon , continued the paper , which would not be the first among former raf members .
former german presidents richard von weizsäcker , roman herzog and johannes rau have all pardoned raf terrorists . " the state does n't mourn " " the president can and should demand an apology from him - at the very least out of respect for the victim 's families , " wrote the tageszeitung daily .
" if klar is too proud for an apology , then he 'll get the regular court-ordered release - two years from now . " though the tagesspiegel conceded that the president 's decision to pardon klar would be a delicate one , especially considering the approaching 30th anniversary of the murders , the paper added that " it is one of the state 's greatest accomplishments that it can position itself between the offender and the victim .

klar , who the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung referred to as the raf 's " cold implementer , " has also served 24 years but has two more to go to fulfill his minimum sentence , which will expire in january 2007 . klar has petitioned president horst köhler for an early pardon , which , for some , makes the question of remorse even more relevant . " for such an act , remorse would be very helpful , " wrote the stuttgarter nachrichten , referring to a possible presidential pardon .
" so far , klar has n't shown any .
reconciliation always takes both parties . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian klar has not expressed any regret the left-wing parties have shown support for the pardon , continued the paper , which would not be the first among former raf members .
former german presidents richard von weizsäcker , roman herzog and johannes rau have all pardoned raf terrorists . " the state does n't mourn " " the president can and should demand an apology from him - at the very least out of respect for the victim 's families , " wrote the tageszeitung daily .
" if klar is too proud for an apology , then he 'll get the regular court-ordered release - two years from now . " though the tagesspiegel conceded that the president 's decision to pardon klar would be a delicate one , especially considering the approaching 30th anniversary of the murders , the paper added that " it is one of the state 's greatest accomplishments that it can position itself between the offender and the victim . " " it is not the state 's job to mourn , " continued the paper .

the environment , immigration and workplace portfolios have all changed hands - and all three are thought to be key election issues .
mr howard faces an uphill task as his liberal party battles to win re-election for a historic fifth term .
the main opposition labor party is riding high in recent opinion polls , as is its new leader kevin rudd .
water key issue the cabinet changes announced on tuesday reflect many of the key issues facing australian politics at the moment .
the country is currently suffering its worst drought on record , and both climate change and water management are seen as important issues for voters .
the new environment minister is malcolm turnbull - a former merchant banker , best known for his failed attempt to make australia a republic in a 1999 referendum .
mr rudd -lrb- r -rrb- and his labor party are riding high in the polls " there is no doubt issues relating to climate change and water are going to be important , " mr howard told reporters , when announcing mr turnbull 's appointment .
" i think it is an effective concentration of the firepower of the prominent people within the government . "
another controversial issue is immigration , and the current immigration minister , amanda vanstone , will be replaced by kevin andrews .
ms vanstone 's department has been involved in a series of embarrassing mistakes in recent years , including the detention and erroneous deportation of australian citizens .
kevin andrews ' previous job , that of employment and workplace relations minister , will be taken over by joe hockey .
his job is also seen as important in the run-up to the election , as changes in labour laws are likely to have a large impact on voters .
other key figures , such as treasurer peter costello , finance minister nick minchin and foreign minister alexander downer have kept their posts in the reshuffle .
poll woes after almost 11 years in power , mr howard is due to call an election at some point in the second half of this year .
a recent poll by the australian newspaper showed that labor is currently in line to win 55 % of the vote , compared to 45 % for the ruling coalition of mr howard 's liberal party and the national party .
mr howard 's personal voter satisfaction level is 46 % , while new labor leader kevin rudd 's is 56 % , the poll found .
analysts say mr howard has lost a lot of his popularity because of his decision to deploy troops in the us-led war in iraq in 2003 .
some 1,400 soldiers are still in the region .
more than 60 % of voters polled by the australian survey said they opposed the government 's handling of the iraq crisis , and 71 % said the issue was important to how they would vote .

but although this flintshire trunk road may lack the allure of route 66 , plans to turn it into seven lanes have prompted a chorus of disagreement .
john butler , from shotton , flintshire , was driven to write " a494 agony " because of his concerns .
the welsh assembly government says it suffers from congestion , but critics fear disruption and more pollution .
mr butler , a retired retailer , said he wanted to make people smile , but also raise some of the more serious issues behind the scheme .
" i wrote the song to put a humorous but thoughtful slant on it , " he said .
" if i can put a smile on peoples ' faces then great - whether they be students , pensioners , young or old . "
he added : " it 's a very serious issue .
" i have two grandchildren and i realise that a project this big is not just for now , it will affect future generations for hundreds of years .
" i believe this is a social injustice and it 's outrageous that people should have this forced upon them without the powers that be giving them all the details . "
the a494 links the a55 with the north-west of england , bypassing places like ewloe , aston and queensferry .
it has a speed limit of 50mph , but the plans would see a stretch near queensferry turned into a seven-lane road , with speed limits of up to 70mph .
many residents from aston on deeside are opposed to the scheme , fearing rises in pollution , noise , and busier roads .
in his song , mr butler refers to the new road being a convenient shortcut to ireland for continental truck operators .
he also sings about " gogs " against the motorway , gogs being a nickname for north walians taken from gogledd cymru , meaning north wales .
extract from a494 agony " visitors on holiday are welcome to our shore but left-hand speeding juggernauts we do n't need any more !
environment , not " food-miles " this is where we stand it 's ' gogs ' against a motorway - carving up our land ! "
chorus : " they 're piling on the agony , piling on the style they plan to desecrate our roads with more noise by the mile we 'll always keep a welcome - with a love that never fails but we do n't need a motorway across the top of wales ! "
" ' gogs ' ca n't get down to cardiff town ' taffs ' ca n't get up to us the toffs may fly but we must try by bike or auto-bus we 'd like a hi-speed railway-link that joins our lovely land but folks in our assembly do n't seem to understand ! "

eric nerhus , 41 , was diving off cape howe on australia 's south-east coast when he was attacked .
a fellow diver said the three-metre -lrb- 10-foot -rrb- shark bit mr nerhus from the head down , crushing his face mask inwards and breaking his nose .
he managed to break free and was hauled aboard a waiting boat .
his condition is described as serious but stable .
" eric is a tough boy , he 's super-fit , " his friend and fellow diver dennis luobikis told reporters .
" but i would say that would test anyone 's resolve , being a fish lunch . "
second bite mr luobikis , mr nerhus and his son - as well as other friends - were fishing for abalone off the coast , some 400km -lrb- 249 miles -rrb- south of sydney , when the attack happened .
" he was actually bitten by the head down , the shark swallowed his head , " mr luobikis said .
the shark then took a second bite , this time seizing mr nerhus by the body and biting into his torso .
mr luobikis said his friend " pushed his abalone chisel " into the shark 's head , managing to wrestle himself free before the shark swam away .
" he came up to the surface and was going : " help , help there 's a shark , " mr nerhus 's 25-year-old son mark said later .
" and i went over and there was a big pool of blood , and i pulled him out of the water he was just : " get me to shore , get me to shore " . "
mr nerhus was airlifted to hospital where doctors said he was suffering from blood loss and shock .
shark attacks are not uncommon in australian waters , the bbc 's nick bryant in sydney says .
there are around 15 a year - one of the highest rates in the world .
an average of one a year is fatal .

" like a pressure cooker about to explode , " i said .
that 's how it feels .
with the announcement of the new plan to secure baghdad , it is not just the americans and iraqi government gearing up for a last big push .
the insurgents and militias are too .
many seem to be starting their offensive early .
the violence becomes more vicious , random and constant .
gunfire in our part of baghdad carries on long into the night now .
the distinctive sound of mortars being fired or car bombs wake us up most mornings .
but several incidents stand out .
a gangland-style shooting at an evening groceries market in east baghdad .
gunmen drove up and raked the stalls with machinegun rounds , leaving at least 10 people dead and many others injured .
then there was the devastating double-bombing at mustansiriya university in east baghdad last week , in which 70 people were killed - most of them young students .
one hundred and seventy others were injured .
first , a car bomb was set off at the university entrance .
then , a suicide bomber detonated his explosives vest in a crowd fleeing the scene .
rescue workers arriving to retrieve the dead and wounded were greeted by the sound of dozens of mobile phones ringing amongst the wreckage , as friends and relatives tried again and again to check on the fate of loved ones .
just as depressing now is how quickly such events are forgotten .
seventy students dead in one attack .
it is an amazing figure .
anywhere else it would be a story for days .
yet as soon as the wreckage is cleared , so too are the memories .
we still travel round the city , to try to report on what 's happening .
but we are being more cautious than ever .
crucial contacts few are aware just how important technology has become in this conflict .
i 'm not talking about american laser-guided weaponry and their all-seeing drones flying above baghdad 24 hours a day .
what 's just as significant is the access ordinary iraqis now have to day-to-day communication devices like mobiles and the internet .
some use it as part of their fight , others to survive .
a quiet revolution has occurred since saddam 's overthrow .
you did n't have broadband under the baath party .
you do now .
millions of iraqis own mobiles .
despite the violence , the phone companies have gradually expanded coverage - although their security budgets are astronomical .
even in places like falluja , you get good reception .
a surreal moment comes to mind , when i was there with a us patrol .
my uk mobile rang .
it was my credit card company , wanting to check a purchase .
as i was talking , the patrol came under fire .
" i 'm a bit busy now , i 'll call you back , " i shouted as i ducked behind a humvee . "

prevented from reaching her college because of fighting in her area , an academic friend decided to email questions to her students for their english literature exam .
i 've mentioned her before in previous diaries .
she talks more and more of leaving .
but as long as she stays , she is determined to keep trying to educate her students , even if she now rarely sees them face to face .
but computers and baghdad 's dysfunctional power system are not a happy partnership .
her area was without power for more than a week recently .
the back-up neighbourhood generator had been damaged by a bomb .
eventually they got it fixed .
but then a passing us military vehicle snagged the electricity cables in her street .
only one thing for it .
she sent the questions out by text message .
her problem now is how to gather up all the exam papers .
snuff film it will probably be one of the most bizarre press conferences i will cover , certainly the most grotesque .
right up to the moment it started , none of us there really knew what to expect .
but the way we were searched beforehand told us something .
an unusually determined crowd of iraqi police officers surrounded the entrance to the room .
we had to give up all our cameras , mobiles and microphones .
one notebook and pen was all we were allowed .
some journalists had watches and sunglasses taken away , in case they held some kind of recorder .
the new york times correspondent even had his hair searched .
it was the day barzan ibrahim al-tikriti , saddam hussein 's half brother , and awad al-bandar , the former chief judge of his revolutionary court , had been executed .
we had had a clue that yet again , something had gone wrong .
we got word that the two men had been executed early in the morning and reported it .
but then some officials started to deny they had announced the execution .
the government would not confirm it had happened officially .
eventually , by late-morning , ali dabbagh , the iraqi prime minister 's spokesman announced the news - and nervously added the unfortunate detail .
the head of saddam 's half brother had become " separated " from his body .
the hangman had got his macabre calculations of his weight wrong and given him too much rope .
but he said no video of the event would be shown this time .
by the afternoon though , the first conspiracy theories were circulating on the streets of baghdad .
as with saddam 's execution , it was taking on sectarian overtones .
some were saying the shias had beheaded barzan , a sunni .
so we journalists were called in , to try to scotch the rumours .
" we want you to be eyewitnesses , as if you were there at the execution , " said ali dabbagh .
but the video will not be released , he said .
" this was an act of god . "
" but please , " he said , before starting the video .
" no prayers or chanting in any religious way . "
the first surprise once the film started was what the two men were wearing - orange jump suits of the kind that have become infamous from guantanamo bay .
in some ways it was no surprise .
the two men were in us custody .
but you would have thought someone would have seen the potential downside of having them appear on the execution stand in those clothes .
both men appeared to be on the verge of tears - faces stretched in anguish .
but there was no sound .
so , even now , we do not have a full picture of what happened .
then the final moment came .
the trap doors opened beneath the feet of the two men .
almost instantaneously the rope round barzan al-tikriti 's neck jerks upwards .
and then the camera man panned down to the pit below where we saw his body and the head , still covered by a hood , lying some distance away .
there was a stunned silence in the room .
but not just because of what we had seen , i think .
also because of what this meant - that the iraqi government is so worried and insecure , it has to show videos like this .

eventually , by late-morning , ali dabbagh , the iraqi prime minister 's spokesman announced the news - and nervously added the unfortunate detail .
the head of saddam 's half brother had become " separated " from his body .
the hangman had got his macabre calculations of his weight wrong and given him too much rope .
but he said no video of the event would be shown this time .
by the afternoon though , the first conspiracy theories were circulating on the streets of baghdad .
as with saddam 's execution , it was taking on sectarian overtones .
some were saying the shias had beheaded barzan , a sunni .
so we journalists were called in , to try to scotch the rumours .
" we want you to be eyewitnesses , as if you were there at the execution , " said ali dabbagh .
but the video will not be released , he said .
" this was an act of god . "
" but please , " he said , before starting the video .
" no prayers or chanting in any religious way . "
the first surprise once the film started was what the two men were wearing - orange jump suits of the kind that have become infamous from guantanamo bay .
in some ways it was no surprise .
the two men were in us custody .
but you would have thought someone would have seen the potential downside of having them appear on the execution stand in those clothes .
both men appeared to be on the verge of tears - faces stretched in anguish .
but there was no sound .
so , even now , we do not have a full picture of what happened .
then the final moment came .
the trap doors opened beneath the feet of the two men .
almost instantaneously the rope round barzan al-tikriti 's neck jerks upwards .
and then the camera man panned down to the pit below where we saw his body and the head , still covered by a hood , lying some distance away .
there was a stunned silence in the room .
but not just because of what we had seen , i think .
also because of what this meant - that the iraqi government is so worried and insecure , it has to show videos like this .

" like a pressure cooker about to explode , " i said .
that 's how it feels .
with the announcement of the new plan to secure baghdad , it is not just the americans and iraqi government gearing up for a last big push .
the insurgents and militias are too .
many seem to be starting their offensive early .
blood-stained bread : bombings are an every-day occurrence in baghdad the violence becomes more vicious , random and constant .
gunfire in our part of baghdad carries on long into the night now .
the distinctive sound of mortars being fired or car bombs wake us up most mornings .
but several incidents stand out .
a gangland-style shooting at an evening groceries market in east baghdad .
gunmen drove up and raked the stalls with machinegun rounds , leaving at least 10 people dead and many others injured .
then there was the devastating double-bombing at mustansiriya university in east baghdad last week , in which 70 people were killed - most of them young students .
one hundred and seventy others were injured .
first , a car bomb was set off at the university entrance .
then , a suicide bomber detonated his explosives vest in a crowd fleeing the scene .
rescue workers arriving to retrieve the dead and wounded were greeted by the sound of dozens of mobile phones ringing amongst the wreckage , as friends and relatives tried again and again to check on the fate of loved ones .
just as depressing now is how quickly such events are forgotten .
seventy students dead in one attack .
it is an amazing figure .
anywhere else it would be a story for days .
yet as soon as the wreckage is cleared , so too are the memories .
we still travel round the city , to try to report on what 's happening .
but we are being more cautious than ever .
crucial contacts few are aware just how important technology has become in this conflict .
i 'm not talking about american laser-guided weaponry and their all-seeing drones flying above baghdad 24 hours a day .
even travelling across baghdad has become too dangerous for many what 's just as significant is the access ordinary iraqis now have to day-to-day communication devices like mobiles and the internet .
some use it as part of their fight , others to survive .
a quiet revolution has occurred since saddam 's overthrow .
you did n't have broadband under the baath party .
you do now .
millions of iraqis own mobiles .
despite the violence , the phone companies have gradually expanded coverage - although their security budgets are astronomical .
even in places like falluja , you get good reception .
a surreal moment comes to mind , when i was there with a us patrol .
my uk mobile rang .
it was my credit card company , wanting to check a purchase .
as i was talking , the patrol came under fire .
" i 'm a bit busy now , i 'll call you back , " i shouted as i ducked behind a humvee .
prevented from reaching her college because of fighting in her area , an academic friend decided to email questions to her students for their english literature exam the camera-equipped mobile phone has a central place in iraqi history now , thanks to the notorious video of saddam hussein 's execution .
but for ali , a doctor , it was also the only way he could show his parents and relatives his newborn son .
it is just too dangerous for him to travel across town to where his parents live .
insurgent groups have long used the internet and mobiles to get their message out , distributing clips of attacks on the americans - long before any us version of events is available .
wealthier families use internet phones to keep in touch with loved ones across the city and abroad .
prevented from reaching her college because of fighting in her area , an academic friend decided to email questions to her students for their english literature exam .
i 've mentioned her before in previous diaries .
she talks more and more of leaving .
but as long as she stays , she is determined to keep trying to educate her students , even if she now rarely sees them face to face .
but computers and baghdad 's dysfunctional power system are not a happy partnership .
her area was without power for more than a week recently .
the back-up neighbourhood generator had been damaged by a bomb .
eventually they got it fixed .
but then a passing us military vehicle snagged the electricity cables in her street .
only one thing for it .
she sent the questions out by text message .
her problem now is how to gather up all the exam papers .
snuff film it will probably be one of the most bizarre press conferences i will cover , certainly the most grotesque .
right up to the moment it started , none of us there really knew what to expect .
but the way we were searched beforehand told us something .
an unusually determined crowd of iraqi police officers surrounded the entrance to the room .
we had to give up all our cameras , mobiles and microphones .
one notebook and pen was all we were allowed .
some journalists had watches and sunglasses taken away , in case they held some kind of recorder .
the new york times correspondent even had his hair searched .
it was the day barzan ibrahim al-tikriti , saddam hussein 's half brother , and awad al-bandar , the former chief judge of his revolutionary court , had been executed .
we had had a clue that yet again , something had gone wrong .

" like a pressure cooker about to explode , " i said .
that 's how it feels .
with the announcement of the new plan to secure baghdad , it is not just the americans and iraqi government gearing up for a last big push .
the insurgents and militias are too .
many seem to be starting their offensive early .
blood-stained bread : bombings are an every-day occurrence in baghdad the violence becomes more vicious , random and constant .
gunfire in our part of baghdad carries on long into the night now .
the distinctive sound of mortars being fired or car bombs wake us up most mornings .
but several incidents stand out .
a gangland-style shooting at an evening groceries market in east baghdad .
gunmen drove up and raked the stalls with machinegun rounds , leaving at least 10 people dead and many others injured .
then there was the devastating double-bombing at mustansiriya university in east baghdad last week , in which 70 people were killed - most of them young students .
one hundred and seventy others were injured .
first , a car bomb was set off at the university entrance .
then , a suicide bomber detonated his explosives vest in a crowd fleeing the scene .
rescue workers arriving to retrieve the dead and wounded were greeted by the sound of dozens of mobile phones ringing amongst the wreckage , as friends and relatives tried again and again to check on the fate of loved ones .
just as depressing now is how quickly such events are forgotten .
seventy students dead in one attack .
it is an amazing figure .
anywhere else it would be a story for days .
yet as soon as the wreckage is cleared , so too are the memories .
we still travel round the city , to try to report on what 's happening .
but we are being more cautious than ever .
crucial contacts few are aware just how important technology has become in this conflict .
i 'm not talking about american laser-guided weaponry and their all-seeing drones flying above baghdad 24 hours a day .
even travelling across baghdad has become too dangerous for many what 's just as significant is the access ordinary iraqis now have to day-to-day communication devices like mobiles and the internet .
some use it as part of their fight , others to survive .
a quiet revolution has occurred since saddam 's overthrow .
you did n't have broadband under the baath party .
you do now .
millions of iraqis own mobiles .
despite the violence , the phone companies have gradually expanded coverage - although their security budgets are astronomical .
even in places like falluja , you get good reception .
a surreal moment comes to mind , when i was there with a us patrol .
my uk mobile rang .
it was my credit card company , wanting to check a purchase .
as i was talking , the patrol came under fire .
" i 'm a bit busy now , i 'll call you back , " i shouted as i ducked behind a humvee .
prevented from reaching her college because of fighting in her area , an academic friend decided to email questions to her students for their english literature exam the camera-equipped mobile phone has a central place in iraqi history now , thanks to the notorious video of saddam hussein 's execution .
but for ali , a doctor , it was also the only way he could show his parents and relatives his newborn son .
it is just too dangerous for him to travel across town to where his parents live .
insurgent groups have long used the internet and mobiles to get their message out , distributing clips of attacks on the americans - long before any us version of events is available .
wealthier families use internet phones to keep in touch with loved ones across the city and abroad .
prevented from reaching her college because of fighting in her area , an academic friend decided to email questions to her students for their english literature exam .
i 've mentioned her before in previous diaries .
she talks more and more of leaving .
but as long as she stays , she is determined to keep trying to educate her students , even if she now rarely sees them face to face .
but computers and baghdad 's dysfunctional power system are not a happy partnership .
her area was without power for more than a week recently .
the back-up neighbourhood generator had been damaged by a bomb .
eventually they got it fixed .
but then a passing us military vehicle snagged the electricity cables in her street .
only one thing for it .
she sent the questions out by text message .
her problem now is how to gather up all the exam papers .
snuff film it will probably be one of the most bizarre press conferences i will cover , certainly the most grotesque .
right up to the moment it started , none of us there really knew what to expect .
but the way we were searched beforehand told us something .
an unusually determined crowd of iraqi police officers surrounded the entrance to the room .
we had to give up all our cameras , mobiles and microphones .
one notebook and pen was all we were allowed .
some journalists had watches and sunglasses taken away , in case they held some kind of recorder .
the new york times correspondent even had his hair searched .
it was the day barzan ibrahim al-tikriti , saddam hussein 's half brother , and awad al-bandar , the former chief judge of his revolutionary court , had been executed .
we had had a clue that yet again , something had gone wrong .
we got word that the two men had been executed early in the morning and reported it .
but then some officials started to deny they had announced the execution .
the government would not confirm it had happened officially .
eventually , by late-morning , ali dabbagh , the iraqi prime minister 's spokesman announced the news - and nervously added the unfortunate detail .
the head of saddam 's half brother had become " separated " from his body .
the hangman had got his macabre calculations of his weight wrong and given him too much rope .
but he said no video of the event would be shown this time .
by the afternoon though , the first conspiracy theories were circulating on the streets of baghdad .
as with saddam 's execution , it was taking on sectarian overtones .
some were saying the shias had beheaded barzan , a sunni .
so we journalists were called in , to try to scotch the rumours .
" we want you to be eyewitnesses , as if you were there at the execution , " said ali dabbagh .
but the video will not be released , he said .
" this was an act of god . "
" but please , " he said , before starting the video .
" no prayers or chanting in any religious way . "
the first surprise once the film started was what the two men were wearing - orange jump suits of the kind that have become infamous from guantanamo bay .
in some ways it was no surprise .
the two men were in us custody .
but you would have thought someone would have seen the potential downside of having them appear on the execution stand in those clothes .
both men appeared to be on the verge of tears - faces stretched in anguish .
but there was no sound .
so , even now , we do not have a full picture of what happened .
then the final moment came .
the trap doors opened beneath the feet of the two men .
almost instantaneously the rope round barzan al-tikriti 's neck jerks upwards .
and then the camera man panned down to the pit below where we saw his body and the head , still covered by a hood , lying some distance away .
there was a stunned silence in the room .
but not just because of what we had seen , i think .
also because of what this meant - that the iraqi government is so worried and insecure , it has to show videos like this .

blood-stained bread : bombings are an every-day occurrence in baghdad the violence becomes more vicious , random and constant .
gunfire in our part of baghdad carries on long into the night now .
the distinctive sound of mortars being fired or car bombs wake us up most mornings .
but several incidents stand out .
a gangland-style shooting at an evening groceries market in east baghdad .
gunmen drove up and raked the stalls with machinegun rounds , leaving at least 10 people dead and many others injured .
then there was the devastating double-bombing at mustansiriya university in east baghdad last week , in which 70 people were killed - most of them young students .
one hundred and seventy others were injured .
first , a car bomb was set off at the university entrance .
then , a suicide bomber detonated his explosives vest in a crowd fleeing the scene .
rescue workers arriving to retrieve the dead and wounded were greeted by the sound of dozens of mobile phones ringing amongst the wreckage , as friends and relatives tried again and again to check on the fate of loved ones .
just as depressing now is how quickly such events are forgotten .
seventy students dead in one attack .
it is an amazing figure .
anywhere else it would be a story for days .
yet as soon as the wreckage is cleared , so too are the memories .
we still travel round the city , to try to report on what 's happening .
but we are being more cautious than ever .
crucial contacts few are aware just how important technology has become in this conflict .
i 'm not talking about american laser-guided weaponry and their all-seeing drones flying above baghdad 24 hours a day .
even travelling across baghdad has become too dangerous for many what 's just as significant is the access ordinary iraqis now have to day-to-day communication devices like mobiles and the internet .
some use it as part of their fight , others to survive .
a quiet revolution has occurred since saddam 's overthrow .
you did n't have broadband under the baath party .
you do now .
millions of iraqis own mobiles .
despite the violence , the phone companies have gradually expanded coverage - although their security budgets are astronomical .
even in places like falluja , you get good reception .
a surreal moment comes to mind , when i was there with a us patrol .
my uk mobile rang .
it was my credit card company , wanting to check a purchase .
as i was talking , the patrol came under fire .
" i 'm a bit busy now , i 'll call you back , " i shouted as i ducked behind a humvee .
prevented from reaching her college because of fighting in her area , an academic friend decided to email questions to her students for their english literature exam the camera-equipped mobile phone has a central place in iraqi history now , thanks to the notorious video of saddam hussein 's execution .
but for ali , a doctor , it was also the only way he could show his parents and relatives his newborn son .
it is just too dangerous for him to travel across town to where his parents live .
insurgent groups have long used the internet and mobiles to get their message out , distributing clips of attacks on the americans - long before any us version of events is available .
wealthier families use internet phones to keep in touch with loved ones across the city and abroad .
prevented from reaching her college because of fighting in her area , an academic friend decided to email questions to her students for their english literature exam .
i 've mentioned her before in previous diaries .
she talks more and more of leaving .
but as long as she stays , she is determined to keep trying to educate her students , even if she now rarely sees them face to face .
but computers and baghdad 's dysfunctional power system are not a happy partnership .
her area was without power for more than a week recently .
the back-up neighbourhood generator had been damaged by a bomb .
eventually they got it fixed .
but then a passing us military vehicle snagged the electricity cables in her street .
only one thing for it .
she sent the questions out by text message .
her problem now is how to gather up all the exam papers .
snuff film it will probably be one of the most bizarre press conferences i will cover , certainly the most grotesque .
right up to the moment it started , none of us there really knew what to expect .
but the way we were searched beforehand told us something .
an unusually determined crowd of iraqi police officers surrounded the entrance to the room .
we had to give up all our cameras , mobiles and microphones .
one notebook and pen was all we were allowed .
some journalists had watches and sunglasses taken away , in case they held some kind of recorder .
the new york times correspondent even had his hair searched .
it was the day barzan ibrahim al-tikriti , saddam hussein 's half brother , and awad al-bandar , the former chief judge of his revolutionary court , had been executed .
we had had a clue that yet again , something had gone wrong .
we got word that the two men had been executed early in the morning and reported it .
but then some officials started to deny they had announced the execution .
the government would not confirm it had happened officially .
eventually , by late-morning , ali dabbagh , the iraqi prime minister 's spokesman announced the news - and nervously added the unfortunate detail .
the head of saddam 's half brother had become " separated " from his body .
the hangman had got his macabre calculations of his weight wrong and given him too much rope .
but he said no video of the event would be shown this time .
by the afternoon though , the first conspiracy theories were circulating on the streets of baghdad .
as with saddam 's execution , it was taking on sectarian overtones .
some were saying the shias had beheaded barzan , a sunni .
so we journalists were called in , to try to scotch the rumours .
" we want you to be eyewitnesses , as if you were there at the execution , " said ali dabbagh .
but the video will not be released , he said .
" this was an act of god . "
" but please , " he said , before starting the video .
" no prayers or chanting in any religious way . "
the first surprise once the film started was what the two men were wearing - orange jump suits of the kind that have become infamous from guantanamo bay .
in some ways it was no surprise .
the two men were in us custody .
but you would have thought someone would have seen the potential downside of having them appear on the execution stand in those clothes .
both men appeared to be on the verge of tears - faces stretched in anguish .
but there was no sound .
so , even now , we do not have a full picture of what happened .
then the final moment came .
the trap doors opened beneath the feet of the two men .
almost instantaneously the rope round barzan al-tikriti 's neck jerks upwards .
and then the camera man panned down to the pit below where we saw his body and the head , still covered by a hood , lying some distance away .
there was a stunned silence in the room .
but not just because of what we had seen , i think .
also because of what this meant - that the iraqi government is so worried and insecure , it has to show videos like this .

the page is now closed .
thank you for your emails .
the comments published reflect a balance of views we have received .
this for me was possibly one of the most moving , informative and relevant documentaries in recent times .
i would strongly suggest this be shown in schools .
informing children of the real social consequences of western consumerism / politics would surely be as much a deterent as a picture of a missing septum ?
frances smith , brighton a very informative and truthful programme highlighting the real issues faced by a poor country like bolivia .
hopefully we will see more documentaries from this under-reported continent .
martyn , warrington another programme about drugs and crime in latin america !
do n't you get tired of it ?
myself and my brazilian wife do .
do you think nothing good ever happens in south america and that all the people are involved in drugs and crime ?
do you think all the kids there are on the streets and poor ?
that 's all we ever see about brazil too !
john rowlands , liverpool thank you this world for this documentary .
it is sad to see the predicament of the families and generations in the jungle .
the coca leaves are providing essential income for these families living in unacceptable poverty .
i can understand why the women and the mothers carry drugs .
the us government should shoulder the responsibility , in my view .
their law threatens to take away the livelihood of the cocaleros , hence the basic human needs of food , clothes and shelter .
angela , glasgow i , like toria , worked with an ngo in san sabastian prison in 2004-5 .
by teaching the women crafts , they not only have the means to support themselves , but also to support their children .
previously , women would send their children to beg on the streets to earn money , but with the introduction of the crafts project , laundry and bakery , the women have means to pay their rent and buy their food in the prison .
even though their parents are locked in the prison , the children have the freedom to come and go .
across the square from san sebastian is a childrens project , giving the kids of prisoners the skills and activites which will set them up for life , and so hopefully less likely to follow the path their mothers were obliged to take .
niki , london people should open their eyes and see how the west have turned a little girl into a drug carrier .
we all should stand and put a stop to it .
newman , london in colombia many coca growers used to grow coffee and switched to more lucrative coca when the coffee price fell through the floor and they could n't feed their children .
we need to develop a more balanced , adult , drugs policy and curtail the " free trade " with the third world that is anything but .
until then , while we screw up their lives with globalisation , they should feel quite ok about screwing up our lives with addictive drugs .
moflard , uk i actually worked with the ladies in san sebastian prison and some ex-prisoners for a year in 2003-04 through an ngo .
i taught them art and craft so that they could sell the handicraft they made through the small business we were trying to develop .
the ladies inside are in a desperate state - locked in a vicious cycle of poverty .
many of them have several kids , no husband and have no way of feeding their children as unemployment is high .
it is a very sad situation .
someone offers them money to carry a package from a to b and it is very tempting .
however once caught they are sucked into further debt as they have to pay for their stay in prison as well as for lawyers to try to get them out .
it is very stressful for them living each day not knowing if they will have enough food or if they will ever be able to break out of the cycle they are in .
in many ways i think if coca leaves really could be marketed and sold for their medicinal purposes worldwide , like peppermint tea , there would be sufficient work for the cocaleros so they would not have to resort to producing cocaine .
i actually really liked coca leaf tea and drank it all the time there .
toria , guildford i made a point of watching this documentary with my 16-year-old daughter , at her request .
congratulations to all the team and participants who brought this to our screens .
what is so sad for most of these people is that there seems to be so little choice for them in their lives and they have so little control over their destiny .
what can we do to help - campaign to have the law changed ?
highlight their plight ?
but what then , what can we actually do to help to make a difference in their lives ?
we feel so helpless .
maria croydon , dublin an excellent programme giving an insight into the lives of many bolivian people .
our friends are currently in cochabamba working in an orphanage for six months and it was good to see the area and people .
the situation out there at the moment is very volatile and there were riots in cochabamba last week with two dead and the town hall burnt down .
we would be interested in more programmes focusing on the politics of this area .
anne marie proudfoot , manchester according to the coca museum in la paz , 50 % of the world 's cocaine is consumed in the us .
this points to the problem being in the us , yet , they pursue a foreign policy which bullies countries like bolivia into passing laws which send a 12-year-old girl to prison .
i 'm sure their influence and cash could be used in a far more positive manner .
ron mackenzie , edinburgh the best film about coca in bolivia since brian moser 's 1970s films .
excellent translating , good camera work and all rang very true .
it made sensible points about the logicality of the main consuming nation -lrb- us -rrb- trying to penalise the poor producing countries .
david p , oxford i feel for the poor people in bolivia , but drugs are not good and they never will be .
why can the world not help poorer countries unite and form uber-countries where poverty can be resolved ?
edward lewis , macclesfield it is so depressing that this child was pulled to such a destiny .
if they gave a hand to this child when she was first caught she would n't have gone so far .
there is no justice in this world .
while one is dying from bombs , others are out and about enjoying life to the maximum !
i hope for peace and love between all nations and all religions .
canan , london bolivia is a big country with such diversity you 'd probably have years of amazing documentary footage to make , but by doing a film about drugs and how poor people are , you also send the completely wrong message to an audience that already has no idea about the place .

newman , london in colombia many coca growers used to grow coffee and switched to more lucrative coca when the coffee price fell through the floor and they could n't feed their children .
we need to develop a more balanced , adult , drugs policy and curtail the " free trade " with the third world that is anything but .
until then , while we screw up their lives with globalisation , they should feel quite ok about screwing up our lives with addictive drugs .
moflard , uk i actually worked with the ladies in san sebastian prison and some ex-prisoners for a year in 2003-04 through an ngo .
i taught them art and craft so that they could sell the handicraft they made through the small business we were trying to develop .
the ladies inside are in a desperate state - locked in a vicious cycle of poverty .
many of them have several kids , no husband and have no way of feeding their children as unemployment is high .
it is a very sad situation .
someone offers them money to carry a package from a to b and it is very tempting .
however once caught they are sucked into further debt as they have to pay for their stay in prison as well as for lawyers to try to get them out .
it is very stressful for them living each day not knowing if they will have enough food or if they will ever be able to break out of the cycle they are in .
in many ways i think if coca leaves really could be marketed and sold for their medicinal purposes worldwide , like peppermint tea , there would be sufficient work for the cocaleros so they would not have to resort to producing cocaine .
i actually really liked coca leaf tea and drank it all the time there .
toria , guildford i made a point of watching this documentary with my 16-year-old daughter , at her request .
congratulations to all the team and participants who brought this to our screens .
what is so sad for most of these people is that there seems to be so little choice for them in their lives and they have so little control over their destiny .
what can we do to help - campaign to have the law changed ?
highlight their plight ?
but what then , what can we actually do to help to make a difference in their lives ?
we feel so helpless .
maria croydon , dublin an excellent programme giving an insight into the lives of many bolivian people .
our friends are currently in cochabamba working in an orphanage for six months and it was good to see the area and people .
the situation out there at the moment is very volatile and there were riots in cochabamba last week with two dead and the town hall burnt down .
we would be interested in more programmes focusing on the politics of this area .
anne marie proudfoot , manchester according to the coca museum in la paz , 50 % of the world 's cocaine is consumed in the us .
this points to the problem being in the us , yet , they pursue a foreign policy which bullies countries like bolivia into passing laws which send a 12-year-old girl to prison .
i 'm sure their influence and cash could be used in a far more positive manner .
ron mackenzie , edinburgh the best film about coca in bolivia since brian moser 's 1970s films .
excellent translating , good camera work and all rang very true .
it made sensible points about the logicality of the main consuming nation -lrb- us -rrb- trying to penalise the poor producing countries .
david p , oxford i feel for the poor people in bolivia , but drugs are not good and they never will be .
why can the world not help poorer countries unite and form uber-countries where poverty can be resolved ?
edward lewis , macclesfield it is so depressing that this child was pulled to such a destiny .
if they gave a hand to this child when she was first caught she would n't have gone so far .
there is no justice in this world .
while one is dying from bombs , others are out and about enjoying life to the maximum !
i hope for peace and love between all nations and all religions .
canan , london bolivia is a big country with such diversity you 'd probably have years of amazing documentary footage to make , but by doing a film about drugs and how poor people are , you also send the completely wrong message to an audience that already has no idea about the place .

last updated : tuesday , 23 january 2007 , 09:25 gmt e-mail this to a friend printable version read your comments the 12-year-old drug smuggler was broadcast on wednesday , 17 january , 2007 at 2100 gmt on bbc two .
the page is now closed .
thank you for your emails .
the comments published reflect a balance of views we have received .
this for me was possibly one of the most moving , informative and relevant documentaries in recent times .
i would strongly suggest this be shown in schools .
informing children of the real social consequences of western consumerism / politics would surely be as much a deterent as a picture of a missing septum ?
frances smith , brighton a very informative and truthful programme highlighting the real issues faced by a poor country like bolivia .
hopefully we will see more documentaries from this under-reported continent .
martyn , warrington another programme about drugs and crime in latin america !
do n't you get tired of it ?
myself and my brazilian wife do .
do you think nothing good ever happens in south america and that all the people are involved in drugs and crime ?
do you think all the kids there are on the streets and poor ?
that 's all we ever see about brazil too !
john rowlands , liverpool thank you this world for this documentary .
it is sad to see the predicament of the families and generations in the jungle .
the coca leaves are providing essential income for these families living in unacceptable poverty .
i can understand why the women and the mothers carry drugs .
the us government should shoulder the responsibility , in my view .
their law threatens to take away the livelihood of the cocaleros , hence the basic human needs of food , clothes and shelter .
angela , glasgow i , like toria , worked with an ngo in san sabastian prison in 2004-5 .
by teaching the women crafts , they not only have the means to support themselves , but also to support their children .
previously , women would send their children to beg on the streets to earn money , but with the introduction of the crafts project , laundry and bakery , the women have means to pay their rent and buy their food in the prison .
even though their parents are locked in the prison , the children have the freedom to come and go .
across the square from san sebastian is a childrens project , giving the kids of prisoners the skills and activites which will set them up for life , and so hopefully less likely to follow the path their mothers were obliged to take .
niki , london people should open their eyes and see how the west have turned a little girl into a drug carrier .

last updated : tuesday , 23 january 2007 , 09:25 gmt e-mail this to a friend printable version read your comments the 12-year-old drug smuggler was broadcast on wednesday , 17 january , 2007 at 2100 gmt on bbc two .
the page is now closed .
thank you for your emails .
the comments published reflect a balance of views we have received .
this for me was possibly one of the most moving , informative and relevant documentaries in recent times .
i would strongly suggest this be shown in schools .
informing children of the real social consequences of western consumerism / politics would surely be as much a deterent as a picture of a missing septum ?
frances smith , brighton a very informative and truthful programme highlighting the real issues faced by a poor country like bolivia .
hopefully we will see more documentaries from this under-reported continent .
martyn , warrington another programme about drugs and crime in latin america !
do n't you get tired of it ?
myself and my brazilian wife do .
do you think nothing good ever happens in south america and that all the people are involved in drugs and crime ?
do you think all the kids there are on the streets and poor ?
that 's all we ever see about brazil too !
john rowlands , liverpool thank you this world for this documentary .
it is sad to see the predicament of the families and generations in the jungle .
the coca leaves are providing essential income for these families living in unacceptable poverty .
i can understand why the women and the mothers carry drugs .
the us government should shoulder the responsibility , in my view .
their law threatens to take away the livelihood of the cocaleros , hence the basic human needs of food , clothes and shelter .
angela , glasgow i , like toria , worked with an ngo in san sabastian prison in 2004-5 .
by teaching the women crafts , they not only have the means to support themselves , but also to support their children .
previously , women would send their children to beg on the streets to earn money , but with the introduction of the crafts project , laundry and bakery , the women have means to pay their rent and buy their food in the prison .
even though their parents are locked in the prison , the children have the freedom to come and go .
across the square from san sebastian is a childrens project , giving the kids of prisoners the skills and activites which will set them up for life , and so hopefully less likely to follow the path their mothers were obliged to take .
niki , london people should open their eyes and see how the west have turned a little girl into a drug carrier .
we all should stand and put a stop to it .
newman , london in colombia many coca growers used to grow coffee and switched to more lucrative coca when the coffee price fell through the floor and they could n't feed their children .
we need to develop a more balanced , adult , drugs policy and curtail the " free trade " with the third world that is anything but .
until then , while we screw up their lives with globalisation , they should feel quite ok about screwing up our lives with addictive drugs .
moflard , uk i actually worked with the ladies in san sebastian prison and some ex-prisoners for a year in 2003-04 through an ngo .
i taught them art and craft so that they could sell the handicraft they made through the small business we were trying to develop .
the ladies inside are in a desperate state - locked in a vicious cycle of poverty .
many of them have several kids , no husband and have no way of feeding their children as unemployment is high .
it is a very sad situation .
someone offers them money to carry a package from a to b and it is very tempting .
however once caught they are sucked into further debt as they have to pay for their stay in prison as well as for lawyers to try to get them out .
it is very stressful for them living each day not knowing if they will have enough food or if they will ever be able to break out of the cycle they are in .
in many ways i think if coca leaves really could be marketed and sold for their medicinal purposes worldwide , like peppermint tea , there would be sufficient work for the cocaleros so they would not have to resort to producing cocaine .
i actually really liked coca leaf tea and drank it all the time there .
toria , guildford i made a point of watching this documentary with my 16-year-old daughter , at her request .
congratulations to all the team and participants who brought this to our screens .

quick guides are concise explanations of topics or issues in the news .
the academy awards came into being in 1927 when the newly formed academy of motion picture arts and sciences -lrb- ampas -rrb- decided to bestow " awards of merit for distinctive achievements " .
however , it was not until 16 may 1929 that the first ceremony was held at the hollywood roosevelt hotel .
the results had been announced three months earlier , so there was little press attention for what many regarded as a minor industry event .
but the awards rapidly grew in stature and significance , influencing the decision to broadcast them on television for the first time in 1953 .
statuette designed by cedric gibbons , head of mgm 's art department , the statuette depicts a naked knight holding a sword on top of a reel of film .
the reel has five spokes , signifying the five original branches of the academy -lrb- producers , directors , actors , technicians and writers -rrb- .
the award 's familiar soubriquet is generally attributed to academy librarian margaret herrick 's remark that it resembled her uncle , oscar pierce .
by 1934 the nickname was in common usage , though it was not officially adopted by the academy until 1939 .
membership when the academy was founded in 1927 , it comprised 37 members drawn from the upper echelons of the movie business .
these days , however , there are more than 6,000 members .
membership is by invitation only and is limited to those who have achieved distinction in the arts -lrb- acting , writing and directing -rrb- and sciences -lrb- cinematography , editing and so on -rrb- .
every academy member is entitled to vote in their particular area of expertise .
eligibility the criteria for oscar consideration is detailed and complex and depends on rules drawn up by the academy 's individual branches .
the film in a foreign language nominees , for example , are selected from entries officially submitted by their countries of origin .
one rule of thumb , however , is that all films in contention have to be shown in los angeles before 31 december on the preceding year .
in the run-up to oscar nominations , movie studios draw attention to their movies by sending out dvd " screeners " to academy members or by running advertisements with the ubiquitous " for your consideration " tag .
winners and losers the most awards won by any one film is currently 11 - a record shared by ben-hur , titanic and the lord of the rings : the return of the king .
all about eve and titanic hold the record for the most oscar nominations , having each been shortlisted for 14 awards .
the turning point and the color purple share the dubious honour of being the films with the most nominations - 11 in all - not to win a single award .
katharine hepburn is the most successful star in oscar history , having won four best actress prizes between 1934 and 1982 .
controversies the academy awards have not been without moments of contention over the years .

he also paid tribute to the support of his wife and family and said he was looking forward to touring again .
" learning about abstinence was one thing , but then there was all this other area of my life to start learning about , " he said .
" and so 30 days became 60 , and 60 days became 90 , and with each week that passed i found myself really learning how to surrender . "
while in the clinic he missed the release of his latest album , love , pain and the whole crazy thing , and was not present to accept his second male vocalist of the year honour at the country music association awards .
" there was no big cataclysmic event that happened right before i went in , " he added .
" it was a lot of small things that were happening in my life , a lot of small moments that were starting to accumulate that were telling me very loud and clear that i was a long way from my program of recovery , and they were making my life unmanageable . "

here is the open letter independent politician dennis canavan wrote to his falkirk west constituents about why he was leaving holyrood .
dear constituents , after a great deal of reflection , i have now come to a decision not to stand this year as a candidate for re-election to the scottish parliament .
this year i shall be 65 and i have had the honour of being a representative of the people for a third of a century .
during that period , i have been fortunate in enjoying good health , but sadly that has not been the case for some of my children .
in 1989 , when i lost my son paul , at the age of 16 , i thought that was the worst thing that could ever happen to anyone .
but recently my family has been hit by more devastating events .
as you may be aware , paul 's brother , dennis , died last month and my oldest son , mark , is on the other side of the world suffering from motor neurone disease , for which there is no known cure .
if you believe in the power of prayer , please use it and let use all hope that scientific research will find an answer soon .
such family circumstances fill me with regret that , because of my job , i did not spend enough time with my children at an earlier stage in their lives and i feel that i should now compensate in some way .
my youngest son , adam , who will be starting school this year , is a healthy , happy child and i sometimes wonder what i would do without him .
i am blessed with a loving daughter and five wonderful grandchildren .
over the last few months i have learned a lot about the value and real priorities of life and today adam and i are leaving for australia for two weeks to spend some time with mark and his family .
i would like to thank all my constituents , particularly those who have faithfully supported me over the years .
it has been my privilege to serve you and , on my return from australia , i shall continue doing so to the best of my ability until the dissolution of parliament .

lula , who was re-elected last october , wants to involve the private sector in plans to upgrade roads and railways and develop the country 's energy provision .

but for the last two years the overall performance of the economy has been disappointing - with growth averaging less than 3 % .
the ambitious acceleration programme for the country 's growth announced on monday aims to bring the rate of growth up to 5 % by next year .
thirteen per cent of the $ 240bn will come from central government - the rest from state-controlled companies and the private sector , which is being offered tax breaks to participate .
lula said the package would be carefully phased in and that public spending would remain disciplined .
test but some commentators are asking how the president can achieve all of this at the same time .
his programme does not offer the major overhaul of tax structures that many economists are calling for , or detailed proposals to reform a heavily-indebted pensions system .
the investment programme must be approved by congress and backed by powerful state governors .

last week , the lse issued an upbeat trading forecast and said it would return an extra £ 250m to shareholders .

nasdaq said the only meeting it has had with the lse was in the role of shareholder , rather than as a potential bidder , in may 2006 .
the us exchange already owns about 29 % of the lse .
the deadline for shareholders to agree to support the bid is 26 january .

in a letter to the prime minister , the magistrates ' association criticised the use of fines for public order offences .
the association said financial cuts were causing low staff morale and " severely undermining " public confidence in the system .
ministers said spending had risen over the past 10 years , and urged staff to work together more effectively .
the magistrates ' letter was arguing against a financial settlement announced by the constitutional affairs department .
the association said the deal would amount to a decrease of 3.5 % each year in real terms .
" the extent of the financial cuts that have been made in recent years makes it impossible for the system to perform adequately , " the letter stated .
' very frustrating ' the association said the courts needed better it systems , more clerks , more legal advisers and more investment in the court buildings - some of which are rat-infested .
the letter also argued that increased use of measures like fixed penalty notices meant sentences were being decided on " financial grounds rather than judicial grounds " . "
the issue is not a lack of resources , it is making sure all of the people in the system work effectively together " lord falconer lord chancellor association chairman , cindy barnett , told bbc news there were an " awful lot of examples " where lack of funding was putting " enormous strain " on the system .
" if there is a question of a lack of legal advisers , for instance , it makes it more difficult for the right number of courts to run , " she said .
" the same is true when there is under-resourcing of the cps and over-strain on the police . "
she said it was " very frustrating " when magistrates were prevented from dealing with cases because of staff shortages or missing papers .
spending increase but lord falconer , the lord chancellor , said the system was not suffering because of a lack of funds .
" we spend more on criminal justice than any other country in europe and the united states of america . "
he said expenditure on criminal justice had risen from 2 % of gross domestic product to 2.5 % in the past 10 years .
" and that 's not just increasing the number of police , it 's also spending more money on the courts , more money on the prosecutors . "
lord falconer added : " the issue is not a lack of resources , it is making sure all of the people in the system work effectively together . "

in a letter to the prime minister , the magistrates ' association criticised the use of fines for public order offences .
the association said financial cuts were causing low staff morale and " severely undermining " public confidence in the system .
ministers said spending had risen over the past 10 years , and urged staff to work together more effectively .
the magistrates ' letter was arguing against a financial settlement announced by the constitutional affairs department .
the association said the deal would amount to a decrease of 3.5 % each year in real terms .
" the extent of the financial cuts that have been made in recent years makes it impossible for the system to perform adequately , " the letter stated .
' very frustrating ' the association said the courts needed better it systems , more clerks , more legal advisers and more investment in the court buildings - some of which are rat-infested .

the issue is not a lack of resources , it is making sure all of the people in the system work effectively together lord falconer lord chancellor association chairman , cindy barnett , told bbc news there were an " awful lot of examples " where lack of funding was putting " enormous strain " on the system .
" if there is a question of a lack of legal advisers , for instance , it makes it more difficult for the right number of courts to run , " she said .
" the same is true when there is under-resourcing of the cps and over-strain on the police . "
she said it was " very frustrating " when magistrates were prevented from dealing with cases because of staff shortages or missing papers .
spending increase but lord falconer , the lord chancellor , said the system was not suffering because of a lack of funds .
" we spend more on criminal justice than any other country in europe and the united states of america . "
he said expenditure on criminal justice had risen from 2 % of gross domestic product to 2.5 % in the past 10 years .
" and that 's not just increasing the number of police , it 's also spending more money on the courts , more money on the prosecutors . "

the letter also argued that increased use of measures like fixed penalty notices meant sentences were being decided on " financial grounds rather than judicial grounds " .
the issue is not a lack of resources , it is making sure all of the people in the system work effectively together lord falconer lord chancellor association chairman , cindy barnett , told bbc news there were an " awful lot of examples " where lack of funding was putting " enormous strain " on the system .
" if there is a question of a lack of legal advisers , for instance , it makes it more difficult for the right number of courts to run , " she said .
" the same is true when there is under-resourcing of the cps and over-strain on the police . "
she said it was " very frustrating " when magistrates were prevented from dealing with cases because of staff shortages or missing papers .
spending increase but lord falconer , the lord chancellor , said the system was not suffering because of a lack of funds .
" we spend more on criminal justice than any other country in europe and the united states of america . "
he said expenditure on criminal justice had risen from 2 % of gross domestic product to 2.5 % in the past 10 years .
" and that 's not just increasing the number of police , it 's also spending more money on the courts , more money on the prosecutors . "
lord falconer added : " the issue is not a lack of resources , it is making sure all of the people in the system work effectively together . "
