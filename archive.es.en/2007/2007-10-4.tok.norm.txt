4 . german economics minister michael glos will open a two-day german economic conference with the asian-pacific region in seoul , south korea , on thursday , oct .
4 .
ahead of the conference he spoke to deutsche welle about the importance of doing business in asia . deutsche welle : the asia-pacific forum this week will concern itself with exports .
what results do you expect from this event ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it can be difficult for german companies to get started in japan michael glos : asia has become the most important export market for the german economy .
this is not just a small delegation , but a very important economic meeting .
it 's also a chance for german managers working in asia to exchange experiences .
but above all else it 's a sign that we have a close economic partnership with south korea .
last , but not least , i hope that these discussions will be strengthened by the visit . but it 's not just about south korea , it 's about a much , much bigger asia and the pacific region .
the head of the committee , jürgen hambrecht , has said that there are still many opportunities for german companies - not only in india and china but also in japan , australia and new zealand .
do you agree ? yes , i have a similar point of view .
but it is much more difficult to get a foot in the door in the japanese market than the chinese market .
but , in general , i agree with you that the larger region needs to be examined .
that includes an economically strong region like malaysia , which is developing more and more .
i also think that we have to strengthen our contact with indonesia , now that political stability there has improved .
so there 's a lot to do . trade in one direction is good , but so is trade in two directions .
what about more investment flowing into germany from that region ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : automaker hyundai is one of south korea 's best-known international brands that 's something we are promoting in -lsb- south -rsb- korea .
the country , naturally , has high-performing companies that are interwoven throughout the world , and we would like that they also invest in germany . the euro is going from one record high to another .
what 's your view of the situation , particularly for germany 's export-oriented economy ? our invoices are in euros , except for airplanes and certain other products , so it 's not going to hit us as quickly .
but , naturally , when the exchange rates move too far apart there 's a chance our exports will suffer .
but our products are mainly bought because they are technologically first-rate and because the german economy and investment goods in particular compete on the basis of quality , not price . interview : henrik böhme -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

3 .
prosecutors had sent the report to a judge who has spent a year looking into allegations of illegal share dealing at eads , paris daily le figaro wrote .
eads has been suspected of insider trading ever since the company plunged into crisis over delays to airbus ' prestigious a380 .
the value of eads shares had collapsed when airbus first announced delays in 2006 .
months later , airbus formally announced serious production difficulties .
suspicious activities management and shareholders at eads engaged in massive insider trading by selling shares before the problems at airbus were made public , le figaro said .
a total of 1,200 alleged cases of insider trading of the shares were detected , but the regulator decided to move quickly by concentrating on 21 people , including executives at eads and airbus as well as major shareholders .
the paper also wrote that amf described the selling of shares , which allegedly took place between november 2005 and march 2006 , as " simultaneous and massive . "
further press reports said the document cites former airbus chief executive and eads co-chief executive noel forgeard , who resigned in july last year amid a scandal over the timing of his share dealings and problems with the a380 .
also named were current airbus chief thomas enders and a number of other current and former directors . "

judges assigned to the case have since ordered searches to be carried out at the headquarters of eads and one of its principal shareholders , french media and defense company lagardere .
" eads is most surprised by the publication of information in the press , " said an eads statement , condemning what it called " an unlawful violation of the confidentiality of the current investigations and of the principle of the presumption of innocence . "
the major industrial shareholders of eads , german car giant daimlerchrysler and lagardere , each sold 7.5 percent of their holdings on april 4 , 2006 , for 2 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.8 billion -rrb- .
while daimlerchrysler has refused to comment , afp news service reported that lagardere said it would launch legal action for damages caused by " interpretations " of a preliminary amf document that had led to " unfounded accusations . "
government awareness while lagardere controls 7.5 percent and daimlerchrysler 22.5 percent of eads in order to preserve a franco-german balance within the group , 15 percent is owned by the french government .
according to le figaro , the amf report alleged that paris had been made aware of difficulties at eads before the company 's public announcements .

" the beautiful thing about this decision is that you 're all part of my past now , " fischer told journalists at the end of a press conference announcing his resignation from parliament . while that may have -lrb- more or less -rrb- been the case for the past two years , the iconic ex-politician is back at the center of media attention .
after previous books on weight-loss and another one about the post-sept .
11 world , a well-fed fischer has just published the first part of his political memoirs . " the red-green years - german foreign policy from kosovo to sept .
11 " hit book stores on thursday , oct .
4 .
it covers the first four years of his time in office from 1998 to 2001 and focuses on the tough battles ahead of germany 's first military mission after world war ii , in the former yugoslavia . green dilemmas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer was attacked with paint because of his support for the kosovo mission the book comes at a time when fischer 's green party colleagues are torn between the former über-leader 's legacy and a strong current to bring the party back to its pacifist roots . fischer has harshly criticized his party 's recent decision not to support a renewal of the military mission in afghanistan .
he also said it would make it less likely for the greens to return to power after the 2009 election . " if the greens think that they can return to a leftist protest profile without paying a hefty price , they 're mistaken , " the 59-year-old told german magazine stern in an interview , adding that germany should expand rather than cut back its presence in afghanistan . " now some people might understand better why i just wanted to get away , " fischer told der spiegel newsmagazine in another interview coinciding with the publication of his book .
" the party was very exhausting .
it enabled me to have a great political career , but i was just tired at the end .

ahead of the conference he spoke to deutsche welle about the importance of doing business in asia . deutsche welle : the asia-pacific forum this week will concern itself with exports .
what results do you expect from this event ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it can be difficult for german companies to get started in japan michael glos : asia has become the most important export market for the german economy .
this is not just a small delegation , but a very important economic meeting .
it 's also a chance for german managers working in asia to exchange experiences .
but above all else it 's a sign that we have a close economic partnership with south korea .
last , but not least , i hope that these discussions will be strengthened by the visit . but it 's not just about south korea , it 's about a much , much bigger asia and the pacific region .
the head of the committee , jürgen hambrecht , has said that there are still many opportunities for german companies - not only in india and china but also in japan , australia and new zealand .
do you agree ? yes , i have a similar point of view .
but it is much more difficult to get a foot in the door in the japanese market than the chinese market .
but , in general , i agree with you that the larger region needs to be examined .
that includes an economically strong region like malaysia , which is developing more and more .
i also think that we have to strengthen our contact with indonesia , now that political stability there has improved .
so there 's a lot to do . trade in one direction is good , but so is trade in two directions .
what about more investment flowing into germany from that region ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : automaker hyundai is one of south korea 's best-known international brands that 's something we are promoting in -lsb- south -rsb- korea .

what 's your view of the situation , particularly for germany 's export-oriented economy ? our invoices are in euros , except for airplanes and certain other products , so it 's not going to hit us as quickly .
but , naturally , when the exchange rates move too far apart there 's a chance our exports will suffer .

4 , after a two-year renovation , the organization announced the end of its own one-year long overhaul and new plans to step up its international presence . in paris with foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier to attend the inauguration of the new offices , goethe institute pesident jutta limbach on wednesday revealed the first of the organization 's post-facelift plans . " the goethe institute in paris will again become a central place to encounter german and french culture , " limback said in a statement . in addition to the paris institute , limbach said gi was also examining which other offices it will reopen . " we are considering which of the institutes that had to be shut down in the 1990s in north and sub-saharan africa should now be reopened , " she said , referring to closures that happened as part of an economy drive .
the gi is set to open three new offices , including one in novosibirsk , the third largest city in russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : changing with the times also on the agenda is boosted cooperation with the institut francais .
two such projects already exist in ramallah and glasgow .
" collaboration with the institut francais in moscow has been on the cards for years , " said limbach .
out of the woods the goethe institute 's overhaul , aimed at increasing efficiency and modernizing the non-profit organization , began in 2006 . " goethe needs to reinvent himself in order to adapt to the changing times , " said limbach on public broadcaster wdr last october . the reform measures have now come to a close , she said , adding that the organization had come through its period of change . the gi has 142 offices in 81 countries , and costs some 250 million euros a year .
roughly 165 million euros of that comes from the foreign ministry , and cost-cutting has long been a priority .
not a goodbye to europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the organization plans to expand in asia and africa , the hanoi gi is seen here but while more will be invested in offices in africa and asia , the gi 's headquarters in munich will be witnessing job cuts , with infrastructure costs both at home and abroad set to be reduced .
to many , the move makes sense .
until now , the gi has had a significantly higher profile in europe than overseas .
the gi has seven offices in italy , for example , compared to just three in china .
but limbach was keen to counter any impression the gi was withdrawing from europe .
" we plan to continue our work without closing any of our offices in europe , " she said .
" our intention is to distribute our budget - which used to have a west-european focus - more fairly around the world . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

4 , with the presiding judge sentencing them to between 10 and 15 years . the state court in bonn ruled that the three men had with premeditation murdered 20-year-old hermann h. , who was found dead in his four-man cell at the correctional facility in the western german town of siegburg on nov .
11 , 2006 .
he had been tortured , beaten and sexually abused for 12 hours before being forced to hang himself by his cellmates .
the judge stated that the three men , who had previously admitted to the killing , had planned to cover up the murder by making it look like suicide .
the victim was known to have psychological problems and the plan seemed to be to make the death look like an attempt to be moved from the facility to a hospital .
the main instigator of the crime , 20-year-old pascal i. , was sentenced to 15 years in prison while accomplice ralf a. , 21 , received 14 years .
the third man , 18-year-old dany k. , was handed the maximum possible sentence under youth criminal law - 10 years .
public prosecutor calls for life for main culprit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the murder at the prison in siegburg was premeditated the judge was asked to take into consideration the recommendations of the public prosecutor 's office in handing down the sentences .
the public prosecutor had recommended a life sentence for pascal i. , with no chance of parole for 15 years .
the judge complied with the office 's wishes to the letter on both the other sentences .
a proposed case against prison personnel is still being considered after complaints made about the guards at the scene who failed to notice anything awry , despite the fact that the brutal ordeal went on for hours .
the murder in the state of north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- shocked germany when it was first brought to light and prompted calls for sweeping reforms in the juvenile detention system .
a second case at the prison , in which another detainee was taunted and harassed and eventually forced to slit his wrists , added weight to the calls .

3 .
prosecutors had sent the report to a judge who has spent a year looking into allegations of illegal share dealing at eads , paris daily le figaro wrote .
eads has been suspected of insider trading ever since the company plunged into crisis over delays to airbus ' prestigious a380 .
the value of eads shares had collapsed when airbus first announced delays in 2006 .
months later , airbus formally announced serious production difficulties .
suspicious activities management and shareholders at eads engaged in massive insider trading by selling shares before the problems at airbus were made public , le figaro said .
a total of 1,200 alleged cases of insider trading of the shares were detected , but the regulator decided to move quickly by concentrating on 21 people , including executives at eads and airbus as well as major shareholders .
the paper also wrote that amf described the selling of shares , which allegedly took place between november 2005 and march 2006 , as " simultaneous and massive . "
further press reports said the document cites former airbus chief executive and eads co-chief executive noel forgeard , who resigned in july last year amid a scandal over the timing of his share dealings and problems with the a380 .
also named were current airbus chief thomas enders and a number of other current and former directors . "
unfounded accusations " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former eads joint ceos thomas enders -lrb- left -rrb- and noel forgeard the judicial probe was opened in november 2006 in response to complaints , notably from appac , an association of small french shareholders .
judges assigned to the case have since ordered searches to be carried out at the headquarters of eads and one of its principal shareholders , french media and defense company lagardere .
" eads is most surprised by the publication of information in the press , " said an eads statement , condemning what it called " an unlawful violation of the confidentiality of the current investigations and of the principle of the presumption of innocence . "
the major industrial shareholders of eads , german car giant daimlerchrysler and lagardere , each sold 7.5 percent of their holdings on april 4 , 2006 , for 2 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.8 billion -rrb- .
while daimlerchrysler has refused to comment , afp news service reported that lagardere said it would launch legal action for damages caused by " interpretations " of a preliminary amf document that had led to " unfounded accusations . "
government awareness while lagardere controls 7.5 percent and daimlerchrysler 22.5 percent of eads in order to preserve a franco-german balance within the group , 15 percent is owned by the french government .
according to le figaro , the amf report alleged that paris had been made aware of difficulties at eads before the company 's public announcements .
this threatens to create a political storm in france .
economics minister christine lagarde has denied any insider trading by the government , stressing that the state " never sold a single share , " according to afp . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

3 .
prosecutors had sent the report to a judge who has spent a year looking into allegations of illegal share dealing at eads , paris daily le figaro wrote .
eads has been suspected of insider trading ever since the company plunged into crisis over delays to airbus ' prestigious a380 .
the value of eads shares had collapsed when airbus first announced delays in 2006 .
months later , airbus formally announced serious production difficulties .
suspicious activities management and shareholders at eads engaged in massive insider trading by selling shares before the problems at airbus were made public , le figaro said .
a total of 1,200 alleged cases of insider trading of the shares were detected , but the regulator decided to move quickly by concentrating on 21 people , including executives at eads and airbus as well as major shareholders .
the paper also wrote that amf described the selling of shares , which allegedly took place between november 2005 and march 2006 , as " simultaneous and massive . "
further press reports said the document cites former airbus chief executive and eads co-chief executive noel forgeard , who resigned in july last year amid a scandal over the timing of his share dealings and problems with the a380 .
also named were current airbus chief thomas enders and a number of other current and former directors . "
unfounded accusations " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former eads joint ceos thomas enders -lrb- left -rrb- and noel forgeard the judicial probe was opened in november 2006 in response to complaints , notably from appac , an association of small french shareholders .
judges assigned to the case have since ordered searches to be carried out at the headquarters of eads and one of its principal shareholders , french media and defense company lagardere .
" eads is most surprised by the publication of information in the press , " said an eads statement , condemning what it called " an unlawful violation of the confidentiality of the current investigations and of the principle of the presumption of innocence . "
the major industrial shareholders of eads , german car giant daimlerchrysler and lagardere , each sold 7.5 percent of their holdings on april 4 , 2006 , for 2 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.8 billion -rrb- .
while daimlerchrysler has refused to comment , afp news service reported that lagardere said it would launch legal action for damages caused by " interpretations " of a preliminary amf document that had led to " unfounded accusations . "
government awareness while lagardere controls 7.5 percent and daimlerchrysler 22.5 percent of eads in order to preserve a franco-german balance within the group , 15 percent is owned by the french government .
according to le figaro , the amf report alleged that paris had been made aware of difficulties at eads before the company 's public announcements .
this threatens to create a political storm in france .
economics minister christine lagarde has denied any insider trading by the government , stressing that the state " never sold a single share , " according to afp . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the beautiful thing about this decision is that you 're all part of my past now , " fischer told journalists at the end of a press conference announcing his resignation from parliament . while that may have -lrb- more or less -rrb- been the case for the past two years , the iconic ex-politician is back at the center of media attention .
after previous books on weight-loss and another one about the post-sept .

11 " hit book stores on thursday , oct .

it covers the first four years of his time in office from 1998 to 2001 and focuses on the tough battles ahead of germany 's first military mission after world war ii , in the former yugoslavia . green dilemmas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer was attacked with paint because of his support for the kosovo mission the book comes at a time when fischer 's green party colleagues are torn between the former über-leader 's legacy and a strong current to bring the party back to its pacifist roots . fischer has harshly criticized his party 's recent decision not to support a renewal of the military mission in afghanistan .
he also said it would make it less likely for the greens to return to power after the 2009 election . " if the greens think that they can return to a leftist protest profile without paying a hefty price , they 're mistaken , " the 59-year-old told german magazine stern in an interview , adding that germany should expand rather than cut back its presence in afghanistan . " now some people might understand better why i just wanted to get away , " fischer told der spiegel newsmagazine in another interview coinciding with the publication of his book .
" the party was very exhausting .
it enabled me to have a great political career , but i was just tired at the end . " after a stint as a guest professor at princeton university and a reported move from his central berlin apartment to a house in the german capital 's posh grunewald neighborhood , fischer seems to have regained his spirits .
he 's founded a political consultancy firm and serves as a co-chair of the newly established european council on foreign relations . " no more concerts " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer now prefers writing to active politics while some see fischer 's reappearance as a sign of his possible return to politics , the man himself has repeatedly said that he has no desire to return to his old line of work and will not appear at green party events during future election campaigns . " no more concerts , " fischer , who once described himself as germany 's last " live rock and roller , " told stern . he 's also rejected rumors that he 's interested in the country 's top job - the largely ceremonial federal presidency . " there are few offices that i 'm less qualified for , " fischer , a high school dropout and former taxi driver , told stern .
" if there 's something i did n't like as foreign minister , then it was the representative , the ceremonial aspects .
that 's not me . " instead , fischer will soon start writing the second part of his memoirs , he said on thursday . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

3 .
prosecutors had sent the report to a judge who has spent a year looking into allegations of illegal share dealing at eads , paris daily le figaro wrote .
eads has been suspected of insider trading ever since the company plunged into crisis over delays to airbus ' prestigious a380 .
the value of eads shares had collapsed when airbus first announced delays in 2006 .
months later , airbus formally announced serious production difficulties .
suspicious activities management and shareholders at eads engaged in massive insider trading by selling shares before the problems at airbus were made public , le figaro said .
a total of 1,200 alleged cases of insider trading of the shares were detected , but the regulator decided to move quickly by concentrating on 21 people , including executives at eads and airbus as well as major shareholders .
the paper also wrote that amf described the selling of shares , which allegedly took place between november 2005 and march 2006 , as " simultaneous and massive . "
further press reports said the document cites former airbus chief executive and eads co-chief executive noel forgeard , who resigned in july last year amid a scandal over the timing of his share dealings and problems with the a380 .
also named were current airbus chief thomas enders and a number of other current and former directors . "
unfounded accusations " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former eads joint ceos thomas enders -lrb- left -rrb- and noel forgeard the judicial probe was opened in november 2006 in response to complaints , notably from appac , an association of small french shareholders .
judges assigned to the case have since ordered searches to be carried out at the headquarters of eads and one of its principal shareholders , french media and defense company lagardere .
" eads is most surprised by the publication of information in the press , " said an eads statement , condemning what it called " an unlawful violation of the confidentiality of the current investigations and of the principle of the presumption of innocence . "
the major industrial shareholders of eads , german car giant daimlerchrysler and lagardere , each sold 7.5 percent of their holdings on april 4 , 2006 , for 2 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.8 billion -rrb- .
while daimlerchrysler has refused to comment , afp news service reported that lagardere said it would launch legal action for damages caused by " interpretations " of a preliminary amf document that had led to " unfounded accusations . "
government awareness while lagardere controls 7.5 percent and daimlerchrysler 22.5 percent of eads in order to preserve a franco-german balance within the group , 15 percent is owned by the french government .
according to le figaro , the amf report alleged that paris had been made aware of difficulties at eads before the company 's public announcements .
this threatens to create a political storm in france .
economics minister christine lagarde has denied any insider trading by the government , stressing that the state " never sold a single share , " according to afp . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

3 .
prosecutors had sent the report to a judge who has spent a year looking into allegations of illegal share dealing at eads , paris daily le figaro wrote .
eads has been suspected of insider trading ever since the company plunged into crisis over delays to airbus ' prestigious a380 .
the value of eads shares had collapsed when airbus first announced delays in 2006 .
months later , airbus formally announced serious production difficulties .
suspicious activities management and shareholders at eads engaged in massive insider trading by selling shares before the problems at airbus were made public , le figaro said .
a total of 1,200 alleged cases of insider trading of the shares were detected , but the regulator decided to move quickly by concentrating on 21 people , including executives at eads and airbus as well as major shareholders .
the paper also wrote that amf described the selling of shares , which allegedly took place between november 2005 and march 2006 , as " simultaneous and massive . "
further press reports said the document cites former airbus chief executive and eads co-chief executive noel forgeard , who resigned in july last year amid a scandal over the timing of his share dealings and problems with the a380 .
also named were current airbus chief thomas enders and a number of other current and former directors . "
unfounded accusations " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former eads joint ceos thomas enders -lrb- left -rrb- and noel forgeard the judicial probe was opened in november 2006 in response to complaints , notably from appac , an association of small french shareholders .
judges assigned to the case have since ordered searches to be carried out at the headquarters of eads and one of its principal shareholders , french media and defense company lagardere .
" eads is most surprised by the publication of information in the press , " said an eads statement , condemning what it called " an unlawful violation of the confidentiality of the current investigations and of the principle of the presumption of innocence . "
the major industrial shareholders of eads , german car giant daimlerchrysler and lagardere , each sold 7.5 percent of their holdings on april 4 , 2006 , for 2 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.8 billion -rrb- .
while daimlerchrysler has refused to comment , afp news service reported that lagardere said it would launch legal action for damages caused by " interpretations " of a preliminary amf document that had led to " unfounded accusations . "
government awareness while lagardere controls 7.5 percent and daimlerchrysler 22.5 percent of eads in order to preserve a franco-german balance within the group , 15 percent is owned by the french government .
according to le figaro , the amf report alleged that paris had been made aware of difficulties at eads before the company 's public announcements .
this threatens to create a political storm in france .
economics minister christine lagarde has denied any insider trading by the government , stressing that the state " never sold a single share , " according to afp . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

4 . german economics minister michael glos will open a two-day german economic conference with the asian-pacific region in seoul , south korea , on thursday , oct .
4 .
ahead of the conference he spoke to deutsche welle about the importance of doing business in asia . deutsche welle : the asia-pacific forum this week will concern itself with exports .
what results do you expect from this event ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it can be difficult for german companies to get started in japan michael glos : asia has become the most important export market for the german economy .
this is not just a small delegation , but a very important economic meeting .
it 's also a chance for german managers working in asia to exchange experiences .
but above all else it 's a sign that we have a close economic partnership with south korea .
last , but not least , i hope that these discussions will be strengthened by the visit . but it 's not just about south korea , it 's about a much , much bigger asia and the pacific region .
the head of the committee , jürgen hambrecht , has said that there are still many opportunities for german companies - not only in india and china but also in japan , australia and new zealand .
do you agree ? yes , i have a similar point of view .
but it is much more difficult to get a foot in the door in the japanese market than the chinese market .
but , in general , i agree with you that the larger region needs to be examined .
that includes an economically strong region like malaysia , which is developing more and more .
i also think that we have to strengthen our contact with indonesia , now that political stability there has improved .
so there 's a lot to do . trade in one direction is good , but so is trade in two directions .
what about more investment flowing into germany from that region ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : automaker hyundai is one of south korea 's best-known international brands that 's something we are promoting in -lsb- south -rsb- korea .
the country , naturally , has high-performing companies that are interwoven throughout the world , and we would like that they also invest in germany . the euro is going from one record high to another .
what 's your view of the situation , particularly for germany 's export-oriented economy ? our invoices are in euros , except for airplanes and certain other products , so it 's not going to hit us as quickly .
but , naturally , when the exchange rates move too far apart there 's a chance our exports will suffer .
but our products are mainly bought because they are technologically first-rate and because the german economy and investment goods in particular compete on the basis of quality , not price . interview : henrik böhme -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the case is not expect to be brought to trial until some time in 2008 , nötzel told the associated press . siemens employs 461,000 people , of whom 165,000 are in germany , and manufactures telecommunications equipment , but also trains , power plants and medical equipment . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

prosecutors had sent the report to a judge who has spent a year looking into allegations of illegal share dealing at eads , paris daily le figaro wrote .
eads has been suspected of insider trading ever since the company plunged into crisis over delays to airbus ' prestigious a380 .
the value of eads shares had collapsed when airbus first announced delays in 2006 .
months later , airbus formally announced serious production difficulties .
suspicious activities management and shareholders at eads engaged in massive insider trading by selling shares before the problems at airbus were made public , le figaro said .
a total of 1,200 alleged cases of insider trading of the shares were detected , but the regulator decided to move quickly by concentrating on 21 people , including executives at eads and airbus as well as major shareholders .
the paper also wrote that amf described the selling of shares , which allegedly took place between november 2005 and march 2006 , as " simultaneous and massive . "
further press reports said the document cites former airbus chief executive and eads co-chief executive noel forgeard , who resigned in july last year amid a scandal over the timing of his share dealings and problems with the a380 .

according to le figaro , the amf report alleged that paris had been made aware of difficulties at eads before the company 's public announcements .

3 .
prosecutors had sent the report to a judge who has spent a year looking into allegations of illegal share dealing at eads , paris daily le figaro wrote .
eads has been suspected of insider trading ever since the company plunged into crisis over delays to airbus ' prestigious a380 .
the value of eads shares had collapsed when airbus first announced delays in 2006 .
months later , airbus formally announced serious production difficulties .
suspicious activities management and shareholders at eads engaged in massive insider trading by selling shares before the problems at airbus were made public , le figaro said .
a total of 1,200 alleged cases of insider trading of the shares were detected , but the regulator decided to move quickly by concentrating on 21 people , including executives at eads and airbus as well as major shareholders .
the paper also wrote that amf described the selling of shares , which allegedly took place between november 2005 and march 2006 , as " simultaneous and massive . "
further press reports said the document cites former airbus chief executive and eads co-chief executive noel forgeard , who resigned in july last year amid a scandal over the timing of his share dealings and problems with the a380 .
also named were current airbus chief thomas enders and a number of other current and former directors . "
unfounded accusations " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former eads joint ceos thomas enders -lrb- left -rrb- and noel forgeard the judicial probe was opened in november 2006 in response to complaints , notably from appac , an association of small french shareholders .
judges assigned to the case have since ordered searches to be carried out at the headquarters of eads and one of its principal shareholders , french media and defense company lagardere .
" eads is most surprised by the publication of information in the press , " said an eads statement , condemning what it called " an unlawful violation of the confidentiality of the current investigations and of the principle of the presumption of innocence . "
the major industrial shareholders of eads , german car giant daimlerchrysler and lagardere , each sold 7.5 percent of their holdings on april 4 , 2006 , for 2 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.8 billion -rrb- .
while daimlerchrysler has refused to comment , afp news service reported that lagardere said it would launch legal action for damages caused by " interpretations " of a preliminary amf document that had led to " unfounded accusations . "
government awareness while lagardere controls 7.5 percent and daimlerchrysler 22.5 percent of eads in order to preserve a franco-german balance within the group , 15 percent is owned by the french government .
according to le figaro , the amf report alleged that paris had been made aware of difficulties at eads before the company 's public announcements .
this threatens to create a political storm in france .
economics minister christine lagarde has denied any insider trading by the government , stressing that the state " never sold a single share , " according to afp . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

4 .
ahead of the conference he spoke to deutsche welle about the importance of doing business in asia . deutsche welle : the asia-pacific forum this week will concern itself with exports .
what results do you expect from this event ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it can be difficult for german companies to get started in japan michael glos : asia has become the most important export market for the german economy .
this is not just a small delegation , but a very important economic meeting .
it 's also a chance for german managers working in asia to exchange experiences .
but above all else it 's a sign that we have a close economic partnership with south korea .
last , but not least , i hope that these discussions will be strengthened by the visit . but it 's not just about south korea , it 's about a much , much bigger asia and the pacific region .
the head of the committee , jürgen hambrecht , has said that there are still many opportunities for german companies - not only in india and china but also in japan , australia and new zealand .
do you agree ? yes , i have a similar point of view .
but it is much more difficult to get a foot in the door in the japanese market than the chinese market .
but , in general , i agree with you that the larger region needs to be examined .
that includes an economically strong region like malaysia , which is developing more and more .
i also think that we have to strengthen our contact with indonesia , now that political stability there has improved .
so there 's a lot to do . trade in one direction is good , but so is trade in two directions .
what about more investment flowing into germany from that region ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : automaker hyundai is one of south korea 's best-known international brands that 's something we are promoting in -lsb- south -rsb- korea .
the country , naturally , has high-performing companies that are interwoven throughout the world , and we would like that they also invest in germany . the euro is going from one record high to another .
what 's your view of the situation , particularly for germany 's export-oriented economy ? our invoices are in euros , except for airplanes and certain other products , so it 's not going to hit us as quickly .
but , naturally , when the exchange rates move too far apart there 's a chance our exports will suffer .
but our products are mainly bought because they are technologically first-rate and because the german economy and investment goods in particular compete on the basis of quality , not price . interview : henrik böhme -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

4 , with the presiding judge sentencing them to between 10 and 15 years . the state court in bonn ruled that the three men had with premeditation murdered 20-year-old hermann h. , who was found dead in his four-man cell at the correctional facility in the western german town of siegburg on nov .
11 , 2006 .
he had been tortured , beaten and sexually abused for 12 hours before being forced to hang himself by his cellmates .
the judge stated that the three men , who had previously admitted to the killing , had planned to cover up the murder by making it look like suicide .
the victim was known to have psychological problems and the plan seemed to be to make the death look like an attempt to be moved from the facility to a hospital .
the main instigator of the crime , 20-year-old pascal i. , was sentenced to 15 years in prison while accomplice ralf a. , 21 , received 14 years .
the third man , 18-year-old dany k. , was handed the maximum possible sentence under youth criminal law - 10 years .
public prosecutor calls for life for main culprit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the murder at the prison in siegburg was premeditated the judge was asked to take into consideration the recommendations of the public prosecutor 's office in handing down the sentences .
the public prosecutor had recommended a life sentence for pascal i. , with no chance of parole for 15 years .
the judge complied with the office 's wishes to the letter on both the other sentences .
a proposed case against prison personnel is still being considered after complaints made about the guards at the scene who failed to notice anything awry , despite the fact that the brutal ordeal went on for hours .
the murder in the state of north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- shocked germany when it was first brought to light and prompted calls for sweeping reforms in the juvenile detention system .
a second case at the prison , in which another detainee was taunted and harassed and eventually forced to slit his wrists , added weight to the calls .
murder shocked nrw into prison reform review bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müller-piepenkötter instigated a prison review in response to the incidents in siegburg , north rhine-westphalian justice minister roswitha müller-piepenkötter announced measures to reduce overcrowding in the facilities and increase the number of guards .
she also laid out a plan to create an ombudsman 's office to represent prisoners who feel their rights are being infringed upon , and she has created an " independent , expert panel " to look into the issue of how to improve the system . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

4 , with the presiding judge sentencing them to between 10 and 15 years . the state court in bonn ruled that the three men had with premeditation murdered 20-year-old hermann h. , who was found dead in his four-man cell at the correctional facility in the western german town of siegburg on nov .
11 , 2006 .
he had been tortured , beaten and sexually abused for 12 hours before being forced to hang himself by his cellmates .
the judge stated that the three men , who had previously admitted to the killing , had planned to cover up the murder by making it look like suicide .
the victim was known to have psychological problems and the plan seemed to be to make the death look like an attempt to be moved from the facility to a hospital .
the main instigator of the crime , 20-year-old pascal i. , was sentenced to 15 years in prison while accomplice ralf a. , 21 , received 14 years .
the third man , 18-year-old dany k. , was handed the maximum possible sentence under youth criminal law - 10 years .
public prosecutor calls for life for main culprit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the murder at the prison in siegburg was premeditated the judge was asked to take into consideration the recommendations of the public prosecutor 's office in handing down the sentences .
the public prosecutor had recommended a life sentence for pascal i. , with no chance of parole for 15 years .
the judge complied with the office 's wishes to the letter on both the other sentences .
a proposed case against prison personnel is still being considered after complaints made about the guards at the scene who failed to notice anything awry , despite the fact that the brutal ordeal went on for hours .
the murder in the state of north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- shocked germany when it was first brought to light and prompted calls for sweeping reforms in the juvenile detention system .
a second case at the prison , in which another detainee was taunted and harassed and eventually forced to slit his wrists , added weight to the calls .
murder shocked nrw into prison reform review bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müller-piepenkötter instigated a prison review in response to the incidents in siegburg , north rhine-westphalian justice minister roswitha müller-piepenkötter announced measures to reduce overcrowding in the facilities and increase the number of guards .
she also laid out a plan to create an ombudsman 's office to represent prisoners who feel their rights are being infringed upon , and she has created an " independent , expert panel " to look into the issue of how to improve the system . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

3 .
prosecutors had sent the report to a judge who has spent a year looking into allegations of illegal share dealing at eads , paris daily le figaro wrote .
eads has been suspected of insider trading ever since the company plunged into crisis over delays to airbus ' prestigious a380 .
the value of eads shares had collapsed when airbus first announced delays in 2006 .
months later , airbus formally announced serious production difficulties .
suspicious activities management and shareholders at eads engaged in massive insider trading by selling shares before the problems at airbus were made public , le figaro said .
a total of 1,200 alleged cases of insider trading of the shares were detected , but the regulator decided to move quickly by concentrating on 21 people , including executives at eads and airbus as well as major shareholders .
the paper also wrote that amf described the selling of shares , which allegedly took place between november 2005 and march 2006 , as " simultaneous and massive . "
further press reports said the document cites former airbus chief executive and eads co-chief executive noel forgeard , who resigned in july last year amid a scandal over the timing of his share dealings and problems with the a380 .
also named were current airbus chief thomas enders and a number of other current and former directors . "
unfounded accusations " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former eads joint ceos thomas enders -lrb- left -rrb- and noel forgeard the judicial probe was opened in november 2006 in response to complaints , notably from appac , an association of small french shareholders .
judges assigned to the case have since ordered searches to be carried out at the headquarters of eads and one of its principal shareholders , french media and defense company lagardere .
" eads is most surprised by the publication of information in the press , " said an eads statement , condemning what it called " an unlawful violation of the confidentiality of the current investigations and of the principle of the presumption of innocence . "
the major industrial shareholders of eads , german car giant daimlerchrysler and lagardere , each sold 7.5 percent of their holdings on april 4 , 2006 , for 2 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.8 billion -rrb- .
while daimlerchrysler has refused to comment , afp news service reported that lagardere said it would launch legal action for damages caused by " interpretations " of a preliminary amf document that had led to " unfounded accusations . "
government awareness while lagardere controls 7.5 percent and daimlerchrysler 22.5 percent of eads in order to preserve a franco-german balance within the group , 15 percent is owned by the french government .
according to le figaro , the amf report alleged that paris had been made aware of difficulties at eads before the company 's public announcements .
this threatens to create a political storm in france .

4 , after a two-year renovation , the organization announced the end of its own one-year long overhaul and new plans to step up its international presence . in paris with foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier to attend the inauguration of the new offices , goethe institute pesident jutta limbach on wednesday revealed the first of the organization 's post-facelift plans . " the goethe institute in paris will again become a central place to encounter german and french culture , " limback said in a statement . in addition to the paris institute , limbach said gi was also examining which other offices it will reopen . " we are considering which of the institutes that had to be shut down in the 1990s in north and sub-saharan africa should now be reopened , " she said , referring to closures that happened as part of an economy drive .
the gi is set to open three new offices , including one in novosibirsk , the third largest city in russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : changing with the times also on the agenda is boosted cooperation with the institut francais .
two such projects already exist in ramallah and glasgow .
" collaboration with the institut francais in moscow has been on the cards for years , " said limbach .
out of the woods the goethe institute 's overhaul , aimed at increasing efficiency and modernizing the non-profit organization , began in 2006 . " goethe needs to reinvent himself in order to adapt to the changing times , " said limbach on public broadcaster wdr last october . the reform measures have now come to a close , she said , adding that the organization had come through its period of change . the gi has 142 offices in 81 countries , and costs some 250 million euros a year .
roughly 165 million euros of that comes from the foreign ministry , and cost-cutting has long been a priority .
not a goodbye to europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the organization plans to expand in asia and africa , the hanoi gi is seen here but while more will be invested in offices in africa and asia , the gi 's headquarters in munich will be witnessing job cuts , with infrastructure costs both at home and abroad set to be reduced .
to many , the move makes sense .
until now , the gi has had a significantly higher profile in europe than overseas .
the gi has seven offices in italy , for example , compared to just three in china .
but limbach was keen to counter any impression the gi was withdrawing from europe .
" we plan to continue our work without closing any of our offices in europe , " she said .
" our intention is to distribute our budget - which used to have a west-european focus - more fairly around the world . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" accused of paying for contracts siemens was suspected of bribing key union officials to secure industrial peace and of establishing a massive slush fund to obtain foreign contracts . the company admitted that its own internal investigations uncovered 420 million euros in " questionable payments " dating back to 1999 , although german press reports say the sum involved exceeded 1.5 billion euros . the investigation into the company led to the resignations of chairman heinrich von pierer and chief executive officer klaus kleinfeld in april . other investigations continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are at least six investigations into siemens ' business practices the vast investigation has also spawned investigations by the swiss authorities and by the us stock market watchdog , the securities and exchange commission . " it 's the closing of one chapter and that 's certainly appreciated by the market , " bernd laux , an analyst at credit agricole cheuvreux in frankfurt , told bloomberg .
" but the big and by far the most important chapter is the investigations by the sec . " also thursday , court spokeswoman margarete nötzel said munich prosecutors had filed charges against longtime siemens manager reinhard s. in connection with the ongoing scandal . the charges are the first to be brought against a manager for the company .
the case is not expect to be brought to trial until some time in 2008 , nötzel told the associated press . siemens employs 461,000 people , of whom 165,000 are in germany , and manufactures telecommunications equipment , but also trains , power plants and medical equipment . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

4 , with the presiding judge sentencing them to between 10 and 15 years . the state court in bonn ruled that the three men had with premeditation murdered 20-year-old hermann h. , who was found dead in his four-man cell at the correctional facility in the western german town of siegburg on nov .
11 , 2006 .
he had been tortured , beaten and sexually abused for 12 hours before being forced to hang himself by his cellmates .
the judge stated that the three men , who had previously admitted to the killing , had planned to cover up the murder by making it look like suicide .
the victim was known to have psychological problems and the plan seemed to be to make the death look like an attempt to be moved from the facility to a hospital .
the main instigator of the crime , 20-year-old pascal i. , was sentenced to 15 years in prison while accomplice ralf a. , 21 , received 14 years .
the third man , 18-year-old dany k. , was handed the maximum possible sentence under youth criminal law - 10 years .
public prosecutor calls for life for main culprit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the murder at the prison in siegburg was premeditated the judge was asked to take into consideration the recommendations of the public prosecutor 's office in handing down the sentences .
the public prosecutor had recommended a life sentence for pascal i. , with no chance of parole for 15 years .
the judge complied with the office 's wishes to the letter on both the other sentences .
a proposed case against prison personnel is still being considered after complaints made about the guards at the scene who failed to notice anything awry , despite the fact that the brutal ordeal went on for hours .
the murder in the state of north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- shocked germany when it was first brought to light and prompted calls for sweeping reforms in the juvenile detention system .
a second case at the prison , in which another detainee was taunted and harassed and eventually forced to slit his wrists , added weight to the calls .
murder shocked nrw into prison reform review bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müller-piepenkötter instigated a prison review in response to the incidents in siegburg , north rhine-westphalian justice minister roswitha müller-piepenkötter announced measures to reduce overcrowding in the facilities and increase the number of guards .
she also laid out a plan to create an ombudsman 's office to represent prisoners who feel their rights are being infringed upon , and she has created an " independent , expert panel " to look into the issue of how to improve the system . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

3 .
prosecutors had sent the report to a judge who has spent a year looking into allegations of illegal share dealing at eads , paris daily le figaro wrote .
eads has been suspected of insider trading ever since the company plunged into crisis over delays to airbus ' prestigious a380 .
the value of eads shares had collapsed when airbus first announced delays in 2006 .
months later , airbus formally announced serious production difficulties .
suspicious activities management and shareholders at eads engaged in massive insider trading by selling shares before the problems at airbus were made public , le figaro said .
a total of 1,200 alleged cases of insider trading of the shares were detected , but the regulator decided to move quickly by concentrating on 21 people , including executives at eads and airbus as well as major shareholders .
the paper also wrote that amf described the selling of shares , which allegedly took place between november 2005 and march 2006 , as " simultaneous and massive . "
further press reports said the document cites former airbus chief executive and eads co-chief executive noel forgeard , who resigned in july last year amid a scandal over the timing of his share dealings and problems with the a380 .
also named were current airbus chief thomas enders and a number of other current and former directors . "
unfounded accusations " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former eads joint ceos thomas enders -lrb- left -rrb- and noel forgeard the judicial probe was opened in november 2006 in response to complaints , notably from appac , an association of small french shareholders .
judges assigned to the case have since ordered searches to be carried out at the headquarters of eads and one of its principal shareholders , french media and defense company lagardere .
" eads is most surprised by the publication of information in the press , " said an eads statement , condemning what it called " an unlawful violation of the confidentiality of the current investigations and of the principle of the presumption of innocence . "
the major industrial shareholders of eads , german car giant daimlerchrysler and lagardere , each sold 7.5 percent of their holdings on april 4 , 2006 , for 2 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.8 billion -rrb- .
while daimlerchrysler has refused to comment , afp news service reported that lagardere said it would launch legal action for damages caused by " interpretations " of a preliminary amf document that had led to " unfounded accusations . "
government awareness while lagardere controls 7.5 percent and daimlerchrysler 22.5 percent of eads in order to preserve a franco-german balance within the group , 15 percent is owned by the french government .
according to le figaro , the amf report alleged that paris had been made aware of difficulties at eads before the company 's public announcements .
this threatens to create a political storm in france .

" the beautiful thing about this decision is that you 're all part of my past now , " fischer told journalists at the end of a press conference announcing his resignation from parliament . while that may have -lrb- more or less -rrb- been the case for the past two years , the iconic ex-politician is back at the center of media attention .

it covers the first four years of his time in office from 1998 to 2001 and focuses on the tough battles ahead of germany 's first military mission after world war ii , in the former yugoslavia . green dilemmas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer was attacked with paint because of his support for the kosovo mission the book comes at a time when fischer 's green party colleagues are torn between the former über-leader 's legacy and a strong current to bring the party back to its pacifist roots . fischer has harshly criticized his party 's recent decision not to support a renewal of the military mission in afghanistan .
he also said it would make it less likely for the greens to return to power after the 2009 election . " if the greens think that they can return to a leftist protest profile without paying a hefty price , they 're mistaken , " the 59-year-old told german magazine stern in an interview , adding that germany should expand rather than cut back its presence in afghanistan .

" the party was very exhausting .
it enabled me to have a great political career , but i was just tired at the end . " after a stint as a guest professor at princeton university and a reported move from his central berlin apartment to a house in the german capital 's posh grunewald neighborhood , fischer seems to have regained his spirits .

" no more concerts , " fischer , who once described himself as germany 's last " live rock and roller , " told stern . he 's also rejected rumors that he 's interested in the country 's top job - the largely ceremonial federal presidency . " there are few offices that i 'm less qualified for , " fischer , a high school dropout and former taxi driver , told stern .

" the beautiful thing about this decision is that you 're all part of my past now , " fischer told journalists at the end of a press conference announcing his resignation from parliament . while that may have -lrb- more or less -rrb- been the case for the past two years , the iconic ex-politician is back at the center of media attention .
after previous books on weight-loss and another one about the post-sept .
11 world , a well-fed fischer has just published the first part of his political memoirs . " the red-green years - german foreign policy from kosovo to sept .
11 " hit book stores on thursday , oct .
4 .
it covers the first four years of his time in office from 1998 to 2001 and focuses on the tough battles ahead of germany 's first military mission after world war ii , in the former yugoslavia . green dilemmas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer was attacked with paint because of his support for the kosovo mission the book comes at a time when fischer 's green party colleagues are torn between the former über-leader 's legacy and a strong current to bring the party back to its pacifist roots . fischer has harshly criticized his party 's recent decision not to support a renewal of the military mission in afghanistan .
he also said it would make it less likely for the greens to return to power after the 2009 election . " if the greens think that they can return to a leftist protest profile without paying a hefty price , they 're mistaken , " the 59-year-old told german magazine stern in an interview , adding that germany should expand rather than cut back its presence in afghanistan . " now some people might understand better why i just wanted to get away , " fischer told der spiegel newsmagazine in another interview coinciding with the publication of his book .
" the party was very exhausting .
it enabled me to have a great political career , but i was just tired at the end . " after a stint as a guest professor at princeton university and a reported move from his central berlin apartment to a house in the german capital 's posh grunewald neighborhood , fischer seems to have regained his spirits .
he 's founded a political consultancy firm and serves as a co-chair of the newly established european council on foreign relations . " no more concerts " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer now prefers writing to active politics while some see fischer 's reappearance as a sign of his possible return to politics , the man himself has repeatedly said that he has no desire to return to his old line of work and will not appear at green party events during future election campaigns . " no more concerts , " fischer , who once described himself as germany 's last " live rock and roller , " told stern . he 's also rejected rumors that he 's interested in the country 's top job - the largely ceremonial federal presidency . " there are few offices that i 'm less qualified for , " fischer , a high school dropout and former taxi driver , told stern .
" if there 's something i did n't like as foreign minister , then it was the representative , the ceremonial aspects .
that 's not me . " instead , fischer will soon start writing the second part of his memoirs , he said on thursday . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

3 .
prosecutors had sent the report to a judge who has spent a year looking into allegations of illegal share dealing at eads , paris daily le figaro wrote .
eads has been suspected of insider trading ever since the company plunged into crisis over delays to airbus ' prestigious a380 .
the value of eads shares had collapsed when airbus first announced delays in 2006 .
months later , airbus formally announced serious production difficulties .
suspicious activities management and shareholders at eads engaged in massive insider trading by selling shares before the problems at airbus were made public , le figaro said .
a total of 1,200 alleged cases of insider trading of the shares were detected , but the regulator decided to move quickly by concentrating on 21 people , including executives at eads and airbus as well as major shareholders .
the paper also wrote that amf described the selling of shares , which allegedly took place between november 2005 and march 2006 , as " simultaneous and massive . "
further press reports said the document cites former airbus chief executive and eads co-chief executive noel forgeard , who resigned in july last year amid a scandal over the timing of his share dealings and problems with the a380 .
also named were current airbus chief thomas enders and a number of other current and former directors . "
unfounded accusations " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former eads joint ceos thomas enders -lrb- left -rrb- and noel forgeard the judicial probe was opened in november 2006 in response to complaints , notably from appac , an association of small french shareholders .
judges assigned to the case have since ordered searches to be carried out at the headquarters of eads and one of its principal shareholders , french media and defense company lagardere .
" eads is most surprised by the publication of information in the press , " said an eads statement , condemning what it called " an unlawful violation of the confidentiality of the current investigations and of the principle of the presumption of innocence . "
the major industrial shareholders of eads , german car giant daimlerchrysler and lagardere , each sold 7.5 percent of their holdings on april 4 , 2006 , for 2 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.8 billion -rrb- .
while daimlerchrysler has refused to comment , afp news service reported that lagardere said it would launch legal action for damages caused by " interpretations " of a preliminary amf document that had led to " unfounded accusations . "
government awareness while lagardere controls 7.5 percent and daimlerchrysler 22.5 percent of eads in order to preserve a franco-german balance within the group , 15 percent is owned by the french government .
according to le figaro , the amf report alleged that paris had been made aware of difficulties at eads before the company 's public announcements .
this threatens to create a political storm in france .
economics minister christine lagarde has denied any insider trading by the government , stressing that the state " never sold a single share , " according to afp . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

health commission wales -lrb- hcw -rrb- has been told to apologise to yvonne thomas for the " perverse " decision which the ombudsman said was maladministration .
mrs thomas was told she needed an £ 800 pet scan to check for cancer after a lump was found beside her lung .
but health commission wales refused funding and said she could have surgery instead - costing the nhs more .
hcw has been ordered to reimburse the cost of the scan and pay an extra £ 500 for worry and distress , the assembly government said .
when the lump was first discovered , mrs thomas ' consultant wrote to hcw to request funding for the scan - which uses radiation to produce a three-dimensional colour image - to determine if the lump was malignant .
i really was dumbfounded at the logic behind it ... especially because the cost to the nhs of this procedure was three or four times as much as a pet scan yvonne thomas but the request was turned down on the grounds that mrs thomas did not have a proven case of lung cancer and therefore did not qualify .
the only other option available to mrs thomas was to have a thoracotomy - an operation which would have cost three or four times more than the pet scan and which , because of the location of ms thomas ' lump , was described as a " tricky " procedure by a surgeon .
the cost of a thoracotomy would not have come out of hcw 's budget , the report by public services ombudsman adam peat said .
in the end the lump did not prove to be cancerous but mrs thomas , 52 , said she was shocked by the way she was treated and complained to the public services ombudsman .
" it seemed ludicrous , " she said .
" it -lsb- the pet scan -rsb- could have put my mind at rest much sooner because i waited a very , very long time to know that i was clear of cancer .
" i think the most shocking thing is that they were prepared to put me through a major operation .
public services ombudsman adam peat said the decision was perverse " i really was dumbfounded at the logic behind it ... especially because the cost to the nhs of this procedure was three or four times as much as a pet scan . "
in his report , mr peat said it was " absurd " for a welsh assembly government agency to take funding decisions which were wasteful of nhs resources and that the commission appeared to be " driven by a desire to protect hcw 's own budget " .
he recommended that hcw apologised to mrs thomas , reimbursed her the £ 800 she paid for the private pet scan and that it paid an additional sum of £ 500 " to reflect the worry and distress which its flawed decision-making also caused her " .
' urgently review ' he also said hcw should also review its pet scan policy to ensure that applications falling outside the criteria would be considered on their individual merits .
as well as that he recommended the welsh assembly government should " urgently review " the operation of hcw with a view to optimising the use of nhs resources .
the assembly government has seen a draft of the report and has agreed to implement all his recommendations .
mrs thomas said she would accept an apology on condition that hcw reviewed the criteria they used to exclude people from pet scans .
she said : " to me , the criteria was so specific that it appeared that it was designed to exclude as many people as possible as opposed to including as many people as possible . "
hcw is already under a review announced by health minister edwina hart last week .
professor mansel aylward , of cardiff university , who is also chairman of the wales centre for health , will carry out the review .

instead , ms spears was granted rights to visit the children .
her former husband , kevin federline , was awarded sole custody earlier this week .
los angeles superior court commissioner scott gordon extended that custody order until another hearing on 26 october to review the situation .
the couple previously shared custody , and no reason was given for the change .
however , a lawyer for ms spears , sorrell trope , told a us magazine that the judge had acted after the singer was unable to prove she had complied with several court orders .
last month , mr gordon said ms spears , 25 , showed " a habitual , frequent and continuous use of controlled substances and alcohol " .
hit-and-run the singer , whose career has been hit by a year of frequent erratic behaviour , did not attend court on wednesday , although mr federline did .
speaking after the hearing , mr federline 's lawyer , mark kaplan , said his client believed the ruling giving him custody was " justified " .
" kevin wants to maintain the custody that he has as long as he can , " mr kaplan added .
the judge was later expected to confirm the details of ms spears ' visitation rights .
she has already been ordered her to undergo random drug and alcohol tests twice a week and meet weekly with a " parenting coach " , according to court documents .
the judge has also ordered ms spears and mr federline to complete a parenting class .
also last month , ms spears was charged with hit-and-run and driving without a valid licence .
she is accused of hitting a parked car and driving away from a los angeles car park on 6 august , a spokesman for the city 's attorney 's office said .
ms spears could face six months in jail and a $ 1,000 -lrb- £ 495 -rrb- fine if convicted of the charges .
the singer 's latest setback follows a year of unfavourable headlines following her separation from mr federline last november .
she was dropped by her management firm last month following her so-called comeback performance at the mtv video music awards , which was panned by critics .
her divorce was finalised on 30 july and since then , the estranged couple have shared an equal amount of time with the two boys .
however , mr federline had been fighting for greater time and more money .

lancashire police wildlife officer , pc duncan thomas , said the scheme was " exceptional compared to other areas of the country " .
he said : " although we enjoy comparatively good returns of all species , we created operation buffer to provide a multi-agency approach to management of breeding sites in the major estates of lancashire , which provide exceptional habitats for these breeding birds .
" without the full support of these estates we may not see the progress and situation that we have enjoyed so far . "
pc thomas said it was difficult to tell the exact number of hen harriers in lancashire , as the birds were typically nomadic birds .

the online auction site and web pay service are working with yahoo to use the firm 's anti-phishing technology .
the firms are supporting the emerging standard known as domain keys , which block fake e-mails by validating the sender with a digital signature .
spammers hide their identity by using a false , or spoofed , address in the millions of messages they send out .
the technology , called the domainkeys identified mail -lrb- dkim -rrb- , will be available to millions of yahoo mail users worldwide in the coming weeks .
" it is a big step forward for consumers in defence against the bad guys , " john kremer , vice president of yahoo mail , told reuters news agency .
targeted companies according to security analysts trend micro , ebay and its popular payment service paypal are the two most targeted companies for phishing e-mails in the last months .
e-mail analysts messagelabs reports that one in every 173 e-mails sent around the world each day contains some form of phishing attacks . "
two years ago if you asked companies whether they were using e-mail authentication , most people would n't have cared " chenxi wang , forrester anatomy of a spam " our message to both businesses and consumers is : beware of unexpected or strange-looking e-mails regardless of their sender and never open attachments or links contained in these email messages " , said david sancho , of trendlabs at trend micro .
a recent yougov poll , conducted on behalf of uswitch.com , reported that 35 % of 2,500 people surveyed in the uk said they received more than 10 spam e-mails every day .
yahoo 's system is designed to automatically detect potential phishing attacks without relying on the consumer to intervene .
encrypted signatures " if the consumer does n't receive an e-mail in their inbox then it is very hard for the phisher to victimise them , " michael barrett , paypal 's chief information security officer .
dkim uses encrypted digital signatures to prove a message 's origin .
although 90 to 99 % of e-mail comes from senders known to the recipient , establishing the identity of a sender remains a key consideration in the protection against spam .
spammers get away with sending spoofed e-mails because mail servers only check if a domain mentioned in these spoofed addresses - such as @ madeupmailname.com - is known to be used by spammers .
dkim lets honest e-mail senders prove they sent a message by encrypting a two-part signature , or key , in a selected part of the mail .
the e-mail provider , such as yahoo , puts an encrypted private key into the e-mail when it is sent .
it is linked to a public key held by the internet 's domain name system - the phonebook of the internet .
the mail server which receives the e-mail checks to ensure that the private and public keys match , proving that the message has come from a genuine sender .
' coming around ' but in order for the technology to work , both the sender and recipient need their mail services to be signed up to dkim .
the technology was developed by yahoo and is backed by aol , google , ibm , sendmail and verisign .
a second standard , called sender policy framework -lrb- spf -rrb- , is backed by microsoft , amazon and ebay , which supports both forms of protection .
digitally signed e-mails are expected to become the norm in the coming years .
chenxi wang , a security analyst with forrester research , told reuters : " two years ago if you asked companies whether they were using e-mail authentication , most people would n't have cared .
" the industry is slowly coming around , " mr wang said .
" ebay and paypal are some of the first to actively block unauthenticated e-mails . "

the scottish government said some of the money would help support young people beyond the age of 18 .
latest figures show there are 1,560 children in residential care homes and schools across scotland .
charity children 1st said it hoped the money would improve the extremely poor life outcomes experienced by some children who have been in care .
the money will be distributed between scotland 's 32 local authorities in 2007/8 .
adam ingram , the children and early years minister , said : " authorities and agencies can never fully replace a parent , but they can turn around the experiences of children from challenging backgrounds by asking ' what would i want for my own child ' ? "
" improving corporate parenting will improve the future of many " nicola mcdade care leaver ' luck should n't come into it ' anne houston , children 1st chief executive , welcomed the funding .
" for too long children in care , who are among some of our most vulnerable members of society , have lacked the long-term support they need .
" many young people have had a very difficult start in life , and it is our responsibility to make sure we do not write them off but instead provide the necessary support to help them overcome the challenges they have faced . "
nicola mcdade , 24 , entered the care of glasgow city council as a baby and went on to complete a masters degree at the university of glasgow .
she said : " the scottish government 's innovative drive to improve corporate parenting by raising standards , prioritising education and achieving continuity and stability in the lives of looked-after young people will improve the future of many . "

she told the bbc scotland news website about the differences her educational achievements have made to her life . "
my personal experience of the care system comes from being in local authority care from an early age .
nicola mcdade and her brother were placed with a family funding to help care for children i was in various foster placements from the age of six months until the age of six , when both my brother and i were placed with a family .
we were under the impression that this would be a short-term situation until an adoptive family could be found .
however , the weeks became months and the years rolled by and 18 years on we are still there .
i think the fact that my brother and i had a place to call home , a sense of stability and , more essentially , a caring family made such a significant difference to my life and future .
being part of a family is so important .
just the feeling of belonging , the sense of permanence and of knowing people care , is vital to every child 's wellbeing and personal development .
i feel extremely fortunate in that i have people who love me and who give me support and encouragement in all that i do .
i think this has been integral to the person i have become and has enabled me to realise my ambitions and ultimately has led me to where i am today .
having people around me who care has been essential to my education , particularly during my years at university . "
having people around me who care has been essential to my education " but i know that it is not the same for all young people .
some , through no fault of their own , find themselves in difficult circumstances - often alone and with no-one to offer a simple word of comfort or encouragement .
i know that young people in care can find themselves the victims of negative stereotypes and , combined with financial and emotional pressures , successfully completing high school education or going to college or university is just not often an option .
i think young people in local authority care may face challenges that are often radically different from those faced by the large majority of young people .
their educational needs need to be prioritised and attitudes changed in order to give them the chance to fulfil their potential in the face of these opposing circumstances , barriers that too many currently face .
i feel lucky but luck should n't come into it .
in my opinion we need to improve the communication between local authority workers , from social , residential and educational workers , to foster carers and senior officers , to ensure that their roles and responsibilities are having an impact .
the lives of looked-after young people need continuity and stability and essentially listening to .
putting them at the centre of all they do will , in my opinion , improve the future of many . "
i warmly welcome any new concerted effort to implement support networks aimed at improving the educational achievements of all children in care " i know how vital that support was during my school years and how this enabled me to continue to learn and progress .
in 2005 i graduated from the university of glasgow with a 2:1 ma -lrb- hons -rrb- in economic and social history and film and television studies .
throughout my time at university i was continually supported and encouraged by many , from my foster family to my tutors to my local authority , glasgow city council .
as part of a scheme at improving the educational attainment of looked-after children i was offered a laptop and printer to aid my studies .
naturally i jumped at the chance - it made such a difference and enabled me to complete my coursework to a high standard , allowing me to study at home and meet course deadlines .
glasgow city council also ensured that my fees were paid and that additional support was provided for travelling and studying resources .
free from the added strain of financial pressures i could focus wholly on my studies and i 'm convinced all of these factors combined in helping me to obtain my degree .
i thoroughly enjoyed my time at university and wanted to further my qualifications so i began to look into post-graduate courses .
i contacted the council to see whether financial support could be provided .
to my delight i was told that my course could be funded and in november of last year i graduated again from the university of glasgow with a master of letters in screen studies .
what i 'd really like now is take part in the mountbatten internship programme which involves working in new york for a year and then eventually gaining a cambridge international diploma in management .
as i look back now as a care leaver i warmly welcome any new concerted effort to implement procedures and support networks aimed at improving the educational achievements of all children in care .
i know the difference it can make and there 's no reason why they ca n't reach their goals too . "

i think young people in local authority care may face challenges that are often radically different from those faced by the large majority of young people .
their educational needs need to be prioritised and attitudes changed in order to give them the chance to fulfil their potential in the face of these opposing circumstances , barriers that too many currently face .
i feel lucky but luck should n't come into it .
in my opinion we need to improve the communication between local authority workers , from social , residential and educational workers , to foster carers and senior officers , to ensure that their roles and responsibilities are having an impact .
the lives of looked-after young people need continuity and stability and essentially listening to .
putting them at the centre of all they do will , in my opinion , improve the future of many .
i warmly welcome any new concerted effort to implement support networks aimed at improving the educational achievements of all children in care i know how vital that support was during my school years and how this enabled me to continue to learn and progress .
in 2005 i graduated from the university of glasgow with a 2:1 ma -lrb- hons -rrb- in economic and social history and film and television studies .
throughout my time at university i was continually supported and encouraged by many , from my foster family to my tutors to my local authority , glasgow city council .
as part of a scheme at improving the educational attainment of looked-after children i was offered a laptop and printer to aid my studies .
naturally i jumped at the chance - it made such a difference and enabled me to complete my coursework to a high standard , allowing me to study at home and meet course deadlines .
glasgow city council also ensured that my fees were paid and that additional support was provided for travelling and studying resources .
free from the added strain of financial pressures i could focus wholly on my studies and i 'm convinced all of these factors combined in helping me to obtain my degree .
i thoroughly enjoyed my time at university and wanted to further my qualifications so i began to look into post-graduate courses .
i contacted the council to see whether financial support could be provided .
to my delight i was told that my course could be funded and in november of last year i graduated again from the university of glasgow with a master of letters in screen studies .
what i 'd really like now is take part in the mountbatten internship programme which involves working in new york for a year and then eventually gaining a cambridge international diploma in management .
as i look back now as a care leaver i warmly welcome any new concerted effort to implement procedures and support networks aimed at improving the educational achievements of all children in care .
i know the difference it can make and there 's no reason why they ca n't reach their goals too .

james callaghan elected leader : april 1976 age when elected : 62 defeated rivals : michael foot , tony benn , roy jenkins , denis healey , tony crosland by the end of the year , his chancellor , denis healey , would have gone cap-in-hand to the international monetary fund for a rescue loan , at the cost of big public spending cuts .
but for the first 100 days of his premiership at least , voters appeared willing to give " sunny jim , " as mr callaghan was dubbed by the press , the benefit of the doubt .
he was seen as a calming influence in troubled times , a more straightforward and frank character than his predecessor , harold wilson .
and his background in trade unionism was seen as a major bonus at a time when the union barons held so many of the economic cards .
majority mr callaghan 's government was expected to be a short-lived one .
mr callaghan is proving a firm , plain speaking prime minister , who has established more confidence among the cabinet , the parliamentary party , the top of the trade union movement than for many a day the times he had taken on the top job after a bitter leadership contest triggered by mr wilson 's surprise resignation and had the unenviable task of holding the warring factions together .
to make matters worse , labour 's minuscule majority was wiped out within days of his arrival in downing street , following the death of one labour mp and the resignation of another .
yet , for all his troubles , mr callaghan was still seen as the most likely victor if it came to an electoral contest with tory leader margaret thatcher , who was still an unknown quantity for many voters .
throughout the blazing hot summer of 1976 , the newspapers were full of speculation about a snap election .
" the conventional view is that the conservatives are a weak opposition and that they would be unlikely to win a general election either now or later , " the times wrote in an editorial .
" this view is to some extent supported by the most recent gallup poll which showed that the labour and conservative parties were level and that the prime minister was a good deal more highly regarded than mrs thatcher . "
' intrigue ' but , the editorial went on to note , with some prescience , that there was " no great enthusiasm for the government among its own supporters in the country , " who had been on the receiving end of their wages squeeze and rising prices .
a few days earlier , in an article to mark mr callaghan 's first 100 days , times writer geoffrey smith praised the new prime minister 's " calm strength " - but also wondered if the warm reception he had received was " too good to be true " .
labour 's left and right were united in praise for mr callaghan , wrote mr smith , and " there is not the air of intrigue and suspicion that used to haunt the cabinet room " under mr wilson .
but , he added , " much of the approval is a reaction from the wilson years ; once people forget to make that comparison a few of mr callaghan 's human blemishes may appear . "
nevertheless , he concluded : " mr callaghan is proving a firm , plain speaking prime minister , who has established more confidence among the cabinet , the parliamentary party , the top of the trade union movement than for many a day . "
what happened next : james callaghan lost the 1979 general election to conservative margaret thatcher and stood down as an mp in 1987 .

james callaghan elected leader : april 1976 age when elected : 62 defeated rivals : michael foot , tony benn , roy jenkins , denis healey , tony crosland by the end of the year , his chancellor , denis healey , would have gone cap-in-hand to the international monetary fund for a rescue loan , at the cost of big public spending cuts .
but for the first 100 days of his premiership at least , voters appeared willing to give " sunny jim , " as mr callaghan was dubbed by the press , the benefit of the doubt .
he was seen as a calming influence in troubled times , a more straightforward and frank character than his predecessor , harold wilson .
and his background in trade unionism was seen as a major bonus at a time when the union barons held so many of the economic cards .
majority mr callaghan 's government was expected to be a short-lived one .
mr callaghan is proving a firm , plain speaking prime minister , who has established more confidence among the cabinet , the parliamentary party , the top of the trade union movement than for many a day the times he had taken on the top job after a bitter leadership contest triggered by mr wilson 's surprise resignation and had the unenviable task of holding the warring factions together .
to make matters worse , labour 's minuscule majority was wiped out within days of his arrival in downing street , following the death of one labour mp and the resignation of another .
yet , for all his troubles , mr callaghan was still seen as the most likely victor if it came to an electoral contest with tory leader margaret thatcher , who was still an unknown quantity for many voters .
throughout the blazing hot summer of 1976 , the newspapers were full of speculation about a snap election .
" the conventional view is that the conservatives are a weak opposition and that they would be unlikely to win a general election either now or later , " the times wrote in an editorial .
" this view is to some extent supported by the most recent gallup poll which showed that the labour and conservative parties were level and that the prime minister was a good deal more highly regarded than mrs thatcher . "
' intrigue ' but , the editorial went on to note , with some prescience , that there was " no great enthusiasm for the government among its own supporters in the country , " who had been on the receiving end of their wages squeeze and rising prices .
a few days earlier , in an article to mark mr callaghan 's first 100 days , times writer geoffrey smith praised the new prime minister 's " calm strength " - but also wondered if the warm reception he had received was " too good to be true " .
labour 's left and right were united in praise for mr callaghan , wrote mr smith , and " there is not the air of intrigue and suspicion that used to haunt the cabinet room " under mr wilson .
but , he added , " much of the approval is a reaction from the wilson years ; once people forget to make that comparison a few of mr callaghan 's human blemishes may appear . "
nevertheless , he concluded : " mr callaghan is proving a firm , plain speaking prime minister , who has established more confidence among the cabinet , the parliamentary party , the top of the trade union movement than for many a day . "
what happened next : james callaghan lost the 1979 general election to conservative margaret thatcher and stood down as an mp in 1987 .
he died , aged 92 , in 2005 .

microsoft , yahoo and ask have been busy offering new interfaces and features in an effort to compete .
but broadly the search engines offer similar services - different ways to refine searches , link to shopping and local services and access blogs and other sources , alongside traditional web pages .
according to jupiter analyst nate elliot the underlying algorithms that powers search are also very similar among the main players .
" strip out the brands and just show the results and there is not often a lot of difference .
the biggest difference between them is the logo at the top of the page , " he said .
and it is here that google has a huge advantage : a trusted brand in many people 's minds , there is little reason to desert it for one of the other search engines .
the bbc news website takes a look at some of the features offered by the main players and where they go next .
yahoo some see yahoo as under google 's shadow without yahoo , google would n't be the company that it is today .
between june 2000 and may 2004 , google powered yahoo 's search engine and since then , many think that yahoo has been in google 's shadow .
its latest upgrade sees it introduce an interface that integrates video , audio and photos into search .
there is also a new search-assist feature based on concepts .
it allows the engine to provide a list of possible questions when users type their request .
it is seen as being pretty innovative in social search with features such as yahoo answers offering users the chance to post questions and seek answers from other users .
it owns photo-sharing site flickr , which gives it a vast image library , and should help toward becoming what vice-president of search vish makhijani described as the " best in breed in certain categories " .
its other big play is in the area of mobile search .
most recently it has done a deal with spain 's telefonica to become the main search engine on its networks in europe and latin america .
microsoft live search formerly known as msn search , microsoft 's live search has just had a significant revamp .
according to derrick connell , microsoft 's global live search general manager , this latest makeover was more for existing customers than about attracting new ones .
" we wanted to engage current users rather than convince other users to come to us .
it was about differentiating the service from what we had last year , " he said .
as part of this it has quadrupled the size of its searchable index and improved relevancy of answers with , for instance , links to reviews when looking for products .
from the white box that people type into to a fully scaled 3d model of the world , the way people get access to their answers will dramatically change , derrick connell , general manager microsoft it now offers the ability to refine questions , view additional search results on the same web page rather than clicking through to the next page and dynamically adjust the amount of information displayed for each search result .
it also allows the user to save searches and see them updated automatically on live.com microsoft is concentrating on four main areas of search ; entertainment , shopping , local mapping and health which , according to mr connell , account for 40 % of all searches .
" there will always be a basic human need for answers to questions but everything else will change , " said mr connell .
microsoft 's mapping service virtual earth 3d , could play a huge part in the future of search , he thinks .
" from the white box that people type into to a fully scaled 3d model of the world , the way people get access to their answers will dramatically change , " he said .
ask ask was relaunched in june 2007 with a more simplistic interface which divided the search page into three columns .
the left-hand column lets searchers refine what they are looking for to make their terms either more or less specific .
the central column contains a familiar list of results plus adverts and the tools that let people save pages or use the now well-known binoculars feature to get a sneak preview of websites .
the right-hand column gives instant access to results from other categories such as images , blogs and video .
for some its collaboration with bloglines , enabling users to search and track blogs , is one of its best features while others admire its image search facility .
for jupiter 's elliot , ask has always been the plucky under-dog .
" i really like ask and i think they have offered some of the most innovative features of the last year , " he said .
google google 's dominance of the search engine market comes down to two things , most experts agree .
it 's simple interface and the way it was able to provide much more accurate results than its rivals in the early days .
this was down to a new way of ranking pages , a kind of real-life metric , which took into account how many others linked to and referred to sites .
google 's search engine comes with a long list of features from the now-familiar i 'm feeling lucky , to images , books , street maps , local search and a new tool to refine searches .
for allen weiner , research director at gartner , google is still the winner when it comes to general queries but in other areas , it is not doing so well .
" its book search seems like an uphill struggle and its video search might be good on youtube because it owns them but using the same web technology for searching the video universe might not work , " he said .
in the spring , google showed how important it thought personalised search would be when it introduced igoogle , which allowed users to publish their own content on a personalised google homepage .
as for the future , gartner 's weiner thinks the real threat might not come from its traditional rivals .
" i 'm not sure what makes winners and losers in the search space but it might come from other companies offering niche searches , such as tv guide and buddytv , " he said .

microsoft 's mapping service virtual earth 3d , could play a huge part in the future of search , he thinks .

ask ask was relaunched in june 2007 with a more simplistic interface which divided the search page into three columns .
the left-hand column lets searchers refine what they are looking for to make their terms either more or less specific .
the central column contains a familiar list of results plus adverts and the tools that let people save pages or use the now well-known binoculars feature to get a sneak preview of websites .
the right-hand column gives instant access to results from other categories such as images , blogs and video .
for some its collaboration with bloglines , enabling users to search and track blogs , is one of its best features while others admire its image search facility .

google 's search engine comes with a long list of features from the now-familiar i 'm feeling lucky , to images , books , street maps , local search and a new tool to refine searches .
for allen weiner , research director at gartner , google is still the winner when it comes to general queries but in other areas , it is not doing so well .
" its book search seems like an uphill struggle and its video search might be good on youtube because it owns them but using the same web technology for searching the video universe might not work , " he said .
in the spring , google showed how important it thought personalised search would be when it introduced igoogle , which allowed users to publish their own content on a personalised google homepage .
as for the future , gartner 's weiner thinks the real threat might not come from its traditional rivals .
" i 'm not sure what makes winners and losers in the search space but it might come from other companies offering niche searches , such as tv guide and buddytv , " he said .

microsoft , yahoo and ask have been busy offering new interfaces and features in an effort to compete .
but broadly the search engines offer similar services - different ways to refine searches , link to shopping and local services and access blogs and other sources , alongside traditional web pages .
according to jupiter analyst nate elliot the underlying algorithms that powers search are also very similar among the main players .
" strip out the brands and just show the results and there is not often a lot of difference .
the biggest difference between them is the logo at the top of the page , " he said .
and it is here that google has a huge advantage : a trusted brand in many people 's minds , there is little reason to desert it for one of the other search engines .
the bbc news website takes a look at some of the features offered by the main players and where they go next .
yahoo some see yahoo as under google 's shadow without yahoo , google would n't be the company that it is today .
between june 2000 and may 2004 , google powered yahoo 's search engine and since then , many think that yahoo has been in google 's shadow .
its latest upgrade sees it introduce an interface that integrates video , audio and photos into search .
there is also a new search-assist feature based on concepts .
it allows the engine to provide a list of possible questions when users type their request .
it is seen as being pretty innovative in social search with features such as yahoo answers offering users the chance to post questions and seek answers from other users .
it owns photo-sharing site flickr , which gives it a vast image library , and should help toward becoming what vice-president of search vish makhijani described as the " best in breed in certain categories " .
its other big play is in the area of mobile search .
most recently it has done a deal with spain 's telefonica to become the main search engine on its networks in europe and latin america .
microsoft live search formerly known as msn search , microsoft 's live search has just had a significant revamp .
according to derrick connell , microsoft 's global live search general manager , this latest makeover was more for existing customers than about attracting new ones .
" we wanted to engage current users rather than convince other users to come to us .
it was about differentiating the service from what we had last year , " he said .
as part of this it has quadrupled the size of its searchable index and improved relevancy of answers with , for instance , links to reviews when looking for products .
from the white box that people type into to a fully scaled 3d model of the world , the way people get access to their answers will dramatically change , derrick connell , general manager microsoft it now offers the ability to refine questions , view additional search results on the same web page rather than clicking through to the next page and dynamically adjust the amount of information displayed for each search result .
it also allows the user to save searches and see them updated automatically on live.com microsoft is concentrating on four main areas of search ; entertainment , shopping , local mapping and health which , according to mr connell , account for 40 % of all searches .
" there will always be a basic human need for answers to questions but everything else will change , " said mr connell .
microsoft 's mapping service virtual earth 3d , could play a huge part in the future of search , he thinks .
" from the white box that people type into to a fully scaled 3d model of the world , the way people get access to their answers will dramatically change , " he said .
ask ask was relaunched in june 2007 with a more simplistic interface which divided the search page into three columns .
the left-hand column lets searchers refine what they are looking for to make their terms either more or less specific .
the central column contains a familiar list of results plus adverts and the tools that let people save pages or use the now well-known binoculars feature to get a sneak preview of websites .
the right-hand column gives instant access to results from other categories such as images , blogs and video .
for some its collaboration with bloglines , enabling users to search and track blogs , is one of its best features while others admire its image search facility .
for jupiter 's elliot , ask has always been the plucky under-dog .
" i really like ask and i think they have offered some of the most innovative features of the last year , " he said .
google google 's dominance of the search engine market comes down to two things , most experts agree .
it 's simple interface and the way it was able to provide much more accurate results than its rivals in the early days .
this was down to a new way of ranking pages , a kind of real-life metric , which took into account how many others linked to and referred to sites .
google 's search engine comes with a long list of features from the now-familiar i 'm feeling lucky , to images , books , street maps , local search and a new tool to refine searches .
for allen weiner , research director at gartner , google is still the winner when it comes to general queries but in other areas , it is not doing so well .
" its book search seems like an uphill struggle and its video search might be good on youtube because it owns them but using the same web technology for searching the video universe might not work , " he said .
in the spring , google showed how important it thought personalised search would be when it introduced igoogle , which allowed users to publish their own content on a personalised google homepage .
as for the future , gartner 's weiner thinks the real threat might not come from its traditional rivals .
" i 'm not sure what makes winners and losers in the search space but it might come from other companies offering niche searches , such as tv guide and buddytv , " he said .

and it is here that google has a huge advantage : a trusted brand in many people 's minds , there is little reason to desert it for one of the other search engines .
the bbc news website takes a look at some of the features offered by the main players and where they go next .
yahoo without yahoo , google would n't be the company that it is today .
between june 2000 and may 2004 , google powered yahoo 's search engine and since then , many think that yahoo has been in google 's shadow .
its latest upgrade sees it introduce an interface that integrates video , audio and photos into search .
there is also a new search-assist feature based on concepts .
it allows the engine to provide a list of possible questions when users type their request .
it is seen as being pretty innovative in social search with features such as yahoo answers offering users the chance to post questions and seek answers from other users .
it owns photo-sharing site flickr , which gives it a vast image library , and should help toward becoming what vice-president of search vish makhijani described as the " best in breed in certain categories " .
its other big play is in the area of mobile search .
most recently it has done a deal with spain 's telefonica to become the main search engine on its networks in europe and latin america .
microsoft live search formerly known as msn search , microsoft 's live search has just had a significant revamp .
according to derrick connell , microsoft 's global live search general manager , this latest makeover was more for existing customers than about attracting new ones .
" we wanted to engage current users rather than convince other users to come to us .
it was about differentiating the service from what we had last year , " he said .
as part of this it has quadrupled the size of its searchable index and improved relevancy of answers with , for instance , links to reviews when looking for products . "
from the white box that people type into to a fully scaled 3d model of the world , the way people get access to their answers will dramatically change , " derrick connell , general manager microsoft it now offers the ability to refine questions , view additional search results on the same web page rather than clicking through to the next page and dynamically adjust the amount of information displayed for each search result .
it also allows the user to save searches and see them updated automatically on live.com microsoft is concentrating on four main areas of search ; entertainment , shopping , local mapping and health which , according to mr connell , account for 40 % of all searches .
" there will always be a basic human need for answers to questions but everything else will change , " said mr connell .
microsoft 's mapping service virtual earth 3d , could play a huge part in the future of search , he thinks .
" from the white box that people type into to a fully scaled 3d model of the world , the way people get access to their answers will dramatically change , " he said .
ask ask was relaunched in june 2007 with a more simplistic interface which divided the search page into three columns .
the left-hand column lets searchers refine what they are looking for to make their terms either more or less specific .
the central column contains a familiar list of results plus adverts and the tools that let people save pages or use the now well-known binoculars feature to get a sneak preview of websites .
the right-hand column gives instant access to results from other categories such as images , blogs and video .
for some its collaboration with bloglines , enabling users to search and track blogs , is one of its best features while others admire its image search facility .
for jupiter 's elliot , ask has always been the plucky under-dog .
" i really like ask and i think they have offered some of the most innovative features of the last year , " he said .
google google 's dominance of the search engine market comes down to two things , most experts agree .
it 's simple interface and the way it was able to provide much more accurate results than its rivals in the early days .
this was down to a new way of ranking pages , a kind of real-life metric , which took into account how many others linked to and referred to sites .
google 's search engine comes with a long list of features from the now-familiar i 'm feeling lucky , to images , books , street maps , local search and a new tool to refine searches .
for allen weiner , research director at gartner , google is still the winner when it comes to general queries but in other areas , it is not doing so well .
" its book search seems like an uphill struggle and its video search might be good on youtube because it owns them but using the same web technology for searching the video universe might not work , " he said .
in the spring , google showed how important it thought personalised search would be when it introduced igoogle , which allowed users to publish their own content on a personalised google homepage .
as for the future , gartner 's weiner thinks the real threat might not come from its traditional rivals .
" i 'm not sure what makes winners and losers in the search space but it might come from other companies offering niche searches , such as tv guide and buddytv , " he said .

john major elected leader : november 1990 age when elected : 47 defeated rivals : michael heseltine , douglas hurd yet the words most often used by commentators summing-up his performance , were " modest , " " unassuming " and , inevitably , " grey " .
" we have all become accustomed to john major 's un-thatcherish understatement , the wily pragmatism and body language of the friendly bank manager next door , " wrote michael white in the guardian .
" the worst you can say about him , " added mr white , " is that he is decent and a little grey " .
the conservatives badly needed a period of calm after the brutal political assassination of margaret thatcher and that is what mr major - whom tory mps chose over michael heseltine and douglas hurd - appeared to provide .
he was a working-class boy from a poor south london background , who entered downing street promising to create a " classless " society .
poll boost in a break with the thatcher era , he pledged a more collegiate style of leadership ; a return , some pundits said , to genuine cabinet government .
he even indulged in cross-party cooperation during the gulf war - something that would have been hard to imagine under his predecessor .
mr major emerges from his hundred days the best-loved prime minister in living memory peter jenkins , the independent he was widely praised for his steady , statesmanlike handling of the gulf conflict and the aftermath of the ira 's failed mortar attack on downing street .
as a result , the conservatives edged ahead in the opinion polls wiping out labour 's previous nine-point lead , with mr major 's personal ratings looking particularly rosy .
" the inside story of major 's first 100 days at 10 downing street points to a new leader who is much more than an affable happy-eater , benevolently bidding us all ' god bless ' .
" it points to the emergence of a formidable political operator , one , some say , who has the sharpest antennae of any prime minister since harold wilson , " wrote michael jones , in the sunday times .
' metal ' but pundits were also impatient to see how the new prime minister would perform when up against real political adversity .
" mr major emerges from his hundred days the best-loved prime minister in living memory , his opinion poll ratings a consistent glow of approval , " wrote peter jenkins in the independent .
" busy he has been , no doubt , since he stepped blinking across the threshold of no 10 , helping to win a war in his spare moments , but it has hardly been a hundred days of prodigious activism in the roosevelt or kennedy manner .
" now , with peace broken out , we may see what metal he is made of , as enoch powell said of the iron lady as she went to war . "
the test - most commentators agreed - would come when he was forced to decide the future of the community charge , or poll tax - the policy that had brought ruin to his predecessor .
" the prime minister may show excellent peacetime leadership qualities , to match his gulf war performance .
we will see .
first let him go into the arena with the poll tax , " wrote joe rogaly , in the financial times .
by-election defeat on his 100th day , voters appeared to give their verdict on the poll tax , with a thumping by-election defeat for the government .
a conservative majority of nearly 20,000 votes in ribble valley was turned into a liberal democrat majority of 4,601 , with most deserters blaming their decision on the hated tax .
there was also the looming spectre of internal party divisions over europe and an economy still struggling with the fallout from the late 1980s recession .
for some commentators , mr major had mainly benefited in the opinion polls from not being margaret thatcher .
it remained to be seen how he would fare when he faced the electorate at a general election .
" the bipartisan front of the gulf war may have clouded the issue , but the truth is that the new prime minister has been running not so much against neil kinnock , or even paddy ashdown , as against the public 's perception of what mrs thatcher would have been doing had she still been in office .
that sort of support tends to be transient and shallow , " said the independent .
what happened next : john major went on to win the general election of 1992 but was beaten by tony blair 's labour in 1997 .
he resigned as party leader and then stood down as an mp in 2001 .

john major elected leader : november 1990 age when elected : 47 defeated rivals : michael heseltine , douglas hurd yet the words most often used by commentators summing-up his performance , were " modest , " " unassuming " and , inevitably , " grey " .
" we have all become accustomed to john major 's un-thatcherish understatement , the wily pragmatism and body language of the friendly bank manager next door , " wrote michael white in the guardian .
" the worst you can say about him , " added mr white , " is that he is decent and a little grey " .
the conservatives badly needed a period of calm after the brutal political assassination of margaret thatcher and that is what mr major - whom tory mps chose over michael heseltine and douglas hurd - appeared to provide .
he was a working-class boy from a poor south london background , who entered downing street promising to create a " classless " society .
poll boost in a break with the thatcher era , he pledged a more collegiate style of leadership ; a return , some pundits said , to genuine cabinet government .
he even indulged in cross-party cooperation during the gulf war - something that would have been hard to imagine under his predecessor .
mr major emerges from his hundred days the best-loved prime minister in living memory peter jenkins , the independent he was widely praised for his steady , statesmanlike handling of the gulf conflict and the aftermath of the ira 's failed mortar attack on downing street .
as a result , the conservatives edged ahead in the opinion polls wiping out labour 's previous nine-point lead , with mr major 's personal ratings looking particularly rosy .
" the inside story of major 's first 100 days at 10 downing street points to a new leader who is much more than an affable happy-eater , benevolently bidding us all ' god bless ' .
" it points to the emergence of a formidable political operator , one , some say , who has the sharpest antennae of any prime minister since harold wilson , " wrote michael jones , in the sunday times .
' metal ' but pundits were also impatient to see how the new prime minister would perform when up against real political adversity .
" mr major emerges from his hundred days the best-loved prime minister in living memory , his opinion poll ratings a consistent glow of approval , " wrote peter jenkins in the independent .
" busy he has been , no doubt , since he stepped blinking across the threshold of no 10 , helping to win a war in his spare moments , but it has hardly been a hundred days of prodigious activism in the roosevelt or kennedy manner .
" now , with peace broken out , we may see what metal he is made of , as enoch powell said of the iron lady as she went to war . "
the test - most commentators agreed - would come when he was forced to decide the future of the community charge , or poll tax - the policy that had brought ruin to his predecessor .
" the prime minister may show excellent peacetime leadership qualities , to match his gulf war performance .
we will see .
first let him go into the arena with the poll tax , " wrote joe rogaly , in the financial times .
by-election defeat on his 100th day , voters appeared to give their verdict on the poll tax , with a thumping by-election defeat for the government .
a conservative majority of nearly 20,000 votes in ribble valley was turned into a liberal democrat majority of 4,601 , with most deserters blaming their decision on the hated tax .
there was also the looming spectre of internal party divisions over europe and an economy still struggling with the fallout from the late 1980s recession .
for some commentators , mr major had mainly benefited in the opinion polls from not being margaret thatcher .
it remained to be seen how he would fare when he faced the electorate at a general election .
" the bipartisan front of the gulf war may have clouded the issue , but the truth is that the new prime minister has been running not so much against neil kinnock , or even paddy ashdown , as against the public 's perception of what mrs thatcher would have been doing had she still been in office .
that sort of support tends to be transient and shallow , " said the independent .
what happened next : john major went on to win the general election of 1992 but was beaten by tony blair 's labour in 1997 .
he resigned as party leader and then stood down as an mp in 2001 .
