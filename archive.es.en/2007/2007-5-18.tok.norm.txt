the bayern munich board of directors headed by franz beckenbauer has given their go ahead to plans to invest heavily in new players as the side finishes its most disappointing season in years . beckenbauer and the board of directors said this week that the club could go ahead with their secret plans to buy leading players to put together a side that can compete internationally .

the 20-million-euro signing of world champion luca toni from florence also seems a done deal .
german internationals marcell jansen and miroslav klose are also on the wanted list , as is the transfer of ze roberto , who is rumored to be on the verge of returning to germany from brazil .

the bayern munich board of directors headed by franz beckenbauer has given their go ahead to plans to invest heavily in new players as the side finishes its most disappointing season in years . beckenbauer and the board of directors said this week that the club could go ahead with their secret plans to buy leading players to put together a side that can compete internationally .
" the club 's board put forward their ideas and named their players , and we were all of the opinion that this would be the right way to go forward to ensure that bayern once again become successful , " beckenbauer said .
" everybody knows that good players who are well-known internationally are not cheap , " german soccer 's kaiser added .
" we will have to invest a lot of money to have a strong team next year , to be able to compete at the highest level . "
bayern , for the first time in years , are not in the running for the bundesliga title and have been forced to settle with a uefa cup berth instead of a spot in the more prestigious champion league .
expensive undertaking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's fans are used to seeing them raise at least some kind of trophy every season although beckenbauer said nothing about the value of the investment , german media speculated that it could be between 76 million euros and 100 million euros -lrb- $ 103 million and $ 136 million -rrb- .
" it is clear that it will be expensive , but we are a football business and it must be our first priority to have a strong team , " said beckenbauer , who won the world cup both as a player and coach .
new names were not leaked to the press , but bayern have already announced that they will be buying hamit altintop -lrb- schalke 04 -rrb- , jan schlaudraff -lrb- alemannia aachen -rrb- and argentine jose ernesto sosa -lrb- estudiantes de la plata -rrb- .
the 20-million-euro signing of world champion luca toni from florence also seems a done deal .
german internationals marcell jansen and miroslav klose are also on the wanted list , as is the transfer of ze roberto , who is rumored to be on the verge of returning to germany from brazil .
bayern manager uli hoeness said a short while ago , that bayern has always managed to secure the players they wanted .
he said that the club would be investing money " like never before . "
international comings and goings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern tried to keep hargreaves from leaving but could n't convince him while beckenbauer can already contemplate next season with top players , fans will have to wait a bit longer till the seasons end in spain , italy , england and elsewhere before the club announces the signings .
by then the names of the players who will be leaving the club should also be known .
bayern are on the verge of selling english international owen hargreaves to manchester united .
kicker sports magazine reported monday that the two clubs had reached an agreement whereby the premiership champions will be paying 25 million euro plus a further amount determined by united 's results , for the midfielder , whose contract with bayern runs till 2010 .
paraguayan international roque santa cruz has also announced that he intends to leave the club .
another player who will not be with the team next season is mehmet scholl .
the 36-year old will be playing his final match for the team in saturday 's season-closer against mainz 05 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german soccer authorities to investigate klose 's bayern meeting german soccer authorities will investigate a " secret " meeting between bayern munich and werder bremen 's striker miroslav klose to see if any of the strict rules concerning approaches to contracted players were breached .

the drug caused thousands of children to be born with severe disabilities . grünenthal pharmaceuticals had tried to get the tv movie banned , saying it was not a fair or truthful depiction of the tragic story .
but judges in hamburg ruled this week that it is clearly fiction rather than a documentary .
this means it is officially a work of art protected from censorship by the german constitution .
devastating side effects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the drug was given to pregnant women to treat morning sickness the film called “ contergan – just one tablet ” is now set to be aired on german public television in august .
contergan was the german name for the drug that was given to pregnant women to treat morning sickness in the 1950s and the early 1960s . the drug triggered the biggest pharmaceutical scandal in postwar germany after it later became clear that it caused severe damage to the limbs and internal organs of unborn foetuses .
dr. annette fusenig from grünenthal had criticized the film for failing to properly distinguish between fact and fiction .
" it ’ s a fictional film , and it does not give the truth , but on the other hand the film claims that is an historically based film , " she said .
" confusing " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hamburg court ruled it was clearly a work of fiction fusenig said she thought viewers would be confused and unable to judge what is based on fact and what is fiction .
the production company zeitsprung , however , always opposed these claims .
its managing director michael souviginier says that grünenthal has too low an opinion of the audience .
" the audience can differentiate between a feature film and a documentary , " said souvignier .
" and our film simply isn ’ t a documentary ; even a child could see that , " he added .
the court has asked the film company to make two small alterations before the work goes on air .
one scene will be deleted and also “ contergan : just one tablet ” will have to run with a disclaimer before and after , reiterating that it is a work of fiction .
victory for filmmakers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the manufacturers were involved in a lengthy trial over the drug souviginier welcomed the court 's decision .
" basically it is art that has won here , and the tradition of such films in gemany and around the world ; a tradition which has come out of this case unscathed , " he said .
for its part , grünenthal says it 's not campaigning to stop a film about thalidomide , or to avoid bad press .

the drug caused thousands of children to be born with severe disabilities . grünenthal pharmaceuticals had tried to get the tv movie banned , saying it was not a fair or truthful depiction of the tragic story .
but judges in hamburg ruled this week that it is clearly fiction rather than a documentary .
this means it is officially a work of art protected from censorship by the german constitution .
devastating side effects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the drug was given to pregnant women to treat morning sickness the film called “ contergan – just one tablet ” is now set to be aired on german public television in august .
contergan was the german name for the drug that was given to pregnant women to treat morning sickness in the 1950s and the early 1960s . the drug triggered the biggest pharmaceutical scandal in postwar germany after it later became clear that it caused severe damage to the limbs and internal organs of unborn foetuses .
dr. annette fusenig from grünenthal had criticized the film for failing to properly distinguish between fact and fiction .
" it ’ s a fictional film , and it does not give the truth , but on the other hand the film claims that is an historically based film , " she said .
" confusing " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hamburg court ruled it was clearly a work of fiction fusenig said she thought viewers would be confused and unable to judge what is based on fact and what is fiction .
the production company zeitsprung , however , always opposed these claims .
its managing director michael souviginier says that grünenthal has too low an opinion of the audience .
" the audience can differentiate between a feature film and a documentary , " said souvignier .
" and our film simply isn ’ t a documentary ; even a child could see that , " he added .
the court has asked the film company to make two small alterations before the work goes on air .
one scene will be deleted and also “ contergan : just one tablet ” will have to run with a disclaimer before and after , reiterating that it is a work of fiction .
victory for filmmakers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the manufacturers were involved in a lengthy trial over the drug souviginier welcomed the court 's decision .
" basically it is art that has won here , and the tradition of such films in gemany and around the world ; a tradition which has come out of this case unscathed , " he said .
for its part , grünenthal says it 's not campaigning to stop a film about thalidomide , or to avoid bad press .
but the company feels issues like compensation and general treatment of the victims are not fairly depicted in the film .
the firm could still try to appeal the verdict in germany ’ s highest court , and says it is considering its options . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new eu rules to make medication safer for kids new eu rules require europe-based pharmaceutical companies to show that the drugs they bring to market are suitable for kids .

" i hope that they will be able to express their opinion , " merkel told a joint news conference at the end of the two-day summit at which eu leaders discussed the state of democracy and human rights .
" i 'm somewhat concerned that people had difficulties getting here , but perhaps a possible demonstration can still take place , " merkel said . " if demonstrators throw stones , if they smash windows , then of course they should be curbed .
but if someone has done nothing , if they just want to go to a demonstration , then it 's different , " merkel said . russian president putin testily defended " preventive measures " taken by russian police ahead of the rally , comparing these to common practice in european countries . expressing assurances that the opposition 's right to protest would be respected , putin countered that german authorities have not ruled out using preventative detention in the run-up to next month 's group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in the german resort of heiligendamm .

" not one member of the other russia delegation was allowed to board , " denis bilunov , a spokeman for kasparov , told afp .

a presidential spokesman denied the kremlin was involved in the incident and said he did not expect the incident to be discussed at the summit .

putin and eu leaders discussed setting up an alert mechanism for increasingly vital russian energy supplies to europe following a request from merkel after recent gas and oil cut-offs from russia .
putin told barroso and merkel over dinner on thursday that supply agreements he signed this month with the central asian states of kazakhstan and turkmenistan would benefit europe .
talks touched on russia 's bid to join the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- , which is being dogged by trade tariff disputes with brussels , and the future status of the serbian province of kosovo .
" russia ca n't tango on its own " but the overall impression was one of deep discord between the two sides .

we have not always managed to convince each other but i think it 's always better to speak to each other than to speak about each other , " merkel said .
negotiations over a partnership agreement between the eu and russia , including in the sensitive energy sphere , are being blocked by eu member poland because of a trade dispute with moscow . the current agreement runs out this year and can be extended , but eu officials said that failure to start negotiations would be an embarrassment for both sides .

putin responded that the eu should first solve its " internal problems , " and kremlin officials said that russia had already made sufficient concessions to poland and was waiting for a response .
" russia ca n't tango on its own , " said dmitry peskov , a kremlin spokesman .
the eu 's external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner ascribed some of the frostiness in relations to upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections in russia .

" i hope that they will be able to express their opinion , " merkel told a joint news conference at the end of the two-day summit at which eu leaders discussed the state of democracy and human rights .
" i 'm somewhat concerned that people had difficulties getting here , but perhaps a possible demonstration can still take place , " merkel said . " if demonstrators throw stones , if they smash windows , then of course they should be curbed .

a presidential spokesman denied the kremlin was involved in the incident and said he did not expect the incident to be discussed at the summit .
" i do n't think the issue of the non-arrival of a russian citizen , even a famous one will be on the summit agenda , " said dmitry pescov .

putin and eu leaders discussed setting up an alert mechanism for increasingly vital russian energy supplies to europe following a request from merkel after recent gas and oil cut-offs from russia .
putin told barroso and merkel over dinner on thursday that supply agreements he signed this month with the central asian states of kazakhstan and turkmenistan would benefit europe .
talks touched on russia 's bid to join the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- , which is being dogged by trade tariff disputes with brussels , and the future status of the serbian province of kosovo .
" russia ca n't tango on its own " but the overall impression was one of deep discord between the two sides .
" we found many problems during the summit .
we have not always managed to convince each other but i think it 's always better to speak to each other than to speak about each other , " merkel said .
negotiations over a partnership agreement between the eu and russia , including in the sensitive energy sphere , are being blocked by eu member poland because of a trade dispute with moscow . the current agreement runs out this year and can be extended , but eu officials said that failure to start negotiations would be an embarrassment for both sides .

putin responded that the eu should first solve its " internal problems , " and kremlin officials said that russia had already made sufficient concessions to poland and was waiting for a response .
" russia ca n't tango on its own , " said dmitry peskov , a kremlin spokesman .
the eu 's external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner ascribed some of the frostiness in relations to upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections in russia .

" we 're at sheremetyevo airport and uniformed men have taken our passports .
they 've taken 13 passports .
i consider this a criminal offence , " said lev ponomaryov of the for human rights organization .
" they told us at the check-in that our tickets had been rejected by the computer as they had been sold -lrb- to other passengers -rrb- .
but some journalists who were allowed to board told us the plane was half empty . "
a presidential spokesman denied the kremlin was involved in the incident and said he did not expect the incident to be discussed at the summit .
" i do n't think the issue of the non-arrival of a russian citizen , even a famous one will be on the summit agenda , " said dmitry pescov .
" i can not comment on behalf of the police .
the kremlin was not in sheremetyevo . "
some " constructive " discussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow 's ban on polish meat imports is one point of dispute meanwhile , russian and european leaders vowed to hold frank discussions about all areas of dispute .
president putin said : " we are ready for an open and honest dialogue without any taboo subjects . "
chancellor merkel said she hoped for firm solutions to the problems between the eu and russia .
" i hope that we can take concrete steps where there are snags and hitches . "
still , participants said " constructive " discussions had taken place at the summit in volzhsky utyos -lrb- volga cliff -rrb- , a picturesque resort complex some 1,000 kilometres -lrb- 620 miles -rrb- south of moscow .
putin and eu leaders discussed setting up an alert mechanism for increasingly vital russian energy supplies to europe following a request from merkel after recent gas and oil cut-offs from russia .
putin told barroso and merkel over dinner on thursday that supply agreements he signed this month with the central asian states of kazakhstan and turkmenistan would benefit europe .
talks touched on russia 's bid to join the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- , which is being dogged by trade tariff disputes with brussels , and the future status of the serbian province of kosovo .
" russia ca n't tango on its own " but the overall impression was one of deep discord between the two sides .
" we found many problems during the summit .
we have not always managed to convince each other but i think it 's always better to speak to each other than to speak about each other , " merkel said .
negotiations over a partnership agreement between the eu and russia , including in the sensitive energy sphere , are being blocked by eu member poland because of a trade dispute with moscow . the current agreement runs out this year and can be extended , but eu officials said that failure to start negotiations would be an embarrassment for both sides .

putin responded that the eu should first solve its " internal problems , " and kremlin officials said that russia had already made sufficient concessions to poland and was waiting for a response .
" russia ca n't tango on its own , " said dmitry peskov , a kremlin spokesman .
the eu 's external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner ascribed some of the frostiness in relations to upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections in russia .

" i hope that they will be able to express their opinion , " merkel told a joint news conference at the end of the two-day summit at which eu leaders discussed the state of democracy and human rights .
" i 'm somewhat concerned that people had difficulties getting here , but perhaps a possible demonstration can still take place , " merkel said . " if demonstrators throw stones , if they smash windows , then of course they should be curbed .
but if someone has done nothing , if they just want to go to a demonstration , then it 's different , " merkel said . russian president putin testily defended " preventive measures " taken by russian police ahead of the rally , comparing these to common practice in european countries . expressing assurances that the opposition 's right to protest would be respected , putin countered that german authorities have not ruled out using preventative detention in the run-up to next month 's group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in the german resort of heiligendamm .

the bayern munich board of directors headed by franz beckenbauer has given their go ahead to plans to invest heavily in new players as the side finishes its most disappointing season in years . beckenbauer and the board of directors said this week that the club could go ahead with their secret plans to buy leading players to put together a side that can compete internationally .

the bayern munich board of directors headed by franz beckenbauer has given their go ahead to plans to invest heavily in new players as the side finishes its most disappointing season in years . beckenbauer and the board of directors said this week that the club could go ahead with their secret plans to buy leading players to put together a side that can compete internationally .
" the club 's board put forward their ideas and named their players , and we were all of the opinion that this would be the right way to go forward to ensure that bayern once again become successful , " beckenbauer said .
" everybody knows that good players who are well-known internationally are not cheap , " german soccer 's kaiser added .

the bayern munich board of directors headed by franz beckenbauer has given their go ahead to plans to invest heavily in new players as the side finishes its most disappointing season in years . beckenbauer and the board of directors said this week that the club could go ahead with their secret plans to buy leading players to put together a side that can compete internationally .
" the club 's board put forward their ideas and named their players , and we were all of the opinion that this would be the right way to go forward to ensure that bayern once again become successful , " beckenbauer said .
" everybody knows that good players who are well-known internationally are not cheap , " german soccer 's kaiser added .
" we will have to invest a lot of money to have a strong team next year , to be able to compete at the highest level . "
bayern , for the first time in years , are not in the running for the bundesliga title and have been forced to settle with a uefa cup berth instead of a spot in the more prestigious champion league .
expensive undertaking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's fans are used to seeing them raise at least some kind of trophy every season although beckenbauer said nothing about the value of the investment , german media speculated that it could be between 76 million euros and 100 million euros -lrb- $ 103 million and $ 136 million -rrb- .
" it is clear that it will be expensive , but we are a football business and it must be our first priority to have a strong team , " said beckenbauer , who won the world cup both as a player and coach .
new names were not leaked to the press , but bayern have already announced that they will be buying hamit altintop -lrb- schalke 04 -rrb- , jan schlaudraff -lrb- alemannia aachen -rrb- and argentine jose ernesto sosa -lrb- estudiantes de la plata -rrb- .

it 's the first time , as far as is known , that there has been such an assault on a state . many government and corporate sites in the hi-tech baltic nation have been crippled for almost three weeks after being flooded with enormous amounts of traffic .
prime minister andrus ansip had claimed that some of the cyber-attacks , which forced the authorities in the tiny baltic state to temporarily shut down web sites , came from russian government computers , including the president 's office .
but tallinn has now backed away from such explicit accusations .
estonia 's defence minister jaak aaviksoo said there was a possibility of russian involvement in the attacks that involved at least one million computers .
the kremlin has dismissed the accusations , saying hackers could have used a false ip address to tarnish the russian authorities .
coincidence ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the relocation of a soviet war memorial has further soured relations between moscow and tallinn the start of the cyber-attacks coincide with the start of a row with the kremlin over the removal from central talinn of a post-world war ii memorial to soviet red army soldiers .
the nato spokesman remained vague on the question of russian involvement .
" it 's not that easy because of the nature of cyber space , " he said .
he added that " various indications " had been identified .
but he said that tracking and identifying the cyber attackers was not the primary goal of the investigations .
" our aim ultimately is protection . "
he told afp , " we do see it as serious because it was concerted .
it 's clearly not the sort of thing that two teenagers , for whatever their motives , do .
we are talking about a pretty well-organised thing . "
" this is a special case because of the scale of this attack .
so of course allies are going to help and we are not just treating this as an estonian problem , of course it is a problem for nato , " the spokesman added .
growing threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spread of technology is set to increase the threat of cyber attack at present , nato does not define cyber attacks as clear military action .
this means the provisions of collective self-defence would not apply to the attacked country .
us deputy secretary of state john negroponte told a number of leading european newspapers on friday that cyber attacks were likely to become more of an issue in the future .
a common method of achieving such attacks is by hijacking computers belonging to normal web surfers using a virus or other malware picked up from an infected e-mail attachment or by visiting a website that hosts such malware .
estonia , which has a large russia minority , is a pioneer in the development of e-government and a very wired society .
this also makes it very vulnerable to cyber attacks . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : germany intervened in russia-estonia dispute germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier practiced some behind-the-scenes realpolitik this week to sooth russian-estonian tensions over the removal of a momument in tallinn , according to a german news report .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : development aid to africa tops g8 agenda " the lack of a global response to aids is a catastrophe " europe rushes to stem flood of cocaine coming through africa rock stars urge g8 industrialized nations to deliver on africa aid g8 development ministers seek ways to meet african aid goals development aid -pipe- 18.05.2007 experts question g8 's emphasis on africa großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : development aid to date has n't alleviated african nations ' problems germany has put aid for africa at the top of the agenda for the upcoming g8 summit .
it is n't the first time the continent is a g8 focus .
but have previous commitments brought about any change ? africa was last the focus of a g8 summit two years ago in gleneagles .
at the time , the world 's leading industrialized nations resolved to double development aid by 2010 and to free the poorest countries of their debts . denis tull , an africa expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , said he considered the debt relief a positive move .
but added thatsuch measures should not be overrated . " you should look at it matter-of-factly , " tull said .
" the debts were cancelled - well knowing that they never would have been paid back anyway . " tull said it was ultimately in the hands of african governments to decide whether the funds freed by the debt relief would now be put to good use . broken promises ? the international community has committed itself to fighting worldwide poverty in the united nations millennium development goals .
the g8 nations in particular have repeatedly affirmed their commitment and want to set a good example .
yet worldwide development aid has decreased in the past years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gentlemen at the g8 summit in gleneagles committed to do more for africa " the g8 countries are not true to their word , " said africa and development aid expert cord jakobeit from the university of hamburg .
" the commitment by the g8 to significantly increase their contribution to development aid looks gloomy . " the latest figures by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- confirm jakobeit 's opinion .
together , the 30 oecd member states spent 5 percent less on development aid in 2006 than in the previous year .
the thriftiest were italy with a 30 percent cut and the united states with a reduction of 20 percent .
both countries are members of the g8 . in absolute terms , g8 nations spend the most money on development aid .
but viewed in terms of countries ' economic output , a g8 member first appears seventh on the list .

it is n't the first time the continent is a g8 focus .
but have previous commitments brought about any change ? africa was last the focus of a g8 summit two years ago in gleneagles .
at the time , the world 's leading industrialized nations resolved to double development aid by 2010 and to free the poorest countries of their debts . denis tull , an africa expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , said he considered the debt relief a positive move .
but added thatsuch measures should not be overrated . " you should look at it matter-of-factly , " tull said .
" the debts were cancelled - well knowing that they never would have been paid back anyway . " tull said it was ultimately in the hands of african governments to decide whether the funds freed by the debt relief would now be put to good use . broken promises ? the international community has committed itself to fighting worldwide poverty in the united nations millennium development goals .
the g8 nations in particular have repeatedly affirmed their commitment and want to set a good example .
yet worldwide development aid has decreased in the past years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gentlemen at the g8 summit in gleneagles committed to do more for africa " the g8 countries are not true to their word , " said africa and development aid expert cord jakobeit from the university of hamburg .
" the commitment by the g8 to significantly increase their contribution to development aid looks gloomy . " the latest figures by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- confirm jakobeit 's opinion .
together , the 30 oecd member states spent 5 percent less on development aid in 2006 than in the previous year .
the thriftiest were italy with a 30 percent cut and the united states with a reduction of 20 percent .
both countries are members of the g8 . in absolute terms , g8 nations spend the most money on development aid .
but viewed in terms of countries ' economic output , a g8 member first appears seventh on the list .
half of the most frugal aid donors belong to the group of eight , according to the oecd . is outside aid the right measure ? but both donor countries , as well as african nations themselves are questioning the concept of development aid .
the kenyan economist james shikwati said he rejected conventional development policies .
instead , he emphasized progress by africa 's own means . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african nations should be building their own futures , some experts say " without foreign aid , governments would have to see to an economic development which develops in the country itself , " shikwati told the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . according to tull , development aid is n't a panacea for poor nations . " it can only have a limited impact , as does every measure which comes from outside , " tull said , adding that it would be presumptuous to believe one could steer certain economic or political processes in such a way that the result would meet western expectations . the situation in post-colonial africa has not improved there are good reasons for the world to deal with africa 's problems , according to development experts .

now the world bank has to repair its reputation as quickly as possible , said steinbrück , adding that the institution is " extremely important for the countries of the third world . "
following a conflict-of-interest scandal that became public six weeks ago , paul wolfowitz said late thursday evening from washington that his resignation was in the best interest of the world bank .
the announcement came ahead of a meeting of the finance ministers from the group of eight countries on friday in potsdam , just outside of berlin .
wolfowitz said he would not be attending the conference , where he was scheduled to give a speech on corruption .

riza later transferred to a position at the us state department , but continued receiving paychecks from the world bank .

the bayern munich board of directors headed by franz beckenbauer has given their go ahead to plans to invest heavily in new players as the side finishes its most disappointing season in years . beckenbauer and the board of directors said this week that the club could go ahead with their secret plans to buy leading players to put together a side that can compete internationally .
" the club 's board put forward their ideas and named their players , and we were all of the opinion that this would be the right way to go forward to ensure that bayern once again become successful , " beckenbauer said .
" everybody knows that good players who are well-known internationally are not cheap , " german soccer 's kaiser added .
" we will have to invest a lot of money to have a strong team next year , to be able to compete at the highest level . "
bayern , for the first time in years , are not in the running for the bundesliga title and have been forced to settle with a uefa cup berth instead of a spot in the more prestigious champion league .
expensive undertaking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's fans are used to seeing them raise at least some kind of trophy every season although beckenbauer said nothing about the value of the investment , german media speculated that it could be between 76 million euros and 100 million euros -lrb- $ 103 million and $ 136 million -rrb- .
" it is clear that it will be expensive , but we are a football business and it must be our first priority to have a strong team , " said beckenbauer , who won the world cup both as a player and coach .
new names were not leaked to the press , but bayern have already announced that they will be buying hamit altintop -lrb- schalke 04 -rrb- , jan schlaudraff -lrb- alemannia aachen -rrb- and argentine jose ernesto sosa -lrb- estudiantes de la plata -rrb- .
the 20-million-euro signing of world champion luca toni from florence also seems a done deal .
german internationals marcell jansen and miroslav klose are also on the wanted list , as is the transfer of ze roberto , who is rumored to be on the verge of returning to germany from brazil .
bayern manager uli hoeness said a short while ago , that bayern has always managed to secure the players they wanted .
he said that the club would be investing money " like never before . "
international comings and goings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern tried to keep hargreaves from leaving but could n't convince him while beckenbauer can already contemplate next season with top players , fans will have to wait a bit longer till the seasons end in spain , italy , england and elsewhere before the club announces the signings .
by then the names of the players who will be leaving the club should also be known .
bayern are on the verge of selling english international owen hargreaves to manchester united .
kicker sports magazine reported monday that the two clubs had reached an agreement whereby the premiership champions will be paying 25 million euro plus a further amount determined by united 's results , for the midfielder , whose contract with bayern runs till 2010 .
paraguayan international roque santa cruz has also announced that he intends to leave the club .
another player who will not be with the team next season is mehmet scholl .
the 36-year old will be playing his final match for the team in saturday 's season-closer against mainz 05 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german soccer authorities to investigate klose 's bayern meeting german soccer authorities will investigate a " secret " meeting between bayern munich and werder bremen 's striker miroslav klose to see if any of the strict rules concerning approaches to contracted players were breached .

the bayern munich board of directors headed by franz beckenbauer has given their go ahead to plans to invest heavily in new players as the side finishes its most disappointing season in years . beckenbauer and the board of directors said this week that the club could go ahead with their secret plans to buy leading players to put together a side that can compete internationally .
" the club 's board put forward their ideas and named their players , and we were all of the opinion that this would be the right way to go forward to ensure that bayern once again become successful , " beckenbauer said .
" everybody knows that good players who are well-known internationally are not cheap , " german soccer 's kaiser added .
" we will have to invest a lot of money to have a strong team next year , to be able to compete at the highest level . "
bayern , for the first time in years , are not in the running for the bundesliga title and have been forced to settle with a uefa cup berth instead of a spot in the more prestigious champion league .
expensive undertaking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's fans are used to seeing them raise at least some kind of trophy every season although beckenbauer said nothing about the value of the investment , german media speculated that it could be between 76 million euros and 100 million euros -lrb- $ 103 million and $ 136 million -rrb- .
" it is clear that it will be expensive , but we are a football business and it must be our first priority to have a strong team , " said beckenbauer , who won the world cup both as a player and coach .
new names were not leaked to the press , but bayern have already announced that they will be buying hamit altintop -lrb- schalke 04 -rrb- , jan schlaudraff -lrb- alemannia aachen -rrb- and argentine jose ernesto sosa -lrb- estudiantes de la plata -rrb- .
the 20-million-euro signing of world champion luca toni from florence also seems a done deal .
german internationals marcell jansen and miroslav klose are also on the wanted list , as is the transfer of ze roberto , who is rumored to be on the verge of returning to germany from brazil .
bayern manager uli hoeness said a short while ago , that bayern has always managed to secure the players they wanted .
he said that the club would be investing money " like never before . "

by then the names of the players who will be leaving the club should also be known .
bayern are on the verge of selling english international owen hargreaves to manchester united .
kicker sports magazine reported monday that the two clubs had reached an agreement whereby the premiership champions will be paying 25 million euro plus a further amount determined by united 's results , for the midfielder , whose contract with bayern runs till 2010 .
paraguayan international roque santa cruz has also announced that he intends to leave the club .

now the world bank has to repair its reputation as quickly as possible , said steinbrück , adding that the institution is " extremely important for the countries of the third world . "
following a conflict-of-interest scandal that became public six weeks ago , paul wolfowitz said late thursday evening from washington that his resignation was in the best interest of the world bank .
the announcement came ahead of a meeting of the finance ministers from the group of eight countries on friday in potsdam , just outside of berlin .
wolfowitz said he would not be attending the conference , where he was scheduled to give a speech on corruption .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now the world bank has a reputation to save , said steinbrück eckhard deutscher , germany 's representative on the 24-member board of the world bank , said on thursday wolfowitz 's failings ran deeper than the immediate cause of his resignation .
poor management style and lack of vision for the bank 's mission were among wolfowitz 's weaknesses , he told reporters in washington .
" i regret that paul wolfowitz personally suffered damage , but i regret the damage he cause the bank much more , " said deutscher .
us , europe divided shortly after taking on the world bank presidency in 2005 , wolfowitz arranged for a promotion and a $ 60,000 -lrb- 44,000 euro -rrb- pay raise for his girlfriend shaha riza , who was also working at the bank at that time .
riza later transferred to a position at the us state department , but continued receiving paychecks from the world bank .
the scandal had caused a transatlantic rift : germany , france and the netherlands have been particularly vocal in demanding wolfowitz 's resignation , while the us staunchly defended him .
the white house said president george w. bush would name a successor as soon as possible .
by tradition , the us appoints the head of the world bank , while europe selects a leader for its partner institution , the international monetary fund .
focusing on developing countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing countries are top of the agenda the debt crisis in developing countries will top the agenda at the two-day g8 finance ministers ' meeting in potsdam .
delegates from cameroon , ghana , nigeria and south africa have been invited to the talks .
steinbrück said that germany 's lawmakers will prioritize developmental aid as much as possible when forming the national budget for 2008 .
the finance conference , which serves as a precursor to the g8 meeting in early june , will also focus on achieving more transparency for companies with hedge funds , a german initiative that faces resistance in the us and britain . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany says wolfowitz not welcome at berlin meeting german development minister wieczorek-zeul wednesday stepped up pressure on disgraced world bank president paul wolfowitz to resign , saying he would not be welcome at a forum the bank is holding next week in berlin .

now the world bank has to repair its reputation as quickly as possible , said steinbrück , adding that the institution is " extremely important for the countries of the third world . "
following a conflict-of-interest scandal that became public six weeks ago , paul wolfowitz said late thursday evening from washington that his resignation was in the best interest of the world bank .
the announcement came ahead of a meeting of the finance ministers from the group of eight countries on friday in potsdam , just outside of berlin .
wolfowitz said he would not be attending the conference , where he was scheduled to give a speech on corruption .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now the world bank has a reputation to save , said steinbrück eckhard deutscher , germany 's representative on the 24-member board of the world bank , said on thursday wolfowitz 's failings ran deeper than the immediate cause of his resignation .
poor management style and lack of vision for the bank 's mission were among wolfowitz 's weaknesses , he told reporters in washington .
" i regret that paul wolfowitz personally suffered damage , but i regret the damage he cause the bank much more , " said deutscher .
us , europe divided shortly after taking on the world bank presidency in 2005 , wolfowitz arranged for a promotion and a $ 60,000 -lrb- 44,000 euro -rrb- pay raise for his girlfriend shaha riza , who was also working at the bank at that time .
riza later transferred to a position at the us state department , but continued receiving paychecks from the world bank .
the scandal had caused a transatlantic rift : germany , france and the netherlands have been particularly vocal in demanding wolfowitz 's resignation , while the us staunchly defended him .
the white house said president george w. bush would name a successor as soon as possible .
by tradition , the us appoints the head of the world bank , while europe selects a leader for its partner institution , the international monetary fund .
focusing on developing countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing countries are top of the agenda the debt crisis in developing countries will top the agenda at the two-day g8 finance ministers ' meeting in potsdam .
delegates from cameroon , ghana , nigeria and south africa have been invited to the talks .
steinbrück said that germany 's lawmakers will prioritize developmental aid as much as possible when forming the national budget for 2008 .
the finance conference , which serves as a precursor to the g8 meeting in early june , will also focus on achieving more transparency for companies with hedge funds , a german initiative that faces resistance in the us and britain . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany says wolfowitz not welcome at berlin meeting german development minister wieczorek-zeul wednesday stepped up pressure on disgraced world bank president paul wolfowitz to resign , saying he would not be welcome at a forum the bank is holding next week in berlin .

at the time , the world 's leading industrialized nations resolved to double development aid by 2010 and to free the poorest countries of their debts . denis tull , an africa expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , said he considered the debt relief a positive move .
but added thatsuch measures should not be overrated . " you should look at it matter-of-factly , " tull said .
" the debts were cancelled - well knowing that they never would have been paid back anyway . " tull said it was ultimately in the hands of african governments to decide whether the funds freed by the debt relief would now be put to good use . broken promises ? the international community has committed itself to fighting worldwide poverty in the united nations millennium development goals .
the g8 nations in particular have repeatedly affirmed their commitment and want to set a good example .
yet worldwide development aid has decreased in the past years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gentlemen at the g8 summit in gleneagles committed to do more for africa " the g8 countries are not true to their word , " said africa and development aid expert cord jakobeit from the university of hamburg .
" the commitment by the g8 to significantly increase their contribution to development aid looks gloomy . " the latest figures by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- confirm jakobeit 's opinion .
together , the 30 oecd member states spent 5 percent less on development aid in 2006 than in the previous year .
the thriftiest were italy with a 30 percent cut and the united states with a reduction of 20 percent .
both countries are members of the g8 . in absolute terms , g8 nations spend the most money on development aid .
but viewed in terms of countries ' economic output , a g8 member first appears seventh on the list .
half of the most frugal aid donors belong to the group of eight , according to the oecd . is outside aid the right measure ? but both donor countries , as well as african nations themselves are questioning the concept of development aid .
the kenyan economist james shikwati said he rejected conventional development policies .
instead , he emphasized progress by africa 's own means . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african nations should be building their own futures , some experts say " without foreign aid , governments would have to see to an economic development which develops in the country itself , " shikwati told the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . according to tull , development aid is n't a panacea for poor nations . " it can only have a limited impact , as does every measure which comes from outside , " tull said , adding that it would be presumptuous to believe one could steer certain economic or political processes in such a way that the result would meet western expectations . the situation in post-colonial africa has not improved there are good reasons for the world to deal with africa 's problems , according to development experts . " africa is the hardship case of the global community , " said jakobeit . of course , this assessment does n't apply to all african countries .
but in many cases , the political and economic situation has tended to worsen rather than improve since the years of great hope following the end of colonial rule . the facts show how staggering the situation in africa really is .
some 75 percent of the population living south of the sahara has to survive on less than $ 2 per day and according to the united nations , two-thirds of the world 's least developed countries are located in africa . in the past five decades , trillions of euros have been spent on development aid , yet a sustainable impact has only been achieved in rare cases . " long-term studies prove that the positive effect of development policies in africa can not be significantly proven , " jakobeit said . pablo walden -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are the right countries sitting at the g8 table ?
g8 stands for the world 's leading eight industrial nations .
but in the lead up to the 2007 g8 summit in germany , some economists are again raising the question of whether the right members are in the g8 club .

i am convinced that , among other topics , climate change , sustainable development , the fight against hunger and against social marginalization as well as financing development are among the issues on which the most important emerging countries need to be heard from more and more .

she is attending the g8 alternative summit in rostock . two years ago g8 leaders promised universal access to treatment and preventative care - two years on there has been very little action .
we are calling for a long-term funding plan so we do n't have to go begging , bowl in hand , at every annual meeting .
universal access by 2015 is a goal that deserves a budget . i think the credibility and legitimacy of g8 is in question .
it 's an ongoing debate .
they have invited other countries to join them , which is a sign of the times .
the g8 has been more aware of its lack of credibility , but also aware of protests and therefore has tended to hide itself away .
russian president vladimir putin met with action aid last year , which i think was a recognition that civil society is important . the g8 can lead by example .
unfortunately , so far it has tended to make cost free promises . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback what does the g8 mean to you ?

we have our medium-term objectives and i 'm sure that by the end of this presidency , we will have come further than where we are at the moment , " he said . the debate was a " process " which will continue " at least until the end of the german presidency " of the g8 . it was of secondary importance " whether we will come to a specific code of conduct by end of this year or in 2008 ... so long as we get there , " steinbrück said . just a prep meeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 summit will take place here in heiligendamm from june 3 to 9 , 2007 the finance ministers of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , the united states and russia were meeting in potsdam , just outside berlin , this weekend , to prepare for the bigger summit of government leaders in june . in addition to hedge funds , the ministers were to discuss a wide range of topics , from ways of strengthening financial market stability , supporting sound governance in africa . steinbrück , who has already acknowledged that agreement was unlikely before the wider g8 summit of government leaders in the plush seaside resort of heiligendamm in early june , said friday discussions had progressed since the topic was first discussed at a meeting of g7 -lrb- g8 minus russia -rrb- finance ministers in essen in february . he also suggested that the idea of self-regulation - where the funds themselves would implement the rules and make sure they were adhered to - had the support not only of governments and institutions such as the ecb but also within the banking sector and even the industry itself . " we 've struck a nerve " , he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 18.05.2007 germany welcomes wolfowitz 's resignation from world bank großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfowitz said his resignation was in the best interest of the world bank germany finance minister peer steinbrück said the resignation of world bank president paul wolfowitz was good for institution . the process leading up to wolfowitz 's resignation lasted too long and damaged the reputation of the world bank , said german finance minister peer steinbrück friday in an interview with broadcaster deutschlandradio kultur .
now the world bank has to repair its reputation as quickly as possible , said steinbrück , adding that the institution is " extremely important for the countries of the third world . "
following a conflict-of-interest scandal that became public six weeks ago , paul wolfowitz said late thursday evening from washington that his resignation was in the best interest of the world bank .
the announcement came ahead of a meeting of the finance ministers from the group of eight countries on friday in potsdam , just outside of berlin .
wolfowitz said he would not be attending the conference , where he was scheduled to give a speech on corruption .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now the world bank has a reputation to save , said steinbrück eckhard deutscher , germany 's representative on the 24-member board of the world bank , said on thursday wolfowitz 's failings ran deeper than the immediate cause of his resignation .
poor management style and lack of vision for the bank 's mission were among wolfowitz 's weaknesses , he told reporters in washington .
" i regret that paul wolfowitz personally suffered damage , but i regret the damage he cause the bank much more , " said deutscher .
us , europe divided shortly after taking on the world bank presidency in 2005 , wolfowitz arranged for a promotion and a $ 60,000 -lrb- 44,000 euro -rrb- pay raise for his girlfriend shaha riza , who was also working at the bank at that time .
riza later transferred to a position at the us state department , but continued receiving paychecks from the world bank .
the scandal had caused a transatlantic rift : germany , france and the netherlands have been particularly vocal in demanding wolfowitz 's resignation , while the us staunchly defended him .
the white house said president george w. bush would name a successor as soon as possible .
by tradition , the us appoints the head of the world bank , while europe selects a leader for its partner institution , the international monetary fund .
focusing on developing countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing countries are top of the agenda the debt crisis in developing countries will top the agenda at the two-day g8 finance ministers ' meeting in potsdam .
delegates from cameroon , ghana , nigeria and south africa have been invited to the talks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 18.05.2007 nato probes cyber attacks on estonia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many estonian sites have been closed down nato is investigating the mass cyber attacks launched on estonian websites over the past three weeks .
it 's the first time , as far as is known , that there has been such an assault on a state . many government and corporate sites in the hi-tech baltic nation have been crippled for almost three weeks after being flooded with enormous amounts of traffic .
prime minister andrus ansip had claimed that some of the cyber-attacks , which forced the authorities in the tiny baltic state to temporarily shut down web sites , came from russian government computers , including the president 's office .
but tallinn has now backed away from such explicit accusations .
estonia 's defence minister jaak aaviksoo said there was a possibility of russian involvement in the attacks that involved at least one million computers .
the kremlin has dismissed the accusations , saying hackers could have used a false ip address to tarnish the russian authorities .
coincidence ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the relocation of a soviet war memorial has further soured relations between moscow and tallinn the start of the cyber-attacks coincide with the start of a row with the kremlin over the removal from central talinn of a post-world war ii memorial to soviet red army soldiers .
the nato spokesman remained vague on the question of russian involvement .
" it 's not that easy because of the nature of cyber space , " he said .
he added that " various indications " had been identified .
but he said that tracking and identifying the cyber attackers was not the primary goal of the investigations .
" our aim ultimately is protection . "
he told afp , " we do see it as serious because it was concerted .
it 's clearly not the sort of thing that two teenagers , for whatever their motives , do .
we are talking about a pretty well-organised thing . "
" this is a special case because of the scale of this attack .
so of course allies are going to help and we are not just treating this as an estonian problem , of course it is a problem for nato , " the spokesman added .
growing threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spread of technology is set to increase the threat of cyber attack at present , nato does not define cyber attacks as clear military action .
this means the provisions of collective self-defence would not apply to the attacked country .
us deputy secretary of state john negroponte told a number of leading european newspapers on friday that cyber attacks were likely to become more of an issue in the future .
a common method of achieving such attacks is by hijacking computers belonging to normal web surfers using a virus or other malware picked up from an infected e-mail attachment or by visiting a website that hosts such malware .
estonia , which has a large russia minority , is a pioneer in the development of e-government and a very wired society .
this also makes it very vulnerable to cyber attacks . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : germany intervened in russia-estonia dispute germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier practiced some behind-the-scenes realpolitik this week to sooth russian-estonian tensions over the removal of a momument in tallinn , according to a german news report .

it 's the first time , as far as is known , that there has been such an assault on a state . many government and corporate sites in the hi-tech baltic nation have been crippled for almost three weeks after being flooded with enormous amounts of traffic .
prime minister andrus ansip had claimed that some of the cyber-attacks , which forced the authorities in the tiny baltic state to temporarily shut down web sites , came from russian government computers , including the president 's office .
but tallinn has now backed away from such explicit accusations .
estonia 's defence minister jaak aaviksoo said there was a possibility of russian involvement in the attacks that involved at least one million computers .
the kremlin has dismissed the accusations , saying hackers could have used a false ip address to tarnish the russian authorities .

the nato spokesman remained vague on the question of russian involvement .
" it 's not that easy because of the nature of cyber space , " he said .
he added that " various indications " had been identified .
but he said that tracking and identifying the cyber attackers was not the primary goal of the investigations .

he told afp , " we do see it as serious because it was concerted .
it 's clearly not the sort of thing that two teenagers , for whatever their motives , do .
we are talking about a pretty well-organised thing . "
" this is a special case because of the scale of this attack .
so of course allies are going to help and we are not just treating this as an estonian problem , of course it is a problem for nato , " the spokesman added .
growing threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spread of technology is set to increase the threat of cyber attack at present , nato does not define cyber attacks as clear military action .
this means the provisions of collective self-defence would not apply to the attacked country .
us deputy secretary of state john negroponte told a number of leading european newspapers on friday that cyber attacks were likely to become more of an issue in the future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 18.05.2007 " both g8 and african leaders failed to keep their promises " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some readers said bono should pull out his own wallet readers commented this week on pleas made by rock stars bono and bob geldof for g8 nations to honor their pledges to africa .
a guest commentary on dictatorships in the un also caught readers ' attention . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . is the g8 neglecting africa ? it is true that the g8 has made and not kept its promises to africa .
but there is another side to the coin .
africa 's leaders have failed to keep their part of the bargain - not just to the west about proper use of the aid funds , but to their own citizens in terms of human rights , accountable government and rule of law .
however much one empathizes with africa , the truth is that corruption and the absence of the rule of law are the biggest problem , not the lack of aid .
the solutions must come from africa itself .
what makes things difficult is that african rulers use the poverty of their citizens - more often than not , caused by them - as an excuse to ask for more aid .
africans like me are sick of the tired excuse that the west is to blame , the colonialists are to blame , or that by telling african leaders the blatant and sad truth they are being " racist . "
africa has been independent for far too long to use racism and colonial heritage as excuses for its woes .
for how long should they be potty-trained on democracy ? - lereko obonyo , kenya bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solutions must come from africa itself , wrote one readers i do not agree with bono and geldof that the g8 are neglecting our " responsibility " to africa .
they are neglecting the fact that government must extort money from us for their pet causes , whether we the people support the cause or not .
and what of the hypocrisy of bono moving his band 's business to a low-tax country to avoid exactly the extortion that he now demands of my government on me ?
neither man is certainly hurting for money . why are n't they living like common folk and giving the extra to africa themselves ? - jamie extract , us africa has not felt germany 's european leadership in terms of relief and development in africa .
i saw what tony blair has done about the debt cancellation in africa .
what did angel merkel sacrifice for the development of africa ?
a high-powered delegation including the german president visited my country , sierra leone .
since then i have not felt any impact .
please do something about this . - alusine s. kargbo , sierra-leone i agree with bono and bob geldof that g8 countries are neglecting commitments to africa . - dumitru florea , romania why does n't he just quit yapping ?
tell him to give some of the hundreds of millions of dollars he has made to these poor people .
my money belongs in my pocket .
it is sickening that i saw bono at ouest on the upper west side on mother 's day and he left half his food on his plate when the waiter came to clean up . - william , us a un of democracies and dictatorships ? i think the creation of a democratic caucus within the united nations would help solve the problem of the existence of dictatorships or other kinds of governments in the world , without leaving anyone out of the un .
promoting the cause of democracy is the best way to inculcate this kind of government in countries with no regard for human rights . - jose nigrin , israel a democracy caucus might be useful if the democracies would stick together , demand changes in the un charter , clean up the corruption and back it up with the combined position that they will withhold funding unless their requests are met .
the us should start by refusing any funding for the renovation of the un headquarters in new york and intimate that the un may be told to vacate the building and find a location in another country without us funding if it fails to meet the conditions of the democratic caucus . - max lester , us compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : united nations of democracies and dictatorships ?
the increasing role of non-democracies in key un bodies lead observers to wonder how the un can live up to its ideals .
the us and the eu should turn to the old-fashioned tools of diplomacy , argues thorsten benner .
-lrb- 17.05.2007 -rrb- rock stars urge g8 industrialized nations to deliver on africa aid irish rock stars bono and bob geldof on tuesday accused g8 nations of falling far behind on pledges of aid to africa and put pressure on germany as current head of the club to donate nearly one billion dollars .
-lrb- 15.05.2007 -rrb- from africa to germany , blogs reflect a globalized world as the number of blogs around the world continues to climb , many blogs focusing on local issues are gaining a global audience in this hyper-connected media landscape .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 18.05.2007 film on german drug scandal gets green light großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thalidomide was at the center of the biggest drug scandal in postwar germany a german film about the drug thalidomide , first issued 50 years ago , will be aired despite opposition by the firm that invented the medication .
the drug caused thousands of children to be born with severe disabilities . grünenthal pharmaceuticals had tried to get the tv movie banned , saying it was not a fair or truthful depiction of the tragic story .
but judges in hamburg ruled this week that it is clearly fiction rather than a documentary .
this means it is officially a work of art protected from censorship by the german constitution .
devastating side effects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the drug was given to pregnant women to treat morning sickness the film called “ contergan – just one tablet ” is now set to be aired on german public television in august .
contergan was the german name for the drug that was given to pregnant women to treat morning sickness in the 1950s and the early 1960s . the drug triggered the biggest pharmaceutical scandal in postwar germany after it later became clear that it caused severe damage to the limbs and internal organs of unborn foetuses .
dr. annette fusenig from grünenthal had criticized the film for failing to properly distinguish between fact and fiction .
" it ’ s a fictional film , and it does not give the truth , but on the other hand the film claims that is an historically based film , " she said .
" confusing " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hamburg court ruled it was clearly a work of fiction fusenig said she thought viewers would be confused and unable to judge what is based on fact and what is fiction .
the production company zeitsprung , however , always opposed these claims .
its managing director michael souviginier says that grünenthal has too low an opinion of the audience .
" the audience can differentiate between a feature film and a documentary , " said souvignier .
" and our film simply isn ’ t a documentary ; even a child could see that , " he added .
the court has asked the film company to make two small alterations before the work goes on air .
one scene will be deleted and also “ contergan : just one tablet ” will have to run with a disclaimer before and after , reiterating that it is a work of fiction .
victory for filmmakers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the manufacturers were involved in a lengthy trial over the drug souviginier welcomed the court 's decision .
" basically it is art that has won here , and the tradition of such films in gemany and around the world ; a tradition which has come out of this case unscathed , " he said .
for its part , grünenthal says it 's not campaigning to stop a film about thalidomide , or to avoid bad press .
but the company feels issues like compensation and general treatment of the victims are not fairly depicted in the film .
the firm could still try to appeal the verdict in germany ’ s highest court , and says it is considering its options . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new eu rules to make medication safer for kids new eu rules require europe-based pharmaceutical companies to show that the drugs they bring to market are suitable for kids .

" i hope that they will be able to express their opinion , " merkel told a joint news conference at the end of the two-day summit at which eu leaders discussed the state of democracy and human rights .
" i 'm somewhat concerned that people had difficulties getting here , but perhaps a possible demonstration can still take place , " merkel said . " if demonstrators throw stones , if they smash windows , then of course they should be curbed .
but if someone has done nothing , if they just want to go to a demonstration , then it 's different , " merkel said . russian president putin testily defended " preventive measures " taken by russian police ahead of the rally , comparing these to common practice in european countries . expressing assurances that the opposition 's right to protest would be respected , putin countered that german authorities have not ruled out using preventative detention in the run-up to next month 's group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in the german resort of heiligendamm . " we will not however point the finger at others , " the russian leader said . in hamburg alone , german police resorted to water canons and truncheons last week in clashes with some 2,000 activists demonstrating against the upcoming g8 summit on the baltic coast . boarding hindered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chess champion and opposition leader garry kasparov was stopped from flying kasparov 's other russia movement had planned an anti-kremlin protest to coincide with the tense meeting between russian president vladimir putin , chancellor merkel , the current holder of the european union 's six-month rotating presidency , and european commission president jose manuel barroso . the former chess champion had been scheduled to fly to the volga river city which is 70 kilometers -lrb- 43 miles -rrb- from the summit venue of volzhsky utyos .
" not one member of the other russia delegation was allowed to board , " denis bilunov , a spokeman for kasparov , told afp .
the leader of the radical national bolshevik movement , eduard limonov , was also stranded at the russian capital 's sheremetyevo airport , as were a number of journalists .
wall street journal correspondent alan cullison said police had told them that there was a problem with the tickets .
passports confiscated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : summit leaders have pledged to have an open dialogue about a number of thorny issues a representative of a human rights organization had his passport confiscated .
" we 're at sheremetyevo airport and uniformed men have taken our passports .
they 've taken 13 passports .
i consider this a criminal offence , " said lev ponomaryov of the for human rights organization .
" they told us at the check-in that our tickets had been rejected by the computer as they had been sold -lrb- to other passengers -rrb- .
but some journalists who were allowed to board told us the plane was half empty . "
a presidential spokesman denied the kremlin was involved in the incident and said he did not expect the incident to be discussed at the summit .
" i do n't think the issue of the non-arrival of a russian citizen , even a famous one will be on the summit agenda , " said dmitry pescov .
" i can not comment on behalf of the police .
the kremlin was not in sheremetyevo . "
some " constructive " discussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow 's ban on polish meat imports is one point of dispute meanwhile , russian and european leaders vowed to hold frank discussions about all areas of dispute .
president putin said : " we are ready for an open and honest dialogue without any taboo subjects . "
chancellor merkel said she hoped for firm solutions to the problems between the eu and russia .
" i hope that we can take concrete steps where there are snags and hitches . "
still , participants said " constructive " discussions had taken place at the summit in volzhsky utyos -lrb- volga cliff -rrb- , a picturesque resort complex some 1,000 kilometres -lrb- 620 miles -rrb- south of moscow .
putin and eu leaders discussed setting up an alert mechanism for increasingly vital russian energy supplies to europe following a request from merkel after recent gas and oil cut-offs from russia .
putin told barroso and merkel over dinner on thursday that supply agreements he signed this month with the central asian states of kazakhstan and turkmenistan would benefit europe .
talks touched on russia 's bid to join the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- , which is being dogged by trade tariff disputes with brussels , and the future status of the serbian province of kosovo .
" russia ca n't tango on its own " but the overall impression was one of deep discord between the two sides .
" we found many problems during the summit .
we have not always managed to convince each other but i think it 's always better to speak to each other than to speak about each other , " merkel said .
negotiations over a partnership agreement between the eu and russia , including in the sensitive energy sphere , are being blocked by eu member poland because of a trade dispute with moscow . the current agreement runs out this year and can be extended , but eu officials said that failure to start negotiations would be an embarrassment for both sides .

" i hope that they will be able to express their opinion , " merkel told a joint news conference at the end of the two-day summit at which eu leaders discussed the state of democracy and human rights .
" i 'm somewhat concerned that people had difficulties getting here , but perhaps a possible demonstration can still take place , " merkel said . " if demonstrators throw stones , if they smash windows , then of course they should be curbed .

a presidential spokesman denied the kremlin was involved in the incident and said he did not expect the incident to be discussed at the summit .
" i do n't think the issue of the non-arrival of a russian citizen , even a famous one will be on the summit agenda , " said dmitry pescov .

chancellor merkel said she hoped for firm solutions to the problems between the eu and russia .
" i hope that we can take concrete steps where there are snags and hitches . "
still , participants said " constructive " discussions had taken place at the summit in volzhsky utyos -lrb- volga cliff -rrb- , a picturesque resort complex some 1,000 kilometres -lrb- 620 miles -rrb- south of moscow .
putin and eu leaders discussed setting up an alert mechanism for increasingly vital russian energy supplies to europe following a request from merkel after recent gas and oil cut-offs from russia .
putin told barroso and merkel over dinner on thursday that supply agreements he signed this month with the central asian states of kazakhstan and turkmenistan would benefit europe .
talks touched on russia 's bid to join the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- , which is being dogged by trade tariff disputes with brussels , and the future status of the serbian province of kosovo .
" russia ca n't tango on its own " but the overall impression was one of deep discord between the two sides .
" we found many problems during the summit .
we have not always managed to convince each other but i think it 's always better to speak to each other than to speak about each other , " merkel said .
negotiations over a partnership agreement between the eu and russia , including in the sensitive energy sphere , are being blocked by eu member poland because of a trade dispute with moscow . the current agreement runs out this year and can be extended , but eu officials said that failure to start negotiations would be an embarrassment for both sides .

" i hope that they will be able to express their opinion , " merkel told a joint news conference at the end of the two-day summit at which eu leaders discussed the state of democracy and human rights .
" i 'm somewhat concerned that people had difficulties getting here , but perhaps a possible demonstration can still take place , " merkel said . " if demonstrators throw stones , if they smash windows , then of course they should be curbed .
but if someone has done nothing , if they just want to go to a demonstration , then it 's different , " merkel said . russian president putin testily defended " preventive measures " taken by russian police ahead of the rally , comparing these to common practice in european countries . expressing assurances that the opposition 's right to protest would be respected , putin countered that german authorities have not ruled out using preventative detention in the run-up to next month 's group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in the german resort of heiligendamm . " we will not however point the finger at others , " the russian leader said . in hamburg alone , german police resorted to water canons and truncheons last week in clashes with some 2,000 activists demonstrating against the upcoming g8 summit on the baltic coast . boarding hindered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chess champion and opposition leader garry kasparov was stopped from flying kasparov 's other russia movement had planned an anti-kremlin protest to coincide with the tense meeting between russian president vladimir putin , chancellor merkel , the current holder of the european union 's six-month rotating presidency , and european commission president jose manuel barroso . the former chess champion had been scheduled to fly to the volga river city which is 70 kilometers -lrb- 43 miles -rrb- from the summit venue of volzhsky utyos .
" not one member of the other russia delegation was allowed to board , " denis bilunov , a spokeman for kasparov , told afp .
the leader of the radical national bolshevik movement , eduard limonov , was also stranded at the russian capital 's sheremetyevo airport , as were a number of journalists .
wall street journal correspondent alan cullison said police had told them that there was a problem with the tickets .
passports confiscated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : summit leaders have pledged to have an open dialogue about a number of thorny issues a representative of a human rights organization had his passport confiscated .
" we 're at sheremetyevo airport and uniformed men have taken our passports .
they 've taken 13 passports .
i consider this a criminal offence , " said lev ponomaryov of the for human rights organization .
" they told us at the check-in that our tickets had been rejected by the computer as they had been sold -lrb- to other passengers -rrb- .
but some journalists who were allowed to board told us the plane was half empty . "
a presidential spokesman denied the kremlin was involved in the incident and said he did not expect the incident to be discussed at the summit .
" i do n't think the issue of the non-arrival of a russian citizen , even a famous one will be on the summit agenda , " said dmitry pescov .
" i can not comment on behalf of the police .
the kremlin was not in sheremetyevo . "
some " constructive " discussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow 's ban on polish meat imports is one point of dispute meanwhile , russian and european leaders vowed to hold frank discussions about all areas of dispute .
president putin said : " we are ready for an open and honest dialogue without any taboo subjects . "
chancellor merkel said she hoped for firm solutions to the problems between the eu and russia .
" i hope that we can take concrete steps where there are snags and hitches . "
still , participants said " constructive " discussions had taken place at the summit in volzhsky utyos -lrb- volga cliff -rrb- , a picturesque resort complex some 1,000 kilometres -lrb- 620 miles -rrb- south of moscow .
putin and eu leaders discussed setting up an alert mechanism for increasingly vital russian energy supplies to europe following a request from merkel after recent gas and oil cut-offs from russia .
putin told barroso and merkel over dinner on thursday that supply agreements he signed this month with the central asian states of kazakhstan and turkmenistan would benefit europe .
talks touched on russia 's bid to join the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- , which is being dogged by trade tariff disputes with brussels , and the future status of the serbian province of kosovo .
" russia ca n't tango on its own " but the overall impression was one of deep discord between the two sides .
" we found many problems during the summit .
we have not always managed to convince each other but i think it 's always better to speak to each other than to speak about each other , " merkel said .
negotiations over a partnership agreement between the eu and russia , including in the sensitive energy sphere , are being blocked by eu member poland because of a trade dispute with moscow . the current agreement runs out this year and can be extended , but eu officials said that failure to start negotiations would be an embarrassment for both sides .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso , left , and merkel with putin in samara barroso on friday reiterated the eu 's position that there was " no basis " for russia to maintain a ban on polish meat imports , the source of the dispute .
russia imposed the ban last year , citing food safety concerns .
putin responded that the eu should first solve its " internal problems , " and kremlin officials said that russia had already made sufficient concessions to poland and was waiting for a response .
" russia ca n't tango on its own , " said dmitry peskov , a kremlin spokesman .
the eu 's external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner ascribed some of the frostiness in relations to upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections in russia .
" russia is in a pre-election period so maybe nationalistic feelings are coming up .
but at the same time there are questions that have to be solved in a constructive spirit , " she told reporters . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu-russia talks open amid tensions , divisions an eu-russia summit meant to strengthen ties instead opened amid simmering tensions sparked by a long list of disputes that have fueled antagonism between moscow and its western neighbors .

it is n't the first time the continent is a g8 focus .
but have previous commitments brought about any change ? africa was last the focus of a g8 summit two years ago in gleneagles .
at the time , the world 's leading industrialized nations resolved to double development aid by 2010 and to free the poorest countries of their debts . denis tull , an africa expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , said he considered the debt relief a positive move .
but added thatsuch measures should not be overrated . " you should look at it matter-of-factly , " tull said .
" the debts were cancelled - well knowing that they never would have been paid back anyway . " tull said it was ultimately in the hands of african governments to decide whether the funds freed by the debt relief would now be put to good use . broken promises ? the international community has committed itself to fighting worldwide poverty in the united nations millennium development goals .
the g8 nations in particular have repeatedly affirmed their commitment and want to set a good example .
yet worldwide development aid has decreased in the past years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gentlemen at the g8 summit in gleneagles committed to do more for africa " the g8 countries are not true to their word , " said africa and development aid expert cord jakobeit from the university of hamburg .
" the commitment by the g8 to significantly increase their contribution to development aid looks gloomy . " the latest figures by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- confirm jakobeit 's opinion .
together , the 30 oecd member states spent 5 percent less on development aid in 2006 than in the previous year .
the thriftiest were italy with a 30 percent cut and the united states with a reduction of 20 percent .
both countries are members of the g8 . in absolute terms , g8 nations spend the most money on development aid .
but viewed in terms of countries ' economic output , a g8 member first appears seventh on the list .
half of the most frugal aid donors belong to the group of eight , according to the oecd . is outside aid the right measure ? but both donor countries , as well as african nations themselves are questioning the concept of development aid .
the kenyan economist james shikwati said he rejected conventional development policies .
instead , he emphasized progress by africa 's own means . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african nations should be building their own futures , some experts say " without foreign aid , governments would have to see to an economic development which develops in the country itself , " shikwati told the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . according to tull , development aid is n't a panacea for poor nations . " it can only have a limited impact , as does every measure which comes from outside , " tull said , adding that it would be presumptuous to believe one could steer certain economic or political processes in such a way that the result would meet western expectations . the situation in post-colonial africa has not improved there are good reasons for the world to deal with africa 's problems , according to development experts . " africa is the hardship case of the global community , " said jakobeit . of course , this assessment does n't apply to all african countries .
but in many cases , the political and economic situation has tended to worsen rather than improve since the years of great hope following the end of colonial rule . the facts show how staggering the situation in africa really is .
some 75 percent of the population living south of the sahara has to survive on less than $ 2 per day and according to the united nations , two-thirds of the world 's least developed countries are located in africa . in the past five decades , trillions of euros have been spent on development aid , yet a sustainable impact has only been achieved in rare cases . " long-term studies prove that the positive effect of development policies in africa can not be significantly proven , " jakobeit said . pablo walden -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are the right countries sitting at the g8 table ?

it 's the first time , as far as is known , that there has been such an assault on a state . many government and corporate sites in the hi-tech baltic nation have been crippled for almost three weeks after being flooded with enormous amounts of traffic .
prime minister andrus ansip had claimed that some of the cyber-attacks , which forced the authorities in the tiny baltic state to temporarily shut down web sites , came from russian government computers , including the president 's office .
but tallinn has now backed away from such explicit accusations .
estonia 's defence minister jaak aaviksoo said there was a possibility of russian involvement in the attacks that involved at least one million computers .
the kremlin has dismissed the accusations , saying hackers could have used a false ip address to tarnish the russian authorities .
coincidence ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the relocation of a soviet war memorial has further soured relations between moscow and tallinn the start of the cyber-attacks coincide with the start of a row with the kremlin over the removal from central talinn of a post-world war ii memorial to soviet red army soldiers .
the nato spokesman remained vague on the question of russian involvement .
" it 's not that easy because of the nature of cyber space , " he said .
he added that " various indications " had been identified .
but he said that tracking and identifying the cyber attackers was not the primary goal of the investigations .
" our aim ultimately is protection . "
he told afp , " we do see it as serious because it was concerted .
it 's clearly not the sort of thing that two teenagers , for whatever their motives , do .
we are talking about a pretty well-organised thing . "
" this is a special case because of the scale of this attack .
so of course allies are going to help and we are not just treating this as an estonian problem , of course it is a problem for nato , " the spokesman added .
growing threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spread of technology is set to increase the threat of cyber attack at present , nato does not define cyber attacks as clear military action .
this means the provisions of collective self-defence would not apply to the attacked country .
us deputy secretary of state john negroponte told a number of leading european newspapers on friday that cyber attacks were likely to become more of an issue in the future .
a common method of achieving such attacks is by hijacking computers belonging to normal web surfers using a virus or other malware picked up from an infected e-mail attachment or by visiting a website that hosts such malware .
estonia , which has a large russia minority , is a pioneer in the development of e-government and a very wired society .
this also makes it very vulnerable to cyber attacks . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : germany intervened in russia-estonia dispute germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier practiced some behind-the-scenes realpolitik this week to sooth russian-estonian tensions over the removal of a momument in tallinn , according to a german news report .

it 's the first time , as far as is known , that there has been such an assault on a state . many government and corporate sites in the hi-tech baltic nation have been crippled for almost three weeks after being flooded with enormous amounts of traffic .
prime minister andrus ansip had claimed that some of the cyber-attacks , which forced the authorities in the tiny baltic state to temporarily shut down web sites , came from russian government computers , including the president 's office .
but tallinn has now backed away from such explicit accusations .
estonia 's defence minister jaak aaviksoo said there was a possibility of russian involvement in the attacks that involved at least one million computers .
the kremlin has dismissed the accusations , saying hackers could have used a false ip address to tarnish the russian authorities .
coincidence ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the relocation of a soviet war memorial has further soured relations between moscow and tallinn the start of the cyber-attacks coincide with the start of a row with the kremlin over the removal from central talinn of a post-world war ii memorial to soviet red army soldiers .
the nato spokesman remained vague on the question of russian involvement .
" it 's not that easy because of the nature of cyber space , " he said .
he added that " various indications " had been identified .
but he said that tracking and identifying the cyber attackers was not the primary goal of the investigations .
" our aim ultimately is protection . "
he told afp , " we do see it as serious because it was concerted .
it 's clearly not the sort of thing that two teenagers , for whatever their motives , do .
we are talking about a pretty well-organised thing . "
" this is a special case because of the scale of this attack .
so of course allies are going to help and we are not just treating this as an estonian problem , of course it is a problem for nato , " the spokesman added .
growing threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spread of technology is set to increase the threat of cyber attack at present , nato does not define cyber attacks as clear military action .
this means the provisions of collective self-defence would not apply to the attacked country .
us deputy secretary of state john negroponte told a number of leading european newspapers on friday that cyber attacks were likely to become more of an issue in the future .
a common method of achieving such attacks is by hijacking computers belonging to normal web surfers using a virus or other malware picked up from an infected e-mail attachment or by visiting a website that hosts such malware .
estonia , which has a large russia minority , is a pioneer in the development of e-government and a very wired society .
this also makes it very vulnerable to cyber attacks . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : germany intervened in russia-estonia dispute germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier practiced some behind-the-scenes realpolitik this week to sooth russian-estonian tensions over the removal of a momument in tallinn , according to a german news report .

now the world bank has to repair its reputation as quickly as possible , said steinbrück , adding that the institution is " extremely important for the countries of the third world . "
following a conflict-of-interest scandal that became public six weeks ago , paul wolfowitz said late thursday evening from washington that his resignation was in the best interest of the world bank .
the announcement came ahead of a meeting of the finance ministers from the group of eight countries on friday in potsdam , just outside of berlin .
wolfowitz said he would not be attending the conference , where he was scheduled to give a speech on corruption .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now the world bank has a reputation to save , said steinbrück eckhard deutscher , germany 's representative on the 24-member board of the world bank , said on thursday wolfowitz 's failings ran deeper than the immediate cause of his resignation .
poor management style and lack of vision for the bank 's mission were among wolfowitz 's weaknesses , he told reporters in washington .
" i regret that paul wolfowitz personally suffered damage , but i regret the damage he cause the bank much more , " said deutscher .
us , europe divided shortly after taking on the world bank presidency in 2005 , wolfowitz arranged for a promotion and a $ 60,000 -lrb- 44,000 euro -rrb- pay raise for his girlfriend shaha riza , who was also working at the bank at that time .
riza later transferred to a position at the us state department , but continued receiving paychecks from the world bank .
the scandal had caused a transatlantic rift : germany , france and the netherlands have been particularly vocal in demanding wolfowitz 's resignation , while the us staunchly defended him .
the white house said president george w. bush would name a successor as soon as possible .
by tradition , the us appoints the head of the world bank , while europe selects a leader for its partner institution , the international monetary fund .
focusing on developing countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing countries are top of the agenda the debt crisis in developing countries will top the agenda at the two-day g8 finance ministers ' meeting in potsdam .
delegates from cameroon , ghana , nigeria and south africa have been invited to the talks .
steinbrück said that germany 's lawmakers will prioritize developmental aid as much as possible when forming the national budget for 2008 .
the finance conference , which serves as a precursor to the g8 meeting in early june , will also focus on achieving more transparency for companies with hedge funds , a german initiative that faces resistance in the us and britain . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany says wolfowitz not welcome at berlin meeting german development minister wieczorek-zeul wednesday stepped up pressure on disgraced world bank president paul wolfowitz to resign , saying he would not be welcome at a forum the bank is holding next week in berlin .

" i hope that they will be able to express their opinion , " merkel told a joint news conference at the end of the two-day summit at which eu leaders discussed the state of democracy and human rights .
" i 'm somewhat concerned that people had difficulties getting here , but perhaps a possible demonstration can still take place , " merkel said . " if demonstrators throw stones , if they smash windows , then of course they should be curbed .
but if someone has done nothing , if they just want to go to a demonstration , then it 's different , " merkel said . russian president putin testily defended " preventive measures " taken by russian police ahead of the rally , comparing these to common practice in european countries . expressing assurances that the opposition 's right to protest would be respected , putin countered that german authorities have not ruled out using preventative detention in the run-up to next month 's group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in the german resort of heiligendamm . " we will not however point the finger at others , " the russian leader said . in hamburg alone , german police resorted to water canons and truncheons last week in clashes with some 2,000 activists demonstrating against the upcoming g8 summit on the baltic coast . boarding hindered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chess champion and opposition leader garry kasparov was stopped from flying kasparov 's other russia movement had planned an anti-kremlin protest to coincide with the tense meeting between russian president vladimir putin , chancellor merkel , the current holder of the european union 's six-month rotating presidency , and european commission president jose manuel barroso . the former chess champion had been scheduled to fly to the volga river city which is 70 kilometers -lrb- 43 miles -rrb- from the summit venue of volzhsky utyos .
" not one member of the other russia delegation was allowed to board , " denis bilunov , a spokeman for kasparov , told afp .
the leader of the radical national bolshevik movement , eduard limonov , was also stranded at the russian capital 's sheremetyevo airport , as were a number of journalists .
wall street journal correspondent alan cullison said police had told them that there was a problem with the tickets .
passports confiscated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : summit leaders have pledged to have an open dialogue about a number of thorny issues a representative of a human rights organization had his passport confiscated .
" we 're at sheremetyevo airport and uniformed men have taken our passports .
they 've taken 13 passports .
i consider this a criminal offence , " said lev ponomaryov of the for human rights organization .
" they told us at the check-in that our tickets had been rejected by the computer as they had been sold -lrb- to other passengers -rrb- .
but some journalists who were allowed to board told us the plane was half empty . "
a presidential spokesman denied the kremlin was involved in the incident and said he did not expect the incident to be discussed at the summit .
" i do n't think the issue of the non-arrival of a russian citizen , even a famous one will be on the summit agenda , " said dmitry pescov .
" i can not comment on behalf of the police .
the kremlin was not in sheremetyevo . "
some " constructive " discussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow 's ban on polish meat imports is one point of dispute meanwhile , russian and european leaders vowed to hold frank discussions about all areas of dispute .
president putin said : " we are ready for an open and honest dialogue without any taboo subjects . "
chancellor merkel said she hoped for firm solutions to the problems between the eu and russia .
" i hope that we can take concrete steps where there are snags and hitches . "
still , participants said " constructive " discussions had taken place at the summit in volzhsky utyos -lrb- volga cliff -rrb- , a picturesque resort complex some 1,000 kilometres -lrb- 620 miles -rrb- south of moscow .
putin and eu leaders discussed setting up an alert mechanism for increasingly vital russian energy supplies to europe following a request from merkel after recent gas and oil cut-offs from russia .
putin told barroso and merkel over dinner on thursday that supply agreements he signed this month with the central asian states of kazakhstan and turkmenistan would benefit europe .
talks touched on russia 's bid to join the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- , which is being dogged by trade tariff disputes with brussels , and the future status of the serbian province of kosovo .
" russia ca n't tango on its own " but the overall impression was one of deep discord between the two sides .
" we found many problems during the summit .
we have not always managed to convince each other but i think it 's always better to speak to each other than to speak about each other , " merkel said .
negotiations over a partnership agreement between the eu and russia , including in the sensitive energy sphere , are being blocked by eu member poland because of a trade dispute with moscow . the current agreement runs out this year and can be extended , but eu officials said that failure to start negotiations would be an embarrassment for both sides .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso , left , and merkel with putin in samara barroso on friday reiterated the eu 's position that there was " no basis " for russia to maintain a ban on polish meat imports , the source of the dispute .
russia imposed the ban last year , citing food safety concerns .
putin responded that the eu should first solve its " internal problems , " and kremlin officials said that russia had already made sufficient concessions to poland and was waiting for a response .
" russia ca n't tango on its own , " said dmitry peskov , a kremlin spokesman .
the eu 's external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner ascribed some of the frostiness in relations to upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections in russia .

contergan was the german name for the drug that was given to pregnant women to treat morning sickness in the 1950s and the early 1960s . the drug triggered the biggest pharmaceutical scandal in postwar germany after it later became clear that it caused severe damage to the limbs and internal organs of unborn foetuses .

i am convinced that , among other topics , climate change , sustainable development , the fight against hunger and against social marginalization as well as financing development are among the issues on which the most important emerging countries need to be heard from more and more .
not only because their populations are the most affected in an increasing networked and interconnected world , but also because in our countries there are more innovative approaches to finding solutions to these challenges . i mean that the meetings taking place with the participation of the emerging countries will contribute to lending additional credibility and effectiveness on an international level to the g8 's endeavors .

i am convinced that , among other topics , climate change , sustainable development , the fight against hunger and against social marginalization as well as financing development are among the issues on which the most important emerging countries need to be heard from more and more .
not only because their populations are the most affected in an increasing networked and interconnected world , but also because in our countries there are more innovative approaches to finding solutions to these challenges . i mean that the meetings taking place with the participation of the emerging countries will contribute to lending additional credibility and effectiveness on an international level to the g8 's endeavors .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . is the g8 neglecting africa ? it is true that the g8 has made and not kept its promises to africa .
but there is another side to the coin .
africa 's leaders have failed to keep their part of the bargain - not just to the west about proper use of the aid funds , but to their own citizens in terms of human rights , accountable government and rule of law .
however much one empathizes with africa , the truth is that corruption and the absence of the rule of law are the biggest problem , not the lack of aid .
the solutions must come from africa itself .
what makes things difficult is that african rulers use the poverty of their citizens - more often than not , caused by them - as an excuse to ask for more aid .
africans like me are sick of the tired excuse that the west is to blame , the colonialists are to blame , or that by telling african leaders the blatant and sad truth they are being " racist . "
africa has been independent for far too long to use racism and colonial heritage as excuses for its woes .

neither man is certainly hurting for money . why are n't they living like common folk and giving the extra to africa themselves ? - jamie extract , us africa has not felt germany 's european leadership in terms of relief and development in africa .

promoting the cause of democracy is the best way to inculcate this kind of government in countries with no regard for human rights . - jose nigrin , israel a democracy caucus might be useful if the democracies would stick together , demand changes in the un charter , clean up the corruption and back it up with the combined position that they will withhold funding unless their requests are met .

a guest commentary on dictatorships in the un also caught readers ' attention . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . is the g8 neglecting africa ? it is true that the g8 has made and not kept its promises to africa .
but there is another side to the coin .
africa 's leaders have failed to keep their part of the bargain - not just to the west about proper use of the aid funds , but to their own citizens in terms of human rights , accountable government and rule of law .
however much one empathizes with africa , the truth is that corruption and the absence of the rule of law are the biggest problem , not the lack of aid .
the solutions must come from africa itself .
what makes things difficult is that african rulers use the poverty of their citizens - more often than not , caused by them - as an excuse to ask for more aid .
africans like me are sick of the tired excuse that the west is to blame , the colonialists are to blame , or that by telling african leaders the blatant and sad truth they are being " racist . "
africa has been independent for far too long to use racism and colonial heritage as excuses for its woes .
for how long should they be potty-trained on democracy ? - lereko obonyo , kenya bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solutions must come from africa itself , wrote one readers i do not agree with bono and geldof that the g8 are neglecting our " responsibility " to africa .
they are neglecting the fact that government must extort money from us for their pet causes , whether we the people support the cause or not .
and what of the hypocrisy of bono moving his band 's business to a low-tax country to avoid exactly the extortion that he now demands of my government on me ?
neither man is certainly hurting for money . why are n't they living like common folk and giving the extra to africa themselves ? - jamie extract , us africa has not felt germany 's european leadership in terms of relief and development in africa .
i saw what tony blair has done about the debt cancellation in africa .
what did angel merkel sacrifice for the development of africa ?
a high-powered delegation including the german president visited my country , sierra leone .
since then i have not felt any impact .
please do something about this . - alusine s. kargbo , sierra-leone i agree with bono and bob geldof that g8 countries are neglecting commitments to africa . - dumitru florea , romania why does n't he just quit yapping ?
tell him to give some of the hundreds of millions of dollars he has made to these poor people .
my money belongs in my pocket .
it is sickening that i saw bono at ouest on the upper west side on mother 's day and he left half his food on his plate when the waiter came to clean up . - william , us a un of democracies and dictatorships ? i think the creation of a democratic caucus within the united nations would help solve the problem of the existence of dictatorships or other kinds of governments in the world , without leaving anyone out of the un .
promoting the cause of democracy is the best way to inculcate this kind of government in countries with no regard for human rights . - jose nigrin , israel a democracy caucus might be useful if the democracies would stick together , demand changes in the un charter , clean up the corruption and back it up with the combined position that they will withhold funding unless their requests are met .
the us should start by refusing any funding for the renovation of the un headquarters in new york and intimate that the un may be told to vacate the building and find a location in another country without us funding if it fails to meet the conditions of the democratic caucus . - max lester , us compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : united nations of democracies and dictatorships ?
the increasing role of non-democracies in key un bodies lead observers to wonder how the un can live up to its ideals .
the us and the eu should turn to the old-fashioned tools of diplomacy , argues thorsten benner .
-lrb- 17.05.2007 -rrb- rock stars urge g8 industrialized nations to deliver on africa aid irish rock stars bono and bob geldof on tuesday accused g8 nations of falling far behind on pledges of aid to africa and put pressure on germany as current head of the club to donate nearly one billion dollars .

" i 'm somewhat concerned that people had difficulties getting here , but perhaps a possible demonstration can still take place , " merkel said . " if demonstrators throw stones , if they smash windows , then of course they should be curbed .
but if someone has done nothing , if they just want to go to a demonstration , then it 's different , " merkel said . russian president putin testily defended " preventive measures " taken by russian police ahead of the rally , comparing these to common practice in european countries . expressing assurances that the opposition 's right to protest would be respected , putin countered that german authorities have not ruled out using preventative detention in the run-up to next month 's group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in the german resort of heiligendamm . " we will not however point the finger at others , " the russian leader said . in hamburg alone , german police resorted to water canons and truncheons last week in clashes with some 2,000 activists demonstrating against the upcoming g8 summit on the baltic coast . boarding hindered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chess champion and opposition leader garry kasparov was stopped from flying kasparov 's other russia movement had planned an anti-kremlin protest to coincide with the tense meeting between russian president vladimir putin , chancellor merkel , the current holder of the european union 's six-month rotating presidency , and european commission president jose manuel barroso . the former chess champion had been scheduled to fly to the volga river city which is 70 kilometers -lrb- 43 miles -rrb- from the summit venue of volzhsky utyos .
" not one member of the other russia delegation was allowed to board , " denis bilunov , a spokeman for kasparov , told afp .
the leader of the radical national bolshevik movement , eduard limonov , was also stranded at the russian capital 's sheremetyevo airport , as were a number of journalists .
wall street journal correspondent alan cullison said police had told them that there was a problem with the tickets .
passports confiscated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : summit leaders have pledged to have an open dialogue about a number of thorny issues a representative of a human rights organization had his passport confiscated .
" we 're at sheremetyevo airport and uniformed men have taken our passports .
they 've taken 13 passports .
i consider this a criminal offence , " said lev ponomaryov of the for human rights organization .
" they told us at the check-in that our tickets had been rejected by the computer as they had been sold -lrb- to other passengers -rrb- .
but some journalists who were allowed to board told us the plane was half empty . "
a presidential spokesman denied the kremlin was involved in the incident and said he did not expect the incident to be discussed at the summit .
" i do n't think the issue of the non-arrival of a russian citizen , even a famous one will be on the summit agenda , " said dmitry pescov .
" i can not comment on behalf of the police .
the kremlin was not in sheremetyevo . "
some " constructive " discussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow 's ban on polish meat imports is one point of dispute meanwhile , russian and european leaders vowed to hold frank discussions about all areas of dispute .
president putin said : " we are ready for an open and honest dialogue without any taboo subjects . "
chancellor merkel said she hoped for firm solutions to the problems between the eu and russia .
" i hope that we can take concrete steps where there are snags and hitches . "
still , participants said " constructive " discussions had taken place at the summit in volzhsky utyos -lrb- volga cliff -rrb- , a picturesque resort complex some 1,000 kilometres -lrb- 620 miles -rrb- south of moscow .
putin and eu leaders discussed setting up an alert mechanism for increasingly vital russian energy supplies to europe following a request from merkel after recent gas and oil cut-offs from russia .
putin told barroso and merkel over dinner on thursday that supply agreements he signed this month with the central asian states of kazakhstan and turkmenistan would benefit europe .
talks touched on russia 's bid to join the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- , which is being dogged by trade tariff disputes with brussels , and the future status of the serbian province of kosovo .
" russia ca n't tango on its own " but the overall impression was one of deep discord between the two sides .
" we found many problems during the summit .
we have not always managed to convince each other but i think it 's always better to speak to each other than to speak about each other , " merkel said .
negotiations over a partnership agreement between the eu and russia , including in the sensitive energy sphere , are being blocked by eu member poland because of a trade dispute with moscow . the current agreement runs out this year and can be extended , but eu officials said that failure to start negotiations would be an embarrassment for both sides .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso , left , and merkel with putin in samara barroso on friday reiterated the eu 's position that there was " no basis " for russia to maintain a ban on polish meat imports , the source of the dispute .
russia imposed the ban last year , citing food safety concerns .
putin responded that the eu should first solve its " internal problems , " and kremlin officials said that russia had already made sufficient concessions to poland and was waiting for a response .
" russia ca n't tango on its own , " said dmitry peskov , a kremlin spokesman .
the eu 's external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner ascribed some of the frostiness in relations to upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections in russia .
" russia is in a pre-election period so maybe nationalistic feelings are coming up .
but at the same time there are questions that have to be solved in a constructive spirit , " she told reporters . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu-russia talks open amid tensions , divisions an eu-russia summit meant to strengthen ties instead opened amid simmering tensions sparked by a long list of disputes that have fueled antagonism between moscow and its western neighbors .

" any inappropriate regulation that could hurt free market mechanisms should be avoided , " japanese finance minister koji omi told journalists after bilateral talks with us deputy treasury secretary robert kimmitt .
" japan and the us agree on that . " omi 's comments will come as a blow to german finance minister peer steinbrück , host of a meeting of group of eight finance ministers this weekend , who is spearheading a campaign for a system of self-regulation for the industry . germany has repeatedly expressed concern over potential risks to financial stability from hedge funds , highly speculative and aggressive investment instruments .
and berlin has long campaigned for increased transparency and even regulation of the largely uncontrolled sector . but any such plans have consistently run up against fierce resistance , particularly in the us and britain , where most of the funds are based . moderate progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's finance minister peer steinbrück at a press briefing just before the g8 finance meeting officially got underway , steinbrück insisted that progress was being made . the minister , however , acknowledged that drawing up a blue-print for self-regulation of the industry would be a long process . " nobody has ever announced that we will come to a clear result , " steinbrück said . " these are expectations that we have not set ourselves .
we have our medium-term objectives and i 'm sure that by the end of this presidency , we will have come further than where we are at the moment , " he said . the debate was a " process " which will continue " at least until the end of the german presidency " of the g8 . it was of secondary importance " whether we will come to a specific code of conduct by end of this year or in 2008 ... so long as we get there , " steinbrück said . just a prep meeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 summit will take place here in heiligendamm from june 3 to 9 , 2007 the finance ministers of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , the united states and russia were meeting in potsdam , just outside berlin , this weekend , to prepare for the bigger summit of government leaders in june . in addition to hedge funds , the ministers were to discuss a wide range of topics , from ways of strengthening financial market stability , supporting sound governance in africa . steinbrück , who has already acknowledged that agreement was unlikely before the wider g8 summit of government leaders in the plush seaside resort of heiligendamm in early june , said friday discussions had progressed since the topic was first discussed at a meeting of g7 -lrb- g8 minus russia -rrb- finance ministers in essen in february . he also suggested that the idea of self-regulation - where the funds themselves would implement the rules and make sure they were adhered to - had the support not only of governments and institutions such as the ecb but also within the banking sector and even the industry itself . " we 've struck a nerve " , he said .

the drug caused thousands of children to be born with severe disabilities . grünenthal pharmaceuticals had tried to get the tv movie banned , saying it was not a fair or truthful depiction of the tragic story .
but judges in hamburg ruled this week that it is clearly fiction rather than a documentary .
this means it is officially a work of art protected from censorship by the german constitution .
devastating side effects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the drug was given to pregnant women to treat morning sickness the film called “ contergan – just one tablet ” is now set to be aired on german public television in august .
contergan was the german name for the drug that was given to pregnant women to treat morning sickness in the 1950s and the early 1960s . the drug triggered the biggest pharmaceutical scandal in postwar germany after it later became clear that it caused severe damage to the limbs and internal organs of unborn foetuses .
dr. annette fusenig from grünenthal had criticized the film for failing to properly distinguish between fact and fiction .
" it ’ s a fictional film , and it does not give the truth , but on the other hand the film claims that is an historically based film , " she said .
" confusing " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hamburg court ruled it was clearly a work of fiction fusenig said she thought viewers would be confused and unable to judge what is based on fact and what is fiction .
the production company zeitsprung , however , always opposed these claims .
its managing director michael souviginier says that grünenthal has too low an opinion of the audience .
" the audience can differentiate between a feature film and a documentary , " said souvignier .
" and our film simply isn ’ t a documentary ; even a child could see that , " he added .
the court has asked the film company to make two small alterations before the work goes on air .
one scene will be deleted and also “ contergan : just one tablet ” will have to run with a disclaimer before and after , reiterating that it is a work of fiction .
victory for filmmakers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the manufacturers were involved in a lengthy trial over the drug souviginier welcomed the court 's decision .
" basically it is art that has won here , and the tradition of such films in gemany and around the world ; a tradition which has come out of this case unscathed , " he said .
for its part , grünenthal says it 's not campaigning to stop a film about thalidomide , or to avoid bad press .
but the company feels issues like compensation and general treatment of the victims are not fairly depicted in the film .

i am convinced that , among other topics , climate change , sustainable development , the fight against hunger and against social marginalization as well as financing development are among the issues on which the most important emerging countries need to be heard from more and more .

not only because their populations are the most affected in an increasing networked and interconnected world , but also because in our countries there are more innovative approaches to finding solutions to these challenges . i mean that the meetings taking place with the participation of the emerging countries will contribute to lending additional credibility and effectiveness on an international level to the g8 's endeavors .
for this reason , i make the case for the extended summit to become the core of a permanent forum where the developing and industrialized countries can transparently and representatively exchange their views on the issues that require a concentrated answer .
in this way we will make a decisive step toward true global governance .
this will enable the intensification of multilateral action to make globalization show more solidarity and become less asymmetrical . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 picture of the day dw-tv europe live journal - nachrichten mit tagesthema we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

africa 's leaders have failed to keep their part of the bargain - not just to the west about proper use of the aid funds , but to their own citizens in terms of human rights , accountable government and rule of law .
however much one empathizes with africa , the truth is that corruption and the absence of the rule of law are the biggest problem , not the lack of aid .
the solutions must come from africa itself .
what makes things difficult is that african rulers use the poverty of their citizens - more often than not , caused by them - as an excuse to ask for more aid .
africans like me are sick of the tired excuse that the west is to blame , the colonialists are to blame , or that by telling african leaders the blatant and sad truth they are being " racist . "

a guest commentary on dictatorships in the un also caught readers ' attention . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . is the g8 neglecting africa ? it is true that the g8 has made and not kept its promises to africa .
but there is another side to the coin .
africa 's leaders have failed to keep their part of the bargain - not just to the west about proper use of the aid funds , but to their own citizens in terms of human rights , accountable government and rule of law .
however much one empathizes with africa , the truth is that corruption and the absence of the rule of law are the biggest problem , not the lack of aid .
the solutions must come from africa itself .
what makes things difficult is that african rulers use the poverty of their citizens - more often than not , caused by them - as an excuse to ask for more aid .
africans like me are sick of the tired excuse that the west is to blame , the colonialists are to blame , or that by telling african leaders the blatant and sad truth they are being " racist . "
africa has been independent for far too long to use racism and colonial heritage as excuses for its woes .
for how long should they be potty-trained on democracy ? - lereko obonyo , kenya bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solutions must come from africa itself , wrote one readers i do not agree with bono and geldof that the g8 are neglecting our " responsibility " to africa .
they are neglecting the fact that government must extort money from us for their pet causes , whether we the people support the cause or not .
and what of the hypocrisy of bono moving his band 's business to a low-tax country to avoid exactly the extortion that he now demands of my government on me ?
neither man is certainly hurting for money . why are n't they living like common folk and giving the extra to africa themselves ? - jamie extract , us africa has not felt germany 's european leadership in terms of relief and development in africa .
i saw what tony blair has done about the debt cancellation in africa .
what did angel merkel sacrifice for the development of africa ?
a high-powered delegation including the german president visited my country , sierra leone .
since then i have not felt any impact .
please do something about this . - alusine s. kargbo , sierra-leone i agree with bono and bob geldof that g8 countries are neglecting commitments to africa . - dumitru florea , romania why does n't he just quit yapping ?
tell him to give some of the hundreds of millions of dollars he has made to these poor people .
my money belongs in my pocket .
it is sickening that i saw bono at ouest on the upper west side on mother 's day and he left half his food on his plate when the waiter came to clean up . - william , us a un of democracies and dictatorships ? i think the creation of a democratic caucus within the united nations would help solve the problem of the existence of dictatorships or other kinds of governments in the world , without leaving anyone out of the un .
promoting the cause of democracy is the best way to inculcate this kind of government in countries with no regard for human rights . - jose nigrin , israel a democracy caucus might be useful if the democracies would stick together , demand changes in the un charter , clean up the corruption and back it up with the combined position that they will withhold funding unless their requests are met .
the us should start by refusing any funding for the renovation of the un headquarters in new york and intimate that the un may be told to vacate the building and find a location in another country without us funding if it fails to meet the conditions of the democratic caucus . - max lester , us compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : united nations of democracies and dictatorships ?
the increasing role of non-democracies in key un bodies lead observers to wonder how the un can live up to its ideals .
the us and the eu should turn to the old-fashioned tools of diplomacy , argues thorsten benner .
-lrb- 17.05.2007 -rrb- rock stars urge g8 industrialized nations to deliver on africa aid irish rock stars bono and bob geldof on tuesday accused g8 nations of falling far behind on pledges of aid to africa and put pressure on germany as current head of the club to donate nearly one billion dollars .

the announcement came ahead of a meeting of the finance ministers from the group of eight countries on friday in potsdam , just outside of berlin .
wolfowitz said he would not be attending the conference , where he was scheduled to give a speech on corruption .

" any inappropriate regulation that could hurt free market mechanisms should be avoided , " japanese finance minister koji omi told journalists after bilateral talks with us deputy treasury secretary robert kimmitt .
" japan and the us agree on that . " omi 's comments will come as a blow to german finance minister peer steinbrück , host of a meeting of group of eight finance ministers this weekend , who is spearheading a campaign for a system of self-regulation for the industry . germany has repeatedly expressed concern over potential risks to financial stability from hedge funds , highly speculative and aggressive investment instruments .
and berlin has long campaigned for increased transparency and even regulation of the largely uncontrolled sector . but any such plans have consistently run up against fierce resistance , particularly in the us and britain , where most of the funds are based . moderate progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's finance minister peer steinbrück at a press briefing just before the g8 finance meeting officially got underway , steinbrück insisted that progress was being made . the minister , however , acknowledged that drawing up a blue-print for self-regulation of the industry would be a long process . " nobody has ever announced that we will come to a clear result , " steinbrück said . " these are expectations that we have not set ourselves .

complex talks require significant preparation if they are going to be dealt with efficiently in the time available .
i am the g8 sherpa to chancellor merkel , and there are sherpas to all the other leaders of members countries , whom i meet with regularly to work on summit drafts .
it 's not always easy , because all g8 members have to be in agreement .
i have to be in tune with what the interests of others are and work with them diplomatically to probe for a solution that also meets our aims .
i am used to working long hours , but i also find i can quite easily switch off on weekends and relax - when i have to the weekend off .
i will be happy if the summit comes off successfully .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 18.05.2007 nato probes cyber attacks on estonia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many estonian sites have been closed down nato is investigating the mass cyber attacks launched on estonian websites over the past three weeks .
it 's the first time , as far as is known , that there has been such an assault on a state . many government and corporate sites in the hi-tech baltic nation have been crippled for almost three weeks after being flooded with enormous amounts of traffic .
prime minister andrus ansip had claimed that some of the cyber-attacks , which forced the authorities in the tiny baltic state to temporarily shut down web sites , came from russian government computers , including the president 's office .
but tallinn has now backed away from such explicit accusations .
estonia 's defence minister jaak aaviksoo said there was a possibility of russian involvement in the attacks that involved at least one million computers .
the kremlin has dismissed the accusations , saying hackers could have used a false ip address to tarnish the russian authorities .
coincidence ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the relocation of a soviet war memorial has further soured relations between moscow and tallinn the start of the cyber-attacks coincide with the start of a row with the kremlin over the removal from central talinn of a post-world war ii memorial to soviet red army soldiers .
the nato spokesman remained vague on the question of russian involvement .
" it 's not that easy because of the nature of cyber space , " he said .
he added that " various indications " had been identified .
but he said that tracking and identifying the cyber attackers was not the primary goal of the investigations .
" our aim ultimately is protection . "
he told afp , " we do see it as serious because it was concerted .
it 's clearly not the sort of thing that two teenagers , for whatever their motives , do .
we are talking about a pretty well-organised thing . "
" this is a special case because of the scale of this attack .
so of course allies are going to help and we are not just treating this as an estonian problem , of course it is a problem for nato , " the spokesman added .

now the world bank has to repair its reputation as quickly as possible , said steinbrück , adding that the institution is " extremely important for the countries of the third world . "
following a conflict-of-interest scandal that became public six weeks ago , paul wolfowitz said late thursday evening from washington that his resignation was in the best interest of the world bank .
the announcement came ahead of a meeting of the finance ministers from the group of eight countries on friday in potsdam , just outside of berlin .
wolfowitz said he would not be attending the conference , where he was scheduled to give a speech on corruption .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now the world bank has a reputation to save , said steinbrück eckhard deutscher , germany 's representative on the 24-member board of the world bank , said on thursday wolfowitz 's failings ran deeper than the immediate cause of his resignation .
poor management style and lack of vision for the bank 's mission were among wolfowitz 's weaknesses , he told reporters in washington .
" i regret that paul wolfowitz personally suffered damage , but i regret the damage he cause the bank much more , " said deutscher .
us , europe divided shortly after taking on the world bank presidency in 2005 , wolfowitz arranged for a promotion and a $ 60,000 -lrb- 44,000 euro -rrb- pay raise for his girlfriend shaha riza , who was also working at the bank at that time .
riza later transferred to a position at the us state department , but continued receiving paychecks from the world bank .
the scandal had caused a transatlantic rift : germany , france and the netherlands have been particularly vocal in demanding wolfowitz 's resignation , while the us staunchly defended him .
the white house said president george w. bush would name a successor as soon as possible .
by tradition , the us appoints the head of the world bank , while europe selects a leader for its partner institution , the international monetary fund .
focusing on developing countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : developing countries are top of the agenda the debt crisis in developing countries will top the agenda at the two-day g8 finance ministers ' meeting in potsdam .
delegates from cameroon , ghana , nigeria and south africa have been invited to the talks .
steinbrück said that germany 's lawmakers will prioritize developmental aid as much as possible when forming the national budget for 2008 .
the finance conference , which serves as a precursor to the g8 meeting in early june , will also focus on achieving more transparency for companies with hedge funds , a german initiative that faces resistance in the us and britain . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany says wolfowitz not welcome at berlin meeting german development minister wieczorek-zeul wednesday stepped up pressure on disgraced world bank president paul wolfowitz to resign , saying he would not be welcome at a forum the bank is holding next week in berlin .

"
in a report of the same name , chancellor merkel has said what she means by " growth and responsibility : " to compete successfully in global markets . angela merkel also knows what globalization is : " the process of the globalization is a process of the liberalization " the government has defined the rules just like soccer : " plays are won on attack , not defense . "
the chancellor does n't see that this " game " leaves millions of people in crisis and poverty .
unlike globalization , soccer has clear rules .
if someone breaks the rules they are sent off the field .
in a world of global competition , the person who commits a nasty foul can , however , be very successful .

she is attending the g8 alternative summit in rostock . two years ago g8 leaders promised universal access to treatment and preventative care - two years on there has been very little action .
we are calling for a long-term funding plan so we do n't have to go begging , bowl in hand , at every annual meeting .
universal access by 2015 is a goal that deserves a budget . i think the credibility and legitimacy of g8 is in question .
it 's an ongoing debate .
they have invited other countries to join them , which is a sign of the times .
the g8 has been more aware of its lack of credibility , but also aware of protests and therefore has tended to hide itself away .
russian president vladimir putin met with action aid last year , which i think was a recognition that civil society is important . the g8 can lead by example .
unfortunately , so far it has tended to make cost free promises . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback what does the g8 mean to you ?

the bayern munich board of directors headed by franz beckenbauer has given their go ahead to plans to invest heavily in new players as the side finishes its most disappointing season in years . beckenbauer and the board of directors said this week that the club could go ahead with their secret plans to buy leading players to put together a side that can compete internationally .
" the club 's board put forward their ideas and named their players , and we were all of the opinion that this would be the right way to go forward to ensure that bayern once again become successful , " beckenbauer said .
" everybody knows that good players who are well-known internationally are not cheap , " german soccer 's kaiser added .
" we will have to invest a lot of money to have a strong team next year , to be able to compete at the highest level . "
bayern , for the first time in years , are not in the running for the bundesliga title and have been forced to settle with a uefa cup berth instead of a spot in the more prestigious champion league .
expensive undertaking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's fans are used to seeing them raise at least some kind of trophy every season although beckenbauer said nothing about the value of the investment , german media speculated that it could be between 76 million euros and 100 million euros -lrb- $ 103 million and $ 136 million -rrb- .
" it is clear that it will be expensive , but we are a football business and it must be our first priority to have a strong team , " said beckenbauer , who won the world cup both as a player and coach .

the 20-million-euro signing of world champion luca toni from florence also seems a done deal .
german internationals marcell jansen and miroslav klose are also on the wanted list , as is the transfer of ze roberto , who is rumored to be on the verge of returning to germany from brazil .

bayern are on the verge of selling english international owen hargreaves to manchester united .
kicker sports magazine reported monday that the two clubs had reached an agreement whereby the premiership champions will be paying 25 million euro plus a further amount determined by united 's results , for the midfielder , whose contract with bayern runs till 2010 .

complex talks require significant preparation if they are going to be dealt with efficiently in the time available .
i am the g8 sherpa to chancellor merkel , and there are sherpas to all the other leaders of members countries , whom i meet with regularly to work on summit drafts .
it 's not always easy , because all g8 members have to be in agreement .
i have to be in tune with what the interests of others are and work with them diplomatically to probe for a solution that also meets our aims .
i am used to working long hours , but i also find i can quite easily switch off on weekends and relax - when i have to the weekend off .
i will be happy if the summit comes off successfully .
if it does n't , it will be because of bad lack or because we did a bad job .

in previous years we have found that these summits might talk a lot about goodwill and aid , but in private it 's just " business as usual . "
two years ago in gleneagles they talked about the largest debt package in history .
we are only beginning to see some action on this now .
i expect them to give a similar brush-off to the public again this year .
on the other hand , i 'm optimistic about our activities .
i think that the g8 summit in heiligendamm will bring about a large social mobilization .
the activist networks and groups that are preparing to demonstrate at the summit range from the far left to the mainstream in their politics .
civil society cooperation is very strong and in recent years we have built a movement that is critical of globalization and questions the neo-liberal conviction that " there is no alternative " to globalization . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback what does the g8 mean to you ?

the drug caused thousands of children to be born with severe disabilities . grünenthal pharmaceuticals had tried to get the tv movie banned , saying it was not a fair or truthful depiction of the tragic story .

this means it is officially a work of art protected from censorship by the german constitution .
devastating side effects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the drug was given to pregnant women to treat morning sickness the film called “ contergan – just one tablet ” is now set to be aired on german public television in august .
contergan was the german name for the drug that was given to pregnant women to treat morning sickness in the 1950s and the early 1960s . the drug triggered the biggest pharmaceutical scandal in postwar germany after it later became clear that it caused severe damage to the limbs and internal organs of unborn foetuses .
dr. annette fusenig from grünenthal had criticized the film for failing to properly distinguish between fact and fiction .

its managing director michael souviginier says that grünenthal has too low an opinion of the audience .
" the audience can differentiate between a feature film and a documentary , " said souvignier .
" and our film simply isn ’ t a documentary ; even a child could see that , " he added .
the court has asked the film company to make two small alterations before the work goes on air .
one scene will be deleted and also “ contergan : just one tablet ” will have to run with a disclaimer before and after , reiterating that it is a work of fiction .

for its part , grünenthal says it 's not campaigning to stop a film about thalidomide , or to avoid bad press .

the drug caused thousands of children to be born with severe disabilities . grünenthal pharmaceuticals had tried to get the tv movie banned , saying it was not a fair or truthful depiction of the tragic story .
but judges in hamburg ruled this week that it is clearly fiction rather than a documentary .
this means it is officially a work of art protected from censorship by the german constitution .
devastating side effects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the drug was given to pregnant women to treat morning sickness the film called “ contergan – just one tablet ” is now set to be aired on german public television in august .
contergan was the german name for the drug that was given to pregnant women to treat morning sickness in the 1950s and the early 1960s . the drug triggered the biggest pharmaceutical scandal in postwar germany after it later became clear that it caused severe damage to the limbs and internal organs of unborn foetuses .
dr. annette fusenig from grünenthal had criticized the film for failing to properly distinguish between fact and fiction .
" it ’ s a fictional film , and it does not give the truth , but on the other hand the film claims that is an historically based film , " she said .
" confusing " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hamburg court ruled it was clearly a work of fiction fusenig said she thought viewers would be confused and unable to judge what is based on fact and what is fiction .
the production company zeitsprung , however , always opposed these claims .
its managing director michael souviginier says that grünenthal has too low an opinion of the audience .
" the audience can differentiate between a feature film and a documentary , " said souvignier .
" and our film simply isn ’ t a documentary ; even a child could see that , " he added .
the court has asked the film company to make two small alterations before the work goes on air .
one scene will be deleted and also “ contergan : just one tablet ” will have to run with a disclaimer before and after , reiterating that it is a work of fiction .
victory for filmmakers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the manufacturers were involved in a lengthy trial over the drug souviginier welcomed the court 's decision .
" basically it is art that has won here , and the tradition of such films in gemany and around the world ; a tradition which has come out of this case unscathed , " he said .
for its part , grünenthal says it 's not campaigning to stop a film about thalidomide , or to avoid bad press .
but the company feels issues like compensation and general treatment of the victims are not fairly depicted in the film .

in previous years we have found that these summits might talk a lot about goodwill and aid , but in private it 's just " business as usual . "
two years ago in gleneagles they talked about the largest debt package in history .
we are only beginning to see some action on this now .
i expect them to give a similar brush-off to the public again this year .
on the other hand , i 'm optimistic about our activities .
i think that the g8 summit in heiligendamm will bring about a large social mobilization .
the activist networks and groups that are preparing to demonstrate at the summit range from the far left to the mainstream in their politics .
civil society cooperation is very strong and in recent years we have built a movement that is critical of globalization and questions the neo-liberal conviction that " there is no alternative " to globalization . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback what does the g8 mean to you ?

a guest commentary on dictatorships in the un also caught readers ' attention . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . is the g8 neglecting africa ? it is true that the g8 has made and not kept its promises to africa .
but there is another side to the coin .
africa 's leaders have failed to keep their part of the bargain - not just to the west about proper use of the aid funds , but to their own citizens in terms of human rights , accountable government and rule of law .
however much one empathizes with africa , the truth is that corruption and the absence of the rule of law are the biggest problem , not the lack of aid .
the solutions must come from africa itself .
what makes things difficult is that african rulers use the poverty of their citizens - more often than not , caused by them - as an excuse to ask for more aid .
africans like me are sick of the tired excuse that the west is to blame , the colonialists are to blame , or that by telling african leaders the blatant and sad truth they are being " racist . "
africa has been independent for far too long to use racism and colonial heritage as excuses for its woes .
for how long should they be potty-trained on democracy ? - lereko obonyo , kenya bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solutions must come from africa itself , wrote one readers i do not agree with bono and geldof that the g8 are neglecting our " responsibility " to africa .
they are neglecting the fact that government must extort money from us for their pet causes , whether we the people support the cause or not .
and what of the hypocrisy of bono moving his band 's business to a low-tax country to avoid exactly the extortion that he now demands of my government on me ?
neither man is certainly hurting for money . why are n't they living like common folk and giving the extra to africa themselves ? - jamie extract , us africa has not felt germany 's european leadership in terms of relief and development in africa .
i saw what tony blair has done about the debt cancellation in africa .
what did angel merkel sacrifice for the development of africa ?
a high-powered delegation including the german president visited my country , sierra leone .
since then i have not felt any impact .
please do something about this . - alusine s. kargbo , sierra-leone i agree with bono and bob geldof that g8 countries are neglecting commitments to africa . - dumitru florea , romania why does n't he just quit yapping ?
tell him to give some of the hundreds of millions of dollars he has made to these poor people .
my money belongs in my pocket .
it is sickening that i saw bono at ouest on the upper west side on mother 's day and he left half his food on his plate when the waiter came to clean up . - william , us a un of democracies and dictatorships ? i think the creation of a democratic caucus within the united nations would help solve the problem of the existence of dictatorships or other kinds of governments in the world , without leaving anyone out of the un .
promoting the cause of democracy is the best way to inculcate this kind of government in countries with no regard for human rights . - jose nigrin , israel a democracy caucus might be useful if the democracies would stick together , demand changes in the un charter , clean up the corruption and back it up with the combined position that they will withhold funding unless their requests are met .
the us should start by refusing any funding for the renovation of the un headquarters in new york and intimate that the un may be told to vacate the building and find a location in another country without us funding if it fails to meet the conditions of the democratic caucus . - max lester , us compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : united nations of democracies and dictatorships ?
the increasing role of non-democracies in key un bodies lead observers to wonder how the un can live up to its ideals .
the us and the eu should turn to the old-fashioned tools of diplomacy , argues thorsten benner .
-lrb- 17.05.2007 -rrb- rock stars urge g8 industrialized nations to deliver on africa aid irish rock stars bono and bob geldof on tuesday accused g8 nations of falling far behind on pledges of aid to africa and put pressure on germany as current head of the club to donate nearly one billion dollars .

it is an economic paradigm that measures money flows but leaves out a lot , especially natural ecological flows . we are in a time when climate change and ecological crisis jeopardizes human life .
so there are some powerful contradictions that should be discussed at g8 summits , and up to this point they have n't really been discussed .
let 's talk about the future of the planet at the g8 . i think the g8 is undemocratic ; it 's a very powerful club of the ones who are steering the world economy .
they make sure the rich countries keep up an opulent way of life , and when it comes to africa and the third world and the environment those issues are pushed into the background . i think what needs to happen in g8 summits is not to tune in to what global economic leaders are telling us but to fundamentally question what the global economy is really all about . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback what does the g8 mean to you ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 18.05.2007 " both g8 and african leaders failed to keep their promises " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some readers said bono should pull out his own wallet readers commented this week on pleas made by rock stars bono and bob geldof for g8 nations to honor their pledges to africa .
a guest commentary on dictatorships in the un also caught readers ' attention . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . is the g8 neglecting africa ? it is true that the g8 has made and not kept its promises to africa .
but there is another side to the coin .
africa 's leaders have failed to keep their part of the bargain - not just to the west about proper use of the aid funds , but to their own citizens in terms of human rights , accountable government and rule of law .
however much one empathizes with africa , the truth is that corruption and the absence of the rule of law are the biggest problem , not the lack of aid .
the solutions must come from africa itself .
what makes things difficult is that african rulers use the poverty of their citizens - more often than not , caused by them - as an excuse to ask for more aid .
africans like me are sick of the tired excuse that the west is to blame , the colonialists are to blame , or that by telling african leaders the blatant and sad truth they are being " racist . "
africa has been independent for far too long to use racism and colonial heritage as excuses for its woes .
for how long should they be potty-trained on democracy ? - lereko obonyo , kenya bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solutions must come from africa itself , wrote one readers i do not agree with bono and geldof that the g8 are neglecting our " responsibility " to africa .
they are neglecting the fact that government must extort money from us for their pet causes , whether we the people support the cause or not .
and what of the hypocrisy of bono moving his band 's business to a low-tax country to avoid exactly the extortion that he now demands of my government on me ?
neither man is certainly hurting for money . why are n't they living like common folk and giving the extra to africa themselves ? - jamie extract , us africa has not felt germany 's european leadership in terms of relief and development in africa .
i saw what tony blair has done about the debt cancellation in africa .
what did angel merkel sacrifice for the development of africa ?
a high-powered delegation including the german president visited my country , sierra leone .
since then i have not felt any impact .
please do something about this . - alusine s. kargbo , sierra-leone i agree with bono and bob geldof that g8 countries are neglecting commitments to africa . - dumitru florea , romania why does n't he just quit yapping ?
tell him to give some of the hundreds of millions of dollars he has made to these poor people .
my money belongs in my pocket .
it is sickening that i saw bono at ouest on the upper west side on mother 's day and he left half his food on his plate when the waiter came to clean up . - william , us a un of democracies and dictatorships ? i think the creation of a democratic caucus within the united nations would help solve the problem of the existence of dictatorships or other kinds of governments in the world , without leaving anyone out of the un .
promoting the cause of democracy is the best way to inculcate this kind of government in countries with no regard for human rights . - jose nigrin , israel a democracy caucus might be useful if the democracies would stick together , demand changes in the un charter , clean up the corruption and back it up with the combined position that they will withhold funding unless their requests are met .
the us should start by refusing any funding for the renovation of the un headquarters in new york and intimate that the un may be told to vacate the building and find a location in another country without us funding if it fails to meet the conditions of the democratic caucus . - max lester , us compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : united nations of democracies and dictatorships ?
the increasing role of non-democracies in key un bodies lead observers to wonder how the un can live up to its ideals .
the us and the eu should turn to the old-fashioned tools of diplomacy , argues thorsten benner .
-lrb- 17.05.2007 -rrb- rock stars urge g8 industrialized nations to deliver on africa aid irish rock stars bono and bob geldof on tuesday accused g8 nations of falling far behind on pledges of aid to africa and put pressure on germany as current head of the club to donate nearly one billion dollars .

it 's the first time , as far as is known , that there has been such an assault on a state . many government and corporate sites in the hi-tech baltic nation have been crippled for almost three weeks after being flooded with enormous amounts of traffic .
prime minister andrus ansip had claimed that some of the cyber-attacks , which forced the authorities in the tiny baltic state to temporarily shut down web sites , came from russian government computers , including the president 's office .
but tallinn has now backed away from such explicit accusations .
estonia 's defence minister jaak aaviksoo said there was a possibility of russian involvement in the attacks that involved at least one million computers .
the kremlin has dismissed the accusations , saying hackers could have used a false ip address to tarnish the russian authorities .

the nato spokesman remained vague on the question of russian involvement .
" it 's not that easy because of the nature of cyber space , " he said .

it is an economic paradigm that measures money flows but leaves out a lot , especially natural ecological flows . we are in a time when climate change and ecological crisis jeopardizes human life .
so there are some powerful contradictions that should be discussed at g8 summits , and up to this point they have n't really been discussed .
let 's talk about the future of the planet at the g8 . i think the g8 is undemocratic ; it 's a very powerful club of the ones who are steering the world economy .
they make sure the rich countries keep up an opulent way of life , and when it comes to africa and the third world and the environment those issues are pushed into the background . i think what needs to happen in g8 summits is not to tune in to what global economic leaders are telling us but to fundamentally question what the global economy is really all about . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback what does the g8 mean to you ?

it 's the first time , as far as is known , that there has been such an assault on a state . many government and corporate sites in the hi-tech baltic nation have been crippled for almost three weeks after being flooded with enormous amounts of traffic .
prime minister andrus ansip had claimed that some of the cyber-attacks , which forced the authorities in the tiny baltic state to temporarily shut down web sites , came from russian government computers , including the president 's office .
but tallinn has now backed away from such explicit accusations .
estonia 's defence minister jaak aaviksoo said there was a possibility of russian involvement in the attacks that involved at least one million computers .
the kremlin has dismissed the accusations , saying hackers could have used a false ip address to tarnish the russian authorities .
coincidence ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the relocation of a soviet war memorial has further soured relations between moscow and tallinn the start of the cyber-attacks coincide with the start of a row with the kremlin over the removal from central talinn of a post-world war ii memorial to soviet red army soldiers .
the nato spokesman remained vague on the question of russian involvement .
" it 's not that easy because of the nature of cyber space , " he said .
he added that " various indications " had been identified .
but he said that tracking and identifying the cyber attackers was not the primary goal of the investigations .
" our aim ultimately is protection . "
he told afp , " we do see it as serious because it was concerted .
it 's clearly not the sort of thing that two teenagers , for whatever their motives , do .
we are talking about a pretty well-organised thing . "
" this is a special case because of the scale of this attack .
so of course allies are going to help and we are not just treating this as an estonian problem , of course it is a problem for nato , " the spokesman added .
growing threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spread of technology is set to increase the threat of cyber attack at present , nato does not define cyber attacks as clear military action .
this means the provisions of collective self-defence would not apply to the attacked country .
us deputy secretary of state john negroponte told a number of leading european newspapers on friday that cyber attacks were likely to become more of an issue in the future .
a common method of achieving such attacks is by hijacking computers belonging to normal web surfers using a virus or other malware picked up from an infected e-mail attachment or by visiting a website that hosts such malware .
estonia , which has a large russia minority , is a pioneer in the development of e-government and a very wired society .

i am convinced that , among other topics , climate change , sustainable development , the fight against hunger and against social marginalization as well as financing development are among the issues on which the most important emerging countries need to be heard from more and more .
not only because their populations are the most affected in an increasing networked and interconnected world , but also because in our countries there are more innovative approaches to finding solutions to these challenges . i mean that the meetings taking place with the participation of the emerging countries will contribute to lending additional credibility and effectiveness on an international level to the g8 's endeavors .
for this reason , i make the case for the extended summit to become the core of a permanent forum where the developing and industrialized countries can transparently and representatively exchange their views on the issues that require a concentrated answer .
in this way we will make a decisive step toward true global governance .
this will enable the intensification of multilateral action to make globalization show more solidarity and become less asymmetrical . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback do you think g8 members listen closely enough to the views of the developing world ?

i am convinced that , among other topics , climate change , sustainable development , the fight against hunger and against social marginalization as well as financing development are among the issues on which the most important emerging countries need to be heard from more and more .
not only because their populations are the most affected in an increasing networked and interconnected world , but also because in our countries there are more innovative approaches to finding solutions to these challenges . i mean that the meetings taking place with the participation of the emerging countries will contribute to lending additional credibility and effectiveness on an international level to the g8 's endeavors .
for this reason , i make the case for the extended summit to become the core of a permanent forum where the developing and industrialized countries can transparently and representatively exchange their views on the issues that require a concentrated answer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 18.05.2007 nato probes cyber attacks on estonia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many estonian sites have been closed down nato is investigating the mass cyber attacks launched on estonian websites over the past three weeks .
it 's the first time , as far as is known , that there has been such an assault on a state . many government and corporate sites in the hi-tech baltic nation have been crippled for almost three weeks after being flooded with enormous amounts of traffic .
prime minister andrus ansip had claimed that some of the cyber-attacks , which forced the authorities in the tiny baltic state to temporarily shut down web sites , came from russian government computers , including the president 's office .
but tallinn has now backed away from such explicit accusations .
estonia 's defence minister jaak aaviksoo said there was a possibility of russian involvement in the attacks that involved at least one million computers .
the kremlin has dismissed the accusations , saying hackers could have used a false ip address to tarnish the russian authorities .
coincidence ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the relocation of a soviet war memorial has further soured relations between moscow and tallinn the start of the cyber-attacks coincide with the start of a row with the kremlin over the removal from central talinn of a post-world war ii memorial to soviet red army soldiers .
the nato spokesman remained vague on the question of russian involvement .
" it 's not that easy because of the nature of cyber space , " he said .
he added that " various indications " had been identified .
but he said that tracking and identifying the cyber attackers was not the primary goal of the investigations .
" our aim ultimately is protection . "
he told afp , " we do see it as serious because it was concerted .
it 's clearly not the sort of thing that two teenagers , for whatever their motives , do .
we are talking about a pretty well-organised thing . "
" this is a special case because of the scale of this attack .
so of course allies are going to help and we are not just treating this as an estonian problem , of course it is a problem for nato , " the spokesman added .
growing threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spread of technology is set to increase the threat of cyber attack at present , nato does not define cyber attacks as clear military action .
this means the provisions of collective self-defence would not apply to the attacked country .
us deputy secretary of state john negroponte told a number of leading european newspapers on friday that cyber attacks were likely to become more of an issue in the future .
a common method of achieving such attacks is by hijacking computers belonging to normal web surfers using a virus or other malware picked up from an infected e-mail attachment or by visiting a website that hosts such malware .
estonia , which has a large russia minority , is a pioneer in the development of e-government and a very wired society .
this also makes it very vulnerable to cyber attacks . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : germany intervened in russia-estonia dispute germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier practiced some behind-the-scenes realpolitik this week to sooth russian-estonian tensions over the removal of a momument in tallinn , according to a german news report .

neither man is certainly hurting for money . why are n't they living like common folk and giving the extra to africa themselves ? - jamie extract , us africa has not felt germany 's european leadership in terms of relief and development in africa .
i saw what tony blair has done about the debt cancellation in africa .
what did angel merkel sacrifice for the development of africa ?
a high-powered delegation including the german president visited my country , sierra leone .
since then i have not felt any impact .
please do something about this . - alusine s. kargbo , sierra-leone i agree with bono and bob geldof that g8 countries are neglecting commitments to africa . - dumitru florea , romania why does n't he just quit yapping ?
tell him to give some of the hundreds of millions of dollars he has made to these poor people .
my money belongs in my pocket .
it is sickening that i saw bono at ouest on the upper west side on mother 's day and he left half his food on his plate when the waiter came to clean up . - william , us a un of democracies and dictatorships ? i think the creation of a democratic caucus within the united nations would help solve the problem of the existence of dictatorships or other kinds of governments in the world , without leaving anyone out of the un .
promoting the cause of democracy is the best way to inculcate this kind of government in countries with no regard for human rights . - jose nigrin , israel a democracy caucus might be useful if the democracies would stick together , demand changes in the un charter , clean up the corruption and back it up with the combined position that they will withhold funding unless their requests are met .
the us should start by refusing any funding for the renovation of the un headquarters in new york and intimate that the un may be told to vacate the building and find a location in another country without us funding if it fails to meet the conditions of the democratic caucus . - max lester , us compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : united nations of democracies and dictatorships ?
the increasing role of non-democracies in key un bodies lead observers to wonder how the un can live up to its ideals .
the us and the eu should turn to the old-fashioned tools of diplomacy , argues thorsten benner .
-lrb- 17.05.2007 -rrb- rock stars urge g8 industrialized nations to deliver on africa aid irish rock stars bono and bob geldof on tuesday accused g8 nations of falling far behind on pledges of aid to africa and put pressure on germany as current head of the club to donate nearly one billion dollars .

" i hope that they will be able to express their opinion , " merkel told a joint news conference at the end of the two-day summit at which eu leaders discussed the state of democracy and human rights .
" i 'm somewhat concerned that people had difficulties getting here , but perhaps a possible demonstration can still take place , " merkel said . " if demonstrators throw stones , if they smash windows , then of course they should be curbed .
but if someone has done nothing , if they just want to go to a demonstration , then it 's different , " merkel said . russian president putin testily defended " preventive measures " taken by russian police ahead of the rally , comparing these to common practice in european countries . expressing assurances that the opposition 's right to protest would be respected , putin countered that german authorities have not ruled out using preventative detention in the run-up to next month 's group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in the german resort of heiligendamm . " we will not however point the finger at others , " the russian leader said . in hamburg alone , german police resorted to water canons and truncheons last week in clashes with some 2,000 activists demonstrating against the upcoming g8 summit on the baltic coast . boarding hindered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chess champion and opposition leader garry kasparov was stopped from flying kasparov 's other russia movement had planned an anti-kremlin protest to coincide with the tense meeting between russian president vladimir putin , chancellor merkel , the current holder of the european union 's six-month rotating presidency , and european commission president jose manuel barroso . the former chess champion had been scheduled to fly to the volga river city which is 70 kilometers -lrb- 43 miles -rrb- from the summit venue of volzhsky utyos .
" not one member of the other russia delegation was allowed to board , " denis bilunov , a spokeman for kasparov , told afp .
the leader of the radical national bolshevik movement , eduard limonov , was also stranded at the russian capital 's sheremetyevo airport , as were a number of journalists .

a presidential spokesman denied the kremlin was involved in the incident and said he did not expect the incident to be discussed at the summit .
" i do n't think the issue of the non-arrival of a russian citizen , even a famous one will be on the summit agenda , " said dmitry pescov .
" i can not comment on behalf of the police .

still , participants said " constructive " discussions had taken place at the summit in volzhsky utyos -lrb- volga cliff -rrb- , a picturesque resort complex some 1,000 kilometres -lrb- 620 miles -rrb- south of moscow .
putin and eu leaders discussed setting up an alert mechanism for increasingly vital russian energy supplies to europe following a request from merkel after recent gas and oil cut-offs from russia .
putin told barroso and merkel over dinner on thursday that supply agreements he signed this month with the central asian states of kazakhstan and turkmenistan would benefit europe .
talks touched on russia 's bid to join the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- , which is being dogged by trade tariff disputes with brussels , and the future status of the serbian province of kosovo .
" russia ca n't tango on its own " but the overall impression was one of deep discord between the two sides .
" we found many problems during the summit .
we have not always managed to convince each other but i think it 's always better to speak to each other than to speak about each other , " merkel said .
negotiations over a partnership agreement between the eu and russia , including in the sensitive energy sphere , are being blocked by eu member poland because of a trade dispute with moscow . the current agreement runs out this year and can be extended , but eu officials said that failure to start negotiations would be an embarrassment for both sides .

putin responded that the eu should first solve its " internal problems , " and kremlin officials said that russia had already made sufficient concessions to poland and was waiting for a response .
" russia ca n't tango on its own , " said dmitry peskov , a kremlin spokesman .
the eu 's external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner ascribed some of the frostiness in relations to upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections in russia .

" i hope that they will be able to express their opinion , " merkel told a joint news conference at the end of the two-day summit at which eu leaders discussed the state of democracy and human rights .
" i 'm somewhat concerned that people had difficulties getting here , but perhaps a possible demonstration can still take place , " merkel said . " if demonstrators throw stones , if they smash windows , then of course they should be curbed .

a presidential spokesman denied the kremlin was involved in the incident and said he did not expect the incident to be discussed at the summit .

some " constructive " discussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow 's ban on polish meat imports is one point of dispute meanwhile , russian and european leaders vowed to hold frank discussions about all areas of dispute .

chancellor merkel said she hoped for firm solutions to the problems between the eu and russia .
" i hope that we can take concrete steps where there are snags and hitches . "
still , participants said " constructive " discussions had taken place at the summit in volzhsky utyos -lrb- volga cliff -rrb- , a picturesque resort complex some 1,000 kilometres -lrb- 620 miles -rrb- south of moscow .
putin and eu leaders discussed setting up an alert mechanism for increasingly vital russian energy supplies to europe following a request from merkel after recent gas and oil cut-offs from russia .
putin told barroso and merkel over dinner on thursday that supply agreements he signed this month with the central asian states of kazakhstan and turkmenistan would benefit europe .
talks touched on russia 's bid to join the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- , which is being dogged by trade tariff disputes with brussels , and the future status of the serbian province of kosovo .
" russia ca n't tango on its own " but the overall impression was one of deep discord between the two sides .
" we found many problems during the summit .
we have not always managed to convince each other but i think it 's always better to speak to each other than to speak about each other , " merkel said .
negotiations over a partnership agreement between the eu and russia , including in the sensitive energy sphere , are being blocked by eu member poland because of a trade dispute with moscow . the current agreement runs out this year and can be extended , but eu officials said that failure to start negotiations would be an embarrassment for both sides .

" i hope that they will be able to express their opinion , " merkel told a joint news conference at the end of the two-day summit at which eu leaders discussed the state of democracy and human rights .
" i 'm somewhat concerned that people had difficulties getting here , but perhaps a possible demonstration can still take place , " merkel said . " if demonstrators throw stones , if they smash windows , then of course they should be curbed .
but if someone has done nothing , if they just want to go to a demonstration , then it 's different , " merkel said . russian president putin testily defended " preventive measures " taken by russian police ahead of the rally , comparing these to common practice in european countries . expressing assurances that the opposition 's right to protest would be respected , putin countered that german authorities have not ruled out using preventative detention in the run-up to next month 's group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in the german resort of heiligendamm . " we will not however point the finger at others , " the russian leader said . in hamburg alone , german police resorted to water canons and truncheons last week in clashes with some 2,000 activists demonstrating against the upcoming g8 summit on the baltic coast . boarding hindered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chess champion and opposition leader garry kasparov was stopped from flying kasparov 's other russia movement had planned an anti-kremlin protest to coincide with the tense meeting between russian president vladimir putin , chancellor merkel , the current holder of the european union 's six-month rotating presidency , and european commission president jose manuel barroso . the former chess champion had been scheduled to fly to the volga river city which is 70 kilometers -lrb- 43 miles -rrb- from the summit venue of volzhsky utyos .
" not one member of the other russia delegation was allowed to board , " denis bilunov , a spokeman for kasparov , told afp .
the leader of the radical national bolshevik movement , eduard limonov , was also stranded at the russian capital 's sheremetyevo airport , as were a number of journalists .
wall street journal correspondent alan cullison said police had told them that there was a problem with the tickets .
passports confiscated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : summit leaders have pledged to have an open dialogue about a number of thorny issues a representative of a human rights organization had his passport confiscated .
" we 're at sheremetyevo airport and uniformed men have taken our passports .
they 've taken 13 passports .
i consider this a criminal offence , " said lev ponomaryov of the for human rights organization .
" they told us at the check-in that our tickets had been rejected by the computer as they had been sold -lrb- to other passengers -rrb- .
but some journalists who were allowed to board told us the plane was half empty . "
a presidential spokesman denied the kremlin was involved in the incident and said he did not expect the incident to be discussed at the summit .
" i do n't think the issue of the non-arrival of a russian citizen , even a famous one will be on the summit agenda , " said dmitry pescov .
" i can not comment on behalf of the police .
the kremlin was not in sheremetyevo . "
some " constructive " discussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow 's ban on polish meat imports is one point of dispute meanwhile , russian and european leaders vowed to hold frank discussions about all areas of dispute .
president putin said : " we are ready for an open and honest dialogue without any taboo subjects . "
chancellor merkel said she hoped for firm solutions to the problems between the eu and russia .
" i hope that we can take concrete steps where there are snags and hitches . "
still , participants said " constructive " discussions had taken place at the summit in volzhsky utyos -lrb- volga cliff -rrb- , a picturesque resort complex some 1,000 kilometres -lrb- 620 miles -rrb- south of moscow .
putin and eu leaders discussed setting up an alert mechanism for increasingly vital russian energy supplies to europe following a request from merkel after recent gas and oil cut-offs from russia .
putin told barroso and merkel over dinner on thursday that supply agreements he signed this month with the central asian states of kazakhstan and turkmenistan would benefit europe .
talks touched on russia 's bid to join the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- , which is being dogged by trade tariff disputes with brussels , and the future status of the serbian province of kosovo .
" russia ca n't tango on its own " but the overall impression was one of deep discord between the two sides .
" we found many problems during the summit .
we have not always managed to convince each other but i think it 's always better to speak to each other than to speak about each other , " merkel said .
negotiations over a partnership agreement between the eu and russia , including in the sensitive energy sphere , are being blocked by eu member poland because of a trade dispute with moscow . the current agreement runs out this year and can be extended , but eu officials said that failure to start negotiations would be an embarrassment for both sides .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso , left , and merkel with putin in samara barroso on friday reiterated the eu 's position that there was " no basis " for russia to maintain a ban on polish meat imports , the source of the dispute .
russia imposed the ban last year , citing food safety concerns .
putin responded that the eu should first solve its " internal problems , " and kremlin officials said that russia had already made sufficient concessions to poland and was waiting for a response .
" russia ca n't tango on its own , " said dmitry peskov , a kremlin spokesman .
the eu 's external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner ascribed some of the frostiness in relations to upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections in russia .
" russia is in a pre-election period so maybe nationalistic feelings are coming up .
but at the same time there are questions that have to be solved in a constructive spirit , " she told reporters . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu-russia talks open amid tensions , divisions an eu-russia summit meant to strengthen ties instead opened amid simmering tensions sparked by a long list of disputes that have fueled antagonism between moscow and its western neighbors .

the bayern munich board of directors headed by franz beckenbauer has given their go ahead to plans to invest heavily in new players as the side finishes its most disappointing season in years . beckenbauer and the board of directors said this week that the club could go ahead with their secret plans to buy leading players to put together a side that can compete internationally .
" the club 's board put forward their ideas and named their players , and we were all of the opinion that this would be the right way to go forward to ensure that bayern once again become successful , " beckenbauer said .
" everybody knows that good players who are well-known internationally are not cheap , " german soccer 's kaiser added .
" we will have to invest a lot of money to have a strong team next year , to be able to compete at the highest level . "
bayern , for the first time in years , are not in the running for the bundesliga title and have been forced to settle with a uefa cup berth instead of a spot in the more prestigious champion league .
expensive undertaking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's fans are used to seeing them raise at least some kind of trophy every season although beckenbauer said nothing about the value of the investment , german media speculated that it could be between 76 million euros and 100 million euros -lrb- $ 103 million and $ 136 million -rrb- .
" it is clear that it will be expensive , but we are a football business and it must be our first priority to have a strong team , " said beckenbauer , who won the world cup both as a player and coach .
new names were not leaked to the press , but bayern have already announced that they will be buying hamit altintop -lrb- schalke 04 -rrb- , jan schlaudraff -lrb- alemannia aachen -rrb- and argentine jose ernesto sosa -lrb- estudiantes de la plata -rrb- .
the 20-million-euro signing of world champion luca toni from florence also seems a done deal .
german internationals marcell jansen and miroslav klose are also on the wanted list , as is the transfer of ze roberto , who is rumored to be on the verge of returning to germany from brazil .
bayern manager uli hoeness said a short while ago , that bayern has always managed to secure the players they wanted .
he said that the club would be investing money " like never before . "

by then the names of the players who will be leaving the club should also be known .
bayern are on the verge of selling english international owen hargreaves to manchester united .
kicker sports magazine reported monday that the two clubs had reached an agreement whereby the premiership champions will be paying 25 million euro plus a further amount determined by united 's results , for the midfielder , whose contract with bayern runs till 2010 .
paraguayan international roque santa cruz has also announced that he intends to leave the club .

poor management style and lack of vision for the bank 's mission were among wolfowitz 's weaknesses , he told reporters in washington .
" i regret that paul wolfowitz personally suffered damage , but i regret the damage he cause the bank much more , " said deutscher .

" any inappropriate regulation that could hurt free market mechanisms should be avoided , " japanese finance minister koji omi told journalists after bilateral talks with us deputy treasury secretary robert kimmitt .
" japan and the us agree on that . " omi 's comments will come as a blow to german finance minister peer steinbrück , host of a meeting of group of eight finance ministers this weekend , who is spearheading a campaign for a system of self-regulation for the industry . germany has repeatedly expressed concern over potential risks to financial stability from hedge funds , highly speculative and aggressive investment instruments .
and berlin has long campaigned for increased transparency and even regulation of the largely uncontrolled sector . but any such plans have consistently run up against fierce resistance , particularly in the us and britain , where most of the funds are based . moderate progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's finance minister peer steinbrück at a press briefing just before the g8 finance meeting officially got underway , steinbrück insisted that progress was being made . the minister , however , acknowledged that drawing up a blue-print for self-regulation of the industry would be a long process . " nobody has ever announced that we will come to a clear result , " steinbrück said . " these are expectations that we have not set ourselves .
we have our medium-term objectives and i 'm sure that by the end of this presidency , we will have come further than where we are at the moment , " he said . the debate was a " process " which will continue " at least until the end of the german presidency " of the g8 . it was of secondary importance " whether we will come to a specific code of conduct by end of this year or in 2008 ... so long as we get there , " steinbrück said . just a prep meeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 summit will take place here in heiligendamm from june 3 to 9 , 2007 the finance ministers of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , the united states and russia were meeting in potsdam , just outside berlin , this weekend , to prepare for the bigger summit of government leaders in june . in addition to hedge funds , the ministers were to discuss a wide range of topics , from ways of strengthening financial market stability , supporting sound governance in africa . steinbrück , who has already acknowledged that agreement was unlikely before the wider g8 summit of government leaders in the plush seaside resort of heiligendamm in early june , said friday discussions had progressed since the topic was first discussed at a meeting of g7 -lrb- g8 minus russia -rrb- finance ministers in essen in february . he also suggested that the idea of self-regulation - where the funds themselves would implement the rules and make sure they were adhered to - had the support not only of governments and institutions such as the ecb but also within the banking sector and even the industry itself . " we 've struck a nerve " , he said .

"
in a report of the same name , chancellor merkel has said what she means by " growth and responsibility : " to compete successfully in global markets . angela merkel also knows what globalization is : " the process of the globalization is a process of the liberalization " the government has defined the rules just like soccer : " plays are won on attack , not defense . "
the chancellor does n't see that this " game " leaves millions of people in crisis and poverty .
unlike globalization , soccer has clear rules .
if someone breaks the rules they are sent off the field .
in a world of global competition , the person who commits a nasty foul can , however , be very successful .
german wage repression and the national success as a world exporter are prime examples of this .
that more and more people are protesting against this and demanding social justice is a positive sign .
that state and government leaders keep putting up higher and higher fences topped with barbed wire to keep them out is a negative one . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback what does the g8 mean to you ?

a guest commentary on dictatorships in the un also caught readers ' attention . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . is the g8 neglecting africa ? it is true that the g8 has made and not kept its promises to africa .
but there is another side to the coin .
africa 's leaders have failed to keep their part of the bargain - not just to the west about proper use of the aid funds , but to their own citizens in terms of human rights , accountable government and rule of law .
however much one empathizes with africa , the truth is that corruption and the absence of the rule of law are the biggest problem , not the lack of aid .
the solutions must come from africa itself .
what makes things difficult is that african rulers use the poverty of their citizens - more often than not , caused by them - as an excuse to ask for more aid .
africans like me are sick of the tired excuse that the west is to blame , the colonialists are to blame , or that by telling african leaders the blatant and sad truth they are being " racist . "
africa has been independent for far too long to use racism and colonial heritage as excuses for its woes .
for how long should they be potty-trained on democracy ? - lereko obonyo , kenya bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solutions must come from africa itself , wrote one readers i do not agree with bono and geldof that the g8 are neglecting our " responsibility " to africa .
they are neglecting the fact that government must extort money from us for their pet causes , whether we the people support the cause or not .
and what of the hypocrisy of bono moving his band 's business to a low-tax country to avoid exactly the extortion that he now demands of my government on me ?
neither man is certainly hurting for money . why are n't they living like common folk and giving the extra to africa themselves ? - jamie extract , us africa has not felt germany 's european leadership in terms of relief and development in africa .
i saw what tony blair has done about the debt cancellation in africa .
what did angel merkel sacrifice for the development of africa ?
a high-powered delegation including the german president visited my country , sierra leone .
since then i have not felt any impact .
please do something about this . - alusine s. kargbo , sierra-leone i agree with bono and bob geldof that g8 countries are neglecting commitments to africa . - dumitru florea , romania why does n't he just quit yapping ?
tell him to give some of the hundreds of millions of dollars he has made to these poor people .
my money belongs in my pocket .
it is sickening that i saw bono at ouest on the upper west side on mother 's day and he left half his food on his plate when the waiter came to clean up . - william , us a un of democracies and dictatorships ? i think the creation of a democratic caucus within the united nations would help solve the problem of the existence of dictatorships or other kinds of governments in the world , without leaving anyone out of the un .
promoting the cause of democracy is the best way to inculcate this kind of government in countries with no regard for human rights . - jose nigrin , israel a democracy caucus might be useful if the democracies would stick together , demand changes in the un charter , clean up the corruption and back it up with the combined position that they will withhold funding unless their requests are met .
the us should start by refusing any funding for the renovation of the un headquarters in new york and intimate that the un may be told to vacate the building and find a location in another country without us funding if it fails to meet the conditions of the democratic caucus . - max lester , us compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : united nations of democracies and dictatorships ?
the increasing role of non-democracies in key un bodies lead observers to wonder how the un can live up to its ideals .
the us and the eu should turn to the old-fashioned tools of diplomacy , argues thorsten benner .
-lrb- 17.05.2007 -rrb- rock stars urge g8 industrialized nations to deliver on africa aid irish rock stars bono and bob geldof on tuesday accused g8 nations of falling far behind on pledges of aid to africa and put pressure on germany as current head of the club to donate nearly one billion dollars .

africa 's leaders have failed to keep their part of the bargain - not just to the west about proper use of the aid funds , but to their own citizens in terms of human rights , accountable government and rule of law .
however much one empathizes with africa , the truth is that corruption and the absence of the rule of law are the biggest problem , not the lack of aid .

he has signed a petition for the counter demonstration in rostock . i answered to the call to join the demonstration against the g8 summit in heiligendamm because of something goethe once wrote : " sometimes you have to speak your opinions , so that others will eventually speak theirs . "
i have become involved in campaigning for alternative globalization , because i believe that the g8 countries are the biggest polluters and war-makers in the world , since they manufacturer many of weapons used in war today . i think that artists have to stand up publicly in these protests , because art is connected to life and life is connected to politics .
art can also be depoliticized .
unfortunately in europe there is a certain amount of self censorship .
artists do n't speak out about politics because they think they wo n't get work it they do .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 18.05.2007 nato probes cyber attacks on estonia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many estonian sites have been closed down nato is investigating the mass cyber attacks launched on estonian websites over the past three weeks .
it 's the first time , as far as is known , that there has been such an assault on a state . many government and corporate sites in the hi-tech baltic nation have been crippled for almost three weeks after being flooded with enormous amounts of traffic .
prime minister andrus ansip had claimed that some of the cyber-attacks , which forced the authorities in the tiny baltic state to temporarily shut down web sites , came from russian government computers , including the president 's office .
but tallinn has now backed away from such explicit accusations .
estonia 's defence minister jaak aaviksoo said there was a possibility of russian involvement in the attacks that involved at least one million computers .
the kremlin has dismissed the accusations , saying hackers could have used a false ip address to tarnish the russian authorities .
coincidence ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the relocation of a soviet war memorial has further soured relations between moscow and tallinn the start of the cyber-attacks coincide with the start of a row with the kremlin over the removal from central talinn of a post-world war ii memorial to soviet red army soldiers .
the nato spokesman remained vague on the question of russian involvement .
" it 's not that easy because of the nature of cyber space , " he said .
he added that " various indications " had been identified .
but he said that tracking and identifying the cyber attackers was not the primary goal of the investigations .
" our aim ultimately is protection . "
he told afp , " we do see it as serious because it was concerted .
it 's clearly not the sort of thing that two teenagers , for whatever their motives , do .
we are talking about a pretty well-organised thing . "
" this is a special case because of the scale of this attack .
so of course allies are going to help and we are not just treating this as an estonian problem , of course it is a problem for nato , " the spokesman added .
growing threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spread of technology is set to increase the threat of cyber attack at present , nato does not define cyber attacks as clear military action .
this means the provisions of collective self-defence would not apply to the attacked country .
us deputy secretary of state john negroponte told a number of leading european newspapers on friday that cyber attacks were likely to become more of an issue in the future .
a common method of achieving such attacks is by hijacking computers belonging to normal web surfers using a virus or other malware picked up from an infected e-mail attachment or by visiting a website that hosts such malware .
estonia , which has a large russia minority , is a pioneer in the development of e-government and a very wired society .
this also makes it very vulnerable to cyber attacks . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report : germany intervened in russia-estonia dispute germany 's foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier practiced some behind-the-scenes realpolitik this week to sooth russian-estonian tensions over the removal of a momument in tallinn , according to a german news report .

she is attending the g8 alternative summit in rostock . two years ago g8 leaders promised universal access to treatment and preventative care - two years on there has been very little action .
we are calling for a long-term funding plan so we do n't have to go begging , bowl in hand , at every annual meeting .
universal access by 2015 is a goal that deserves a budget . i think the credibility and legitimacy of g8 is in question .
it 's an ongoing debate .
they have invited other countries to join them , which is a sign of the times .
the g8 has been more aware of its lack of credibility , but also aware of protests and therefore has tended to hide itself away .
russian president vladimir putin met with action aid last year , which i think was a recognition that civil society is important . the g8 can lead by example .
unfortunately , so far it has tended to make cost free promises . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback what does the g8 mean to you ?

like so many international institutions , it 's an undemocratic , non-transparent and unaccountable entity used to maintain the economic privilege enjoyed by a small minority in the g8 nations at the expense of the majority of the world living in the southern countries . the g8 was established to address crises facing the system of international capitalism .
if we are going to meaningfully address the threat of climate change , then we have to move away from a global economy based on perpetual economic growth , based on increasing extraction and consumption of fossil fuels .
this model of economic status quo perpetuated by the g8 is the fundamental obstacle in our transition to a low-carbon economy . the free-market response promoted by the g8 in the form of the global carbon market is a false solution , operating on the principle of " polluter profits " rather than " polluter pays . "
we need to push for a system where countries make their emissions reductions at the source rather than expecting southern countries to do it on their behalf . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback what does the g8 mean to you ?

complex talks require significant preparation if they are going to be dealt with efficiently in the time available .
i am the g8 sherpa to chancellor merkel , and there are sherpas to all the other leaders of members countries , whom i meet with regularly to work on summit drafts .
it 's not always easy , because all g8 members have to be in agreement .
i have to be in tune with what the interests of others are and work with them diplomatically to probe for a solution that also meets our aims .
i am used to working long hours , but i also find i can quite easily switch off on weekends and relax - when i have to the weekend off .
i will be happy if the summit comes off successfully .
if it does n't , it will be because of bad lack or because we did a bad job .

it 's the first time , as far as is known , that there has been such an assault on a state . many government and corporate sites in the hi-tech baltic nation have been crippled for almost three weeks after being flooded with enormous amounts of traffic .
prime minister andrus ansip had claimed that some of the cyber-attacks , which forced the authorities in the tiny baltic state to temporarily shut down web sites , came from russian government computers , including the president 's office .
but tallinn has now backed away from such explicit accusations .
estonia 's defence minister jaak aaviksoo said there was a possibility of russian involvement in the attacks that involved at least one million computers .

i am convinced that , among other topics , climate change , sustainable development , the fight against hunger and against social marginalization as well as financing development are among the issues on which the most important emerging countries need to be heard from more and more .
not only because their populations are the most affected in an increasing networked and interconnected world , but also because in our countries there are more innovative approaches to finding solutions to these challenges . i mean that the meetings taking place with the participation of the emerging countries will contribute to lending additional credibility and effectiveness on an international level to the g8 's endeavors .
for this reason , i make the case for the extended summit to become the core of a permanent forum where the developing and industrialized countries can transparently and representatively exchange their views on the issues that require a concentrated answer .
in this way we will make a decisive step toward true global governance .

a guest commentary on dictatorships in the un also caught readers ' attention . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . is the g8 neglecting africa ? it is true that the g8 has made and not kept its promises to africa .
but there is another side to the coin .
africa 's leaders have failed to keep their part of the bargain - not just to the west about proper use of the aid funds , but to their own citizens in terms of human rights , accountable government and rule of law .
however much one empathizes with africa , the truth is that corruption and the absence of the rule of law are the biggest problem , not the lack of aid .
the solutions must come from africa itself .
what makes things difficult is that african rulers use the poverty of their citizens - more often than not , caused by them - as an excuse to ask for more aid .
africans like me are sick of the tired excuse that the west is to blame , the colonialists are to blame , or that by telling african leaders the blatant and sad truth they are being " racist . "
africa has been independent for far too long to use racism and colonial heritage as excuses for its woes .
for how long should they be potty-trained on democracy ? - lereko obonyo , kenya bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solutions must come from africa itself , wrote one readers i do not agree with bono and geldof that the g8 are neglecting our " responsibility " to africa .
they are neglecting the fact that government must extort money from us for their pet causes , whether we the people support the cause or not .
and what of the hypocrisy of bono moving his band 's business to a low-tax country to avoid exactly the extortion that he now demands of my government on me ?
neither man is certainly hurting for money . why are n't they living like common folk and giving the extra to africa themselves ? - jamie extract , us africa has not felt germany 's european leadership in terms of relief and development in africa .
i saw what tony blair has done about the debt cancellation in africa .
what did angel merkel sacrifice for the development of africa ?
a high-powered delegation including the german president visited my country , sierra leone .
since then i have not felt any impact .
please do something about this . - alusine s. kargbo , sierra-leone i agree with bono and bob geldof that g8 countries are neglecting commitments to africa . - dumitru florea , romania why does n't he just quit yapping ?
tell him to give some of the hundreds of millions of dollars he has made to these poor people .
my money belongs in my pocket .
it is sickening that i saw bono at ouest on the upper west side on mother 's day and he left half his food on his plate when the waiter came to clean up . - william , us a un of democracies and dictatorships ? i think the creation of a democratic caucus within the united nations would help solve the problem of the existence of dictatorships or other kinds of governments in the world , without leaving anyone out of the un .
promoting the cause of democracy is the best way to inculcate this kind of government in countries with no regard for human rights . - jose nigrin , israel a democracy caucus might be useful if the democracies would stick together , demand changes in the un charter , clean up the corruption and back it up with the combined position that they will withhold funding unless their requests are met .
the us should start by refusing any funding for the renovation of the un headquarters in new york and intimate that the un may be told to vacate the building and find a location in another country without us funding if it fails to meet the conditions of the democratic caucus . - max lester , us compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : united nations of democracies and dictatorships ?
the increasing role of non-democracies in key un bodies lead observers to wonder how the un can live up to its ideals .
the us and the eu should turn to the old-fashioned tools of diplomacy , argues thorsten benner .
-lrb- 17.05.2007 -rrb- rock stars urge g8 industrialized nations to deliver on africa aid irish rock stars bono and bob geldof on tuesday accused g8 nations of falling far behind on pledges of aid to africa and put pressure on germany as current head of the club to donate nearly one billion dollars .

"
in a report of the same name , chancellor merkel has said what she means by " growth and responsibility : " to compete successfully in global markets . angela merkel also knows what globalization is : " the process of the globalization is a process of the liberalization " the government has defined the rules just like soccer : " plays are won on attack , not defense . "
the chancellor does n't see that this " game " leaves millions of people in crisis and poverty .
unlike globalization , soccer has clear rules .
if someone breaks the rules they are sent off the field .
in a world of global competition , the person who commits a nasty foul can , however , be very successful .
german wage repression and the national success as a world exporter are prime examples of this .
that more and more people are protesting against this and demanding social justice is a positive sign .
that state and government leaders keep putting up higher and higher fences topped with barbed wire to keep them out is a negative one . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback what does the g8 mean to you ?

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . is the g8 neglecting africa ? it is true that the g8 has made and not kept its promises to africa .
but there is another side to the coin .
africa 's leaders have failed to keep their part of the bargain - not just to the west about proper use of the aid funds , but to their own citizens in terms of human rights , accountable government and rule of law .
however much one empathizes with africa , the truth is that corruption and the absence of the rule of law are the biggest problem , not the lack of aid .
the solutions must come from africa itself .
what makes things difficult is that african rulers use the poverty of their citizens - more often than not , caused by them - as an excuse to ask for more aid .
africans like me are sick of the tired excuse that the west is to blame , the colonialists are to blame , or that by telling african leaders the blatant and sad truth they are being " racist . "
africa has been independent for far too long to use racism and colonial heritage as excuses for its woes .

it 's the first time , as far as is known , that there has been such an assault on a state . many government and corporate sites in the hi-tech baltic nation have been crippled for almost three weeks after being flooded with enormous amounts of traffic .
prime minister andrus ansip had claimed that some of the cyber-attacks , which forced the authorities in the tiny baltic state to temporarily shut down web sites , came from russian government computers , including the president 's office .
but tallinn has now backed away from such explicit accusations .
estonia 's defence minister jaak aaviksoo said there was a possibility of russian involvement in the attacks that involved at least one million computers .
the kremlin has dismissed the accusations , saying hackers could have used a false ip address to tarnish the russian authorities .
coincidence ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the relocation of a soviet war memorial has further soured relations between moscow and tallinn the start of the cyber-attacks coincide with the start of a row with the kremlin over the removal from central talinn of a post-world war ii memorial to soviet red army soldiers .
the nato spokesman remained vague on the question of russian involvement .
" it 's not that easy because of the nature of cyber space , " he said .
he added that " various indications " had been identified .
but he said that tracking and identifying the cyber attackers was not the primary goal of the investigations .
" our aim ultimately is protection . "
he told afp , " we do see it as serious because it was concerted .
it 's clearly not the sort of thing that two teenagers , for whatever their motives , do .
we are talking about a pretty well-organised thing . "
" this is a special case because of the scale of this attack .
so of course allies are going to help and we are not just treating this as an estonian problem , of course it is a problem for nato , " the spokesman added .
growing threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spread of technology is set to increase the threat of cyber attack at present , nato does not define cyber attacks as clear military action .
this means the provisions of collective self-defence would not apply to the attacked country .
us deputy secretary of state john negroponte told a number of leading european newspapers on friday that cyber attacks were likely to become more of an issue in the future .
a common method of achieving such attacks is by hijacking computers belonging to normal web surfers using a virus or other malware picked up from an infected e-mail attachment or by visiting a website that hosts such malware .

i am convinced that , among other topics , climate change , sustainable development , the fight against hunger and against social marginalization as well as financing development are among the issues on which the most important emerging countries need to be heard from more and more .
not only because their populations are the most affected in an increasing networked and interconnected world , but also because in our countries there are more innovative approaches to finding solutions to these challenges . i mean that the meetings taking place with the participation of the emerging countries will contribute to lending additional credibility and effectiveness on an international level to the g8 's endeavors .
for this reason , i make the case for the extended summit to become the core of a permanent forum where the developing and industrialized countries can transparently and representatively exchange their views on the issues that require a concentrated answer .

it 's the first time , as far as is known , that there has been such an assault on a state . many government and corporate sites in the hi-tech baltic nation have been crippled for almost three weeks after being flooded with enormous amounts of traffic .
prime minister andrus ansip had claimed that some of the cyber-attacks , which forced the authorities in the tiny baltic state to temporarily shut down web sites , came from russian government computers , including the president 's office .
but tallinn has now backed away from such explicit accusations .
estonia 's defence minister jaak aaviksoo said there was a possibility of russian involvement in the attacks that involved at least one million computers .
the kremlin has dismissed the accusations , saying hackers could have used a false ip address to tarnish the russian authorities .
coincidence ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the relocation of a soviet war memorial has further soured relations between moscow and tallinn the start of the cyber-attacks coincide with the start of a row with the kremlin over the removal from central talinn of a post-world war ii memorial to soviet red army soldiers .
the nato spokesman remained vague on the question of russian involvement .
" it 's not that easy because of the nature of cyber space , " he said .
he added that " various indications " had been identified .
but he said that tracking and identifying the cyber attackers was not the primary goal of the investigations .
" our aim ultimately is protection . "
he told afp , " we do see it as serious because it was concerted .
it 's clearly not the sort of thing that two teenagers , for whatever their motives , do .
we are talking about a pretty well-organised thing . "
" this is a special case because of the scale of this attack .
so of course allies are going to help and we are not just treating this as an estonian problem , of course it is a problem for nato , " the spokesman added .
growing threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spread of technology is set to increase the threat of cyber attack at present , nato does not define cyber attacks as clear military action .
this means the provisions of collective self-defence would not apply to the attacked country .
us deputy secretary of state john negroponte told a number of leading european newspapers on friday that cyber attacks were likely to become more of an issue in the future .
a common method of achieving such attacks is by hijacking computers belonging to normal web surfers using a virus or other malware picked up from an infected e-mail attachment or by visiting a website that hosts such malware .

i am convinced that , among other topics , climate change , sustainable development , the fight against hunger and against social marginalization as well as financing development are among the issues on which the most important emerging countries need to be heard from more and more .
not only because their populations are the most affected in an increasing networked and interconnected world , but also because in our countries there are more innovative approaches to finding solutions to these challenges . i mean that the meetings taking place with the participation of the emerging countries will contribute to lending additional credibility and effectiveness on an international level to the g8 's endeavors .
for this reason , i make the case for the extended summit to become the core of a permanent forum where the developing and industrialized countries can transparently and representatively exchange their views on the issues that require a concentrated answer .

increased tourism means more trade for local businesses , and that will mean more money for the town overall .
in addition , the summit has brought much needed investment and infrastructure to the town and the region .
this was already urgently needed , but because of the cooperation of the federate , state and city authorities , it has happened much quicker .
these developments have improved the quality of life for our residents and also benefited our guests .
i see the likely anti-g8 demonstrations as part of our democracy .
free expression of opinion is one of our basic legal rights , as it should be .
therefore everyone who wishes to protest peacefully here is welcome .
violent demonstrations are not just distressing ; it 's an unacceptable way to change something .
of course there is some concern that it could happen here , but i do n't think it 's our major worry . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 picture of the day dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

"
he has signed a petition for the counter demonstration in rostock . i answered to the call to join the demonstration against the g8 summit in heiligendamm because of something goethe once wrote : " sometimes you have to speak your opinions , so that others will eventually speak theirs . "
i have become involved in campaigning for alternative globalization , because i believe that the g8 countries are the biggest polluters and war-makers in the world , since they manufacturer many of weapons used in war today . i think that artists have to stand up publicly in these protests , because art is connected to life and life is connected to politics .
art can also be depoliticized .
unfortunately in europe there is a certain amount of self censorship .
artists do n't speak out about politics because they think they wo n't get work it they do .
it is desperately important that artists are concerned about humanity because so much depends on this . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback what does the g8 mean to you ?

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . is the g8 neglecting africa ? it is true that the g8 has made and not kept its promises to africa .
but there is another side to the coin .
africa 's leaders have failed to keep their part of the bargain - not just to the west about proper use of the aid funds , but to their own citizens in terms of human rights , accountable government and rule of law .
however much one empathizes with africa , the truth is that corruption and the absence of the rule of law are the biggest problem , not the lack of aid .
the solutions must come from africa itself .
what makes things difficult is that african rulers use the poverty of their citizens - more often than not , caused by them - as an excuse to ask for more aid .
africans like me are sick of the tired excuse that the west is to blame , the colonialists are to blame , or that by telling african leaders the blatant and sad truth they are being " racist . "
africa has been independent for far too long to use racism and colonial heritage as excuses for its woes .
for how long should they be potty-trained on democracy ? - lereko obonyo , kenya bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solutions must come from africa itself , wrote one readers i do not agree with bono and geldof that the g8 are neglecting our " responsibility " to africa .
they are neglecting the fact that government must extort money from us for their pet causes , whether we the people support the cause or not .
and what of the hypocrisy of bono moving his band 's business to a low-tax country to avoid exactly the extortion that he now demands of my government on me ?
neither man is certainly hurting for money . why are n't they living like common folk and giving the extra to africa themselves ? - jamie extract , us africa has not felt germany 's european leadership in terms of relief and development in africa .

my money belongs in my pocket .
it is sickening that i saw bono at ouest on the upper west side on mother 's day and he left half his food on his plate when the waiter came to clean up . - william , us a un of democracies and dictatorships ? i think the creation of a democratic caucus within the united nations would help solve the problem of the existence of dictatorships or other kinds of governments in the world , without leaving anyone out of the un .
promoting the cause of democracy is the best way to inculcate this kind of government in countries with no regard for human rights . - jose nigrin , israel a democracy caucus might be useful if the democracies would stick together , demand changes in the un charter , clean up the corruption and back it up with the combined position that they will withhold funding unless their requests are met .
the us should start by refusing any funding for the renovation of the un headquarters in new york and intimate that the un may be told to vacate the building and find a location in another country without us funding if it fails to meet the conditions of the democratic caucus . - max lester , us compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : united nations of democracies and dictatorships ?

i am the g8 sherpa to chancellor merkel , and there are sherpas to all the other leaders of members countries , whom i meet with regularly to work on summit drafts .
it 's not always easy , because all g8 members have to be in agreement .
i have to be in tune with what the interests of others are and work with them diplomatically to probe for a solution that also meets our aims .
i am used to working long hours , but i also find i can quite easily switch off on weekends and relax - when i have to the weekend off .

increased tourism means more trade for local businesses , and that will mean more money for the town overall .
in addition , the summit has brought much needed investment and infrastructure to the town and the region .
this was already urgently needed , but because of the cooperation of the federate , state and city authorities , it has happened much quicker .
these developments have improved the quality of life for our residents and also benefited our guests .
i see the likely anti-g8 demonstrations as part of our democracy .
free expression of opinion is one of our basic legal rights , as it should be .
therefore everyone who wishes to protest peacefully here is welcome .
violent demonstrations are not just distressing ; it 's an unacceptable way to change something .

increased tourism means more trade for local businesses , and that will mean more money for the town overall .
in addition , the summit has brought much needed investment and infrastructure to the town and the region .
this was already urgently needed , but because of the cooperation of the federate , state and city authorities , it has happened much quicker .
these developments have improved the quality of life for our residents and also benefited our guests .
i see the likely anti-g8 demonstrations as part of our democracy .
free expression of opinion is one of our basic legal rights , as it should be .
therefore everyone who wishes to protest peacefully here is welcome .
violent demonstrations are not just distressing ; it 's an unacceptable way to change something .

i have become involved in campaigning for alternative globalization , because i believe that the g8 countries are the biggest polluters and war-makers in the world , since they manufacturer many of weapons used in war today . i think that artists have to stand up publicly in these protests , because art is connected to life and life is connected to politics .
art can also be depoliticized .
unfortunately in europe there is a certain amount of self censorship .
artists do n't speak out about politics because they think they wo n't get work it they do .
it is desperately important that artists are concerned about humanity because so much depends on this . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 picture of the day dw-tv europe live journal - nachrichten mit tagesthema we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 18.05.2007 " both g8 and african leaders failed to keep their promises " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some readers said bono should pull out his own wallet readers commented this week on pleas made by rock stars bono and bob geldof for g8 nations to honor their pledges to africa .
a guest commentary on dictatorships in the un also caught readers ' attention . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . is the g8 neglecting africa ? it is true that the g8 has made and not kept its promises to africa .
but there is another side to the coin .
africa 's leaders have failed to keep their part of the bargain - not just to the west about proper use of the aid funds , but to their own citizens in terms of human rights , accountable government and rule of law .
however much one empathizes with africa , the truth is that corruption and the absence of the rule of law are the biggest problem , not the lack of aid .
the solutions must come from africa itself .
what makes things difficult is that african rulers use the poverty of their citizens - more often than not , caused by them - as an excuse to ask for more aid .
africans like me are sick of the tired excuse that the west is to blame , the colonialists are to blame , or that by telling african leaders the blatant and sad truth they are being " racist . "
africa has been independent for far too long to use racism and colonial heritage as excuses for its woes .
for how long should they be potty-trained on democracy ? - lereko obonyo , kenya bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solutions must come from africa itself , wrote one readers i do not agree with bono and geldof that the g8 are neglecting our " responsibility " to africa .
they are neglecting the fact that government must extort money from us for their pet causes , whether we the people support the cause or not .
and what of the hypocrisy of bono moving his band 's business to a low-tax country to avoid exactly the extortion that he now demands of my government on me ?
neither man is certainly hurting for money . why are n't they living like common folk and giving the extra to africa themselves ? - jamie extract , us africa has not felt germany 's european leadership in terms of relief and development in africa .
i saw what tony blair has done about the debt cancellation in africa .
what did angel merkel sacrifice for the development of africa ?
a high-powered delegation including the german president visited my country , sierra leone .
since then i have not felt any impact .
please do something about this . - alusine s. kargbo , sierra-leone i agree with bono and bob geldof that g8 countries are neglecting commitments to africa . - dumitru florea , romania why does n't he just quit yapping ?
tell him to give some of the hundreds of millions of dollars he has made to these poor people .
my money belongs in my pocket .
it is sickening that i saw bono at ouest on the upper west side on mother 's day and he left half his food on his plate when the waiter came to clean up . - william , us a un of democracies and dictatorships ? i think the creation of a democratic caucus within the united nations would help solve the problem of the existence of dictatorships or other kinds of governments in the world , without leaving anyone out of the un .
promoting the cause of democracy is the best way to inculcate this kind of government in countries with no regard for human rights . - jose nigrin , israel a democracy caucus might be useful if the democracies would stick together , demand changes in the un charter , clean up the corruption and back it up with the combined position that they will withhold funding unless their requests are met .
the us should start by refusing any funding for the renovation of the un headquarters in new york and intimate that the un may be told to vacate the building and find a location in another country without us funding if it fails to meet the conditions of the democratic caucus . - max lester , us compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : united nations of democracies and dictatorships ?
the increasing role of non-democracies in key un bodies lead observers to wonder how the un can live up to its ideals .
the us and the eu should turn to the old-fashioned tools of diplomacy , argues thorsten benner .
-lrb- 17.05.2007 -rrb- rock stars urge g8 industrialized nations to deliver on africa aid irish rock stars bono and bob geldof on tuesday accused g8 nations of falling far behind on pledges of aid to africa and put pressure on germany as current head of the club to donate nearly one billion dollars .

the drug caused thousands of children to be born with severe disabilities . grünenthal pharmaceuticals had tried to get the tv movie banned , saying it was not a fair or truthful depiction of the tragic story .
but judges in hamburg ruled this week that it is clearly fiction rather than a documentary .
this means it is officially a work of art protected from censorship by the german constitution .
devastating side effects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the drug was given to pregnant women to treat morning sickness the film called “ contergan – just one tablet ” is now set to be aired on german public television in august .
contergan was the german name for the drug that was given to pregnant women to treat morning sickness in the 1950s and the early 1960s . the drug triggered the biggest pharmaceutical scandal in postwar germany after it later became clear that it caused severe damage to the limbs and internal organs of unborn foetuses .
dr. annette fusenig from grünenthal had criticized the film for failing to properly distinguish between fact and fiction .
" it ’ s a fictional film , and it does not give the truth , but on the other hand the film claims that is an historically based film , " she said .
" confusing " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hamburg court ruled it was clearly a work of fiction fusenig said she thought viewers would be confused and unable to judge what is based on fact and what is fiction .
the production company zeitsprung , however , always opposed these claims .
its managing director michael souviginier says that grünenthal has too low an opinion of the audience .
" the audience can differentiate between a feature film and a documentary , " said souvignier .
" and our film simply isn ’ t a documentary ; even a child could see that , " he added .
the court has asked the film company to make two small alterations before the work goes on air .
one scene will be deleted and also “ contergan : just one tablet ” will have to run with a disclaimer before and after , reiterating that it is a work of fiction .
victory for filmmakers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the manufacturers were involved in a lengthy trial over the drug souviginier welcomed the court 's decision .
" basically it is art that has won here , and the tradition of such films in gemany and around the world ; a tradition which has come out of this case unscathed , " he said .
for its part , grünenthal says it 's not campaigning to stop a film about thalidomide , or to avoid bad press .

" and our film simply isn ’ t a documentary ; even a child could see that , " he added .
the court has asked the film company to make two small alterations before the work goes on air .
one scene will be deleted and also “ contergan : just one tablet ” will have to run with a disclaimer before and after , reiterating that it is a work of fiction .
victory for filmmakers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the manufacturers were involved in a lengthy trial over the drug souviginier welcomed the court 's decision .
" basically it is art that has won here , and the tradition of such films in gemany and around the world ; a tradition which has come out of this case unscathed , " he said .
for its part , grünenthal says it 's not campaigning to stop a film about thalidomide , or to avoid bad press .
but the company feels issues like compensation and general treatment of the victims are not fairly depicted in the film .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 18.05.2007 film on german drug scandal gets green light großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thalidomide was at the center of the biggest drug scandal in postwar germany a german film about the drug thalidomide , first issued 50 years ago , will be aired despite opposition by the firm that invented the medication .
the drug caused thousands of children to be born with severe disabilities . grünenthal pharmaceuticals had tried to get the tv movie banned , saying it was not a fair or truthful depiction of the tragic story .
but judges in hamburg ruled this week that it is clearly fiction rather than a documentary .
this means it is officially a work of art protected from censorship by the german constitution .
devastating side effects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the drug was given to pregnant women to treat morning sickness the film called “ contergan – just one tablet ” is now set to be aired on german public television in august .
contergan was the german name for the drug that was given to pregnant women to treat morning sickness in the 1950s and the early 1960s . the drug triggered the biggest pharmaceutical scandal in postwar germany after it later became clear that it caused severe damage to the limbs and internal organs of unborn foetuses .
dr. annette fusenig from grünenthal had criticized the film for failing to properly distinguish between fact and fiction .
" it ’ s a fictional film , and it does not give the truth , but on the other hand the film claims that is an historically based film , " she said .
" confusing " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hamburg court ruled it was clearly a work of fiction fusenig said she thought viewers would be confused and unable to judge what is based on fact and what is fiction .
the production company zeitsprung , however , always opposed these claims .
its managing director michael souviginier says that grünenthal has too low an opinion of the audience .
" the audience can differentiate between a feature film and a documentary , " said souvignier .
" and our film simply isn ’ t a documentary ; even a child could see that , " he added .
the court has asked the film company to make two small alterations before the work goes on air .
one scene will be deleted and also “ contergan : just one tablet ” will have to run with a disclaimer before and after , reiterating that it is a work of fiction .
victory for filmmakers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the manufacturers were involved in a lengthy trial over the drug souviginier welcomed the court 's decision .
" basically it is art that has won here , and the tradition of such films in gemany and around the world ; a tradition which has come out of this case unscathed , " he said .
for its part , grünenthal says it 's not campaigning to stop a film about thalidomide , or to avoid bad press .
but the company feels issues like compensation and general treatment of the victims are not fairly depicted in the film .
the firm could still try to appeal the verdict in germany ’ s highest court , and says it is considering its options . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new eu rules to make medication safer for kids new eu rules require europe-based pharmaceutical companies to show that the drugs they bring to market are suitable for kids .

" i hope that they will be able to express their opinion , " merkel told a joint news conference at the end of the two-day summit at which eu leaders discussed the state of democracy and human rights .
" i 'm somewhat concerned that people had difficulties getting here , but perhaps a possible demonstration can still take place , " merkel said . " if demonstrators throw stones , if they smash windows , then of course they should be curbed .
but if someone has done nothing , if they just want to go to a demonstration , then it 's different , " merkel said . russian president putin testily defended " preventive measures " taken by russian police ahead of the rally , comparing these to common practice in european countries . expressing assurances that the opposition 's right to protest would be respected , putin countered that german authorities have not ruled out using preventative detention in the run-up to next month 's group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in the german resort of heiligendamm . " we will not however point the finger at others , " the russian leader said . in hamburg alone , german police resorted to water canons and truncheons last week in clashes with some 2,000 activists demonstrating against the upcoming g8 summit on the baltic coast . boarding hindered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chess champion and opposition leader garry kasparov was stopped from flying kasparov 's other russia movement had planned an anti-kremlin protest to coincide with the tense meeting between russian president vladimir putin , chancellor merkel , the current holder of the european union 's six-month rotating presidency , and european commission president jose manuel barroso . the former chess champion had been scheduled to fly to the volga river city which is 70 kilometers -lrb- 43 miles -rrb- from the summit venue of volzhsky utyos .
" not one member of the other russia delegation was allowed to board , " denis bilunov , a spokeman for kasparov , told afp .
the leader of the radical national bolshevik movement , eduard limonov , was also stranded at the russian capital 's sheremetyevo airport , as were a number of journalists .
wall street journal correspondent alan cullison said police had told them that there was a problem with the tickets .
passports confiscated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : summit leaders have pledged to have an open dialogue about a number of thorny issues a representative of a human rights organization had his passport confiscated .

" they told us at the check-in that our tickets had been rejected by the computer as they had been sold -lrb- to other passengers -rrb- .
but some journalists who were allowed to board told us the plane was half empty . "
a presidential spokesman denied the kremlin was involved in the incident and said he did not expect the incident to be discussed at the summit .
" i do n't think the issue of the non-arrival of a russian citizen , even a famous one will be on the summit agenda , " said dmitry pescov .
" i can not comment on behalf of the police .
the kremlin was not in sheremetyevo . "
some " constructive " discussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow 's ban on polish meat imports is one point of dispute meanwhile , russian and european leaders vowed to hold frank discussions about all areas of dispute .
president putin said : " we are ready for an open and honest dialogue without any taboo subjects . "
chancellor merkel said she hoped for firm solutions to the problems between the eu and russia .
" i hope that we can take concrete steps where there are snags and hitches . "
still , participants said " constructive " discussions had taken place at the summit in volzhsky utyos -lrb- volga cliff -rrb- , a picturesque resort complex some 1,000 kilometres -lrb- 620 miles -rrb- south of moscow .
putin and eu leaders discussed setting up an alert mechanism for increasingly vital russian energy supplies to europe following a request from merkel after recent gas and oil cut-offs from russia .
putin told barroso and merkel over dinner on thursday that supply agreements he signed this month with the central asian states of kazakhstan and turkmenistan would benefit europe .
talks touched on russia 's bid to join the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- , which is being dogged by trade tariff disputes with brussels , and the future status of the serbian province of kosovo .
" russia ca n't tango on its own " but the overall impression was one of deep discord between the two sides .
" we found many problems during the summit .
we have not always managed to convince each other but i think it 's always better to speak to each other than to speak about each other , " merkel said .
negotiations over a partnership agreement between the eu and russia , including in the sensitive energy sphere , are being blocked by eu member poland because of a trade dispute with moscow . the current agreement runs out this year and can be extended , but eu officials said that failure to start negotiations would be an embarrassment for both sides .

russia imposed the ban last year , citing food safety concerns .
putin responded that the eu should first solve its " internal problems , " and kremlin officials said that russia had already made sufficient concessions to poland and was waiting for a response .
" russia ca n't tango on its own , " said dmitry peskov , a kremlin spokesman .
the eu 's external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner ascribed some of the frostiness in relations to upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections in russia .

" i hope that they will be able to express their opinion , " merkel told a joint news conference at the end of the two-day summit at which eu leaders discussed the state of democracy and human rights .
" i 'm somewhat concerned that people had difficulties getting here , but perhaps a possible demonstration can still take place , " merkel said . " if demonstrators throw stones , if they smash windows , then of course they should be curbed .
but if someone has done nothing , if they just want to go to a demonstration , then it 's different , " merkel said . russian president putin testily defended " preventive measures " taken by russian police ahead of the rally , comparing these to common practice in european countries . expressing assurances that the opposition 's right to protest would be respected , putin countered that german authorities have not ruled out using preventative detention in the run-up to next month 's group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in the german resort of heiligendamm .

a presidential spokesman denied the kremlin was involved in the incident and said he did not expect the incident to be discussed at the summit .
" i do n't think the issue of the non-arrival of a russian citizen , even a famous one will be on the summit agenda , " said dmitry pescov .
" i can not comment on behalf of the police .

some " constructive " discussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow 's ban on polish meat imports is one point of dispute meanwhile , russian and european leaders vowed to hold frank discussions about all areas of dispute .
president putin said : " we are ready for an open and honest dialogue without any taboo subjects . "
chancellor merkel said she hoped for firm solutions to the problems between the eu and russia .
" i hope that we can take concrete steps where there are snags and hitches . "
still , participants said " constructive " discussions had taken place at the summit in volzhsky utyos -lrb- volga cliff -rrb- , a picturesque resort complex some 1,000 kilometres -lrb- 620 miles -rrb- south of moscow .
putin and eu leaders discussed setting up an alert mechanism for increasingly vital russian energy supplies to europe following a request from merkel after recent gas and oil cut-offs from russia .
putin told barroso and merkel over dinner on thursday that supply agreements he signed this month with the central asian states of kazakhstan and turkmenistan would benefit europe .
talks touched on russia 's bid to join the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- , which is being dogged by trade tariff disputes with brussels , and the future status of the serbian province of kosovo .
" russia ca n't tango on its own " but the overall impression was one of deep discord between the two sides .
" we found many problems during the summit .
we have not always managed to convince each other but i think it 's always better to speak to each other than to speak about each other , " merkel said .
negotiations over a partnership agreement between the eu and russia , including in the sensitive energy sphere , are being blocked by eu member poland because of a trade dispute with moscow . the current agreement runs out this year and can be extended , but eu officials said that failure to start negotiations would be an embarrassment for both sides .

russia imposed the ban last year , citing food safety concerns .
putin responded that the eu should first solve its " internal problems , " and kremlin officials said that russia had already made sufficient concessions to poland and was waiting for a response .
" russia ca n't tango on its own , " said dmitry peskov , a kremlin spokesman .
the eu 's external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner ascribed some of the frostiness in relations to upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections in russia .

putin told barroso and merkel over dinner on thursday that supply agreements he signed this month with the central asian states of kazakhstan and turkmenistan would benefit europe .

the drug caused thousands of children to be born with severe disabilities . grünenthal pharmaceuticals had tried to get the tv movie banned , saying it was not a fair or truthful depiction of the tragic story .
but judges in hamburg ruled this week that it is clearly fiction rather than a documentary .
this means it is officially a work of art protected from censorship by the german constitution .
devastating side effects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the drug was given to pregnant women to treat morning sickness the film called “ contergan – just one tablet ” is now set to be aired on german public television in august .
contergan was the german name for the drug that was given to pregnant women to treat morning sickness in the 1950s and the early 1960s . the drug triggered the biggest pharmaceutical scandal in postwar germany after it later became clear that it caused severe damage to the limbs and internal organs of unborn foetuses .
dr. annette fusenig from grünenthal had criticized the film for failing to properly distinguish between fact and fiction .
" it ’ s a fictional film , and it does not give the truth , but on the other hand the film claims that is an historically based film , " she said .

the drug caused thousands of children to be born with severe disabilities . grünenthal pharmaceuticals had tried to get the tv movie banned , saying it was not a fair or truthful depiction of the tragic story .

africa 's leaders have failed to keep their part of the bargain - not just to the west about proper use of the aid funds , but to their own citizens in terms of human rights , accountable government and rule of law .
however much one empathizes with africa , the truth is that corruption and the absence of the rule of law are the biggest problem , not the lack of aid .

what makes things difficult is that african rulers use the poverty of their citizens - more often than not , caused by them - as an excuse to ask for more aid .
africans like me are sick of the tired excuse that the west is to blame , the colonialists are to blame , or that by telling african leaders the blatant and sad truth they are being " racist . "

she is attending the g8 alternative summit in rostock . two years ago g8 leaders promised universal access to treatment and preventative care - two years on there has been very little action .
we are calling for a long-term funding plan so we do n't have to go begging , bowl in hand , at every annual meeting .
universal access by 2015 is a goal that deserves a budget . i think the credibility and legitimacy of g8 is in question .
it 's an ongoing debate .
they have invited other countries to join them , which is a sign of the times .
the g8 has been more aware of its lack of credibility , but also aware of protests and therefore has tended to hide itself away .
russian president vladimir putin met with action aid last year , which i think was a recognition that civil society is important . the g8 can lead by example .
unfortunately , so far it has tended to make cost free promises . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback feedback : what does the g8 mean to you ?

she is attending the g8 alternative summit in rostock . two years ago g8 leaders promised universal access to treatment and preventative care - two years on there has been very little action .
we are calling for a long-term funding plan so we do n't have to go begging , bowl in hand , at every annual meeting .
universal access by 2015 is a goal that deserves a budget . i think the credibility and legitimacy of g8 is in question .
it 's an ongoing debate .
they have invited other countries to join them , which is a sign of the times .
the g8 has been more aware of its lack of credibility , but also aware of protests and therefore has tended to hide itself away .
russian president vladimir putin met with action aid last year , which i think was a recognition that civil society is important . the g8 can lead by example .
unfortunately , so far it has tended to make cost free promises . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback feedback : what does the g8 mean to you ?

i am convinced that , among other topics , climate change , sustainable development , the fight against hunger and against social marginalization as well as financing development are among the issues on which the most important emerging countries need to be heard from more and more .
not only because their populations are the most affected in an increasing networked and interconnected world , but also because in our countries there are more innovative approaches to finding solutions to these challenges . i mean that the meetings taking place with the participation of the emerging countries will contribute to lending additional credibility and effectiveness on an international level to the g8 's endeavors .
for this reason , i make the case for the extended summit to become the core of a permanent forum where the developing and industrialized countries can transparently and representatively exchange their views on the issues that require a concentrated answer .

complex talks require significant preparation if they are going to be dealt with efficiently in the time available .
i am the g8 sherpa to chancellor merkel , and there are sherpas to all the other leaders of members countries , whom i meet with regularly to work on summit drafts .
it 's not always easy , because all g8 members have to be in agreement .
i have to be in tune with what the interests of others are and work with them diplomatically to probe for a solution that also meets our aims .
i am used to working long hours , but i also find i can quite easily switch off on weekends and relax - when i have to the weekend off .
i will be happy if the summit comes off successfully .
if it does n't , it will be because of bad lack or because we did a bad job .
that 's not what we would hope for . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback feedback : what does the g8 mean to you ?

it is n't the first time the continent is a g8 focus .
but have previous commitments brought about any change ? africa was last the focus of a g8 summit two years ago in gleneagles .
at the time , the world 's leading industrialized nations resolved to double development aid by 2010 and to free the poorest countries of their debts . denis tull , an africa expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , said he considered the debt relief a positive move .
but added thatsuch measures should not be overrated . " you should look at it matter-of-factly , " tull said .
" the debts were cancelled - well knowing that they never would have been paid back anyway . " tull said it was ultimately in the hands of african governments to decide whether the funds freed by the debt relief would now be put to good use . broken promises ? the international community has committed itself to fighting worldwide poverty in the united nations millennium development goals .
the g8 nations in particular have repeatedly affirmed their commitment and want to set a good example .
yet worldwide development aid has decreased in the past years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gentlemen at the g8 summit in gleneagles committed to do more for africa " the g8 countries are not true to their word , " said africa and development aid expert cord jakobeit from the university of hamburg .
" the commitment by the g8 to significantly increase their contribution to development aid looks gloomy . " the latest figures by the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- confirm jakobeit 's opinion .
together , the 30 oecd member states spent 5 percent less on development aid in 2006 than in the previous year .
the thriftiest were italy with a 30 percent cut and the united states with a reduction of 20 percent .
both countries are members of the g8 . in absolute terms , g8 nations spend the most money on development aid .
but viewed in terms of countries ' economic output , a g8 member first appears seventh on the list .
half of the most frugal aid donors belong to the group of eight , according to the oecd . is outside aid the right measure ? but both donor countries , as well as african nations themselves are questioning the concept of development aid .
the kenyan economist james shikwati said he rejected conventional development policies .
instead , he emphasized progress by africa 's own means . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african nations should be building their own futures , some experts say " without foreign aid , governments would have to see to an economic development which develops in the country itself , " shikwati told the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . according to tull , development aid is n't a panacea for poor nations . " it can only have a limited impact , as does every measure which comes from outside , " tull said , adding that it would be presumptuous to believe one could steer certain economic or political processes in such a way that the result would meet western expectations . the situation in post-colonial africa has not improved there are good reasons for the world to deal with africa 's problems , according to development experts . " africa is the hardship case of the global community , " said jakobeit . of course , this assessment does n't apply to all african countries .
but in many cases , the political and economic situation has tended to worsen rather than improve since the years of great hope following the end of colonial rule . the facts show how staggering the situation in africa really is .
some 75 percent of the population living south of the sahara has to survive on less than $ 2 per day and according to the united nations , two-thirds of the world 's least developed countries are located in africa . in the past five decades , trillions of euros have been spent on development aid , yet a sustainable impact has only been achieved in rare cases . " long-term studies prove that the positive effect of development policies in africa can not be significantly proven , " jakobeit said . pablo walden -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : are the right countries sitting at the g8 table ?
g8 stands for the world 's leading eight industrial nations .
but in the lead up to the 2007 g8 summit in germany , some economists are again raising the question of whether the right members are in the g8 club .

i have become involved in campaigning for alternative globalization , because i believe that the g8 countries are the biggest polluters and war-makers in the world , since they manufacturer many of weapons used in war today . i think that artists have to stand up publicly in these protests , because art is connected to life and life is connected to politics .
art can also be depoliticized .
unfortunately in europe there is a certain amount of self censorship .
artists do n't speak out about politics because they think they wo n't get work it they do .
it is desperately important that artists are concerned about humanity because so much depends on this . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback feedback : what does the g8 mean to you ?

" i hope that they will be able to express their opinion , " merkel told a joint news conference at the end of the two-day summit at which eu leaders discussed the state of democracy and human rights .
" i 'm somewhat concerned that people had difficulties getting here , but perhaps a possible demonstration can still take place , " merkel said . " if demonstrators throw stones , if they smash windows , then of course they should be curbed .
but if someone has done nothing , if they just want to go to a demonstration , then it 's different , " merkel said . russian president putin testily defended " preventive measures " taken by russian police ahead of the rally , comparing these to common practice in european countries . expressing assurances that the opposition 's right to protest would be respected , putin countered that german authorities have not ruled out using preventative detention in the run-up to next month 's group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- summit in the german resort of heiligendamm . " we will not however point the finger at others , " the russian leader said . in hamburg alone , german police resorted to water canons and truncheons last week in clashes with some 2,000 activists demonstrating against the upcoming g8 summit on the baltic coast . boarding hindered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chess champion and opposition leader garry kasparov was stopped from flying kasparov 's other russia movement had planned an anti-kremlin protest to coincide with the tense meeting between russian president vladimir putin , chancellor merkel , the current holder of the european union 's six-month rotating presidency , and european commission president jose manuel barroso . the former chess champion had been scheduled to fly to the volga river city which is 70 kilometers -lrb- 43 miles -rrb- from the summit venue of volzhsky utyos .
" not one member of the other russia delegation was allowed to board , " denis bilunov , a spokeman for kasparov , told afp .
the leader of the radical national bolshevik movement , eduard limonov , was also stranded at the russian capital 's sheremetyevo airport , as were a number of journalists .
wall street journal correspondent alan cullison said police had told them that there was a problem with the tickets .
passports confiscated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : summit leaders have pledged to have an open dialogue about a number of thorny issues a representative of a human rights organization had his passport confiscated .
" we 're at sheremetyevo airport and uniformed men have taken our passports .
they 've taken 13 passports .
i consider this a criminal offence , " said lev ponomaryov of the for human rights organization .
" they told us at the check-in that our tickets had been rejected by the computer as they had been sold -lrb- to other passengers -rrb- .
but some journalists who were allowed to board told us the plane was half empty . "
a presidential spokesman denied the kremlin was involved in the incident and said he did not expect the incident to be discussed at the summit .
" i do n't think the issue of the non-arrival of a russian citizen , even a famous one will be on the summit agenda , " said dmitry pescov .
" i can not comment on behalf of the police .
the kremlin was not in sheremetyevo . "
some " constructive " discussions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow 's ban on polish meat imports is one point of dispute meanwhile , russian and european leaders vowed to hold frank discussions about all areas of dispute .
president putin said : " we are ready for an open and honest dialogue without any taboo subjects . "
chancellor merkel said she hoped for firm solutions to the problems between the eu and russia .
" i hope that we can take concrete steps where there are snags and hitches . "
still , participants said " constructive " discussions had taken place at the summit in volzhsky utyos -lrb- volga cliff -rrb- , a picturesque resort complex some 1,000 kilometres -lrb- 620 miles -rrb- south of moscow .
putin and eu leaders discussed setting up an alert mechanism for increasingly vital russian energy supplies to europe following a request from merkel after recent gas and oil cut-offs from russia .
putin told barroso and merkel over dinner on thursday that supply agreements he signed this month with the central asian states of kazakhstan and turkmenistan would benefit europe .
talks touched on russia 's bid to join the world trade organisation -lrb- wto -rrb- , which is being dogged by trade tariff disputes with brussels , and the future status of the serbian province of kosovo .
" russia ca n't tango on its own " but the overall impression was one of deep discord between the two sides .
" we found many problems during the summit .
we have not always managed to convince each other but i think it 's always better to speak to each other than to speak about each other , " merkel said .
negotiations over a partnership agreement between the eu and russia , including in the sensitive energy sphere , are being blocked by eu member poland because of a trade dispute with moscow . the current agreement runs out this year and can be extended , but eu officials said that failure to start negotiations would be an embarrassment for both sides .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso , left , and merkel with putin in samara barroso on friday reiterated the eu 's position that there was " no basis " for russia to maintain a ban on polish meat imports , the source of the dispute .
russia imposed the ban last year , citing food safety concerns .
putin responded that the eu should first solve its " internal problems , " and kremlin officials said that russia had already made sufficient concessions to poland and was waiting for a response .
" russia ca n't tango on its own , " said dmitry peskov , a kremlin spokesman .
the eu 's external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner ascribed some of the frostiness in relations to upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections in russia .

" any inappropriate regulation that could hurt free market mechanisms should be avoided , " japanese finance minister koji omi told journalists after bilateral talks with us deputy treasury secretary robert kimmitt .
" japan and the us agree on that . " omi 's comments will come as a blow to german finance minister peer steinbrück , host of a meeting of group of eight finance ministers this weekend , who is spearheading a campaign for a system of self-regulation for the industry . germany has repeatedly expressed concern over potential risks to financial stability from hedge funds , highly speculative and aggressive investment instruments .
and berlin has long campaigned for increased transparency and even regulation of the largely uncontrolled sector . but any such plans have consistently run up against fierce resistance , particularly in the us and britain , where most of the funds are based . moderate progress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's finance minister peer steinbrück at a press briefing just before the g8 finance meeting officially got underway , steinbrück insisted that progress was being made . the minister , however , acknowledged that drawing up a blue-print for self-regulation of the industry would be a long process . " nobody has ever announced that we will come to a clear result , " steinbrück said . " these are expectations that we have not set ourselves .
we have our medium-term objectives and i 'm sure that by the end of this presidency , we will have come further than where we are at the moment , " he said . the debate was a " process " which will continue " at least until the end of the german presidency " of the g8 . it was of secondary importance " whether we will come to a specific code of conduct by end of this year or in 2008 ... so long as we get there , " steinbrück said . just a prep meeting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g8 summit will take place here in heiligendamm from june 3 to 9 , 2007 the finance ministers of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , the united states and russia were meeting in potsdam , just outside berlin , this weekend , to prepare for the bigger summit of government leaders in june . in addition to hedge funds , the ministers were to discuss a wide range of topics , from ways of strengthening financial market stability , supporting sound governance in africa . steinbrück , who has already acknowledged that agreement was unlikely before the wider g8 summit of government leaders in the plush seaside resort of heiligendamm in early june , said friday discussions had progressed since the topic was first discussed at a meeting of g7 -lrb- g8 minus russia -rrb- finance ministers in essen in february . he also suggested that the idea of self-regulation - where the funds themselves would implement the rules and make sure they were adhered to - had the support not only of governments and institutions such as the ecb but also within the banking sector and even the industry itself . " we 've struck a nerve " , he said .

after lengthy talks with the bank 's board , mr wolfowitz said he would quit the global lending body on 30 june .
he had faced widespread calls for his resignation after being accused of a conflict of interest over a pay rise given to ex-bank employee shaha riza .
the white house , which had backed mr wolfowitz , said president george w bush reluctantly accepted his decision .
mr bush 's former deputy defence secretary joined the world bank in 2005 .
the bank said it would start an immediate search for his successor .
' good faith ' in a statement , the board of directors said it accepted mr wolfowitz 's assurances that he had " acted ethically and in good faith " in the handling of ms riza 's role and remuneration .
but it acknowledged that a " number of mistakes " had been made . "
i have concluded it is in the best interests of those whom the institution serves for that mission to be carried forward under new leadership " paul wolfowitz the bank after wolfowitz reaction to resignation q & a : wolfowitz row in response , mr wolfowitz said his decision to resign was " in the best interests " of the institution , which has more than 180 member countries worldwide .
the bbc 's justin webb in washington says that by accepting his claim that his actions were honourably intended , the bank has allowed mr wolfowitz to leave with , in theory at least , his reputation intact .
he has been under severe pressure for weeks , with a number of european politicians calling on him to step down to prevent the bank 's credibility from being eroded .
have your say " wolfowitz was an embarassment to the us and his departure was long overdue " bob apthorpe , austin , usa send us your comments the white house strongly supported mr wolfowitz - although experts believed its influence would not be enough to save his position in the face of european hostility .
a spokeswoman for the bank 's staff association - which had been at the forefront of calls for mr wolfowitz 's resignation - said : " he has damaged the institution and continues to damage it every day that he remains as its president . "
conflict of interest mr wolfowitz came under fire after details emerged about his role in securing a pay rise for ms riza , who used to work at the bank .
when appointed to his post in 2005 , he notified the bank of a potential conflict of interest because of his relationship with ms riza .
he asked to be allowed to recuse himself , or step aside , from any decisions regarding her future .
the bank 's ethics committee acknowledged a conflict of interest but did not allow mr wolfowitz to recuse himself .
mr wolfowitz then proposed to move ms riza to the us state department , where she would be paid and promoted apparently in line with her prospects at the world bank .
the bank accepted and ms riza was duly transferred .
her salary rose quickly to about $ 193,000 -lrb- £ 98,000 -rrb- - more than the $ 186,000 that secretary of state condoleezza rice receives before tax .
a panel of the world bank later found that mr wolfowitz had provoked a " conflict of interest " and broken its code of conduct .
the panel found that the salary mr wolfowitz arranged for ms riza had been higher than her due and that he had acted " in opposition to the rules of the institution " .
while admitting he made a mistake in his handling of the case , mr wolfowitz says he has been the victim of a smear campaign and ought to have followed his initial instinct to recuse himself .
the board is made up of representatives of the bank 's leading members including the us , uk , japan , france and germany .
the bank gave no further details of its agreement with mr wolfowitz .

emi , which is home to acts such as robbie williams and lily allen , said earlier this month that it was being eyed but that talks were " preliminary " .
a number of firms have been linked to emi , and reuters said its rival warner music was one of those interested , as well as private equity groups .
emi , which has issued two profit warnings this year , rejected a £ 2.1bn warner bid in march as being too low .
emi was also concerned that the warner bid would create operational and regulatory risks .
according to reuters , " people familiar with the situation " say that one equity , cereberus and fortress are among the other groups which have been scrutinising emi 's financial data .
independent record labels have been vocal critics of a consolidation in the music industry .
royalty attraction emi has suffered in recent years by the availability of digital downloads and internet piracy .
analysts have said that private investors are principally attracted to future royalties from emi 's back catalogue , which includes prized albums by the beatles , the beach boys , david bowie and coldplay .
emi reports its preliminary results on 23 may and analysts expect little respite in the tough trading conditions currently being experienced by the group .

here , cathy grieve explores how the catholic church in ireland has a new saviour : the immigrant .
polish immigrants pack into the weekly service in their language on a sunday evening at st augustine 's catholic church in cork city centre there is standing room only - and it is a cavernous building .
the choir has been practising for the last hour .
melodic , loud , sincere religious songs ring out .
at the back of the church there is a long queue , snaking up one of the side aisles .
a little red light above a confessional door indicates that forgiveness is on offer .
the young , mostly male polish worshippers wait their turn , patiently .
filing in one by one to confess their sins and take their penance , young men and women are breathing new life into one of ireland 's oldest traditional institutions , the catholic church .
father pat moran is the pryor at st augustine 's and has been a priest for more than 37 years .
he is excited by the new interest in the church .
" this is a new period of growth , the poles here are totally responsible for this .
it is infectious and re-energising for me too . "
revitalised fr moran says the new congregation has also introduced some competition .
" the polish choir introduced new ways of doing things , like using radio microphones made in poland .
irish election : your comments " our choir is now slowly adapting to the new ways and the two are sharing resources , " he said .
the polish mass lasts 90 minutes and many of the faithful remain afterwards for a separate service remembering the late pope john paul ii .
it is reminiscent of an irish catholic church of 20 years ago .
vibrant , busy , dedicated .
the bishop of cork and ross , john buckley , drops into the service to greet this new congregation and to urge them to support cork in upcoming sporting events .
he readily accepts that the immigrant community is a lifeline for the church , with many irish catholics having left following a difficult period of public scandals .
" we have had problems in the church , but we have dealt with them , unlike secular society , " he told the bbc news website .
" i believe irish people still have an affiliation with their catholic faith .
the sunday obligation to attend mass may no longer be relevant in people 's lives , but on the big occasions like weddings , funerals , baptisms , the faith is still there and evident . "
the church 's clergy hope to see more irish people attending bishop buckley catches up with the local polish priest , fr piotr galus , in the sacristy after mass .
they discuss the most recent pre-marriage course , conducted in polish , which is now also a regular addition to the church .
" i had almost 200 people attending , a lot of polish , romanian and other eastern europeans , but they were here with their irish partners .
it is funny to see irish catholics doing a course through polish and having it translated back to english for them , " fr piotr explained .
bishop buckley hopes the immigrants will bring their new irish families back to the church .
irish parishioner neil kelleher regularly attends the polish services and enjoys the lyrical and artistic efforts of the congregation .
" the polish are now as we , the irish , were in the 1960s .
there is great motivation amongst the polish people here and great involvement , " he said .
" i can also see integration happening - the polish attending the english-language masses and the english speakers attending the polish masses . "
new role but this new-found enthusiasm has still to be translated into more irish catholics returning to their church in an active way .
the invitation has been extended to young and old the 2006 census revealed that 3.4 million irish people declare themselves catholic , out of a total population of 4.2 million .
clearly there is still a need for irish catholics to keep their label , acknowledge their membership , belong to this traditional institution , but not the same need to actively take part or to take heed .
the catholic church may once have been all-powerful , setting the moral and political agenda for a willingly obliging society .
but that is no longer the case .
citizens of modern ireland still maintain their membership , but it is more of an a la carte approach to the faith .
the immigrant catholics may have given the church a life-saving transfusion , but the really big challenge for the catholic church here now is making itself relevant in a modern , independent and free-thinking ireland .

here , cathy grieve explores how the catholic church in ireland has a new saviour : the immigrant .
polish immigrants pack into the weekly service in their language on a sunday evening at st augustine 's catholic church in cork city centre there is standing room only - and it is a cavernous building .
the choir has been practising for the last hour .
melodic , loud , sincere religious songs ring out .
at the back of the church there is a long queue , snaking up one of the side aisles .
a little red light above a confessional door indicates that forgiveness is on offer .
the young , mostly male polish worshippers wait their turn , patiently .
filing in one by one to confess their sins and take their penance , young men and women are breathing new life into one of ireland 's oldest traditional institutions , the catholic church .
father pat moran is the pryor at st augustine 's and has been a priest for more than 37 years .
he is excited by the new interest in the church .
" this is a new period of growth , the poles here are totally responsible for this .
it is infectious and re-energising for me too . "
revitalised fr moran says the new congregation has also introduced some competition .
" the polish choir introduced new ways of doing things , like using radio microphones made in poland .
irish election : your comments " our choir is now slowly adapting to the new ways and the two are sharing resources , " he said .
the polish mass lasts 90 minutes and many of the faithful remain afterwards for a separate service remembering the late pope john paul ii .
it is reminiscent of an irish catholic church of 20 years ago .
vibrant , busy , dedicated .
the bishop of cork and ross , john buckley , drops into the service to greet this new congregation and to urge them to support cork in upcoming sporting events .
he readily accepts that the immigrant community is a lifeline for the church , with many irish catholics having left following a difficult period of public scandals .
" we have had problems in the church , but we have dealt with them , unlike secular society , " he told the bbc news website .
" i believe irish people still have an affiliation with their catholic faith .
the sunday obligation to attend mass may no longer be relevant in people 's lives , but on the big occasions like weddings , funerals , baptisms , the faith is still there and evident . "
the church 's clergy hope to see more irish people attending bishop buckley catches up with the local polish priest , fr piotr galus , in the sacristy after mass .
they discuss the most recent pre-marriage course , conducted in polish , which is now also a regular addition to the church .
" i had almost 200 people attending , a lot of polish , romanian and other eastern europeans , but they were here with their irish partners .
it is funny to see irish catholics doing a course through polish and having it translated back to english for them , " fr piotr explained .
bishop buckley hopes the immigrants will bring their new irish families back to the church .
irish parishioner neil kelleher regularly attends the polish services and enjoys the lyrical and artistic efforts of the congregation .
" the polish are now as we , the irish , were in the 1960s .
there is great motivation amongst the polish people here and great involvement , " he said .
" i can also see integration happening - the polish attending the english-language masses and the english speakers attending the polish masses . "
new role but this new-found enthusiasm has still to be translated into more irish catholics returning to their church in an active way .
the invitation has been extended to young and old the 2006 census revealed that 3.4 million irish people declare themselves catholic , out of a total population of 4.2 million .
clearly there is still a need for irish catholics to keep their label , acknowledge their membership , belong to this traditional institution , but not the same need to actively take part or to take heed .
the catholic church may once have been all-powerful , setting the moral and political agenda for a willingly obliging society .
but that is no longer the case .
citizens of modern ireland still maintain their membership , but it is more of an a la carte approach to the faith .
the immigrant catholics may have given the church a life-saving transfusion , but the really big challenge for the catholic church here now is making itself relevant in a modern , independent and free-thinking ireland .
