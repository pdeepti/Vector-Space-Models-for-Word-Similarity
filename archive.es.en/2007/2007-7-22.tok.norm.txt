" you can think what you want of the book , " said wallraff , who added he had discussed the book with muslim acquaintances on numerous occasions .
" you can have serious confrontations about it and even fight over it . " as part of the dialog he wants to open , wallraff said he wished german muslims would distance themselves from the 1989 fatwa to kill rushdie issued by iran 's late ayatollah khomeini .
wallraff said he believed he had already achieved an initial success when ditib recently condemned the fatwa . turkish group faces dilemma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wallraff said he 'd get police protection if necessary but wallraff 's proposal puts the ditib in a difficult position .
if it refuses the reading , it will show a lack of liberality ; if , on the other hand , it allows the reading , it will upset a large number of its members .
the group has said it will not issue its decision until after its advisory board returns from summer vacations . the timing of the proposal is also difficult for ditib as the mosque 's construction continues to divide cologne . " a makeshift mosque has been there for 20 years and the people have the right to build a respectable and presentably modern mosque , " wallraff said . " here in cologne , where i live , it 's taken on a hysterical form of confrontation .

" you can think what you want of the book , " said wallraff , who added he had discussed the book with muslim acquaintances on numerous occasions .
" you can have serious confrontations about it and even fight over it . " as part of the dialog he wants to open , wallraff said he wished german muslims would distance themselves from the 1989 fatwa to kill rushdie issued by iran 's late ayatollah khomeini .
wallraff said he believed he had already achieved an initial success when ditib recently condemned the fatwa . turkish group faces dilemma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wallraff said he 'd get police protection if necessary but wallraff 's proposal puts the ditib in a difficult position .
if it refuses the reading , it will show a lack of liberality ; if , on the other hand , it allows the reading , it will upset a large number of its members .
the group has said it will not issue its decision until after its advisory board returns from summer vacations . the timing of the proposal is also difficult for ditib as the mosque 's construction continues to divide cologne . " a makeshift mosque has been there for 20 years and the people have the right to build a respectable and presentably modern mosque , " wallraff said . " here in cologne , where i live , it 's taken on a hysterical form of confrontation .
far-right extremists tried to mobilize people against the mosque and pushed the discussion in the completely wrong direction , " he said . german muslims are different german muslims should also not be lumped together with radical islamists that exist in some other parts of the world , wallraff said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish-islamic union is yet to respond to wallraff 's suggestion " the muslims i know living in germany are - to a very large extent - peace-loving people .
not fanatics , " he said . " there are some in the second and third generation who can really compare and see the positive sides of both cultures .
for me , these are the people of the future , and they are the people with whom i want to discuss this kind of book . " wallraff said he was confident the reading would take place .
he is viewed positively among germany 's turkish population for his book " lowest of the low , " in which he described the discrimination he experienced while posing as a turkish worker in germany . " my entire work stands for integration , " he said .
" i 'm someone who gets along with his neighbors , especially turkish neighbors , as friends .
no one can accuse me of getting involved in something i do n't understand or something that does n't concern me . " dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on may 30 , former stuttgart and bayern skipper felix magath took over . to signal a new era , magath was named not just coach , but also sporting director .
and he 's gotten plenty of fresh talent to work with - some of it poached from the wolves ' bundesliga rivals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magath hopes to get the wolves pointed in the right direction one victim was cottbus .
wolfsburg bought both of the small east german club 's top scorers from last season - romanians vlad munteanu and sergiu radu . they joined ashkan dejagah , a talented young midfielder already lured away from hertha berlin with a near million-euro contract in the second half of last season . the wolves have also been on the prowl internationally , bagging bosnian striker edin dzeko and portugese national defender ricardo costa . and on wednesday , the club announced it was loaning midfielder christian gentner from champions stuttgart for a year . the future is now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcelinho has some new playmates for the new campaign wolfsburg has spent more than 10 million euros -lrb- $ 13.8 million -rrb- on transfers - a pittance compared with bayern 's shop-til-you-drop summer binge , but a huge investment for a club without a history of success or a national fan base . magath has proved a winner in the past , and many soccer pundits are speculating that the wolves could join the ranks of the bundesliga 's alpha males in 2007-8 . their defense , already solid last year , has been reinforced , while the new midfielders could link up well with star playmaker marcelinho and talented jacek krzynowek .
more importantly , the wolves have infused some new blood into their attack , which was absolutely anemic in 2006-7 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg hope to fly instead of flop but there are dangers in trying to turn a team around from one season to the next instead of slowly building a squad . magath 's starting eleven will likely feature players who have never worked together before , and it 's unclear who will be their leader on the pitch .
moreover , wolfsburg have been burned by star signings in the past . in 2003 , the wolves also bid to escape mediocrity by splashing out for playmaker andrés d 'alessandro .
but the big bucks bought a big ego , and the oft-injured argentine abandoned wolfsburg after two-and-a-half seasons , having scored only eight goals . wolfsburg went on to finish fifteenth .
if this season 's new additions do n't pan out , the wolves could find themselves once again howling at the moon - at the back of the pack . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . my wife and i have just returned from a wonderful holiday in berchtesgaden .
the town and the surrounding countryside are delightful .
we spent most of our holiday walking in the magnificent berchtesgadenland national park .
it was our second visit and we can not wait to return . - bryan phillips , great britain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresden 's rebuilt frauenkirche our two-week visit to three european countries and several cities was highlighted by seeing the reconstructed frauenkirche in dresden .
we had been there in 2000 and seen the carefully stacked stones rescued from the bombing .
to see the church in all its original glory and to hear a litany whose congregational response was " father forgive " as a choir from coventry , england , stood ready to sing was a spiritual epiphany .
remembering that the nazis bombed the coventry cathedral in 1940 and the allies bombed frauenkirche in 1945 and that both cities have sent delegations to sing and ask forgiveness is a bright spot on a dismal prospect for world peace .
the architecture is stunningly beautiful .

" you can think what you want of the book , " said wallraff , who added he had discussed the book with muslim acquaintances on numerous occasions .
" you can have serious confrontations about it and even fight over it . " as part of the dialog he wants to open , wallraff said he wished german muslims would distance themselves from the 1989 fatwa to kill rushdie issued by iran 's late ayatollah khomeini .
wallraff said he believed he had already achieved an initial success when ditib recently condemned the fatwa . turkish group faces dilemma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wallraff said he 'd get police protection if necessary but wallraff 's proposal puts the ditib in a difficult position .
if it refuses the reading , it will show a lack of liberality ; if , on the other hand , it allows the reading , it will upset a large number of its members .
the group has said it will not issue its decision until after its advisory board returns from summer vacations . the timing of the proposal is also difficult for ditib as the mosque 's construction continues to divide cologne . " a makeshift mosque has been there for 20 years and the people have the right to build a respectable and presentably modern mosque , " wallraff said . " here in cologne , where i live , it 's taken on a hysterical form of confrontation .
far-right extremists tried to mobilize people against the mosque and pushed the discussion in the completely wrong direction , " he said . german muslims are different german muslims should also not be lumped together with radical islamists that exist in some other parts of the world , wallraff said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish-islamic union is yet to respond to wallraff 's suggestion " the muslims i know living in germany are - to a very large extent - peace-loving people .
not fanatics , " he said . " there are some in the second and third generation who can really compare and see the positive sides of both cultures .
for me , these are the people of the future , and they are the people with whom i want to discuss this kind of book . " wallraff said he was confident the reading would take place .
he is viewed positively among germany 's turkish population for his book " lowest of the low , " in which he described the discrimination he experienced while posing as a turkish worker in germany . " my entire work stands for integration , " he said .

wolfsburg have brought in a host of new faces after 11 straight years of first-division mediocrity .
they 've tried it before - but this season could yield results . last season was barely over , when wolfsburg commenced their latest and largest rebuilding program . after finishing fifteenth - one place away from relegation - for the second straight year , the volkswagen-sponsored club immediately fired coach klaus augenthaler .
on may 30 , former stuttgart and bayern skipper felix magath took over . to signal a new era , magath was named not just coach , but also sporting director .
and he 's gotten plenty of fresh talent to work with - some of it poached from the wolves ' bundesliga rivals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magath hopes to get the wolves pointed in the right direction one victim was cottbus .
wolfsburg bought both of the small east german club 's top scorers from last season - romanians vlad munteanu and sergiu radu . they joined ashkan dejagah , a talented young midfielder already lured away from hertha berlin with a near million-euro contract in the second half of last season . the wolves have also been on the prowl internationally , bagging bosnian striker edin dzeko and portugese national defender ricardo costa . and on wednesday , the club announced it was loaning midfielder christian gentner from champions stuttgart for a year . the future is now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcelinho has some new playmates for the new campaign wolfsburg has spent more than 10 million euros -lrb- $ 13.8 million -rrb- on transfers - a pittance compared with bayern 's shop-til-you-drop summer binge , but a huge investment for a club without a history of success or a national fan base . magath has proved a winner in the past , and many soccer pundits are speculating that the wolves could join the ranks of the bundesliga 's alpha males in 2007-8 . their defense , already solid last year , has been reinforced , while the new midfielders could link up well with star playmaker marcelinho and talented jacek krzynowek .
more importantly , the wolves have infused some new blood into their attack , which was absolutely anemic in 2006-7 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg hope to fly instead of flop but there are dangers in trying to turn a team around from one season to the next instead of slowly building a squad . magath 's starting eleven will likely feature players who have never worked together before , and it 's unclear who will be their leader on the pitch .
moreover , wolfsburg have been burned by star signings in the past . in 2003 , the wolves also bid to escape mediocrity by splashing out for playmaker andrés d 'alessandro .
but the big bucks bought a big ego , and the oft-injured argentine abandoned wolfsburg after two-and-a-half seasons , having scored only eight goals . wolfsburg went on to finish fifteenth .
if this season 's new additions do n't pan out , the wolves could find themselves once again howling at the moon - at the back of the pack . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" you can think what you want of the book , " said wallraff , who added he had discussed the book with muslim acquaintances on numerous occasions .
" you can have serious confrontations about it and even fight over it . " as part of the dialog he wants to open , wallraff said he wished german muslims would distance themselves from the 1989 fatwa to kill rushdie issued by iran 's late ayatollah khomeini .
wallraff said he believed he had already achieved an initial success when ditib recently condemned the fatwa . turkish group faces dilemma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wallraff said he 'd get police protection if necessary but wallraff 's proposal puts the ditib in a difficult position .
if it refuses the reading , it will show a lack of liberality ; if , on the other hand , it allows the reading , it will upset a large number of its members .
the group has said it will not issue its decision until after its advisory board returns from summer vacations . the timing of the proposal is also difficult for ditib as the mosque 's construction continues to divide cologne . " a makeshift mosque has been there for 20 years and the people have the right to build a respectable and presentably modern mosque , " wallraff said . " here in cologne , where i live , it 's taken on a hysterical form of confrontation .
far-right extremists tried to mobilize people against the mosque and pushed the discussion in the completely wrong direction , " he said . german muslims are different german muslims should also not be lumped together with radical islamists that exist in some other parts of the world , wallraff said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish-islamic union is yet to respond to wallraff 's suggestion " the muslims i know living in germany are - to a very large extent - peace-loving people .
not fanatics , " he said . " there are some in the second and third generation who can really compare and see the positive sides of both cultures .
for me , these are the people of the future , and they are the people with whom i want to discuss this kind of book . " wallraff said he was confident the reading would take place .
he is viewed positively among germany 's turkish population for his book " lowest of the low , " in which he described the discrimination he experienced while posing as a turkish worker in germany . " my entire work stands for integration , " he said .
" i 'm someone who gets along with his neighbors , especially turkish neighbors , as friends .
no one can accuse me of getting involved in something i do n't understand or something that does n't concern me . " dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

wolfsburg have brought in a host of new faces after 11 straight years of first-division mediocrity .
they 've tried it before - but this season could yield results . last season was barely over , when wolfsburg commenced their latest and largest rebuilding program . after finishing fifteenth - one place away from relegation - for the second straight year , the volkswagen-sponsored club immediately fired coach klaus augenthaler .
on may 30 , former stuttgart and bayern skipper felix magath took over . to signal a new era , magath was named not just coach , but also sporting director .

wolfsburg bought both of the small east german club 's top scorers from last season - romanians vlad munteanu and sergiu radu . they joined ashkan dejagah , a talented young midfielder already lured away from hertha berlin with a near million-euro contract in the second half of last season . the wolves have also been on the prowl internationally , bagging bosnian striker edin dzeko and portugese national defender ricardo costa . and on wednesday , the club announced it was loaning midfielder christian gentner from champions stuttgart for a year . the future is now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcelinho has some new playmates for the new campaign wolfsburg has spent more than 10 million euros -lrb- $ 13.8 million -rrb- on transfers - a pittance compared with bayern 's shop-til-you-drop summer binge , but a huge investment for a club without a history of success or a national fan base . magath has proved a winner in the past , and many soccer pundits are speculating that the wolves could join the ranks of the bundesliga 's alpha males in 2007-8 . their defense , already solid last year , has been reinforced , while the new midfielders could link up well with star playmaker marcelinho and talented jacek krzynowek .
more importantly , the wolves have infused some new blood into their attack , which was absolutely anemic in 2006-7 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg hope to fly instead of flop but there are dangers in trying to turn a team around from one season to the next instead of slowly building a squad . magath 's starting eleven will likely feature players who have never worked together before , and it 's unclear who will be their leader on the pitch .
moreover , wolfsburg have been burned by star signings in the past . in 2003 , the wolves also bid to escape mediocrity by splashing out for playmaker andrés d 'alessandro .
but the big bucks bought a big ego , and the oft-injured argentine abandoned wolfsburg after two-and-a-half seasons , having scored only eight goals . wolfsburg went on to finish fifteenth .

after lying on the ground for some time , he was shot . on its web site , the paper said that the kidnappers were not part of the taliban insurgency but were pashtun bandits .
it said only an autopsy could show if rüdiger , abducted wednesday , was already dead when shot . it said that german consular officials had spoken sunday by telephone to the second german hostage . the spokesman for the governor of maidan wardak province said the man had lost a lot of blood from the wound .
the body was being taken from the central province to kabul for further examination . a provincial police chief said earlier that their forces had also located an afghan who was still alive and had been kidnapped on wednesday along with the dead german , one of two germans abducted . germany will not be blackmailed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor angela merkel in berlin , chancellor angela merkel said on sunday in a television interview that germany would not allow itself to be blackmailed by the taliban . " we are not going to respond to demands from the area of the taliban , " merkel told the ard public television .
" we can not be blackmailed . " merkel 's comments were made public before the program was aired . she said she had " no new reliable information " regarding how the hostage died or on the whereabouts of the other man . claims of executions two german engineers along with their five afghan colleagues were kidnapped on wednesday in jaghato district of central maidan wardak province .
initially a taliban spokesman had claimed on saturday that they executed the two germans along with five afghans because germany refused to meet the group 's demands .
but later during the day , the afghan ministry of foreign affairs said that one of the two german died of extreme heat or a heart attack , and the second was still alive .
" our forces found a dead body that they say belongs to a german engineer in jaghato district and they are on their way to the center of the province , " mohammad hewazali mazloom , provincial police chief of maidan wardak told deutsche presse-agentur dpa .
he said could not elaborate on the cause of his death , but said that eshaq noorzai , brother of arif khan noorzai , afghan parliament 's deputy speaker was also with police .
taliban had earlier said that they killed eshaq noorzai along with four other afghans and two germans on saturday after the taliban leadership council ordered their death sentence .
unfolding events bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in berlin , officials said a german foreign ministry 24-hour crisis team continued to follow developments on sunday amid public shock at the death of the aid engineer .
" the team remains in close contact with the afghan government and is still trying to resolve this , " a berlin spokesman said .
foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier had said on saturday evening that it was assumed the kidnapped man had died of the " strains " from his ordeal and had not been directly murdered by the kidnappers .
a german sunday newspaper , bild am sonntag , however , said that german officials had been able to obtain a preliminary view of the body and had seen gunshot wounds .
the foreign ministry declined to comment on that report . emphasis on reconstruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers are mostly stationed in northern afghanistan germany has some 3,000 troops in afghanistan that are stationed mainly in the relatively peaceful north .

" you can think what you want of the book , " said wallraff , who added he had discussed the book with muslim acquaintances on numerous occasions .
" you can have serious confrontations about it and even fight over it . " as part of the dialog he wants to open , wallraff said he wished german muslims would distance themselves from the 1989 fatwa to kill rushdie issued by iran 's late ayatollah khomeini .
wallraff said he believed he had already achieved an initial success when ditib recently condemned the fatwa . turkish group faces dilemma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wallraff said he 'd get police protection if necessary but wallraff 's proposal puts the ditib in a difficult position .

the group has said it will not issue its decision until after its advisory board returns from summer vacations . the timing of the proposal is also difficult for ditib as the mosque 's construction continues to divide cologne . " a makeshift mosque has been there for 20 years and the people have the right to build a respectable and presentably modern mosque , " wallraff said . " here in cologne , where i live , it 's taken on a hysterical form of confrontation .

wolfsburg have brought in a host of new faces after 11 straight years of first-division mediocrity .
they 've tried it before - but this season could yield results . last season was barely over , when wolfsburg commenced their latest and largest rebuilding program . after finishing fifteenth - one place away from relegation - for the second straight year , the volkswagen-sponsored club immediately fired coach klaus augenthaler .
on may 30 , former stuttgart and bayern skipper felix magath took over . to signal a new era , magath was named not just coach , but also sporting director .
and he 's gotten plenty of fresh talent to work with - some of it poached from the wolves ' bundesliga rivals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magath hopes to get the wolves pointed in the right direction one victim was cottbus .
wolfsburg bought both of the small east german club 's top scorers from last season - romanians vlad munteanu and sergiu radu . they joined ashkan dejagah , a talented young midfielder already lured away from hertha berlin with a near million-euro contract in the second half of last season . the wolves have also been on the prowl internationally , bagging bosnian striker edin dzeko and portugese national defender ricardo costa . and on wednesday , the club announced it was loaning midfielder christian gentner from champions stuttgart for a year . the future is now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcelinho has some new playmates for the new campaign wolfsburg has spent more than 10 million euros -lrb- $ 13.8 million -rrb- on transfers - a pittance compared with bayern 's shop-til-you-drop summer binge , but a huge investment for a club without a history of success or a national fan base . magath has proved a winner in the past , and many soccer pundits are speculating that the wolves could join the ranks of the bundesliga 's alpha males in 2007-8 . their defense , already solid last year , has been reinforced , while the new midfielders could link up well with star playmaker marcelinho and talented jacek krzynowek .
more importantly , the wolves have infused some new blood into their attack , which was absolutely anemic in 2006-7 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg hope to fly instead of flop but there are dangers in trying to turn a team around from one season to the next instead of slowly building a squad . magath 's starting eleven will likely feature players who have never worked together before , and it 's unclear who will be their leader on the pitch .
moreover , wolfsburg have been burned by star signings in the past . in 2003 , the wolves also bid to escape mediocrity by splashing out for playmaker andrés d 'alessandro .
but the big bucks bought a big ego , and the oft-injured argentine abandoned wolfsburg after two-and-a-half seasons , having scored only eight goals . wolfsburg went on to finish fifteenth .
if this season 's new additions do n't pan out , the wolves could find themselves once again howling at the moon - at the back of the pack . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

we had been there in 2000 and seen the carefully stacked stones rescued from the bombing .
to see the church in all its original glory and to hear a litany whose congregational response was " father forgive " as a choir from coventry , england , stood ready to sing was a spiritual epiphany .
remembering that the nazis bombed the coventry cathedral in 1940 and the allies bombed frauenkirche in 1945 and that both cities have sent delegations to sing and ask forgiveness is a bright spot on a dismal prospect for world peace .
the architecture is stunningly beautiful .
the detail is exquisite .

wolfsburg have brought in a host of new faces after 11 straight years of first-division mediocrity .
they 've tried it before - but this season could yield results . last season was barely over , when wolfsburg commenced their latest and largest rebuilding program . after finishing fifteenth - one place away from relegation - for the second straight year , the volkswagen-sponsored club immediately fired coach klaus augenthaler .
on may 30 , former stuttgart and bayern skipper felix magath took over . to signal a new era , magath was named not just coach , but also sporting director .
and he 's gotten plenty of fresh talent to work with - some of it poached from the wolves ' bundesliga rivals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magath hopes to get the wolves pointed in the right direction one victim was cottbus .
wolfsburg bought both of the small east german club 's top scorers from last season - romanians vlad munteanu and sergiu radu . they joined ashkan dejagah , a talented young midfielder already lured away from hertha berlin with a near million-euro contract in the second half of last season . the wolves have also been on the prowl internationally , bagging bosnian striker edin dzeko and portugese national defender ricardo costa . and on wednesday , the club announced it was loaning midfielder christian gentner from champions stuttgart for a year . the future is now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcelinho has some new playmates for the new campaign wolfsburg has spent more than 10 million euros -lrb- $ 13.8 million -rrb- on transfers - a pittance compared with bayern 's shop-til-you-drop summer binge , but a huge investment for a club without a history of success or a national fan base . magath has proved a winner in the past , and many soccer pundits are speculating that the wolves could join the ranks of the bundesliga 's alpha males in 2007-8 . their defense , already solid last year , has been reinforced , while the new midfielders could link up well with star playmaker marcelinho and talented jacek krzynowek .
more importantly , the wolves have infused some new blood into their attack , which was absolutely anemic in 2006-7 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg hope to fly instead of flop but there are dangers in trying to turn a team around from one season to the next instead of slowly building a squad . magath 's starting eleven will likely feature players who have never worked together before , and it 's unclear who will be their leader on the pitch .
moreover , wolfsburg have been burned by star signings in the past . in 2003 , the wolves also bid to escape mediocrity by splashing out for playmaker andrés d 'alessandro .
but the big bucks bought a big ego , and the oft-injured argentine abandoned wolfsburg after two-and-a-half seasons , having scored only eight goals . wolfsburg went on to finish fifteenth .
if this season 's new additions do n't pan out , the wolves could find themselves once again howling at the moon - at the back of the pack . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" you can think what you want of the book , " said wallraff , who added he had discussed the book with muslim acquaintances on numerous occasions .
" you can have serious confrontations about it and even fight over it . " as part of the dialog he wants to open , wallraff said he wished german muslims would distance themselves from the 1989 fatwa to kill rushdie issued by iran 's late ayatollah khomeini .
wallraff said he believed he had already achieved an initial success when ditib recently condemned the fatwa . turkish group faces dilemma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wallraff said he 'd get police protection if necessary but wallraff 's proposal puts the ditib in a difficult position .
if it refuses the reading , it will show a lack of liberality ; if , on the other hand , it allows the reading , it will upset a large number of its members .
the group has said it will not issue its decision until after its advisory board returns from summer vacations . the timing of the proposal is also difficult for ditib as the mosque 's construction continues to divide cologne . " a makeshift mosque has been there for 20 years and the people have the right to build a respectable and presentably modern mosque , " wallraff said . " here in cologne , where i live , it 's taken on a hysterical form of confrontation .
far-right extremists tried to mobilize people against the mosque and pushed the discussion in the completely wrong direction , " he said . german muslims are different german muslims should also not be lumped together with radical islamists that exist in some other parts of the world , wallraff said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish-islamic union is yet to respond to wallraff 's suggestion " the muslims i know living in germany are - to a very large extent - peace-loving people .
not fanatics , " he said . " there are some in the second and third generation who can really compare and see the positive sides of both cultures .
for me , these are the people of the future , and they are the people with whom i want to discuss this kind of book . " wallraff said he was confident the reading would take place .
he is viewed positively among germany 's turkish population for his book " lowest of the low , " in which he described the discrimination he experienced while posing as a turkish worker in germany . " my entire work stands for integration , " he said .
" i 'm someone who gets along with his neighbors , especially turkish neighbors , as friends .

" you can think what you want of the book , " said wallraff , who added he had discussed the book with muslim acquaintances on numerous occasions .
" you can have serious confrontations about it and even fight over it . " as part of the dialog he wants to open , wallraff said he wished german muslims would distance themselves from the 1989 fatwa to kill rushdie issued by iran 's late ayatollah khomeini .
wallraff said he believed he had already achieved an initial success when ditib recently condemned the fatwa . turkish group faces dilemma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wallraff said he 'd get police protection if necessary but wallraff 's proposal puts the ditib in a difficult position .
if it refuses the reading , it will show a lack of liberality ; if , on the other hand , it allows the reading , it will upset a large number of its members .
the group has said it will not issue its decision until after its advisory board returns from summer vacations . the timing of the proposal is also difficult for ditib as the mosque 's construction continues to divide cologne . " a makeshift mosque has been there for 20 years and the people have the right to build a respectable and presentably modern mosque , " wallraff said . " here in cologne , where i live , it 's taken on a hysterical form of confrontation .
far-right extremists tried to mobilize people against the mosque and pushed the discussion in the completely wrong direction , " he said . german muslims are different german muslims should also not be lumped together with radical islamists that exist in some other parts of the world , wallraff said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish-islamic union is yet to respond to wallraff 's suggestion " the muslims i know living in germany are - to a very large extent - peace-loving people .
not fanatics , " he said . " there are some in the second and third generation who can really compare and see the positive sides of both cultures .
for me , these are the people of the future , and they are the people with whom i want to discuss this kind of book . " wallraff said he was confident the reading would take place .
he is viewed positively among germany 's turkish population for his book " lowest of the low , " in which he described the discrimination he experienced while posing as a turkish worker in germany . " my entire work stands for integration , " he said .
" i 'm someone who gets along with his neighbors , especially turkish neighbors , as friends .
no one can accuse me of getting involved in something i do n't understand or something that does n't concern me . " dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

wolfsburg have brought in a host of new faces after 11 straight years of first-division mediocrity .
they 've tried it before - but this season could yield results . last season was barely over , when wolfsburg commenced their latest and largest rebuilding program . after finishing fifteenth - one place away from relegation - for the second straight year , the volkswagen-sponsored club immediately fired coach klaus augenthaler .

wolfsburg bought both of the small east german club 's top scorers from last season - romanians vlad munteanu and sergiu radu . they joined ashkan dejagah , a talented young midfielder already lured away from hertha berlin with a near million-euro contract in the second half of last season . the wolves have also been on the prowl internationally , bagging bosnian striker edin dzeko and portugese national defender ricardo costa . and on wednesday , the club announced it was loaning midfielder christian gentner from champions stuttgart for a year . the future is now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcelinho has some new playmates for the new campaign wolfsburg has spent more than 10 million euros -lrb- $ 13.8 million -rrb- on transfers - a pittance compared with bayern 's shop-til-you-drop summer binge , but a huge investment for a club without a history of success or a national fan base . magath has proved a winner in the past , and many soccer pundits are speculating that the wolves could join the ranks of the bundesliga 's alpha males in 2007-8 . their defense , already solid last year , has been reinforced , while the new midfielders could link up well with star playmaker marcelinho and talented jacek krzynowek .

moreover , wolfsburg have been burned by star signings in the past . in 2003 , the wolves also bid to escape mediocrity by splashing out for playmaker andrés d 'alessandro .
but the big bucks bought a big ego , and the oft-injured argentine abandoned wolfsburg after two-and-a-half seasons , having scored only eight goals . wolfsburg went on to finish fifteenth .

" you can think what you want of the book , " said wallraff , who added he had discussed the book with muslim acquaintances on numerous occasions .
" you can have serious confrontations about it and even fight over it . " as part of the dialog he wants to open , wallraff said he wished german muslims would distance themselves from the 1989 fatwa to kill rushdie issued by iran 's late ayatollah khomeini .
wallraff said he believed he had already achieved an initial success when ditib recently condemned the fatwa . turkish group faces dilemma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wallraff said he 'd get police protection if necessary but wallraff 's proposal puts the ditib in a difficult position .
if it refuses the reading , it will show a lack of liberality ; if , on the other hand , it allows the reading , it will upset a large number of its members .
the group has said it will not issue its decision until after its advisory board returns from summer vacations . the timing of the proposal is also difficult for ditib as the mosque 's construction continues to divide cologne . " a makeshift mosque has been there for 20 years and the people have the right to build a respectable and presentably modern mosque , " wallraff said . " here in cologne , where i live , it 's taken on a hysterical form of confrontation .
far-right extremists tried to mobilize people against the mosque and pushed the discussion in the completely wrong direction , " he said . german muslims are different german muslims should also not be lumped together with radical islamists that exist in some other parts of the world , wallraff said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish-islamic union is yet to respond to wallraff 's suggestion " the muslims i know living in germany are - to a very large extent - peace-loving people .
not fanatics , " he said . " there are some in the second and third generation who can really compare and see the positive sides of both cultures .
for me , these are the people of the future , and they are the people with whom i want to discuss this kind of book . " wallraff said he was confident the reading would take place .
he is viewed positively among germany 's turkish population for his book " lowest of the low , " in which he described the discrimination he experienced while posing as a turkish worker in germany . " my entire work stands for integration , " he said .
" i 'm someone who gets along with his neighbors , especially turkish neighbors , as friends .

wolfsburg have brought in a host of new faces after 11 straight years of first-division mediocrity .
they 've tried it before - but this season could yield results . last season was barely over , when wolfsburg commenced their latest and largest rebuilding program . after finishing fifteenth - one place away from relegation - for the second straight year , the volkswagen-sponsored club immediately fired coach klaus augenthaler .
on may 30 , former stuttgart and bayern skipper felix magath took over . to signal a new era , magath was named not just coach , but also sporting director .
and he 's gotten plenty of fresh talent to work with - some of it poached from the wolves ' bundesliga rivals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magath hopes to get the wolves pointed in the right direction one victim was cottbus .
wolfsburg bought both of the small east german club 's top scorers from last season - romanians vlad munteanu and sergiu radu . they joined ashkan dejagah , a talented young midfielder already lured away from hertha berlin with a near million-euro contract in the second half of last season . the wolves have also been on the prowl internationally , bagging bosnian striker edin dzeko and portugese national defender ricardo costa . and on wednesday , the club announced it was loaning midfielder christian gentner from champions stuttgart for a year . the future is now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcelinho has some new playmates for the new campaign wolfsburg has spent more than 10 million euros -lrb- $ 13.8 million -rrb- on transfers - a pittance compared with bayern 's shop-til-you-drop summer binge , but a huge investment for a club without a history of success or a national fan base . magath has proved a winner in the past , and many soccer pundits are speculating that the wolves could join the ranks of the bundesliga 's alpha males in 2007-8 . their defense , already solid last year , has been reinforced , while the new midfielders could link up well with star playmaker marcelinho and talented jacek krzynowek .
more importantly , the wolves have infused some new blood into their attack , which was absolutely anemic in 2006-7 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg hope to fly instead of flop but there are dangers in trying to turn a team around from one season to the next instead of slowly building a squad . magath 's starting eleven will likely feature players who have never worked together before , and it 's unclear who will be their leader on the pitch .
moreover , wolfsburg have been burned by star signings in the past . in 2003 , the wolves also bid to escape mediocrity by splashing out for playmaker andrés d 'alessandro .
but the big bucks bought a big ego , and the oft-injured argentine abandoned wolfsburg after two-and-a-half seasons , having scored only eight goals . wolfsburg went on to finish fifteenth .
if this season 's new additions do n't pan out , the wolves could find themselves once again howling at the moon - at the back of the pack . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

wolfsburg have brought in a host of new faces after 11 straight years of first-division mediocrity .
they 've tried it before - but this season could yield results . last season was barely over , when wolfsburg commenced their latest and largest rebuilding program . after finishing fifteenth - one place away from relegation - for the second straight year , the volkswagen-sponsored club immediately fired coach klaus augenthaler .
on may 30 , former stuttgart and bayern skipper felix magath took over . to signal a new era , magath was named not just coach , but also sporting director .
and he 's gotten plenty of fresh talent to work with - some of it poached from the wolves ' bundesliga rivals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magath hopes to get the wolves pointed in the right direction one victim was cottbus .
wolfsburg bought both of the small east german club 's top scorers from last season - romanians vlad munteanu and sergiu radu . they joined ashkan dejagah , a talented young midfielder already lured away from hertha berlin with a near million-euro contract in the second half of last season . the wolves have also been on the prowl internationally , bagging bosnian striker edin dzeko and portugese national defender ricardo costa . and on wednesday , the club announced it was loaning midfielder christian gentner from champions stuttgart for a year . the future is now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcelinho has some new playmates for the new campaign wolfsburg has spent more than 10 million euros -lrb- $ 13.8 million -rrb- on transfers - a pittance compared with bayern 's shop-til-you-drop summer binge , but a huge investment for a club without a history of success or a national fan base . magath has proved a winner in the past , and many soccer pundits are speculating that the wolves could join the ranks of the bundesliga 's alpha males in 2007-8 . their defense , already solid last year , has been reinforced , while the new midfielders could link up well with star playmaker marcelinho and talented jacek krzynowek .
more importantly , the wolves have infused some new blood into their attack , which was absolutely anemic in 2006-7 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg hope to fly instead of flop but there are dangers in trying to turn a team around from one season to the next instead of slowly building a squad . magath 's starting eleven will likely feature players who have never worked together before , and it 's unclear who will be their leader on the pitch .
moreover , wolfsburg have been burned by star signings in the past . in 2003 , the wolves also bid to escape mediocrity by splashing out for playmaker andrés d 'alessandro .
but the big bucks bought a big ego , and the oft-injured argentine abandoned wolfsburg after two-and-a-half seasons , having scored only eight goals . wolfsburg went on to finish fifteenth .
if this season 's new additions do n't pan out , the wolves could find themselves once again howling at the moon - at the back of the pack . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

to see the church in all its original glory and to hear a litany whose congregational response was " father forgive " as a choir from coventry , england , stood ready to sing was a spiritual epiphany .
remembering that the nazis bombed the coventry cathedral in 1940 and the allies bombed frauenkirche in 1945 and that both cities have sent delegations to sing and ask forgiveness is a bright spot on a dismal prospect for world peace .

wolfsburg have brought in a host of new faces after 11 straight years of first-division mediocrity .
they 've tried it before - but this season could yield results . last season was barely over , when wolfsburg commenced their latest and largest rebuilding program . after finishing fifteenth - one place away from relegation - for the second straight year , the volkswagen-sponsored club immediately fired coach klaus augenthaler .

wolfsburg bought both of the small east german club 's top scorers from last season - romanians vlad munteanu and sergiu radu . they joined ashkan dejagah , a talented young midfielder already lured away from hertha berlin with a near million-euro contract in the second half of last season . the wolves have also been on the prowl internationally , bagging bosnian striker edin dzeko and portugese national defender ricardo costa . and on wednesday , the club announced it was loaning midfielder christian gentner from champions stuttgart for a year . the future is now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcelinho has some new playmates for the new campaign wolfsburg has spent more than 10 million euros -lrb- $ 13.8 million -rrb- on transfers - a pittance compared with bayern 's shop-til-you-drop summer binge , but a huge investment for a club without a history of success or a national fan base . magath has proved a winner in the past , and many soccer pundits are speculating that the wolves could join the ranks of the bundesliga 's alpha males in 2007-8 . their defense , already solid last year , has been reinforced , while the new midfielders could link up well with star playmaker marcelinho and talented jacek krzynowek .
more importantly , the wolves have infused some new blood into their attack , which was absolutely anemic in 2006-7 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg hope to fly instead of flop but there are dangers in trying to turn a team around from one season to the next instead of slowly building a squad . magath 's starting eleven will likely feature players who have never worked together before , and it 's unclear who will be their leader on the pitch .
moreover , wolfsburg have been burned by star signings in the past . in 2003 , the wolves also bid to escape mediocrity by splashing out for playmaker andrés d 'alessandro .
but the big bucks bought a big ego , and the oft-injured argentine abandoned wolfsburg after two-and-a-half seasons , having scored only eight goals . wolfsburg went on to finish fifteenth .

the explosion and fire at bp 's texas city refinery killed 15 people and injured 180 staff .
the citations , including one for a violation osha said may have led to another major accident , come from its post-blast monitoring of the plant .
bp has two weeks to contest the citations and penalties .
a spokesman said the firm was studying the allegations before deciding how to proceed , but added that many of the points made were already being addressed .
bp is being investigated by the us chemical safety board -lrb- csb -rrb- and us justice department over the explosion which killed 15 people an injured 180 .
and an internal report in may said that bp executives should be sacked for failing to prevent a fatal blast .
us investigators have already rapped the company over the blast .
the csb blamed lax safety culture at the firm as well as cost-cutting , bad management culture and worker fatigue .
bp also has faced legal suits from workers and their families and paid millions in settlements .
the aftermath of the texas city blast is not the only safety investigation that bp faces in the us .
in addition , the firm had to close part of its prudhoe bay oil field in alaska earlier this year , after leaks were discovered in one of its pipes .

graeme pearson , head of the scottish crime and drug enforcement agency , said more than 60 industrial-level cannabis farms had been raided in the last year .
mr pearson revealed there had been virtually no major cannabis production in scotland until 12 months ago .
he said the illegal factories were being set up by organised crime gangs .
mr pearson said workers in the factories , which are often set up in residential areas , were frequently kept locked inside like slaves .
about 60 such productions have been discovered by forces across scotland in the last nine months graeme pearson scdea the factories produced super-strength cannabis , which mr pearson said he believed was causing an increasing number of young people to suffer mental health problems .
recent estimates have suggested that about 60 % of cannabis smoked in britain is now home-produced , compared with only 11 % a decade ago .
the uk government downgraded cannabis from a class b to a class c drug in 2004 , but has recently indicated it is considering reversing that decision .
the original reclassification was criticised by many experts , who said it sent out the wrong message about the potential dangers of using the drug .
mr pearson said : " it has gone from virtually no production just over a year ago to over 60 such productions being discovered by forces across scotland in the last nine months .
" what we have got is these types of developments within houses , factories , garages and so forth .
" in a very high number of them we have got chinese or vietnamese people who are locked in the premises , kept sleeping on the floor amongst mattresses with no visible means of support .
they are virtually slaves within the production mechanism . "
' mental health ' many of the factories contain up to 1,000 cannabis plants and are capable of producing £ 100,000-worth of cannabis , making production in scotland worth at least £ 7m a year .
he said the trend of factories being set up to mass-produce cannabis was one that had spread around the world in recent years before finally arriving in the uk .
he added : " australia saw the trend , canada saw the trend and now we now have it in the uk , where organised crime gangs are focusing on the industrial production of cannabis in order that they can up the potency of the product and therefore have a more marketable product .
" doctors have done experiments and gathered statistics which have shown that more people are coming to the attention of the health service because of difficulties with mental health .
" i do n't think it is a problem that law enforcement alone can deal with . "
carla ellis , project manager for the crew 2000 drugs advice group , said more research needed to be done on the potential links between mental health and cannabis use .
she added : " i think we have to remind ourselves that the vast majority of people who smoke cannabis will not have any problems associated with their use .
" they will probably use it for a very short period of time and they will probably stop as the consequences of their use clash with their lifestyle .
" many people do see it as relatively harmless compared to other drugs . "
