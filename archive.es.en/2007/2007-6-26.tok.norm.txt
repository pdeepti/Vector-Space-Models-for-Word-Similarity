" something very negative is going on in germany , " kaczynski said in an interview for polish public radio on tuesday .
" like in an era which already passed , when the large majority of europeans did n't have the courage to talk about it , it is the same today . " " so i 'm issuing a warning , and i 'm addressing the german authorities as the polish prime minister , do not tolerate this kind of thing , these kind of statements , because that leads to the worst , to trouble which can happen in europe , but which in affecting europe will hit the germans too , " he said . kaczynski was reacting to a caricature in a berlin daily about replacing the majority voting process in the new eu treaty with the square root of all world war dead . the cartoon referred to polish proposals last week to change the voting system with an arithmetic calcuation that would take the square root of populations and comments that poland 's war dead should be taken into account . " there is now a situation in europe in which one can not talk about german blame for the war , but very well about polish concentration camps and a polish responsibility for the holocaust , " the polish leader said . breast-feeding image sparks anger kaczynski 's comments add further fuel to a bonfire already crackling between the two nations . in the aftermath of a turbulent eu summit , where germany and poland clashed over the voting procedure in the new eu treaty , german mass-market bild tabloid dubbed the polish president and prime minister , twins , " poison dwarves . " the polish press this week seemed to be contributing just as little to reconciliation between the two nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the front page of " wprost , " a conservative magazine which often has controversial covers some german politicians said tuesday they were outraged by the latest cover of wprosta , a widely-read conservative polish weekly magazine , depicting german chancellor angela merkel breast-feeding the kaczynski twins under the title " stepmother of europe . " " germany used to be an advocate of poland , but now it 's become our prosecutor , " read the subtitle of the leading article . " the poles should stop outdoing themselves with tasteless remarks , " said christian social union 's foreign expert eduard lintner .
" sooner or later , this will have an effect on the mood in germany , which is , at the moment , still cooperative . " according to markus meckel , head of the german-polish parliamentarian group , poland needs to rethink its diplomatic strategy .
" in the last weeks and months , poland has lost many friends , " meckel , who is a member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- said .
" in the future , the country should think hard about how it could win over partners and friends . "
" a little funny " neither the chancellor nor the kaczynski twins have commented on the cover story.what has rankled germany is that one of the authors of the story in the polish weekly , mariusz muszynski is an advisor on germany to the polish foreign ministry .
the editor of wprost , stanislaw janecki , however told german media that the reaction in germany was overblown . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who 's who ?
the polish power twins have been stirring things up in the eu " the cover 's message , " janecki told spiegel online , " is that germany , especially ms. merkel , was trying to treat poles and the polish leaders as small children completely unable to act on their own and somehow dependent on germany .
there is the impression that germany , being more powerful , wants to dominate poland and that the kaczynski brothers want to stand up to this domination . "
he said he could not imagine merkel taking offence . ” we looked for a model that was not too thin but who had a beautiful body , ” janecki said .
" we imagined it to be a little funny . the stepmother is often more sexy and more friendly that the real mother is . "
he pointed out that the image is n't just critical of merkel . " it is also critical of the kaczynskis because the relationship between these politicians has become abnormal .
it has become threatened by history and by national points of view .
there are many factors , but the relationship is clearly not working , " he said .
the wprost cover is just the latest in a long-running media satire saga between the two countries .
last year , polish president lech kaczynski cancelled a meeting with merkel after left-wing berlin daily taz portrayed him as a polish potato .
wprost too is known for its hard-hitting covers and has published irreverent satirical images of former german chancellor gerhard schröder and erika steinbach , head of the german expelle association .
" poland is a big , important partner " the latest tensions come just a day after germany struck a reconciliatory tone with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier saying his country " has a duty to patiently seek a dialogue with poland , especially in difficult times , " given the fact that both countries were linked by " a terrible 20th century history . "
german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said that chancellor angela merkel 's administration was committed to playing its part in ensuring close ties between the neighboring countries . " poland is a big , important partner , " added wilhelm . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" these talks are to draw the attention of the turkish authorities to the case and to contribute to the search for a solution so that this young man can swiftly rejoin his family in germany , " steinmeier said , adding that there were " humanitarian aspects " and " schooling requirements " involved . turkey cites eu entry criteria but turkish economy minister and the country 's chief eu negotiator , ali babacan ruled out any intervention , pointing out that the independence of the judiciary is one of the requirements made by the eu to all candidate states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german teenager has been held in a turkish prison for 10 weeks " as government … we do not want to interfere with the proceedings , and of course , this is an important criteria also for europe , " babacan told a news conference after the talks . babacan said the boy was allowed visits by his family and said a hearing was scheduled for july 6 .

all of these chapters have to be negotiated before a country can join the european union .
the german eu presidency wanted to discuss important areas of economic and monetary policy with turkey this week .

"
he would like to see a strategic partnership , but not eu membership for turkey .
a french diplomat noted that not all policy areas could be treated the same . " negotiations with turkey continue , " he said , according to news reports .
" but there are chapters and there are chapters . "
a turkish foreign ministry official said ankara was unhappy with the fact that the bloc did not agree to start negotiations on the more important area of economic and monetary policy .
" if it is technical we will tackle any problems and move on -lrb- with that chapter -rrb- , but if the decision is politically motivated we could not welcome that , " the official said . turkey not giving up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish negotiators have a lot of convincing to do speaking just before news of the decision , turkish economy minister and chief negotiator ali babacan said ankara would not give up on the talks .

" sarkozy would like to completely abandon the negotiations , " ochmann said .
" however , that would mean that the eu could have no further positive influence over turkey and that it would be very isolated . "
negotiations should be carried out to the end , ochmann said .
it could take as long as 15 years before all 35 chapters are negotiated .
even then , entry would not be automatic .
eu officials would not only check whether turkey had met all of its conditions but also whether the eu is politically and economically strong enough to take turkey on as a new member .

he would like to see a strategic partnership , but not eu membership for turkey .
a french diplomat noted that not all policy areas could be treated the same . " negotiations with turkey continue , " he said , according to news reports .
" but there are chapters and there are chapters . "
a turkish foreign ministry official said ankara was unhappy with the fact that the bloc did not agree to start negotiations on the more important area of economic and monetary policy .
" if it is technical we will tackle any problems and move on -lrb- with that chapter -rrb- , but if the decision is politically motivated we could not welcome that , " the official said . turkey not giving up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish negotiators have a lot of convincing to do speaking just before news of the decision , turkish economy minister and chief negotiator ali babacan said ankara would not give up on the talks .
the country will push ahead to meet conditions to join the eu , he said .
" regardless of what chapters are opened , regardless of what chapters are closed , we will integrate our legislation as soon as possible , and we will wait -lrb- until the eu is ready for turkish membership -rrb- , " babacan said at an investor conference in istanbul .
the talks are still in their beginning stages and it 's premature for sarkozy to oppose turkey 's inclusion in the eu , said cornelius ochmann , an expert for eu enlargement issues at the bertelsmann foundation .
" sarkozy would like to completely abandon the negotiations , " ochmann said .
" however , that would mean that the eu could have no further positive influence over turkey and that it would be very isolated . "
negotiations should be carried out to the end , ochmann said .
it could take as long as 15 years before all 35 chapters are negotiated .
even then , entry would not be automatic .
eu officials would not only check whether turkey had met all of its conditions but also whether the eu is politically and economically strong enough to take turkey on as a new member .
the hurdles for turkey 's membership are higher than for all other candidates , ochmann said .
the fact that economic issues wo n't be brought up is " a negative signal , almost a small rejection , " of turkey , ochmann said . cyprus still a problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : negotiations with turkey will take at least a decade gerald knaus of the european stability initiative -lrb- esi -rrb- , an expert for south eastern european politics predicts that the cyprus problem will continue to hang over the negotiations .
the eu last year suspended negotiations on eight chapters after turkey failed to meet a requirement to open its ports and airports to traffic from cyprus .
" there are reservations , but the eu machine is running and it 's better to discuss two chapters than no chapters . "
croatia 's eu bid looking bright while turkey 's inclusion in the eu is still a distant possibility , croatia is closing in on its goal of joining the eu in 2009 . on tuesday , croatia opened six further chapters for negotiation .
eleven have already been decided . " the opening of these six chapters sends a strong signal , " said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency till the end of the month .
" it 's a real breakthrough . " croatian foreign minister kolinda grabar-kitarovic said she expected her country to meet eu benchmarks and close several chapters of negotiation in 2008 . " we expect 2009 to be the year when we achieve readiness for accession , meaning concluding negotiations , signing the accession treaty and beginning the accession process , " she said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hitler was n't seriously injured in the attack , codenamed operation valkyrie .
the filmmakers " will not be allowed to film at german military sites if count stauffenberg is played by tom cruise , who has publicly professed to being a member of the scientology cult , " german defense ministry spokesman harald kammerbauer said . the church of scientology is not recognized as legitimate by the german government .
kammerbauer said the ministry had not yet received official filming requests from the producers of " valkyrie . " cruise " per fect for the part " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruise is a controversial figure in germany the ban on filming at military sites drew criticism from cruise 's film producing partner , paula wagner , chief executive of united artists entertainment .
she said " valkyrie " is a " historically accurate thriller " and that cruise was offered the role because the movie 's director , bryan singer , " thought he was perfect for the part . "
" aside from his obvious admiration of the man he is portraying , mr. cruise 's personal beliefs have absolutely no bearing on the movie 's plot , themes , or content , " wagner said in a statement .
" and even though we could shoot the movie anywhere in the world , we believe germany is the only place we can truly do the story justice . " scientology 's biggest star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientology is not an officially recognized religion in germany hollywood star tom cruise is one of the best-known members of the church of scientology .
the cult is based on the writings of the late science-fiction author l. ron hubbard , who began scientology as a self-help discipline .
cruise has lobbied german officials in the past over the country 's refusal to recognize scientology as a legitimate church .
the german government views it as a fake religion based on making money from its followers .
stauffenberg 's family has also expressed their displeasure with cruise portraying their father .
stauffenberg 's oldest son , berthold , said in a recent interview with süddeutsche zeitung newspaper that he objected to a practicing scientologist playing his father . " i hoped for a while that it was all just a publicity stunt by mr. cruise , " said the 72-year-old retired major general of the german bundeswehr .
he added that cruise " should keep his hands off my father . "
" it 's sure to be crap , " he said of the movie .
" of course i could be wrong - i would like to be . "
historical figure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the movie will focus on stauffenberg 's failed plot to assasinate hitler " in general , the bundeswehr -lrb- german military -rrb- has a special interest in the serious and authentic portrayal of the events of july 20 , 1944 and stauffenberg 's person , " kammerbauer said .
stauffenberg had deeply opposed to the nazis ' treatment of the jews .
stauffenberg was subsequently caught and shot by firing squad the same night .
the plot 's failure led to the arrest of more than 5,000 people , and the execution of some 200 others .
the film 's action will center around the bendlerblock memorial inside the defense ministry complex in berlin .
stauffenberg and his co-conspirators planned the assassination there .
it 's also the spot where they were executed after the plot failed .

“ the seven hostesses are there to promote the idea of respect , ” said venice ’ s town councilor for tourism , augusto salvadori .
“ they explain to tourists that they can ’ t picnic in the square or bare their torsos , for example , and also remind them that they can ’ t just leave their rubbish on the ground . ”
salvadori said the introduction of the hostesses was a “ positive initiative ” which would restore “ decorum and cleanliness ” to the square .
but at piazza san marco , the crackdown doesn ’ t seem that popular with the visitors .
“ it ’ s ridiculous , ” said american courtney walker , clutching a burger and fries .
she ’ s just been shooed off the steps along with her friends for eating .
“ there ’ s nowhere in mcdonald ’ s to eat , and the square is enormous . ”
her sentiments are also shared many venetians , who say the hostesses don ’ t solve the bigger issue of how to deal with the more than 19.5 million tourists who flock to venice each year .
too many tourists ?
“ instead of devising policies for tourism and planning for the future , the administration is banning the eating of sandwiches , ” said andrea chiappa , the vice-president of venice ’ s hoteliers association , with a shake of his head .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venice 's charms are many , so are its tourists after rome , venice is the most popular destination in italy but the majority of visitors are day trippers who arrive with their water bottles and packed lunches in an effort to avoid venice ’ s high prices .
" the day trippers cost much more in maintenance and cleaning than they bring to the city , ” chiappa said .
the tourists aren ’ t just proving costly , however , they are also causing venetians to leave the city in every increasing numbers .
in the past fifty years , the population has halved to 62,000 .
according to statisticians , if the trend isn ’ t reversed , the city could be a ghost town by 2030 .
residents struggle “ one of the problems is that everything revolves around the tourists , ” complained local resident sergio malara .
“ it ’ s difficult to find the basics , such as a butcher shop or a fruit and vegetable store or a boot maker . ”
instead , streets in the center are lined with shops selling ceramic masks and venetian glass beads .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists bring revenue to venice , but they 're turning the city into a museum another problem is getting around the city ’ s narrow pedestrian streets and bridges .
malara has just moved away from the center because with so many visitors streaming into venice in the summer months , it was just too stressful to get to work .
and when one local moves out , it ’ s not that another moves in .
property prices are so high that few venetians can afford to buy or rent in the center .
this means vacant properties are let to tourists who happily fork out 100 euros a night for the luxury of a tiny room with an outside bathroom and resident mosquito population .
in an effort to keep residential housing from disappearing , the city council recently tightened up zoning regulations making it more difficult to open hotels .
but unfortunately , a loophole in the provincial law means pensions and bed and breakfasts can sprout up without restraint .
in the past few years , more than 700 have opened in venice .
cap on visitors one proposition being tossed around to mitigate the tourist problem is the idea of limiting the number of visitors who can enter the city each day .
according to hotelier chiappa , however , the council needs to do more to even out the flow of tourists to venice before even discussing such “ drastic measures . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evening in venice “ the tourist season runs from april to october , and in winter hotel occupancy falls to below 50 percent , ” chiappa said .
he is critical that major events are held in june and september , and museum exhibitions tend to run over summer .
“ you can just as well go to a museum in winter , ” he said .
as the sun starts setting , the tourists trickle out of the city and the venetians descend into venice ’ s squares to enjoy the balmy evening .
but those drinking aperitivi and chatting on park benches are mostly grey-haired pensioners .
venice ’ s young families have long moved elsewhere . kate hairsine send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hitler was n't seriously injured in the attack , codenamed operation valkyrie .
the filmmakers " will not be allowed to film at german military sites if count stauffenberg is played by tom cruise , who has publicly professed to being a member of the scientology cult , " german defense ministry spokesman harald kammerbauer said . the church of scientology is not recognized as legitimate by the german government .
kammerbauer said the ministry had not yet received official filming requests from the producers of " valkyrie . " cruise " per fect for the part " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruise is a controversial figure in germany the ban on filming at military sites drew criticism from cruise 's film producing partner , paula wagner , chief executive of united artists entertainment .
she said " valkyrie " is a " historically accurate thriller " and that cruise was offered the role because the movie 's director , bryan singer , " thought he was perfect for the part . "
" aside from his obvious admiration of the man he is portraying , mr. cruise 's personal beliefs have absolutely no bearing on the movie 's plot , themes , or content , " wagner said in a statement .
" and even though we could shoot the movie anywhere in the world , we believe germany is the only place we can truly do the story justice . " scientology 's biggest star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientology is not an officially recognized religion in germany hollywood star tom cruise is one of the best-known members of the church of scientology .
the cult is based on the writings of the late science-fiction author l. ron hubbard , who began scientology as a self-help discipline .
cruise has lobbied german officials in the past over the country 's refusal to recognize scientology as a legitimate church .
the german government views it as a fake religion based on making money from its followers .
stauffenberg 's family has also expressed their displeasure with cruise portraying their father .
stauffenberg 's oldest son , berthold , said in a recent interview with süddeutsche zeitung newspaper that he objected to a practicing scientologist playing his father . " i hoped for a while that it was all just a publicity stunt by mr. cruise , " said the 72-year-old retired major general of the german bundeswehr .
he added that cruise " should keep his hands off my father . "
" it 's sure to be crap , " he said of the movie .
" of course i could be wrong - i would like to be . "
historical figure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the movie will focus on stauffenberg 's failed plot to assasinate hitler " in general , the bundeswehr -lrb- german military -rrb- has a special interest in the serious and authentic portrayal of the events of july 20 , 1944 and stauffenberg 's person , " kammerbauer said .
stauffenberg had deeply opposed to the nazis ' treatment of the jews .
stauffenberg was subsequently caught and shot by firing squad the same night .
the plot 's failure led to the arrest of more than 5,000 people , and the execution of some 200 others .
the film 's action will center around the bendlerblock memorial inside the defense ministry complex in berlin .
stauffenberg and his co-conspirators planned the assassination there .
it 's also the spot where they were executed after the plot failed .

the soccer teams have agreed not to reveal transfer details , but bayern increased an original offer of 10 million euros -lrb- $ 13.4 million -rrb- to at least 12 million euros , according to german sports magazine kicker . bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said " a fair solution for both sides " had been reached .
werder sports director klaus allofs meanwhile said the deal had come about after bayern this week hugely upped its offer for the 29-year-old .
" bayern have met our demands so that we can agree to the transfer in the circumstances , " he said .
money no object to bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several international stars are joining bayern next season klose , capped 69 times by germany , had originally said only a top club outside germany could lure him away from bremen , but relations with werder deteriorated after he revealed towards the end of last season that he had been in negotiations with bayern .
the transfer ends a period of unprecedented spending by bayern in an attempt by the bundesliga record champions to reverse their fortunes after a disappointing fourth-place end to last season , missing out on a champions league birth in their worst performance in 10 years .
the team has spent some 53 million euros to secure new players including italy striker luca toni and the france international midfielder franck ribery with the hopes of returning to the top of the german table and competing in the champions league .
others to join are germany defender marcell jansen , germany striker jan schlaudraff , argentinean midfielder jose ernesto sosa , the turkish midfielder hamit altintop and brazilian midfielder ze roberto .
more roster changes expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : national side team mates , klose and podolski will pair up every week in the bundesliga the arrival of klose is now likely to see the departure of dutch striker roy makaay who has already been told he can leave if he receives an offer .
both feyenoord rotterdam and psv eindhoven are said to be interested .
klose will now link up with his germany striker partner lukas podolski in munich , but it remains to be seen how coach ottmar hitzfeld will use them together with toni also in the picture .
end to wrangling werder and bayern had appeared to have reached deadlock over klose after weeks of negotiations , most of which took place openly in the german press .
werder had turned down bayern 's approaches for the player and insisted klose , who has scored 53 goals in 89 league games for werder , would complete his contract until 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego will be left managing bremen without klose next season " we know we are losing a successful player , but miro 's change of mind and the new offer from bayern has changed the situation we were in at the end of the season and persuaded us not to continue the cooperation , " allofs said .
allofs said werder would be making no immediate move to seek a replacement for klose .
werder will go into the new season with a strike force of markus rosenberg , hugo almeida , aaron hunt and youngsters kevin schindler and martin harnik .
croatia striker ivan klasnic , who has undergone a kidney transplant operation , is also still on the books .

hitler was n't seriously injured in the attack , codenamed operation valkyrie .
the filmmakers " will not be allowed to film at german military sites if count stauffenberg is played by tom cruise , who has publicly professed to being a member of the scientology cult , " german defense ministry spokesman harald kammerbauer said . the church of scientology is not recognized as legitimate by the german government .
kammerbauer said the ministry had not yet received official filming requests from the producers of " valkyrie . " cruise " per fect for the part " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruise is a controversial figure in germany the ban on filming at military sites drew criticism from cruise 's film producing partner , paula wagner , chief executive of united artists entertainment .
she said " valkyrie " is a " historically accurate thriller " and that cruise was offered the role because the movie 's director , bryan singer , " thought he was perfect for the part . "
" aside from his obvious admiration of the man he is portraying , mr. cruise 's personal beliefs have absolutely no bearing on the movie 's plot , themes , or content , " wagner said in a statement .
" and even though we could shoot the movie anywhere in the world , we believe germany is the only place we can truly do the story justice . " scientology 's biggest star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientology is not an officially recognized religion in germany hollywood star tom cruise is one of the best-known members of the church of scientology .
the cult is based on the writings of the late science-fiction author l. ron hubbard , who began scientology as a self-help discipline .
cruise has lobbied german officials in the past over the country 's refusal to recognize scientology as a legitimate church .
the german government views it as a fake religion based on making money from its followers .
stauffenberg 's family has also expressed their displeasure with cruise portraying their father .
stauffenberg 's oldest son , berthold , said in a recent interview with süddeutsche zeitung newspaper that he objected to a practicing scientologist playing his father . " i hoped for a while that it was all just a publicity stunt by mr. cruise , " said the 72-year-old retired major general of the german bundeswehr .
he added that cruise " should keep his hands off my father . "
" it 's sure to be crap , " he said of the movie .
" of course i could be wrong - i would like to be . "
historical figure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the movie will focus on stauffenberg 's failed plot to assasinate hitler " in general , the bundeswehr -lrb- german military -rrb- has a special interest in the serious and authentic portrayal of the events of july 20 , 1944 and stauffenberg 's person , " kammerbauer said .
stauffenberg had deeply opposed to the nazis ' treatment of the jews .
stauffenberg was subsequently caught and shot by firing squad the same night .
the plot 's failure led to the arrest of more than 5,000 people , and the execution of some 200 others .
the film 's action will center around the bendlerblock memorial inside the defense ministry complex in berlin .
stauffenberg and his co-conspirators planned the assassination there .
it 's also the spot where they were executed after the plot failed .

" something very negative is going on in germany , " kaczynski said in an interview for polish public radio on tuesday .
" like in an era which already passed , when the large majority of europeans did n't have the courage to talk about it , it is the same today . " " so i 'm issuing a warning , and i 'm addressing the german authorities as the polish prime minister , do not tolerate this kind of thing , these kind of statements , because that leads to the worst , to trouble which can happen in europe , but which in affecting europe will hit the germans too , " he said . kaczynski was reacting to a caricature in a berlin daily about replacing the majority voting process in the new eu treaty with the square root of all world war dead . the cartoon referred to polish proposals last week to change the voting system with an arithmetic calcuation that would take the square root of populations and comments that poland 's war dead should be taken into account . " there is now a situation in europe in which one can not talk about german blame for the war , but very well about polish concentration camps and a polish responsibility for the holocaust , " the polish leader said . breast-feeding image sparks anger kaczynski 's comments add further fuel to a bonfire already crackling between the two nations . in the aftermath of a turbulent eu summit , where germany and poland clashed over the voting procedure in the new eu treaty , german mass-market bild tabloid dubbed the polish president and prime minister , twins , " poison dwarves . " the polish press this week seemed to be contributing just as little to reconciliation between the two nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the front page of " wprost , " a conservative magazine which often has controversial covers some german politicians said tuesday they were outraged by the latest cover of wprosta , a widely-read conservative polish weekly magazine , depicting german chancellor angela merkel breast-feeding the kaczynski twins under the title " stepmother of europe . " " germany used to be an advocate of poland , but now it 's become our prosecutor , " read the subtitle of the leading article . " the poles should stop outdoing themselves with tasteless remarks , " said christian social union 's foreign expert eduard lintner .
" sooner or later , this will have an effect on the mood in germany , which is , at the moment , still cooperative . " according to markus meckel , head of the german-polish parliamentarian group , poland needs to rethink its diplomatic strategy .
" in the last weeks and months , poland has lost many friends , " meckel , who is a member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- said .
" in the future , the country should think hard about how it could win over partners and friends . "
" a little funny " neither the chancellor nor the kaczynski twins have commented on the cover story.what has rankled germany is that one of the authors of the story in the polish weekly , mariusz muszynski is an advisor on germany to the polish foreign ministry .
the editor of wprost , stanislaw janecki , however told german media that the reaction in germany was overblown . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who 's who ?
the polish power twins have been stirring things up in the eu " the cover 's message , " janecki told spiegel online , " is that germany , especially ms. merkel , was trying to treat poles and the polish leaders as small children completely unable to act on their own and somehow dependent on germany .
there is the impression that germany , being more powerful , wants to dominate poland and that the kaczynski brothers want to stand up to this domination . "
he said he could not imagine merkel taking offence . ” we looked for a model that was not too thin but who had a beautiful body , ” janecki said .
" we imagined it to be a little funny . the stepmother is often more sexy and more friendly that the real mother is . "
he pointed out that the image is n't just critical of merkel . " it is also critical of the kaczynskis because the relationship between these politicians has become abnormal .
it has become threatened by history and by national points of view .
there are many factors , but the relationship is clearly not working , " he said .
the wprost cover is just the latest in a long-running media satire saga between the two countries .
last year , polish president lech kaczynski cancelled a meeting with merkel after left-wing berlin daily taz portrayed him as a polish potato .
wprost too is known for its hard-hitting covers and has published irreverent satirical images of former german chancellor gerhard schröder and erika steinbach , head of the german expelle association .
" poland is a big , important partner " the latest tensions come just a day after germany struck a reconciliatory tone with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier saying his country " has a duty to patiently seek a dialogue with poland , especially in difficult times , " given the fact that both countries were linked by " a terrible 20th century history . "
german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said that chancellor angela merkel 's administration was committed to playing its part in ensuring close ties between the neighboring countries . " poland is a big , important partner , " added wilhelm . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but an important " chapter " on economic and monetary policy was left out at the urging of french president nicolas sarkozy . instead , the eu began discussing two other less important issues at tuesday 's accession talks in brussels : statistics and financial control . these are two of 35 chapters which make up eu law .
all of these chapters have to be negotiated before a country can join the european union .
the german eu presidency wanted to discuss important areas of economic and monetary policy with turkey this week .
but it was left off the agenda to appease sarkozy , who threatened to block the issue , according to diplomats . sarkozy outspoken on turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy does n't want turkey in the eu sarkozy has been a vocal opponent of turkey joining the eu , saying in an interview with the parisian newspaper le figaro that the muslim country had " no place in europe . "
he would like to see a strategic partnership , but not eu membership for turkey .
a french diplomat noted that not all policy areas could be treated the same . " negotiations with turkey continue , " he said , according to news reports .
" but there are chapters and there are chapters . "
a turkish foreign ministry official said ankara was unhappy with the fact that the bloc did not agree to start negotiations on the more important area of economic and monetary policy .
" if it is technical we will tackle any problems and move on -lrb- with that chapter -rrb- , but if the decision is politically motivated we could not welcome that , " the official said . turkey not giving up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish negotiators have a lot of convincing to do speaking just before news of the decision , turkish economy minister and chief negotiator ali babacan said ankara would not give up on the talks .
the country will push ahead to meet conditions to join the eu , he said .
" regardless of what chapters are opened , regardless of what chapters are closed , we will integrate our legislation as soon as possible , and we will wait -lrb- until the eu is ready for turkish membership -rrb- , " babacan said at an investor conference in istanbul .
the talks are still in their beginning stages and it 's premature for sarkozy to oppose turkey 's inclusion in the eu , said cornelius ochmann , an expert for eu enlargement issues at the bertelsmann foundation .
" sarkozy would like to completely abandon the negotiations , " ochmann said .
" however , that would mean that the eu could have no further positive influence over turkey and that it would be very isolated . "
negotiations should be carried out to the end , ochmann said .
it could take as long as 15 years before all 35 chapters are negotiated .
even then , entry would not be automatic .
eu officials would not only check whether turkey had met all of its conditions but also whether the eu is politically and economically strong enough to take turkey on as a new member .
the hurdles for turkey 's membership are higher than for all other candidates , ochmann said .
the fact that economic issues wo n't be brought up is " a negative signal , almost a small rejection , " of turkey , ochmann said . cyprus still a problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : negotiations with turkey will take at least a decade gerald knaus of the european stability initiative -lrb- esi -rrb- , an expert for south eastern european politics predicts that the cyprus problem will continue to hang over the negotiations .
the eu last year suspended negotiations on eight chapters after turkey failed to meet a requirement to open its ports and airports to traffic from cyprus .
" there are reservations , but the eu machine is running and it 's better to discuss two chapters than no chapters . "
croatia 's eu bid looking bright while turkey 's inclusion in the eu is still a distant possibility , croatia is closing in on its goal of joining the eu in 2009 . on tuesday , croatia opened six further chapters for negotiation .
eleven have already been decided . " the opening of these six chapters sends a strong signal , " said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency till the end of the month .
" it 's a real breakthrough . " croatian foreign minister kolinda grabar-kitarovic said she expected her country to meet eu benchmarks and close several chapters of negotiation in 2008 . " we expect 2009 to be the year when we achieve readiness for accession , meaning concluding negotiations , signing the accession treaty and beginning the accession process , " she said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the soccer teams have agreed not to reveal transfer details , but bayern increased an original offer of 10 million euros -lrb- $ 13.4 million -rrb- to at least 12 million euros , according to german sports magazine kicker . bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said " a fair solution for both sides " had been reached .
werder sports director klaus allofs meanwhile said the deal had come about after bayern this week hugely upped its offer for the 29-year-old .
" bayern have met our demands so that we can agree to the transfer in the circumstances , " he said .

the transfer ends a period of unprecedented spending by bayern in an attempt by the bundesliga record champions to reverse their fortunes after a disappointing fourth-place end to last season , missing out on a champions league birth in their worst performance in 10 years .
the team has spent some 53 million euros to secure new players including italy striker luca toni and the france international midfielder franck ribery with the hopes of returning to the top of the german table and competing in the champions league .

klose will now link up with his germany striker partner lukas podolski in munich , but it remains to be seen how coach ottmar hitzfeld will use them together with toni also in the picture .
end to wrangling werder and bayern had appeared to have reached deadlock over klose after weeks of negotiations , most of which took place openly in the german press .
werder had turned down bayern 's approaches for the player and insisted klose , who has scored 53 goals in 89 league games for werder , would complete his contract until 2008 .

allofs said werder would be making no immediate move to seek a replacement for klose .

the soccer teams have agreed not to reveal transfer details , but bayern increased an original offer of 10 million euros -lrb- $ 13.4 million -rrb- to at least 12 million euros , according to german sports magazine kicker . bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said " a fair solution for both sides " had been reached .
werder sports director klaus allofs meanwhile said the deal had come about after bayern this week hugely upped its offer for the 29-year-old .
" bayern have met our demands so that we can agree to the transfer in the circumstances , " he said .
money no object to bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several international stars are joining bayern next season klose , capped 69 times by germany , had originally said only a top club outside germany could lure him away from bremen , but relations with werder deteriorated after he revealed towards the end of last season that he had been in negotiations with bayern .
the transfer ends a period of unprecedented spending by bayern in an attempt by the bundesliga record champions to reverse their fortunes after a disappointing fourth-place end to last season , missing out on a champions league birth in their worst performance in 10 years .
the team has spent some 53 million euros to secure new players including italy striker luca toni and the france international midfielder franck ribery with the hopes of returning to the top of the german table and competing in the champions league .
others to join are germany defender marcell jansen , germany striker jan schlaudraff , argentinean midfielder jose ernesto sosa , the turkish midfielder hamit altintop and brazilian midfielder ze roberto .
more roster changes expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : national side team mates , klose and podolski will pair up every week in the bundesliga the arrival of klose is now likely to see the departure of dutch striker roy makaay who has already been told he can leave if he receives an offer .
both feyenoord rotterdam and psv eindhoven are said to be interested .
klose will now link up with his germany striker partner lukas podolski in munich , but it remains to be seen how coach ottmar hitzfeld will use them together with toni also in the picture .
end to wrangling werder and bayern had appeared to have reached deadlock over klose after weeks of negotiations , most of which took place openly in the german press .
werder had turned down bayern 's approaches for the player and insisted klose , who has scored 53 goals in 89 league games for werder , would complete his contract until 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego will be left managing bremen without klose next season " we know we are losing a successful player , but miro 's change of mind and the new offer from bayern has changed the situation we were in at the end of the season and persuaded us not to continue the cooperation , " allofs said .
allofs said werder would be making no immediate move to seek a replacement for klose .
werder will go into the new season with a strike force of markus rosenberg , hugo almeida , aaron hunt and youngsters kevin schindler and martin harnik .
croatia striker ivan klasnic , who has undergone a kidney transplant operation , is also still on the books .

but the measure has been criticized for ignoring the bigger issue of just how many tourists the lagoon city can handle . on this sunny june day , thousands of tourists mill around one of the world ’ s most famous squares , venice ’ s piazza san marco .
as tour groups from china to portugal throng around the entrance of st. mark ’ s basilica , others shriek with laughter as pigeons alight on their outstretched arms .
a group of brightly dressed indian tourists have kicked off their sandals and are relaxed on the steps surrounding the square .
next to them , a dutch family unpacks an large picnic hamper .
similar scenes are repeated all around the piazza , which with its combination of magnificent views and shaded loggia , seems like the ideal spot for a break .
but it ’ s exactly this type of behavior that the venice city council is trying to stop .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venice 's tourist " hostesses " - there to maintain decorum the council has banned eating , sunbathing , lying down and camping in the piazza and its surrounding neighborhood , and has introduced guards of a sort , called " hostesses , " to reprimand those who break the rules .
“ the seven hostesses are there to promote the idea of respect , ” said venice ’ s town councilor for tourism , augusto salvadori .
“ they explain to tourists that they can ’ t picnic in the square or bare their torsos , for example , and also remind them that they can ’ t just leave their rubbish on the ground . ”
salvadori said the introduction of the hostesses was a “ positive initiative ” which would restore “ decorum and cleanliness ” to the square .
but at piazza san marco , the crackdown doesn ’ t seem that popular with the visitors .
“ it ’ s ridiculous , ” said american courtney walker , clutching a burger and fries .
she ’ s just been shooed off the steps along with her friends for eating .
“ there ’ s nowhere in mcdonald ’ s to eat , and the square is enormous . ”
her sentiments are also shared many venetians , who say the hostesses don ’ t solve the bigger issue of how to deal with the more than 19.5 million tourists who flock to venice each year .
too many tourists ?
“ instead of devising policies for tourism and planning for the future , the administration is banning the eating of sandwiches , ” said andrea chiappa , the vice-president of venice ’ s hoteliers association , with a shake of his head .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venice 's charms are many , so are its tourists after rome , venice is the most popular destination in italy but the majority of visitors are day trippers who arrive with their water bottles and packed lunches in an effort to avoid venice ’ s high prices .
" the day trippers cost much more in maintenance and cleaning than they bring to the city , ” chiappa said .
the tourists aren ’ t just proving costly , however , they are also causing venetians to leave the city in every increasing numbers .
in the past fifty years , the population has halved to 62,000 .
according to statisticians , if the trend isn ’ t reversed , the city could be a ghost town by 2030 .
residents struggle “ one of the problems is that everything revolves around the tourists , ” complained local resident sergio malara .
“ it ’ s difficult to find the basics , such as a butcher shop or a fruit and vegetable store or a boot maker . ”
instead , streets in the center are lined with shops selling ceramic masks and venetian glass beads .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists bring revenue to venice , but they 're turning the city into a museum another problem is getting around the city ’ s narrow pedestrian streets and bridges .
malara has just moved away from the center because with so many visitors streaming into venice in the summer months , it was just too stressful to get to work .
and when one local moves out , it ’ s not that another moves in .
property prices are so high that few venetians can afford to buy or rent in the center .
this means vacant properties are let to tourists who happily fork out 100 euros a night for the luxury of a tiny room with an outside bathroom and resident mosquito population .
in an effort to keep residential housing from disappearing , the city council recently tightened up zoning regulations making it more difficult to open hotels .
but unfortunately , a loophole in the provincial law means pensions and bed and breakfasts can sprout up without restraint .
in the past few years , more than 700 have opened in venice .
cap on visitors one proposition being tossed around to mitigate the tourist problem is the idea of limiting the number of visitors who can enter the city each day .
according to hotelier chiappa , however , the council needs to do more to even out the flow of tourists to venice before even discussing such “ drastic measures . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evening in venice “ the tourist season runs from april to october , and in winter hotel occupancy falls to below 50 percent , ” chiappa said .
he is critical that major events are held in june and september , and museum exhibitions tend to run over summer .
“ you can just as well go to a museum in winter , ” he said .
as the sun starts setting , the tourists trickle out of the city and the venetians descend into venice ’ s squares to enjoy the balmy evening .
but those drinking aperitivi and chatting on park benches are mostly grey-haired pensioners .

salvadori said the introduction of the hostesses was a “ positive initiative ” which would restore “ decorum and cleanliness ” to the square .
but at piazza san marco , the crackdown doesn ’ t seem that popular with the visitors .
“ it ’ s ridiculous , ” said american courtney walker , clutching a burger and fries .
she ’ s just been shooed off the steps along with her friends for eating .
“ there ’ s nowhere in mcdonald ’ s to eat , and the square is enormous . ”
her sentiments are also shared many venetians , who say the hostesses don ’ t solve the bigger issue of how to deal with the more than 19.5 million tourists who flock to venice each year .
too many tourists ?
“ instead of devising policies for tourism and planning for the future , the administration is banning the eating of sandwiches , ” said andrea chiappa , the vice-president of venice ’ s hoteliers association , with a shake of his head .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venice 's charms are many , so are its tourists after rome , venice is the most popular destination in italy but the majority of visitors are day trippers who arrive with their water bottles and packed lunches in an effort to avoid venice ’ s high prices .
" the day trippers cost much more in maintenance and cleaning than they bring to the city , ” chiappa said .
the tourists aren ’ t just proving costly , however , they are also causing venetians to leave the city in every increasing numbers .
in the past fifty years , the population has halved to 62,000 .
according to statisticians , if the trend isn ’ t reversed , the city could be a ghost town by 2030 .
residents struggle “ one of the problems is that everything revolves around the tourists , ” complained local resident sergio malara .
“ it ’ s difficult to find the basics , such as a butcher shop or a fruit and vegetable store or a boot maker . ”
instead , streets in the center are lined with shops selling ceramic masks and venetian glass beads .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists bring revenue to venice , but they 're turning the city into a museum another problem is getting around the city ’ s narrow pedestrian streets and bridges .
malara has just moved away from the center because with so many visitors streaming into venice in the summer months , it was just too stressful to get to work .
and when one local moves out , it ’ s not that another moves in .
property prices are so high that few venetians can afford to buy or rent in the center .
this means vacant properties are let to tourists who happily fork out 100 euros a night for the luxury of a tiny room with an outside bathroom and resident mosquito population .
in an effort to keep residential housing from disappearing , the city council recently tightened up zoning regulations making it more difficult to open hotels .
but unfortunately , a loophole in the provincial law means pensions and bed and breakfasts can sprout up without restraint .
in the past few years , more than 700 have opened in venice .
cap on visitors one proposition being tossed around to mitigate the tourist problem is the idea of limiting the number of visitors who can enter the city each day .
according to hotelier chiappa , however , the council needs to do more to even out the flow of tourists to venice before even discussing such “ drastic measures . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evening in venice “ the tourist season runs from april to october , and in winter hotel occupancy falls to below 50 percent , ” chiappa said .
he is critical that major events are held in june and september , and museum exhibitions tend to run over summer .
“ you can just as well go to a museum in winter , ” he said .
as the sun starts setting , the tourists trickle out of the city and the venetians descend into venice ’ s squares to enjoy the balmy evening .
but those drinking aperitivi and chatting on park benches are mostly grey-haired pensioners .
venice ’ s young families have long moved elsewhere . kate hairsine send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the soccer teams have agreed not to reveal transfer details , but bayern increased an original offer of 10 million euros -lrb- $ 13.4 million -rrb- to at least 12 million euros , according to german sports magazine kicker . bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said " a fair solution for both sides " had been reached .
werder sports director klaus allofs meanwhile said the deal had come about after bayern this week hugely upped its offer for the 29-year-old .
" bayern have met our demands so that we can agree to the transfer in the circumstances , " he said .
money no object to bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several international stars are joining bayern next season klose , capped 69 times by germany , had originally said only a top club outside germany could lure him away from bremen , but relations with werder deteriorated after he revealed towards the end of last season that he had been in negotiations with bayern .
the transfer ends a period of unprecedented spending by bayern in an attempt by the bundesliga record champions to reverse their fortunes after a disappointing fourth-place end to last season , missing out on a champions league birth in their worst performance in 10 years .
the team has spent some 53 million euros to secure new players including italy striker luca toni and the france international midfielder franck ribery with the hopes of returning to the top of the german table and competing in the champions league .
others to join are germany defender marcell jansen , germany striker jan schlaudraff , argentinean midfielder jose ernesto sosa , the turkish midfielder hamit altintop and brazilian midfielder ze roberto .
more roster changes expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : national side team mates , klose and podolski will pair up every week in the bundesliga the arrival of klose is now likely to see the departure of dutch striker roy makaay who has already been told he can leave if he receives an offer .
both feyenoord rotterdam and psv eindhoven are said to be interested .
klose will now link up with his germany striker partner lukas podolski in munich , but it remains to be seen how coach ottmar hitzfeld will use them together with toni also in the picture .
end to wrangling werder and bayern had appeared to have reached deadlock over klose after weeks of negotiations , most of which took place openly in the german press .
werder had turned down bayern 's approaches for the player and insisted klose , who has scored 53 goals in 89 league games for werder , would complete his contract until 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego will be left managing bremen without klose next season " we know we are losing a successful player , but miro 's change of mind and the new offer from bayern has changed the situation we were in at the end of the season and persuaded us not to continue the cooperation , " allofs said .
allofs said werder would be making no immediate move to seek a replacement for klose .
werder will go into the new season with a strike force of markus rosenberg , hugo almeida , aaron hunt and youngsters kevin schindler and martin harnik .
croatia striker ivan klasnic , who has undergone a kidney transplant operation , is also still on the books .

hitler was n't seriously injured in the attack , codenamed operation valkyrie .
the filmmakers " will not be allowed to film at german military sites if count stauffenberg is played by tom cruise , who has publicly professed to being a member of the scientology cult , " german defense ministry spokesman harald kammerbauer said . the church of scientology is not recognized as legitimate by the german government .
kammerbauer said the ministry had not yet received official filming requests from the producers of " valkyrie . " cruise " per fect for the part " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruise is a controversial figure in germany the ban on filming at military sites drew criticism from cruise 's film producing partner , paula wagner , chief executive of united artists entertainment .
she said " valkyrie " is a " historically accurate thriller " and that cruise was offered the role because the movie 's director , bryan singer , " thought he was perfect for the part . "
" aside from his obvious admiration of the man he is portraying , mr. cruise 's personal beliefs have absolutely no bearing on the movie 's plot , themes , or content , " wagner said in a statement .
" and even though we could shoot the movie anywhere in the world , we believe germany is the only place we can truly do the story justice . " scientology 's biggest star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientology is not an officially recognized religion in germany hollywood star tom cruise is one of the best-known members of the church of scientology .
the cult is based on the writings of the late science-fiction author l. ron hubbard , who began scientology as a self-help discipline .
cruise has lobbied german officials in the past over the country 's refusal to recognize scientology as a legitimate church .
the german government views it as a fake religion based on making money from its followers .
stauffenberg 's family has also expressed their displeasure with cruise portraying their father .
stauffenberg 's oldest son , berthold , said in a recent interview with süddeutsche zeitung newspaper that he objected to a practicing scientologist playing his father . " i hoped for a while that it was all just a publicity stunt by mr. cruise , " said the 72-year-old retired major general of the german bundeswehr .
he added that cruise " should keep his hands off my father . "
" it 's sure to be crap , " he said of the movie .
" of course i could be wrong - i would like to be . "
historical figure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the movie will focus on stauffenberg 's failed plot to assasinate hitler " in general , the bundeswehr -lrb- german military -rrb- has a special interest in the serious and authentic portrayal of the events of july 20 , 1944 and stauffenberg 's person , " kammerbauer said .
stauffenberg had deeply opposed to the nazis ' treatment of the jews .
stauffenberg was subsequently caught and shot by firing squad the same night .
the plot 's failure led to the arrest of more than 5,000 people , and the execution of some 200 others .
the film 's action will center around the bendlerblock memorial inside the defense ministry complex in berlin .
stauffenberg and his co-conspirators planned the assassination there .
it 's also the spot where they were executed after the plot failed .

the soccer teams have agreed not to reveal transfer details , but bayern increased an original offer of 10 million euros -lrb- $ 13.4 million -rrb- to at least 12 million euros , according to german sports magazine kicker . bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said " a fair solution for both sides " had been reached .
werder sports director klaus allofs meanwhile said the deal had come about after bayern this week hugely upped its offer for the 29-year-old .
" bayern have met our demands so that we can agree to the transfer in the circumstances , " he said .
money no object to bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several international stars are joining bayern next season klose , capped 69 times by germany , had originally said only a top club outside germany could lure him away from bremen , but relations with werder deteriorated after he revealed towards the end of last season that he had been in negotiations with bayern .
the transfer ends a period of unprecedented spending by bayern in an attempt by the bundesliga record champions to reverse their fortunes after a disappointing fourth-place end to last season , missing out on a champions league birth in their worst performance in 10 years .
the team has spent some 53 million euros to secure new players including italy striker luca toni and the france international midfielder franck ribery with the hopes of returning to the top of the german table and competing in the champions league .
others to join are germany defender marcell jansen , germany striker jan schlaudraff , argentinean midfielder jose ernesto sosa , the turkish midfielder hamit altintop and brazilian midfielder ze roberto .
more roster changes expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : national side team mates , klose and podolski will pair up every week in the bundesliga the arrival of klose is now likely to see the departure of dutch striker roy makaay who has already been told he can leave if he receives an offer .
both feyenoord rotterdam and psv eindhoven are said to be interested .
klose will now link up with his germany striker partner lukas podolski in munich , but it remains to be seen how coach ottmar hitzfeld will use them together with toni also in the picture .
end to wrangling werder and bayern had appeared to have reached deadlock over klose after weeks of negotiations , most of which took place openly in the german press .
werder had turned down bayern 's approaches for the player and insisted klose , who has scored 53 goals in 89 league games for werder , would complete his contract until 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego will be left managing bremen without klose next season " we know we are losing a successful player , but miro 's change of mind and the new offer from bayern has changed the situation we were in at the end of the season and persuaded us not to continue the cooperation , " allofs said .
allofs said werder would be making no immediate move to seek a replacement for klose .
werder will go into the new season with a strike force of markus rosenberg , hugo almeida , aaron hunt and youngsters kevin schindler and martin harnik .
croatia striker ivan klasnic , who has undergone a kidney transplant operation , is also still on the books .

but the measure has been criticized for ignoring the bigger issue of just how many tourists the lagoon city can handle . on this sunny june day , thousands of tourists mill around one of the world ’ s most famous squares , venice ’ s piazza san marco .
as tour groups from china to portugal throng around the entrance of st. mark ’ s basilica , others shriek with laughter as pigeons alight on their outstretched arms .
a group of brightly dressed indian tourists have kicked off their sandals and are relaxed on the steps surrounding the square .
next to them , a dutch family unpacks an large picnic hamper .
similar scenes are repeated all around the piazza , which with its combination of magnificent views and shaded loggia , seems like the ideal spot for a break .
but it ’ s exactly this type of behavior that the venice city council is trying to stop .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venice 's tourist " hostesses " - there to maintain decorum the council has banned eating , sunbathing , lying down and camping in the piazza and its surrounding neighborhood , and has introduced guards of a sort , called " hostesses , " to reprimand those who break the rules .
“ the seven hostesses are there to promote the idea of respect , ” said venice ’ s town councilor for tourism , augusto salvadori .
“ they explain to tourists that they can ’ t picnic in the square or bare their torsos , for example , and also remind them that they can ’ t just leave their rubbish on the ground . ”
salvadori said the introduction of the hostesses was a “ positive initiative ” which would restore “ decorum and cleanliness ” to the square .
but at piazza san marco , the crackdown doesn ’ t seem that popular with the visitors .
“ it ’ s ridiculous , ” said american courtney walker , clutching a burger and fries .
she ’ s just been shooed off the steps along with her friends for eating .
“ there ’ s nowhere in mcdonald ’ s to eat , and the square is enormous . ”
her sentiments are also shared many venetians , who say the hostesses don ’ t solve the bigger issue of how to deal with the more than 19.5 million tourists who flock to venice each year .
too many tourists ?
“ instead of devising policies for tourism and planning for the future , the administration is banning the eating of sandwiches , ” said andrea chiappa , the vice-president of venice ’ s hoteliers association , with a shake of his head .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venice 's charms are many , so are its tourists after rome , venice is the most popular destination in italy but the majority of visitors are day trippers who arrive with their water bottles and packed lunches in an effort to avoid venice ’ s high prices .
" the day trippers cost much more in maintenance and cleaning than they bring to the city , ” chiappa said .
the tourists aren ’ t just proving costly , however , they are also causing venetians to leave the city in every increasing numbers .
in the past fifty years , the population has halved to 62,000 .
according to statisticians , if the trend isn ’ t reversed , the city could be a ghost town by 2030 .
residents struggle “ one of the problems is that everything revolves around the tourists , ” complained local resident sergio malara .
“ it ’ s difficult to find the basics , such as a butcher shop or a fruit and vegetable store or a boot maker . ”
instead , streets in the center are lined with shops selling ceramic masks and venetian glass beads .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists bring revenue to venice , but they 're turning the city into a museum another problem is getting around the city ’ s narrow pedestrian streets and bridges .
malara has just moved away from the center because with so many visitors streaming into venice in the summer months , it was just too stressful to get to work .
and when one local moves out , it ’ s not that another moves in .
property prices are so high that few venetians can afford to buy or rent in the center .
this means vacant properties are let to tourists who happily fork out 100 euros a night for the luxury of a tiny room with an outside bathroom and resident mosquito population .
in an effort to keep residential housing from disappearing , the city council recently tightened up zoning regulations making it more difficult to open hotels .
but unfortunately , a loophole in the provincial law means pensions and bed and breakfasts can sprout up without restraint .
in the past few years , more than 700 have opened in venice .
cap on visitors one proposition being tossed around to mitigate the tourist problem is the idea of limiting the number of visitors who can enter the city each day .
according to hotelier chiappa , however , the council needs to do more to even out the flow of tourists to venice before even discussing such “ drastic measures . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evening in venice “ the tourist season runs from april to october , and in winter hotel occupancy falls to below 50 percent , ” chiappa said .
he is critical that major events are held in june and september , and museum exhibitions tend to run over summer .
“ you can just as well go to a museum in winter , ” he said .
as the sun starts setting , the tourists trickle out of the city and the venetians descend into venice ’ s squares to enjoy the balmy evening .
but those drinking aperitivi and chatting on park benches are mostly grey-haired pensioners .
venice ’ s young families have long moved elsewhere . kate hairsine send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

“ they explain to tourists that they can ’ t picnic in the square or bare their torsos , for example , and also remind them that they can ’ t just leave their rubbish on the ground . ”
salvadori said the introduction of the hostesses was a “ positive initiative ” which would restore “ decorum and cleanliness ” to the square .

the soccer teams have agreed not to reveal transfer details , but bayern increased an original offer of 10 million euros -lrb- $ 13.4 million -rrb- to at least 12 million euros , according to german sports magazine kicker . bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said " a fair solution for both sides " had been reached .
werder sports director klaus allofs meanwhile said the deal had come about after bayern this week hugely upped its offer for the 29-year-old .
" bayern have met our demands so that we can agree to the transfer in the circumstances , " he said .
money no object to bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several international stars are joining bayern next season klose , capped 69 times by germany , had originally said only a top club outside germany could lure him away from bremen , but relations with werder deteriorated after he revealed towards the end of last season that he had been in negotiations with bayern .
the transfer ends a period of unprecedented spending by bayern in an attempt by the bundesliga record champions to reverse their fortunes after a disappointing fourth-place end to last season , missing out on a champions league birth in their worst performance in 10 years .
the team has spent some 53 million euros to secure new players including italy striker luca toni and the france international midfielder franck ribery with the hopes of returning to the top of the german table and competing in the champions league .
others to join are germany defender marcell jansen , germany striker jan schlaudraff , argentinean midfielder jose ernesto sosa , the turkish midfielder hamit altintop and brazilian midfielder ze roberto .
more roster changes expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : national side team mates , klose and podolski will pair up every week in the bundesliga the arrival of klose is now likely to see the departure of dutch striker roy makaay who has already been told he can leave if he receives an offer .
both feyenoord rotterdam and psv eindhoven are said to be interested .
klose will now link up with his germany striker partner lukas podolski in munich , but it remains to be seen how coach ottmar hitzfeld will use them together with toni also in the picture .
end to wrangling werder and bayern had appeared to have reached deadlock over klose after weeks of negotiations , most of which took place openly in the german press .
werder had turned down bayern 's approaches for the player and insisted klose , who has scored 53 goals in 89 league games for werder , would complete his contract until 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego will be left managing bremen without klose next season " we know we are losing a successful player , but miro 's change of mind and the new offer from bayern has changed the situation we were in at the end of the season and persuaded us not to continue the cooperation , " allofs said .
allofs said werder would be making no immediate move to seek a replacement for klose .
werder will go into the new season with a strike force of markus rosenberg , hugo almeida , aaron hunt and youngsters kevin schindler and martin harnik .
croatia striker ivan klasnic , who has undergone a kidney transplant operation , is also still on the books .
" we are watching the market but are under no pressure to take action , " allofs said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but an important " chapter " on economic and monetary policy was left out at the urging of french president nicolas sarkozy . instead , the eu began discussing two other less important issues at tuesday 's accession talks in brussels : statistics and financial control . these are two of 35 chapters which make up eu law .
all of these chapters have to be negotiated before a country can join the european union .
the german eu presidency wanted to discuss important areas of economic and monetary policy with turkey this week .
but it was left off the agenda to appease sarkozy , who threatened to block the issue , according to diplomats . sarkozy outspoken on turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy does n't want turkey in the eu sarkozy has been a vocal opponent of turkey joining the eu , saying in an interview with the parisian newspaper le figaro that the muslim country had " no place in europe . "
he would like to see a strategic partnership , but not eu membership for turkey .
a french diplomat noted that not all policy areas could be treated the same . " negotiations with turkey continue , " he said , according to news reports .
" but there are chapters and there are chapters . "
a turkish foreign ministry official said ankara was unhappy with the fact that the bloc did not agree to start negotiations on the more important area of economic and monetary policy .
" if it is technical we will tackle any problems and move on -lrb- with that chapter -rrb- , but if the decision is politically motivated we could not welcome that , " the official said . turkey not giving up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish negotiators have a lot of convincing to do speaking just before news of the decision , turkish economy minister and chief negotiator ali babacan said ankara would not give up on the talks .
the country will push ahead to meet conditions to join the eu , he said .
" regardless of what chapters are opened , regardless of what chapters are closed , we will integrate our legislation as soon as possible , and we will wait -lrb- until the eu is ready for turkish membership -rrb- , " babacan said at an investor conference in istanbul .
the talks are still in their beginning stages and it 's premature for sarkozy to oppose turkey 's inclusion in the eu , said cornelius ochmann , an expert for eu enlargement issues at the bertelsmann foundation .
" sarkozy would like to completely abandon the negotiations , " ochmann said .
" however , that would mean that the eu could have no further positive influence over turkey and that it would be very isolated . "
negotiations should be carried out to the end , ochmann said .
it could take as long as 15 years before all 35 chapters are negotiated .
even then , entry would not be automatic .
eu officials would not only check whether turkey had met all of its conditions but also whether the eu is politically and economically strong enough to take turkey on as a new member .
the hurdles for turkey 's membership are higher than for all other candidates , ochmann said .
the fact that economic issues wo n't be brought up is " a negative signal , almost a small rejection , " of turkey , ochmann said . cyprus still a problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : negotiations with turkey will take at least a decade gerald knaus of the european stability initiative -lrb- esi -rrb- , an expert for south eastern european politics predicts that the cyprus problem will continue to hang over the negotiations .
the eu last year suspended negotiations on eight chapters after turkey failed to meet a requirement to open its ports and airports to traffic from cyprus .
" there are reservations , but the eu machine is running and it 's better to discuss two chapters than no chapters . "
croatia 's eu bid looking bright while turkey 's inclusion in the eu is still a distant possibility , croatia is closing in on its goal of joining the eu in 2009 . on tuesday , croatia opened six further chapters for negotiation .
eleven have already been decided . " the opening of these six chapters sends a strong signal , " said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency till the end of the month .
" it 's a real breakthrough . " croatian foreign minister kolinda grabar-kitarovic said she expected her country to meet eu benchmarks and close several chapters of negotiation in 2008 . " we expect 2009 to be the year when we achieve readiness for accession , meaning concluding negotiations , signing the accession treaty and beginning the accession process , " she said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but an important " chapter " on economic and monetary policy was left out at the urging of french president nicolas sarkozy . instead , the eu began discussing two other less important issues at tuesday 's accession talks in brussels : statistics and financial control . these are two of 35 chapters which make up eu law .
all of these chapters have to be negotiated before a country can join the european union .
the german eu presidency wanted to discuss important areas of economic and monetary policy with turkey this week .
but it was left off the agenda to appease sarkozy , who threatened to block the issue , according to diplomats . sarkozy outspoken on turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy does n't want turkey in the eu sarkozy has been a vocal opponent of turkey joining the eu , saying in an interview with the parisian newspaper le figaro that the muslim country had " no place in europe . "
he would like to see a strategic partnership , but not eu membership for turkey .
a french diplomat noted that not all policy areas could be treated the same . " negotiations with turkey continue , " he said , according to news reports .
" but there are chapters and there are chapters . "
a turkish foreign ministry official said ankara was unhappy with the fact that the bloc did not agree to start negotiations on the more important area of economic and monetary policy .
" if it is technical we will tackle any problems and move on -lrb- with that chapter -rrb- , but if the decision is politically motivated we could not welcome that , " the official said . turkey not giving up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish negotiators have a lot of convincing to do speaking just before news of the decision , turkish economy minister and chief negotiator ali babacan said ankara would not give up on the talks .
the country will push ahead to meet conditions to join the eu , he said .
" regardless of what chapters are opened , regardless of what chapters are closed , we will integrate our legislation as soon as possible , and we will wait -lrb- until the eu is ready for turkish membership -rrb- , " babacan said at an investor conference in istanbul .
the talks are still in their beginning stages and it 's premature for sarkozy to oppose turkey 's inclusion in the eu , said cornelius ochmann , an expert for eu enlargement issues at the bertelsmann foundation .
" sarkozy would like to completely abandon the negotiations , " ochmann said .
" however , that would mean that the eu could have no further positive influence over turkey and that it would be very isolated . "
negotiations should be carried out to the end , ochmann said .
it could take as long as 15 years before all 35 chapters are negotiated .
even then , entry would not be automatic .
eu officials would not only check whether turkey had met all of its conditions but also whether the eu is politically and economically strong enough to take turkey on as a new member .
the hurdles for turkey 's membership are higher than for all other candidates , ochmann said .
the fact that economic issues wo n't be brought up is " a negative signal , almost a small rejection , " of turkey , ochmann said . cyprus still a problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : negotiations with turkey will take at least a decade gerald knaus of the european stability initiative -lrb- esi -rrb- , an expert for south eastern european politics predicts that the cyprus problem will continue to hang over the negotiations .
the eu last year suspended negotiations on eight chapters after turkey failed to meet a requirement to open its ports and airports to traffic from cyprus .
" there are reservations , but the eu machine is running and it 's better to discuss two chapters than no chapters . "
croatia 's eu bid looking bright while turkey 's inclusion in the eu is still a distant possibility , croatia is closing in on its goal of joining the eu in 2009 . on tuesday , croatia opened six further chapters for negotiation .
eleven have already been decided . " the opening of these six chapters sends a strong signal , " said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency till the end of the month .
" it 's a real breakthrough . " croatian foreign minister kolinda grabar-kitarovic said she expected her country to meet eu benchmarks and close several chapters of negotiation in 2008 . " we expect 2009 to be the year when we achieve readiness for accession , meaning concluding negotiations , signing the accession treaty and beginning the accession process , " she said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the soccer teams have agreed not to reveal transfer details , but bayern increased an original offer of 10 million euros -lrb- $ 13.4 million -rrb- to at least 12 million euros , according to german sports magazine kicker . bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said " a fair solution for both sides " had been reached .
werder sports director klaus allofs meanwhile said the deal had come about after bayern this week hugely upped its offer for the 29-year-old .
" bayern have met our demands so that we can agree to the transfer in the circumstances , " he said .
money no object to bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several international stars are joining bayern next season klose , capped 69 times by germany , had originally said only a top club outside germany could lure him away from bremen , but relations with werder deteriorated after he revealed towards the end of last season that he had been in negotiations with bayern .
the transfer ends a period of unprecedented spending by bayern in an attempt by the bundesliga record champions to reverse their fortunes after a disappointing fourth-place end to last season , missing out on a champions league birth in their worst performance in 10 years .
the team has spent some 53 million euros to secure new players including italy striker luca toni and the france international midfielder franck ribery with the hopes of returning to the top of the german table and competing in the champions league .
others to join are germany defender marcell jansen , germany striker jan schlaudraff , argentinean midfielder jose ernesto sosa , the turkish midfielder hamit altintop and brazilian midfielder ze roberto .
more roster changes expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : national side team mates , klose and podolski will pair up every week in the bundesliga the arrival of klose is now likely to see the departure of dutch striker roy makaay who has already been told he can leave if he receives an offer .
both feyenoord rotterdam and psv eindhoven are said to be interested .
klose will now link up with his germany striker partner lukas podolski in munich , but it remains to be seen how coach ottmar hitzfeld will use them together with toni also in the picture .
end to wrangling werder and bayern had appeared to have reached deadlock over klose after weeks of negotiations , most of which took place openly in the german press .
werder had turned down bayern 's approaches for the player and insisted klose , who has scored 53 goals in 89 league games for werder , would complete his contract until 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego will be left managing bremen without klose next season " we know we are losing a successful player , but miro 's change of mind and the new offer from bayern has changed the situation we were in at the end of the season and persuaded us not to continue the cooperation , " allofs said .
allofs said werder would be making no immediate move to seek a replacement for klose .
werder will go into the new season with a strike force of markus rosenberg , hugo almeida , aaron hunt and youngsters kevin schindler and martin harnik .
croatia striker ivan klasnic , who has undergone a kidney transplant operation , is also still on the books .

" something very negative is going on in germany , " kaczynski said in an interview for polish public radio on tuesday .
" like in an era which already passed , when the large majority of europeans did n't have the courage to talk about it , it is the same today . " " so i 'm issuing a warning , and i 'm addressing the german authorities as the polish prime minister , do not tolerate this kind of thing , these kind of statements , because that leads to the worst , to trouble which can happen in europe , but which in affecting europe will hit the germans too , " he said . kaczynski was reacting to a caricature in a berlin daily about replacing the majority voting process in the new eu treaty with the square root of all world war dead . the cartoon referred to polish proposals last week to change the voting system with an arithmetic calcuation that would take the square root of populations and comments that poland 's war dead should be taken into account . " there is now a situation in europe in which one can not talk about german blame for the war , but very well about polish concentration camps and a polish responsibility for the holocaust , " the polish leader said . breast-feeding image sparks anger kaczynski 's comments add further fuel to a bonfire already crackling between the two nations . in the aftermath of a turbulent eu summit , where germany and poland clashed over the voting procedure in the new eu treaty , german mass-market bild tabloid dubbed the polish president and prime minister , twins , " poison dwarves . " the polish press this week seemed to be contributing just as little to reconciliation between the two nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the front page of " wprost , " a conservative magazine which often has controversial covers some german politicians said tuesday they were outraged by the latest cover of wprosta , a widely-read conservative polish weekly magazine , depicting german chancellor angela merkel breast-feeding the kaczynski twins under the title " stepmother of europe . " " germany used to be an advocate of poland , but now it 's become our prosecutor , " read the subtitle of the leading article . " the poles should stop outdoing themselves with tasteless remarks , " said christian social union 's foreign expert eduard lintner .
" sooner or later , this will have an effect on the mood in germany , which is , at the moment , still cooperative . " according to markus meckel , head of the german-polish parliamentarian group , poland needs to rethink its diplomatic strategy .
" in the last weeks and months , poland has lost many friends , " meckel , who is a member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- said .
" in the future , the country should think hard about how it could win over partners and friends . "
" a little funny " neither the chancellor nor the kaczynski twins have commented on the cover story.what has rankled germany is that one of the authors of the story in the polish weekly , mariusz muszynski is an advisor on germany to the polish foreign ministry .
the editor of wprost , stanislaw janecki , however told german media that the reaction in germany was overblown . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who 's who ?
the polish power twins have been stirring things up in the eu " the cover 's message , " janecki told spiegel online , " is that germany , especially ms. merkel , was trying to treat poles and the polish leaders as small children completely unable to act on their own and somehow dependent on germany .
there is the impression that germany , being more powerful , wants to dominate poland and that the kaczynski brothers want to stand up to this domination . "
he said he could not imagine merkel taking offence . ” we looked for a model that was not too thin but who had a beautiful body , ” janecki said .
" we imagined it to be a little funny . the stepmother is often more sexy and more friendly that the real mother is . "
he pointed out that the image is n't just critical of merkel . " it is also critical of the kaczynskis because the relationship between these politicians has become abnormal .
it has become threatened by history and by national points of view .
there are many factors , but the relationship is clearly not working , " he said .
the wprost cover is just the latest in a long-running media satire saga between the two countries .
last year , polish president lech kaczynski cancelled a meeting with merkel after left-wing berlin daily taz portrayed him as a polish potato .
wprost too is known for its hard-hitting covers and has published irreverent satirical images of former german chancellor gerhard schröder and erika steinbach , head of the german expelle association .
" poland is a big , important partner " the latest tensions come just a day after germany struck a reconciliatory tone with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier saying his country " has a duty to patiently seek a dialogue with poland , especially in difficult times , " given the fact that both countries were linked by " a terrible 20th century history . "
german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said that chancellor angela merkel 's administration was committed to playing its part in ensuring close ties between the neighboring countries .

hitler was n't seriously injured in the attack , codenamed operation valkyrie .
the filmmakers " will not be allowed to film at german military sites if count stauffenberg is played by tom cruise , who has publicly professed to being a member of the scientology cult , " german defense ministry spokesman harald kammerbauer said . the church of scientology is not recognized as legitimate by the german government .
kammerbauer said the ministry had not yet received official filming requests from the producers of " valkyrie . " cruise " per fect for the part " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruise is a controversial figure in germany the ban on filming at military sites drew criticism from cruise 's film producing partner , paula wagner , chief executive of united artists entertainment .
she said " valkyrie " is a " historically accurate thriller " and that cruise was offered the role because the movie 's director , bryan singer , " thought he was perfect for the part . "
" aside from his obvious admiration of the man he is portraying , mr. cruise 's personal beliefs have absolutely no bearing on the movie 's plot , themes , or content , " wagner said in a statement .
" and even though we could shoot the movie anywhere in the world , we believe germany is the only place we can truly do the story justice . " scientology 's biggest star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientology is not an officially recognized religion in germany hollywood star tom cruise is one of the best-known members of the church of scientology .
the cult is based on the writings of the late science-fiction author l. ron hubbard , who began scientology as a self-help discipline .
cruise has lobbied german officials in the past over the country 's refusal to recognize scientology as a legitimate church .
the german government views it as a fake religion based on making money from its followers .
stauffenberg 's family has also expressed their displeasure with cruise portraying their father .
stauffenberg 's oldest son , berthold , said in a recent interview with süddeutsche zeitung newspaper that he objected to a practicing scientologist playing his father . " i hoped for a while that it was all just a publicity stunt by mr. cruise , " said the 72-year-old retired major general of the german bundeswehr .
he added that cruise " should keep his hands off my father . "
" it 's sure to be crap , " he said of the movie .
" of course i could be wrong - i would like to be . "
historical figure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the movie will focus on stauffenberg 's failed plot to assasinate hitler " in general , the bundeswehr -lrb- german military -rrb- has a special interest in the serious and authentic portrayal of the events of july 20 , 1944 and stauffenberg 's person , " kammerbauer said .
stauffenberg had deeply opposed to the nazis ' treatment of the jews .
stauffenberg was subsequently caught and shot by firing squad the same night .
the plot 's failure led to the arrest of more than 5,000 people , and the execution of some 200 others .
the film 's action will center around the bendlerblock memorial inside the defense ministry complex in berlin .
stauffenberg and his co-conspirators planned the assassination there .
it 's also the spot where they were executed after the plot failed .

hitler was n't seriously injured in the attack , codenamed operation valkyrie .
the filmmakers " will not be allowed to film at german military sites if count stauffenberg is played by tom cruise , who has publicly professed to being a member of the scientology cult , " german defense ministry spokesman harald kammerbauer said . the church of scientology is not recognized as legitimate by the german government .
kammerbauer said the ministry had not yet received official filming requests from the producers of " valkyrie . " cruise " per fect for the part " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruise is a controversial figure in germany the ban on filming at military sites drew criticism from cruise 's film producing partner , paula wagner , chief executive of united artists entertainment .
she said " valkyrie " is a " historically accurate thriller " and that cruise was offered the role because the movie 's director , bryan singer , " thought he was perfect for the part . "
" aside from his obvious admiration of the man he is portraying , mr. cruise 's personal beliefs have absolutely no bearing on the movie 's plot , themes , or content , " wagner said in a statement .
" and even though we could shoot the movie anywhere in the world , we believe germany is the only place we can truly do the story justice . " scientology 's biggest star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientology is not an officially recognized religion in germany hollywood star tom cruise is one of the best-known members of the church of scientology .
the cult is based on the writings of the late science-fiction author l. ron hubbard , who began scientology as a self-help discipline .
cruise has lobbied german officials in the past over the country 's refusal to recognize scientology as a legitimate church .
the german government views it as a fake religion based on making money from its followers .
stauffenberg 's family has also expressed their displeasure with cruise portraying their father .
stauffenberg 's oldest son , berthold , said in a recent interview with süddeutsche zeitung newspaper that he objected to a practicing scientologist playing his father . " i hoped for a while that it was all just a publicity stunt by mr. cruise , " said the 72-year-old retired major general of the german bundeswehr .
he added that cruise " should keep his hands off my father . "
" it 's sure to be crap , " he said of the movie .
" of course i could be wrong - i would like to be . "
historical figure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the movie will focus on stauffenberg 's failed plot to assasinate hitler " in general , the bundeswehr -lrb- german military -rrb- has a special interest in the serious and authentic portrayal of the events of july 20 , 1944 and stauffenberg 's person , " kammerbauer said .
stauffenberg had deeply opposed to the nazis ' treatment of the jews .
stauffenberg was subsequently caught and shot by firing squad the same night .
the plot 's failure led to the arrest of more than 5,000 people , and the execution of some 200 others .
the film 's action will center around the bendlerblock memorial inside the defense ministry complex in berlin .
stauffenberg and his co-conspirators planned the assassination there .
it 's also the spot where they were executed after the plot failed .
the movie is scheduled for release next year . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" something very negative is going on in germany , " kaczynski said in an interview for polish public radio on tuesday .
" like in an era which already passed , when the large majority of europeans did n't have the courage to talk about it , it is the same today . " " so i 'm issuing a warning , and i 'm addressing the german authorities as the polish prime minister , do not tolerate this kind of thing , these kind of statements , because that leads to the worst , to trouble which can happen in europe , but which in affecting europe will hit the germans too , " he said . kaczynski was reacting to a caricature in a berlin daily about replacing the majority voting process in the new eu treaty with the square root of all world war dead . the cartoon referred to polish proposals last week to change the voting system with an arithmetic calcuation that would take the square root of populations and comments that poland 's war dead should be taken into account . " there is now a situation in europe in which one can not talk about german blame for the war , but very well about polish concentration camps and a polish responsibility for the holocaust , " the polish leader said . breast-feeding image sparks anger kaczynski 's comments add further fuel to a bonfire already crackling between the two nations . in the aftermath of a turbulent eu summit , where germany and poland clashed over the voting procedure in the new eu treaty , german mass-market bild tabloid dubbed the polish president and prime minister , twins , " poison dwarves . " the polish press this week seemed to be contributing just as little to reconciliation between the two nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the front page of " wprost , " a conservative magazine which often has controversial covers some german politicians said tuesday they were outraged by the latest cover of wprosta , a widely-read conservative polish weekly magazine , depicting german chancellor angela merkel breast-feeding the kaczynski twins under the title " stepmother of europe . " " germany used to be an advocate of poland , but now it 's become our prosecutor , " read the subtitle of the leading article . " the poles should stop outdoing themselves with tasteless remarks , " said christian social union 's foreign expert eduard lintner .
" sooner or later , this will have an effect on the mood in germany , which is , at the moment , still cooperative . " according to markus meckel , head of the german-polish parliamentarian group , poland needs to rethink its diplomatic strategy .
" in the last weeks and months , poland has lost many friends , " meckel , who is a member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- said .
" in the future , the country should think hard about how it could win over partners and friends . "
" a little funny " neither the chancellor nor the kaczynski twins have commented on the cover story.what has rankled germany is that one of the authors of the story in the polish weekly , mariusz muszynski is an advisor on germany to the polish foreign ministry .
the editor of wprost , stanislaw janecki , however told german media that the reaction in germany was overblown . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who 's who ?
the polish power twins have been stirring things up in the eu " the cover 's message , " janecki told spiegel online , " is that germany , especially ms. merkel , was trying to treat poles and the polish leaders as small children completely unable to act on their own and somehow dependent on germany .
there is the impression that germany , being more powerful , wants to dominate poland and that the kaczynski brothers want to stand up to this domination . "
he said he could not imagine merkel taking offence . ” we looked for a model that was not too thin but who had a beautiful body , ” janecki said .
" we imagined it to be a little funny . the stepmother is often more sexy and more friendly that the real mother is . "
he pointed out that the image is n't just critical of merkel . " it is also critical of the kaczynskis because the relationship between these politicians has become abnormal .
it has become threatened by history and by national points of view .
there are many factors , but the relationship is clearly not working , " he said .
the wprost cover is just the latest in a long-running media satire saga between the two countries .
last year , polish president lech kaczynski cancelled a meeting with merkel after left-wing berlin daily taz portrayed him as a polish potato .
wprost too is known for its hard-hitting covers and has published irreverent satirical images of former german chancellor gerhard schröder and erika steinbach , head of the german expelle association .
" poland is a big , important partner " the latest tensions come just a day after germany struck a reconciliatory tone with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier saying his country " has a duty to patiently seek a dialogue with poland , especially in difficult times , " given the fact that both countries were linked by " a terrible 20th century history . "
german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said that chancellor angela merkel 's administration was committed to playing its part in ensuring close ties between the neighboring countries . " poland is a big , important partner , " added wilhelm . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" germans are still in a shopping mood , " gfk said .
" rapid successes on the labor market and a globally favorable economic climate ensure that the positive sentiment is continuing into the summer . "

but an important " chapter " on economic and monetary policy was left out at the urging of french president nicolas sarkozy . instead , the eu began discussing two other less important issues at tuesday 's accession talks in brussels : statistics and financial control . these are two of 35 chapters which make up eu law .
all of these chapters have to be negotiated before a country can join the european union .
the german eu presidency wanted to discuss important areas of economic and monetary policy with turkey this week .
but it was left off the agenda to appease sarkozy , who threatened to block the issue , according to diplomats . sarkozy outspoken on turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy does n't want turkey in the eu sarkozy has been a vocal opponent of turkey joining the eu , saying in an interview with the parisian newspaper le figaro that the muslim country had " no place in europe . "
he would like to see a strategic partnership , but not eu membership for turkey .
a french diplomat noted that not all policy areas could be treated the same . " negotiations with turkey continue , " he said , according to news reports .
" but there are chapters and there are chapters . "
a turkish foreign ministry official said ankara was unhappy with the fact that the bloc did not agree to start negotiations on the more important area of economic and monetary policy .
" if it is technical we will tackle any problems and move on -lrb- with that chapter -rrb- , but if the decision is politically motivated we could not welcome that , " the official said . turkey not giving up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish negotiators have a lot of convincing to do speaking just before news of the decision , turkish economy minister and chief negotiator ali babacan said ankara would not give up on the talks .
the country will push ahead to meet conditions to join the eu , he said .
" regardless of what chapters are opened , regardless of what chapters are closed , we will integrate our legislation as soon as possible , and we will wait -lrb- until the eu is ready for turkish membership -rrb- , " babacan said at an investor conference in istanbul .
the talks are still in their beginning stages and it 's premature for sarkozy to oppose turkey 's inclusion in the eu , said cornelius ochmann , an expert for eu enlargement issues at the bertelsmann foundation .
" sarkozy would like to completely abandon the negotiations , " ochmann said .
" however , that would mean that the eu could have no further positive influence over turkey and that it would be very isolated . "
negotiations should be carried out to the end , ochmann said .
it could take as long as 15 years before all 35 chapters are negotiated .
even then , entry would not be automatic .
eu officials would not only check whether turkey had met all of its conditions but also whether the eu is politically and economically strong enough to take turkey on as a new member .
the hurdles for turkey 's membership are higher than for all other candidates , ochmann said .
the fact that economic issues wo n't be brought up is " a negative signal , almost a small rejection , " of turkey , ochmann said . cyprus still a problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : negotiations with turkey will take at least a decade gerald knaus of the european stability initiative -lrb- esi -rrb- , an expert for south eastern european politics predicts that the cyprus problem will continue to hang over the negotiations .

all of these chapters have to be negotiated before a country can join the european union .
the german eu presidency wanted to discuss important areas of economic and monetary policy with turkey this week .

he would like to see a strategic partnership , but not eu membership for turkey .
a french diplomat noted that not all policy areas could be treated the same . " negotiations with turkey continue , " he said , according to news reports .
" but there are chapters and there are chapters . "
a turkish foreign ministry official said ankara was unhappy with the fact that the bloc did not agree to start negotiations on the more important area of economic and monetary policy .

" however , that would mean that the eu could have no further positive influence over turkey and that it would be very isolated . "

it could take as long as 15 years before all 35 chapters are negotiated .
even then , entry would not be automatic .
eu officials would not only check whether turkey had met all of its conditions but also whether the eu is politically and economically strong enough to take turkey on as a new member .

" these talks are to draw the attention of the turkish authorities to the case and to contribute to the search for a solution so that this young man can swiftly rejoin his family in germany , " steinmeier said , adding that there were " humanitarian aspects " and " schooling requirements " involved . turkey cites eu entry criteria but turkish economy minister and the country 's chief eu negotiator , ali babacan ruled out any intervention , pointing out that the independence of the judiciary is one of the requirements made by the eu to all candidate states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german teenager has been held in a turkish prison for 10 weeks " as government … we do not want to interfere with the proceedings , and of course , this is an important criteria also for europe , " babacan told a news conference after the talks . babacan said the boy was allowed visits by his family and said a hearing was scheduled for july 6 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 26.06.2007 bayern end shopping spree by buying klose großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose is reported to receive over 10 million euros in a four-year deal germany striker miroslav klose has agreed to join bayern munich from bundesliga rivals werder bremen , both clubs said tuesday , putting to rest a long-running debate over the world cup golden boot winner 's future . klose , who had a contract with bremen for another season , is to sign a four-year deal with bayern on thursday and will begin pre-season training with his new club on friday .
the soccer teams have agreed not to reveal transfer details , but bayern increased an original offer of 10 million euros -lrb- $ 13.4 million -rrb- to at least 12 million euros , according to german sports magazine kicker . bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said " a fair solution for both sides " had been reached .
werder sports director klaus allofs meanwhile said the deal had come about after bayern this week hugely upped its offer for the 29-year-old .
" bayern have met our demands so that we can agree to the transfer in the circumstances , " he said .
money no object to bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several international stars are joining bayern next season klose , capped 69 times by germany , had originally said only a top club outside germany could lure him away from bremen , but relations with werder deteriorated after he revealed towards the end of last season that he had been in negotiations with bayern .
the transfer ends a period of unprecedented spending by bayern in an attempt by the bundesliga record champions to reverse their fortunes after a disappointing fourth-place end to last season , missing out on a champions league birth in their worst performance in 10 years .
the team has spent some 53 million euros to secure new players including italy striker luca toni and the france international midfielder franck ribery with the hopes of returning to the top of the german table and competing in the champions league .
others to join are germany defender marcell jansen , germany striker jan schlaudraff , argentinean midfielder jose ernesto sosa , the turkish midfielder hamit altintop and brazilian midfielder ze roberto .
more roster changes expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : national side team mates , klose and podolski will pair up every week in the bundesliga the arrival of klose is now likely to see the departure of dutch striker roy makaay who has already been told he can leave if he receives an offer .
both feyenoord rotterdam and psv eindhoven are said to be interested .
klose will now link up with his germany striker partner lukas podolski in munich , but it remains to be seen how coach ottmar hitzfeld will use them together with toni also in the picture .
end to wrangling werder and bayern had appeared to have reached deadlock over klose after weeks of negotiations , most of which took place openly in the german press .
werder had turned down bayern 's approaches for the player and insisted klose , who has scored 53 goals in 89 league games for werder , would complete his contract until 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego will be left managing bremen without klose next season " we know we are losing a successful player , but miro 's change of mind and the new offer from bayern has changed the situation we were in at the end of the season and persuaded us not to continue the cooperation , " allofs said .
allofs said werder would be making no immediate move to seek a replacement for klose .
werder will go into the new season with a strike force of markus rosenberg , hugo almeida , aaron hunt and youngsters kevin schindler and martin harnik .
croatia striker ivan klasnic , who has undergone a kidney transplant operation , is also still on the books .
" we are watching the market but are under no pressure to take action , " allofs said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the soccer teams have agreed not to reveal transfer details , but bayern increased an original offer of 10 million euros -lrb- $ 13.4 million -rrb- to at least 12 million euros , according to german sports magazine kicker . bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said " a fair solution for both sides " had been reached .
werder sports director klaus allofs meanwhile said the deal had come about after bayern this week hugely upped its offer for the 29-year-old .
" bayern have met our demands so that we can agree to the transfer in the circumstances , " he said .
money no object to bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several international stars are joining bayern next season klose , capped 69 times by germany , had originally said only a top club outside germany could lure him away from bremen , but relations with werder deteriorated after he revealed towards the end of last season that he had been in negotiations with bayern .
the transfer ends a period of unprecedented spending by bayern in an attempt by the bundesliga record champions to reverse their fortunes after a disappointing fourth-place end to last season , missing out on a champions league birth in their worst performance in 10 years .
the team has spent some 53 million euros to secure new players including italy striker luca toni and the france international midfielder franck ribery with the hopes of returning to the top of the german table and competing in the champions league .
others to join are germany defender marcell jansen , germany striker jan schlaudraff , argentinean midfielder jose ernesto sosa , the turkish midfielder hamit altintop and brazilian midfielder ze roberto .
more roster changes expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : national side team mates , klose and podolski will pair up every week in the bundesliga the arrival of klose is now likely to see the departure of dutch striker roy makaay who has already been told he can leave if he receives an offer .
both feyenoord rotterdam and psv eindhoven are said to be interested .
klose will now link up with his germany striker partner lukas podolski in munich , but it remains to be seen how coach ottmar hitzfeld will use them together with toni also in the picture .
end to wrangling werder and bayern had appeared to have reached deadlock over klose after weeks of negotiations , most of which took place openly in the german press .
werder had turned down bayern 's approaches for the player and insisted klose , who has scored 53 goals in 89 league games for werder , would complete his contract until 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego will be left managing bremen without klose next season " we know we are losing a successful player , but miro 's change of mind and the new offer from bayern has changed the situation we were in at the end of the season and persuaded us not to continue the cooperation , " allofs said .
allofs said werder would be making no immediate move to seek a replacement for klose .
werder will go into the new season with a strike force of markus rosenberg , hugo almeida , aaron hunt and youngsters kevin schindler and martin harnik .
croatia striker ivan klasnic , who has undergone a kidney transplant operation , is also still on the books .
" we are watching the market but are under no pressure to take action , " allofs said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" something very negative is going on in germany , " kaczynski said in an interview for polish public radio on tuesday .
" like in an era which already passed , when the large majority of europeans did n't have the courage to talk about it , it is the same today . " " so i 'm issuing a warning , and i 'm addressing the german authorities as the polish prime minister , do not tolerate this kind of thing , these kind of statements , because that leads to the worst , to trouble which can happen in europe , but which in affecting europe will hit the germans too , " he said . kaczynski was reacting to a caricature in a berlin daily about replacing the majority voting process in the new eu treaty with the square root of all world war dead . the cartoon referred to polish proposals last week to change the voting system with an arithmetic calcuation that would take the square root of populations and comments that poland 's war dead should be taken into account .

" the polish press this week seemed to be contributing just as little to reconciliation between the two nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the front page of " wprost , " a conservative magazine which often has controversial covers some german politicians said tuesday they were outraged by the latest cover of wprosta , a widely-read conservative polish weekly magazine , depicting german chancellor angela merkel breast-feeding the kaczynski twins under the title " stepmother of europe . " " germany used to be an advocate of poland , but now it 's become our prosecutor , " read the subtitle of the leading article . " the poles should stop outdoing themselves with tasteless remarks , " said christian social union 's foreign expert eduard lintner .
" sooner or later , this will have an effect on the mood in germany , which is , at the moment , still cooperative . " according to markus meckel , head of the german-polish parliamentarian group , poland needs to rethink its diplomatic strategy .
" in the last weeks and months , poland has lost many friends , " meckel , who is a member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- said .
" in the future , the country should think hard about how it could win over partners and friends . "
" a little funny " neither the chancellor nor the kaczynski twins have commented on the cover story.what has rankled germany is that one of the authors of the story in the polish weekly , mariusz muszynski is an advisor on germany to the polish foreign ministry .
the editor of wprost , stanislaw janecki , however told german media that the reaction in germany was overblown . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who 's who ?
the polish power twins have been stirring things up in the eu " the cover 's message , " janecki told spiegel online , " is that germany , especially ms. merkel , was trying to treat poles and the polish leaders as small children completely unable to act on their own and somehow dependent on germany .
there is the impression that germany , being more powerful , wants to dominate poland and that the kaczynski brothers want to stand up to this domination . "
he said he could not imagine merkel taking offence . ” we looked for a model that was not too thin but who had a beautiful body , ” janecki said .
" we imagined it to be a little funny . the stepmother is often more sexy and more friendly that the real mother is . "
he pointed out that the image is n't just critical of merkel . " it is also critical of the kaczynskis because the relationship between these politicians has become abnormal .
it has become threatened by history and by national points of view .
there are many factors , but the relationship is clearly not working , " he said .
the wprost cover is just the latest in a long-running media satire saga between the two countries .
last year , polish president lech kaczynski cancelled a meeting with merkel after left-wing berlin daily taz portrayed him as a polish potato .
wprost too is known for its hard-hitting covers and has published irreverent satirical images of former german chancellor gerhard schröder and erika steinbach , head of the german expelle association .
" poland is a big , important partner " the latest tensions come just a day after germany struck a reconciliatory tone with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier saying his country " has a duty to patiently seek a dialogue with poland , especially in difficult times , " given the fact that both countries were linked by " a terrible 20th century history . "
german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said that chancellor angela merkel 's administration was committed to playing its part in ensuring close ties between the neighboring countries .

the polish power twins have been stirring things up in the eu " the cover 's message , " janecki told spiegel online , " is that germany , especially ms. merkel , was trying to treat poles and the polish leaders as small children completely unable to act on their own and somehow dependent on germany .
there is the impression that germany , being more powerful , wants to dominate poland and that the kaczynski brothers want to stand up to this domination . "
he said he could not imagine merkel taking offence . ” we looked for a model that was not too thin but who had a beautiful body , ” janecki said .
" we imagined it to be a little funny . the stepmother is often more sexy and more friendly that the real mother is . "
he pointed out that the image is n't just critical of merkel . " it is also critical of the kaczynskis because the relationship between these politicians has become abnormal .
it has become threatened by history and by national points of view .
there are many factors , but the relationship is clearly not working , " he said .
the wprost cover is just the latest in a long-running media satire saga between the two countries .
last year , polish president lech kaczynski cancelled a meeting with merkel after left-wing berlin daily taz portrayed him as a polish potato .
wprost too is known for its hard-hitting covers and has published irreverent satirical images of former german chancellor gerhard schröder and erika steinbach , head of the german expelle association .
" poland is a big , important partner " the latest tensions come just a day after germany struck a reconciliatory tone with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier saying his country " has a duty to patiently seek a dialogue with poland , especially in difficult times , " given the fact that both countries were linked by " a terrible 20th century history . "
german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said that chancellor angela merkel 's administration was committed to playing its part in ensuring close ties between the neighboring countries . " poland is a big , important partner , " added wilhelm . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the soccer teams have agreed not to reveal transfer details , but bayern increased an original offer of 10 million euros -lrb- $ 13.4 million -rrb- to at least 12 million euros , according to german sports magazine kicker . bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said " a fair solution for both sides " had been reached .
werder sports director klaus allofs meanwhile said the deal had come about after bayern this week hugely upped its offer for the 29-year-old .
" bayern have met our demands so that we can agree to the transfer in the circumstances , " he said .
money no object to bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several international stars are joining bayern next season klose , capped 69 times by germany , had originally said only a top club outside germany could lure him away from bremen , but relations with werder deteriorated after he revealed towards the end of last season that he had been in negotiations with bayern .
the transfer ends a period of unprecedented spending by bayern in an attempt by the bundesliga record champions to reverse their fortunes after a disappointing fourth-place end to last season , missing out on a champions league birth in their worst performance in 10 years .
the team has spent some 53 million euros to secure new players including italy striker luca toni and the france international midfielder franck ribery with the hopes of returning to the top of the german table and competing in the champions league .
others to join are germany defender marcell jansen , germany striker jan schlaudraff , argentinean midfielder jose ernesto sosa , the turkish midfielder hamit altintop and brazilian midfielder ze roberto .

both feyenoord rotterdam and psv eindhoven are said to be interested .
klose will now link up with his germany striker partner lukas podolski in munich , but it remains to be seen how coach ottmar hitzfeld will use them together with toni also in the picture .
end to wrangling werder and bayern had appeared to have reached deadlock over klose after weeks of negotiations , most of which took place openly in the german press .
werder had turned down bayern 's approaches for the player and insisted klose , who has scored 53 goals in 89 league games for werder , would complete his contract until 2008 .

allofs said werder would be making no immediate move to seek a replacement for klose .

others to join are germany defender marcell jansen , germany striker jan schlaudraff , argentinean midfielder jose ernesto sosa , the turkish midfielder hamit altintop and brazilian midfielder ze roberto .
more roster changes expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : national side team mates , klose and podolski will pair up every week in the bundesliga the arrival of klose is now likely to see the departure of dutch striker roy makaay who has already been told he can leave if he receives an offer .
both feyenoord rotterdam and psv eindhoven are said to be interested .
klose will now link up with his germany striker partner lukas podolski in munich , but it remains to be seen how coach ottmar hitzfeld will use them together with toni also in the picture .
end to wrangling werder and bayern had appeared to have reached deadlock over klose after weeks of negotiations , most of which took place openly in the german press .
werder had turned down bayern 's approaches for the player and insisted klose , who has scored 53 goals in 89 league games for werder , would complete his contract until 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego will be left managing bremen without klose next season " we know we are losing a successful player , but miro 's change of mind and the new offer from bayern has changed the situation we were in at the end of the season and persuaded us not to continue the cooperation , " allofs said .
allofs said werder would be making no immediate move to seek a replacement for klose .
werder will go into the new season with a strike force of markus rosenberg , hugo almeida , aaron hunt and youngsters kevin schindler and martin harnik .
croatia striker ivan klasnic , who has undergone a kidney transplant operation , is also still on the books .
" we are watching the market but are under no pressure to take action , " allofs said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but an important " chapter " on economic and monetary policy was left out at the urging of french president nicolas sarkozy . instead , the eu began discussing two other less important issues at tuesday 's accession talks in brussels : statistics and financial control . these are two of 35 chapters which make up eu law .
all of these chapters have to be negotiated before a country can join the european union .
the german eu presidency wanted to discuss important areas of economic and monetary policy with turkey this week .
but it was left off the agenda to appease sarkozy , who threatened to block the issue , according to diplomats . sarkozy outspoken on turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy does n't want turkey in the eu sarkozy has been a vocal opponent of turkey joining the eu , saying in an interview with the parisian newspaper le figaro that the muslim country had " no place in europe . "
he would like to see a strategic partnership , but not eu membership for turkey .
a french diplomat noted that not all policy areas could be treated the same . " negotiations with turkey continue , " he said , according to news reports .
" but there are chapters and there are chapters . "
a turkish foreign ministry official said ankara was unhappy with the fact that the bloc did not agree to start negotiations on the more important area of economic and monetary policy .
" if it is technical we will tackle any problems and move on -lrb- with that chapter -rrb- , but if the decision is politically motivated we could not welcome that , " the official said . turkey not giving up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish negotiators have a lot of convincing to do speaking just before news of the decision , turkish economy minister and chief negotiator ali babacan said ankara would not give up on the talks .
the country will push ahead to meet conditions to join the eu , he said .
" regardless of what chapters are opened , regardless of what chapters are closed , we will integrate our legislation as soon as possible , and we will wait -lrb- until the eu is ready for turkish membership -rrb- , " babacan said at an investor conference in istanbul .
the talks are still in their beginning stages and it 's premature for sarkozy to oppose turkey 's inclusion in the eu , said cornelius ochmann , an expert for eu enlargement issues at the bertelsmann foundation .
" sarkozy would like to completely abandon the negotiations , " ochmann said .
" however , that would mean that the eu could have no further positive influence over turkey and that it would be very isolated . "
negotiations should be carried out to the end , ochmann said .
it could take as long as 15 years before all 35 chapters are negotiated .
even then , entry would not be automatic .
eu officials would not only check whether turkey had met all of its conditions but also whether the eu is politically and economically strong enough to take turkey on as a new member .
the hurdles for turkey 's membership are higher than for all other candidates , ochmann said .
the fact that economic issues wo n't be brought up is " a negative signal , almost a small rejection , " of turkey , ochmann said . cyprus still a problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : negotiations with turkey will take at least a decade gerald knaus of the european stability initiative -lrb- esi -rrb- , an expert for south eastern european politics predicts that the cyprus problem will continue to hang over the negotiations .

but the measure has been criticized for ignoring the bigger issue of just how many tourists the lagoon city can handle . on this sunny june day , thousands of tourists mill around one of the world ’ s most famous squares , venice ’ s piazza san marco .
as tour groups from china to portugal throng around the entrance of st. mark ’ s basilica , others shriek with laughter as pigeons alight on their outstretched arms .
a group of brightly dressed indian tourists have kicked off their sandals and are relaxed on the steps surrounding the square .
next to them , a dutch family unpacks an large picnic hamper .
similar scenes are repeated all around the piazza , which with its combination of magnificent views and shaded loggia , seems like the ideal spot for a break .
but it ’ s exactly this type of behavior that the venice city council is trying to stop .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venice 's tourist " hostesses " - there to maintain decorum the council has banned eating , sunbathing , lying down and camping in the piazza and its surrounding neighborhood , and has introduced guards of a sort , called " hostesses , " to reprimand those who break the rules .
“ the seven hostesses are there to promote the idea of respect , ” said venice ’ s town councilor for tourism , augusto salvadori .
“ they explain to tourists that they can ’ t picnic in the square or bare their torsos , for example , and also remind them that they can ’ t just leave their rubbish on the ground . ”
salvadori said the introduction of the hostesses was a “ positive initiative ” which would restore “ decorum and cleanliness ” to the square .
but at piazza san marco , the crackdown doesn ’ t seem that popular with the visitors .
“ it ’ s ridiculous , ” said american courtney walker , clutching a burger and fries .
she ’ s just been shooed off the steps along with her friends for eating .
“ there ’ s nowhere in mcdonald ’ s to eat , and the square is enormous . ”
her sentiments are also shared many venetians , who say the hostesses don ’ t solve the bigger issue of how to deal with the more than 19.5 million tourists who flock to venice each year .
too many tourists ?
“ instead of devising policies for tourism and planning for the future , the administration is banning the eating of sandwiches , ” said andrea chiappa , the vice-president of venice ’ s hoteliers association , with a shake of his head .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venice 's charms are many , so are its tourists after rome , venice is the most popular destination in italy but the majority of visitors are day trippers who arrive with their water bottles and packed lunches in an effort to avoid venice ’ s high prices .
" the day trippers cost much more in maintenance and cleaning than they bring to the city , ” chiappa said .
the tourists aren ’ t just proving costly , however , they are also causing venetians to leave the city in every increasing numbers .
in the past fifty years , the population has halved to 62,000 .
according to statisticians , if the trend isn ’ t reversed , the city could be a ghost town by 2030 .
residents struggle “ one of the problems is that everything revolves around the tourists , ” complained local resident sergio malara .
“ it ’ s difficult to find the basics , such as a butcher shop or a fruit and vegetable store or a boot maker . ”
instead , streets in the center are lined with shops selling ceramic masks and venetian glass beads .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists bring revenue to venice , but they 're turning the city into a museum another problem is getting around the city ’ s narrow pedestrian streets and bridges .
malara has just moved away from the center because with so many visitors streaming into venice in the summer months , it was just too stressful to get to work .
and when one local moves out , it ’ s not that another moves in .
property prices are so high that few venetians can afford to buy or rent in the center .
this means vacant properties are let to tourists who happily fork out 100 euros a night for the luxury of a tiny room with an outside bathroom and resident mosquito population .
in an effort to keep residential housing from disappearing , the city council recently tightened up zoning regulations making it more difficult to open hotels .
but unfortunately , a loophole in the provincial law means pensions and bed and breakfasts can sprout up without restraint .
in the past few years , more than 700 have opened in venice .
cap on visitors one proposition being tossed around to mitigate the tourist problem is the idea of limiting the number of visitors who can enter the city each day .
according to hotelier chiappa , however , the council needs to do more to even out the flow of tourists to venice before even discussing such “ drastic measures . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evening in venice “ the tourist season runs from april to october , and in winter hotel occupancy falls to below 50 percent , ” chiappa said .
he is critical that major events are held in june and september , and museum exhibitions tend to run over summer .
“ you can just as well go to a museum in winter , ” he said .
as the sun starts setting , the tourists trickle out of the city and the venetians descend into venice ’ s squares to enjoy the balmy evening .
but those drinking aperitivi and chatting on park benches are mostly grey-haired pensioners .
venice ’ s young families have long moved elsewhere . kate hairsine send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the soccer teams have agreed not to reveal transfer details , but bayern increased an original offer of 10 million euros -lrb- $ 13.4 million -rrb- to at least 12 million euros , according to german sports magazine kicker . bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said " a fair solution for both sides " had been reached .
werder sports director klaus allofs meanwhile said the deal had come about after bayern this week hugely upped its offer for the 29-year-old .
" bayern have met our demands so that we can agree to the transfer in the circumstances , " he said .
money no object to bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several international stars are joining bayern next season klose , capped 69 times by germany , had originally said only a top club outside germany could lure him away from bremen , but relations with werder deteriorated after he revealed towards the end of last season that he had been in negotiations with bayern .
the transfer ends a period of unprecedented spending by bayern in an attempt by the bundesliga record champions to reverse their fortunes after a disappointing fourth-place end to last season , missing out on a champions league birth in their worst performance in 10 years .
the team has spent some 53 million euros to secure new players including italy striker luca toni and the france international midfielder franck ribery with the hopes of returning to the top of the german table and competing in the champions league .
others to join are germany defender marcell jansen , germany striker jan schlaudraff , argentinean midfielder jose ernesto sosa , the turkish midfielder hamit altintop and brazilian midfielder ze roberto .
more roster changes expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : national side team mates , klose and podolski will pair up every week in the bundesliga the arrival of klose is now likely to see the departure of dutch striker roy makaay who has already been told he can leave if he receives an offer .
both feyenoord rotterdam and psv eindhoven are said to be interested .
klose will now link up with his germany striker partner lukas podolski in munich , but it remains to be seen how coach ottmar hitzfeld will use them together with toni also in the picture .
end to wrangling werder and bayern had appeared to have reached deadlock over klose after weeks of negotiations , most of which took place openly in the german press .
werder had turned down bayern 's approaches for the player and insisted klose , who has scored 53 goals in 89 league games for werder , would complete his contract until 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego will be left managing bremen without klose next season " we know we are losing a successful player , but miro 's change of mind and the new offer from bayern has changed the situation we were in at the end of the season and persuaded us not to continue the cooperation , " allofs said .
allofs said werder would be making no immediate move to seek a replacement for klose .
werder will go into the new season with a strike force of markus rosenberg , hugo almeida , aaron hunt and youngsters kevin schindler and martin harnik .
croatia striker ivan klasnic , who has undergone a kidney transplant operation , is also still on the books .

hitler was n't seriously injured in the attack , codenamed operation valkyrie .
the filmmakers " will not be allowed to film at german military sites if count stauffenberg is played by tom cruise , who has publicly professed to being a member of the scientology cult , " german defense ministry spokesman harald kammerbauer said . the church of scientology is not recognized as legitimate by the german government .
kammerbauer said the ministry had not yet received official filming requests from the producers of " valkyrie . " cruise " per fect for the part " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruise is a controversial figure in germany the ban on filming at military sites drew criticism from cruise 's film producing partner , paula wagner , chief executive of united artists entertainment .
she said " valkyrie " is a " historically accurate thriller " and that cruise was offered the role because the movie 's director , bryan singer , " thought he was perfect for the part . "
" aside from his obvious admiration of the man he is portraying , mr. cruise 's personal beliefs have absolutely no bearing on the movie 's plot , themes , or content , " wagner said in a statement .
" and even though we could shoot the movie anywhere in the world , we believe germany is the only place we can truly do the story justice . " scientology 's biggest star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientology is not an officially recognized religion in germany hollywood star tom cruise is one of the best-known members of the church of scientology .
the cult is based on the writings of the late science-fiction author l. ron hubbard , who began scientology as a self-help discipline .
cruise has lobbied german officials in the past over the country 's refusal to recognize scientology as a legitimate church .
the german government views it as a fake religion based on making money from its followers .
stauffenberg 's family has also expressed their displeasure with cruise portraying their father .
stauffenberg 's oldest son , berthold , said in a recent interview with süddeutsche zeitung newspaper that he objected to a practicing scientologist playing his father . " i hoped for a while that it was all just a publicity stunt by mr. cruise , " said the 72-year-old retired major general of the german bundeswehr .
he added that cruise " should keep his hands off my father . "
" it 's sure to be crap , " he said of the movie .
" of course i could be wrong - i would like to be . "
historical figure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the movie will focus on stauffenberg 's failed plot to assasinate hitler " in general , the bundeswehr -lrb- german military -rrb- has a special interest in the serious and authentic portrayal of the events of july 20 , 1944 and stauffenberg 's person , " kammerbauer said .
stauffenberg had deeply opposed to the nazis ' treatment of the jews .
stauffenberg was subsequently caught and shot by firing squad the same night .
the plot 's failure led to the arrest of more than 5,000 people , and the execution of some 200 others .
the film 's action will center around the bendlerblock memorial inside the defense ministry complex in berlin .
stauffenberg and his co-conspirators planned the assassination there .
it 's also the spot where they were executed after the plot failed .

but an important " chapter " on economic and monetary policy was left out at the urging of french president nicolas sarkozy . instead , the eu began discussing two other less important issues at tuesday 's accession talks in brussels : statistics and financial control . these are two of 35 chapters which make up eu law .
all of these chapters have to be negotiated before a country can join the european union .
the german eu presidency wanted to discuss important areas of economic and monetary policy with turkey this week .
but it was left off the agenda to appease sarkozy , who threatened to block the issue , according to diplomats . sarkozy outspoken on turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy does n't want turkey in the eu sarkozy has been a vocal opponent of turkey joining the eu , saying in an interview with the parisian newspaper le figaro that the muslim country had " no place in europe . "
he would like to see a strategic partnership , but not eu membership for turkey .
a french diplomat noted that not all policy areas could be treated the same . " negotiations with turkey continue , " he said , according to news reports .
" but there are chapters and there are chapters . "
a turkish foreign ministry official said ankara was unhappy with the fact that the bloc did not agree to start negotiations on the more important area of economic and monetary policy .
" if it is technical we will tackle any problems and move on -lrb- with that chapter -rrb- , but if the decision is politically motivated we could not welcome that , " the official said . turkey not giving up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish negotiators have a lot of convincing to do speaking just before news of the decision , turkish economy minister and chief negotiator ali babacan said ankara would not give up on the talks .
the country will push ahead to meet conditions to join the eu , he said .
" regardless of what chapters are opened , regardless of what chapters are closed , we will integrate our legislation as soon as possible , and we will wait -lrb- until the eu is ready for turkish membership -rrb- , " babacan said at an investor conference in istanbul .
the talks are still in their beginning stages and it 's premature for sarkozy to oppose turkey 's inclusion in the eu , said cornelius ochmann , an expert for eu enlargement issues at the bertelsmann foundation .
" sarkozy would like to completely abandon the negotiations , " ochmann said .
" however , that would mean that the eu could have no further positive influence over turkey and that it would be very isolated . "
negotiations should be carried out to the end , ochmann said .
it could take as long as 15 years before all 35 chapters are negotiated .
even then , entry would not be automatic .
eu officials would not only check whether turkey had met all of its conditions but also whether the eu is politically and economically strong enough to take turkey on as a new member .
the hurdles for turkey 's membership are higher than for all other candidates , ochmann said .
the fact that economic issues wo n't be brought up is " a negative signal , almost a small rejection , " of turkey , ochmann said . cyprus still a problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : negotiations with turkey will take at least a decade gerald knaus of the european stability initiative -lrb- esi -rrb- , an expert for south eastern european politics predicts that the cyprus problem will continue to hang over the negotiations .
the eu last year suspended negotiations on eight chapters after turkey failed to meet a requirement to open its ports and airports to traffic from cyprus .
" there are reservations , but the eu machine is running and it 's better to discuss two chapters than no chapters . "
croatia 's eu bid looking bright while turkey 's inclusion in the eu is still a distant possibility , croatia is closing in on its goal of joining the eu in 2009 . on tuesday , croatia opened six further chapters for negotiation .
eleven have already been decided . " the opening of these six chapters sends a strong signal , " said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency till the end of the month .
" it 's a real breakthrough . " croatian foreign minister kolinda grabar-kitarovic said she expected her country to meet eu benchmarks and close several chapters of negotiation in 2008 .

" regardless of what chapters are opened , regardless of what chapters are closed , we will integrate our legislation as soon as possible , and we will wait -lrb- until the eu is ready for turkish membership -rrb- , " babacan said at an investor conference in istanbul .
the talks are still in their beginning stages and it 's premature for sarkozy to oppose turkey 's inclusion in the eu , said cornelius ochmann , an expert for eu enlargement issues at the bertelsmann foundation .
" sarkozy would like to completely abandon the negotiations , " ochmann said .
" however , that would mean that the eu could have no further positive influence over turkey and that it would be very isolated . "
negotiations should be carried out to the end , ochmann said .
it could take as long as 15 years before all 35 chapters are negotiated .
even then , entry would not be automatic .
eu officials would not only check whether turkey had met all of its conditions but also whether the eu is politically and economically strong enough to take turkey on as a new member .
the hurdles for turkey 's membership are higher than for all other candidates , ochmann said .
the fact that economic issues wo n't be brought up is " a negative signal , almost a small rejection , " of turkey , ochmann said . cyprus still a problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : negotiations with turkey will take at least a decade gerald knaus of the european stability initiative -lrb- esi -rrb- , an expert for south eastern european politics predicts that the cyprus problem will continue to hang over the negotiations .
the eu last year suspended negotiations on eight chapters after turkey failed to meet a requirement to open its ports and airports to traffic from cyprus .
" there are reservations , but the eu machine is running and it 's better to discuss two chapters than no chapters . "
croatia 's eu bid looking bright while turkey 's inclusion in the eu is still a distant possibility , croatia is closing in on its goal of joining the eu in 2009 . on tuesday , croatia opened six further chapters for negotiation .
eleven have already been decided . " the opening of these six chapters sends a strong signal , " said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency till the end of the month .
" it 's a real breakthrough . " croatian foreign minister kolinda grabar-kitarovic said she expected her country to meet eu benchmarks and close several chapters of negotiation in 2008 . " we expect 2009 to be the year when we achieve readiness for accession , meaning concluding negotiations , signing the accession treaty and beginning the accession process , " she said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the soccer teams have agreed not to reveal transfer details , but bayern increased an original offer of 10 million euros -lrb- $ 13.4 million -rrb- to at least 12 million euros , according to german sports magazine kicker . bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said " a fair solution for both sides " had been reached .
werder sports director klaus allofs meanwhile said the deal had come about after bayern this week hugely upped its offer for the 29-year-old .
" bayern have met our demands so that we can agree to the transfer in the circumstances , " he said .
money no object to bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several international stars are joining bayern next season klose , capped 69 times by germany , had originally said only a top club outside germany could lure him away from bremen , but relations with werder deteriorated after he revealed towards the end of last season that he had been in negotiations with bayern .
the transfer ends a period of unprecedented spending by bayern in an attempt by the bundesliga record champions to reverse their fortunes after a disappointing fourth-place end to last season , missing out on a champions league birth in their worst performance in 10 years .
the team has spent some 53 million euros to secure new players including italy striker luca toni and the france international midfielder franck ribery with the hopes of returning to the top of the german table and competing in the champions league .
others to join are germany defender marcell jansen , germany striker jan schlaudraff , argentinean midfielder jose ernesto sosa , the turkish midfielder hamit altintop and brazilian midfielder ze roberto .
more roster changes expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : national side team mates , klose and podolski will pair up every week in the bundesliga the arrival of klose is now likely to see the departure of dutch striker roy makaay who has already been told he can leave if he receives an offer .
both feyenoord rotterdam and psv eindhoven are said to be interested .
klose will now link up with his germany striker partner lukas podolski in munich , but it remains to be seen how coach ottmar hitzfeld will use them together with toni also in the picture .
end to wrangling werder and bayern had appeared to have reached deadlock over klose after weeks of negotiations , most of which took place openly in the german press .
werder had turned down bayern 's approaches for the player and insisted klose , who has scored 53 goals in 89 league games for werder , would complete his contract until 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego will be left managing bremen without klose next season " we know we are losing a successful player , but miro 's change of mind and the new offer from bayern has changed the situation we were in at the end of the season and persuaded us not to continue the cooperation , " allofs said .
allofs said werder would be making no immediate move to seek a replacement for klose .
werder will go into the new season with a strike force of markus rosenberg , hugo almeida , aaron hunt and youngsters kevin schindler and martin harnik .
croatia striker ivan klasnic , who has undergone a kidney transplant operation , is also still on the books .
" we are watching the market but are under no pressure to take action , " allofs said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the soccer teams have agreed not to reveal transfer details , but bayern increased an original offer of 10 million euros -lrb- $ 13.4 million -rrb- to at least 12 million euros , according to german sports magazine kicker . bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said " a fair solution for both sides " had been reached .
werder sports director klaus allofs meanwhile said the deal had come about after bayern this week hugely upped its offer for the 29-year-old .
" bayern have met our demands so that we can agree to the transfer in the circumstances , " he said .
money no object to bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several international stars are joining bayern next season klose , capped 69 times by germany , had originally said only a top club outside germany could lure him away from bremen , but relations with werder deteriorated after he revealed towards the end of last season that he had been in negotiations with bayern .
the transfer ends a period of unprecedented spending by bayern in an attempt by the bundesliga record champions to reverse their fortunes after a disappointing fourth-place end to last season , missing out on a champions league birth in their worst performance in 10 years .
the team has spent some 53 million euros to secure new players including italy striker luca toni and the france international midfielder franck ribery with the hopes of returning to the top of the german table and competing in the champions league .
others to join are germany defender marcell jansen , germany striker jan schlaudraff , argentinean midfielder jose ernesto sosa , the turkish midfielder hamit altintop and brazilian midfielder ze roberto .

both feyenoord rotterdam and psv eindhoven are said to be interested .
klose will now link up with his germany striker partner lukas podolski in munich , but it remains to be seen how coach ottmar hitzfeld will use them together with toni also in the picture .
end to wrangling werder and bayern had appeared to have reached deadlock over klose after weeks of negotiations , most of which took place openly in the german press .
werder had turned down bayern 's approaches for the player and insisted klose , who has scored 53 goals in 89 league games for werder , would complete his contract until 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego will be left managing bremen without klose next season " we know we are losing a successful player , but miro 's change of mind and the new offer from bayern has changed the situation we were in at the end of the season and persuaded us not to continue the cooperation , " allofs said .
allofs said werder would be making no immediate move to seek a replacement for klose .
werder will go into the new season with a strike force of markus rosenberg , hugo almeida , aaron hunt and youngsters kevin schindler and martin harnik .
croatia striker ivan klasnic , who has undergone a kidney transplant operation , is also still on the books .

" bayern have met our demands so that we can agree to the transfer in the circumstances , " he said .

the transfer ends a period of unprecedented spending by bayern in an attempt by the bundesliga record champions to reverse their fortunes after a disappointing fourth-place end to last season , missing out on a champions league birth in their worst performance in 10 years .
the team has spent some 53 million euros to secure new players including italy striker luca toni and the france international midfielder franck ribery with the hopes of returning to the top of the german table and competing in the champions league .

klose will now link up with his germany striker partner lukas podolski in munich , but it remains to be seen how coach ottmar hitzfeld will use them together with toni also in the picture .
end to wrangling werder and bayern had appeared to have reached deadlock over klose after weeks of negotiations , most of which took place openly in the german press .
werder had turned down bayern 's approaches for the player and insisted klose , who has scored 53 goals in 89 league games for werder , would complete his contract until 2008 .

" something very negative is going on in germany , " kaczynski said in an interview for polish public radio on tuesday .
" like in an era which already passed , when the large majority of europeans did n't have the courage to talk about it , it is the same today . " " so i 'm issuing a warning , and i 'm addressing the german authorities as the polish prime minister , do not tolerate this kind of thing , these kind of statements , because that leads to the worst , to trouble which can happen in europe , but which in affecting europe will hit the germans too , " he said . kaczynski was reacting to a caricature in a berlin daily about replacing the majority voting process in the new eu treaty with the square root of all world war dead . the cartoon referred to polish proposals last week to change the voting system with an arithmetic calcuation that would take the square root of populations and comments that poland 's war dead should be taken into account . " there is now a situation in europe in which one can not talk about german blame for the war , but very well about polish concentration camps and a polish responsibility for the holocaust , " the polish leader said . breast-feeding image sparks anger kaczynski 's comments add further fuel to a bonfire already crackling between the two nations . in the aftermath of a turbulent eu summit , where germany and poland clashed over the voting procedure in the new eu treaty , german mass-market bild tabloid dubbed the polish president and prime minister , twins , " poison dwarves . " the polish press this week seemed to be contributing just as little to reconciliation between the two nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the front page of " wprost , " a conservative magazine which often has controversial covers some german politicians said tuesday they were outraged by the latest cover of wprosta , a widely-read conservative polish weekly magazine , depicting german chancellor angela merkel breast-feeding the kaczynski twins under the title " stepmother of europe . " " germany used to be an advocate of poland , but now it 's become our prosecutor , " read the subtitle of the leading article . " the poles should stop outdoing themselves with tasteless remarks , " said christian social union 's foreign expert eduard lintner .
" sooner or later , this will have an effect on the mood in germany , which is , at the moment , still cooperative . " according to markus meckel , head of the german-polish parliamentarian group , poland needs to rethink its diplomatic strategy .
" in the last weeks and months , poland has lost many friends , " meckel , who is a member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- said .
" in the future , the country should think hard about how it could win over partners and friends . "
" a little funny " neither the chancellor nor the kaczynski twins have commented on the cover story.what has rankled germany is that one of the authors of the story in the polish weekly , mariusz muszynski is an advisor on germany to the polish foreign ministry .
the editor of wprost , stanislaw janecki , however told german media that the reaction in germany was overblown . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who 's who ?
the polish power twins have been stirring things up in the eu " the cover 's message , " janecki told spiegel online , " is that germany , especially ms. merkel , was trying to treat poles and the polish leaders as small children completely unable to act on their own and somehow dependent on germany .
there is the impression that germany , being more powerful , wants to dominate poland and that the kaczynski brothers want to stand up to this domination . "
he said he could not imagine merkel taking offence . ” we looked for a model that was not too thin but who had a beautiful body , ” janecki said .
" we imagined it to be a little funny . the stepmother is often more sexy and more friendly that the real mother is . "
he pointed out that the image is n't just critical of merkel . " it is also critical of the kaczynskis because the relationship between these politicians has become abnormal .
it has become threatened by history and by national points of view .
there are many factors , but the relationship is clearly not working , " he said .
the wprost cover is just the latest in a long-running media satire saga between the two countries .
last year , polish president lech kaczynski cancelled a meeting with merkel after left-wing berlin daily taz portrayed him as a polish potato .
wprost too is known for its hard-hitting covers and has published irreverent satirical images of former german chancellor gerhard schröder and erika steinbach , head of the german expelle association .
" poland is a big , important partner " the latest tensions come just a day after germany struck a reconciliatory tone with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier saying his country " has a duty to patiently seek a dialogue with poland , especially in difficult times , " given the fact that both countries were linked by " a terrible 20th century history . "
german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said that chancellor angela merkel 's administration was committed to playing its part in ensuring close ties between the neighboring countries . " poland is a big , important partner , " added wilhelm . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hitler was n't seriously injured in the attack , codenamed operation valkyrie .
the filmmakers " will not be allowed to film at german military sites if count stauffenberg is played by tom cruise , who has publicly professed to being a member of the scientology cult , " german defense ministry spokesman harald kammerbauer said . the church of scientology is not recognized as legitimate by the german government .
kammerbauer said the ministry had not yet received official filming requests from the producers of " valkyrie . " cruise " per fect for the part " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruise is a controversial figure in germany the ban on filming at military sites drew criticism from cruise 's film producing partner , paula wagner , chief executive of united artists entertainment .
she said " valkyrie " is a " historically accurate thriller " and that cruise was offered the role because the movie 's director , bryan singer , " thought he was perfect for the part . "
" aside from his obvious admiration of the man he is portraying , mr. cruise 's personal beliefs have absolutely no bearing on the movie 's plot , themes , or content , " wagner said in a statement .
" and even though we could shoot the movie anywhere in the world , we believe germany is the only place we can truly do the story justice . " scientology 's biggest star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientology is not an officially recognized religion in germany hollywood star tom cruise is one of the best-known members of the church of scientology .
the cult is based on the writings of the late science-fiction author l. ron hubbard , who began scientology as a self-help discipline .
cruise has lobbied german officials in the past over the country 's refusal to recognize scientology as a legitimate church .
the german government views it as a fake religion based on making money from its followers .
stauffenberg 's family has also expressed their displeasure with cruise portraying their father .
stauffenberg 's oldest son , berthold , said in a recent interview with süddeutsche zeitung newspaper that he objected to a practicing scientologist playing his father . " i hoped for a while that it was all just a publicity stunt by mr. cruise , " said the 72-year-old retired major general of the german bundeswehr .
he added that cruise " should keep his hands off my father . "
" it 's sure to be crap , " he said of the movie .
" of course i could be wrong - i would like to be . "
historical figure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the movie will focus on stauffenberg 's failed plot to assasinate hitler " in general , the bundeswehr -lrb- german military -rrb- has a special interest in the serious and authentic portrayal of the events of july 20 , 1944 and stauffenberg 's person , " kammerbauer said .
stauffenberg had deeply opposed to the nazis ' treatment of the jews .
stauffenberg was subsequently caught and shot by firing squad the same night .
the plot 's failure led to the arrest of more than 5,000 people , and the execution of some 200 others .
the film 's action will center around the bendlerblock memorial inside the defense ministry complex in berlin .
stauffenberg and his co-conspirators planned the assassination there .
it 's also the spot where they were executed after the plot failed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de cities -pipe- 26.06.2007 venice sinks in a sea of tourists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : piazza san marco in venice - magnet for the masses venice has introduced decency stewards to try to get tourists to behave better .
but the measure has been criticized for ignoring the bigger issue of just how many tourists the lagoon city can handle . on this sunny june day , thousands of tourists mill around one of the world ’ s most famous squares , venice ’ s piazza san marco .
as tour groups from china to portugal throng around the entrance of st. mark ’ s basilica , others shriek with laughter as pigeons alight on their outstretched arms .
a group of brightly dressed indian tourists have kicked off their sandals and are relaxed on the steps surrounding the square .
next to them , a dutch family unpacks an large picnic hamper .
similar scenes are repeated all around the piazza , which with its combination of magnificent views and shaded loggia , seems like the ideal spot for a break .
but it ’ s exactly this type of behavior that the venice city council is trying to stop .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venice 's tourist " hostesses " - there to maintain decorum the council has banned eating , sunbathing , lying down and camping in the piazza and its surrounding neighborhood , and has introduced guards of a sort , called " hostesses , " to reprimand those who break the rules .
“ the seven hostesses are there to promote the idea of respect , ” said venice ’ s town councilor for tourism , augusto salvadori .
“ they explain to tourists that they can ’ t picnic in the square or bare their torsos , for example , and also remind them that they can ’ t just leave their rubbish on the ground . ”
salvadori said the introduction of the hostesses was a “ positive initiative ” which would restore “ decorum and cleanliness ” to the square .
but at piazza san marco , the crackdown doesn ’ t seem that popular with the visitors .
“ it ’ s ridiculous , ” said american courtney walker , clutching a burger and fries .
she ’ s just been shooed off the steps along with her friends for eating .
“ there ’ s nowhere in mcdonald ’ s to eat , and the square is enormous . ”
her sentiments are also shared many venetians , who say the hostesses don ’ t solve the bigger issue of how to deal with the more than 19.5 million tourists who flock to venice each year .
too many tourists ?
“ instead of devising policies for tourism and planning for the future , the administration is banning the eating of sandwiches , ” said andrea chiappa , the vice-president of venice ’ s hoteliers association , with a shake of his head .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venice 's charms are many , so are its tourists after rome , venice is the most popular destination in italy but the majority of visitors are day trippers who arrive with their water bottles and packed lunches in an effort to avoid venice ’ s high prices .
" the day trippers cost much more in maintenance and cleaning than they bring to the city , ” chiappa said .
the tourists aren ’ t just proving costly , however , they are also causing venetians to leave the city in every increasing numbers .
in the past fifty years , the population has halved to 62,000 .
according to statisticians , if the trend isn ’ t reversed , the city could be a ghost town by 2030 .
residents struggle “ one of the problems is that everything revolves around the tourists , ” complained local resident sergio malara .
“ it ’ s difficult to find the basics , such as a butcher shop or a fruit and vegetable store or a boot maker . ”

“ they explain to tourists that they can ’ t picnic in the square or bare their torsos , for example , and also remind them that they can ’ t just leave their rubbish on the ground . ”
salvadori said the introduction of the hostesses was a “ positive initiative ” which would restore “ decorum and cleanliness ” to the square .
but at piazza san marco , the crackdown doesn ’ t seem that popular with the visitors .
“ it ’ s ridiculous , ” said american courtney walker , clutching a burger and fries .
she ’ s just been shooed off the steps along with her friends for eating .
“ there ’ s nowhere in mcdonald ’ s to eat , and the square is enormous . ”
her sentiments are also shared many venetians , who say the hostesses don ’ t solve the bigger issue of how to deal with the more than 19.5 million tourists who flock to venice each year .
too many tourists ?
“ instead of devising policies for tourism and planning for the future , the administration is banning the eating of sandwiches , ” said andrea chiappa , the vice-president of venice ’ s hoteliers association , with a shake of his head .

" the day trippers cost much more in maintenance and cleaning than they bring to the city , ” chiappa said .
the tourists aren ’ t just proving costly , however , they are also causing venetians to leave the city in every increasing numbers .
in the past fifty years , the population has halved to 62,000 .
according to statisticians , if the trend isn ’ t reversed , the city could be a ghost town by 2030 .

“ it ’ s difficult to find the basics , such as a butcher shop or a fruit and vegetable store or a boot maker . ”

malara has just moved away from the center because with so many visitors streaming into venice in the summer months , it was just too stressful to get to work .
and when one local moves out , it ’ s not that another moves in .
property prices are so high that few venetians can afford to buy or rent in the center .
this means vacant properties are let to tourists who happily fork out 100 euros a night for the luxury of a tiny room with an outside bathroom and resident mosquito population .
in an effort to keep residential housing from disappearing , the city council recently tightened up zoning regulations making it more difficult to open hotels .

but the measure has been criticized for ignoring the bigger issue of just how many tourists the lagoon city can handle . on this sunny june day , thousands of tourists mill around one of the world ’ s most famous squares , venice ’ s piazza san marco .
as tour groups from china to portugal throng around the entrance of st. mark ’ s basilica , others shriek with laughter as pigeons alight on their outstretched arms .
a group of brightly dressed indian tourists have kicked off their sandals and are relaxed on the steps surrounding the square .
next to them , a dutch family unpacks an large picnic hamper .
similar scenes are repeated all around the piazza , which with its combination of magnificent views and shaded loggia , seems like the ideal spot for a break .
but it ’ s exactly this type of behavior that the venice city council is trying to stop .

but the measure has been criticized for ignoring the bigger issue of just how many tourists the lagoon city can handle . on this sunny june day , thousands of tourists mill around one of the world ’ s most famous squares , venice ’ s piazza san marco .
as tour groups from china to portugal throng around the entrance of st. mark ’ s basilica , others shriek with laughter as pigeons alight on their outstretched arms .
a group of brightly dressed indian tourists have kicked off their sandals and are relaxed on the steps surrounding the square .
next to them , a dutch family unpacks an large picnic hamper .
similar scenes are repeated all around the piazza , which with its combination of magnificent views and shaded loggia , seems like the ideal spot for a break .
but it ’ s exactly this type of behavior that the venice city council is trying to stop .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venice 's tourist " hostesses " - there to maintain decorum the council has banned eating , sunbathing , lying down and camping in the piazza and its surrounding neighborhood , and has introduced guards of a sort , called " hostesses , " to reprimand those who break the rules .
“ the seven hostesses are there to promote the idea of respect , ” said venice ’ s town councilor for tourism , augusto salvadori .
“ they explain to tourists that they can ’ t picnic in the square or bare their torsos , for example , and also remind them that they can ’ t just leave their rubbish on the ground . ”
salvadori said the introduction of the hostesses was a “ positive initiative ” which would restore “ decorum and cleanliness ” to the square .
but at piazza san marco , the crackdown doesn ’ t seem that popular with the visitors .
“ it ’ s ridiculous , ” said american courtney walker , clutching a burger and fries .
she ’ s just been shooed off the steps along with her friends for eating .
“ there ’ s nowhere in mcdonald ’ s to eat , and the square is enormous . ”
her sentiments are also shared many venetians , who say the hostesses don ’ t solve the bigger issue of how to deal with the more than 19.5 million tourists who flock to venice each year .
too many tourists ?
“ instead of devising policies for tourism and planning for the future , the administration is banning the eating of sandwiches , ” said andrea chiappa , the vice-president of venice ’ s hoteliers association , with a shake of his head .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venice 's charms are many , so are its tourists after rome , venice is the most popular destination in italy but the majority of visitors are day trippers who arrive with their water bottles and packed lunches in an effort to avoid venice ’ s high prices .
" the day trippers cost much more in maintenance and cleaning than they bring to the city , ” chiappa said .
the tourists aren ’ t just proving costly , however , they are also causing venetians to leave the city in every increasing numbers .
in the past fifty years , the population has halved to 62,000 .
according to statisticians , if the trend isn ’ t reversed , the city could be a ghost town by 2030 .
residents struggle “ one of the problems is that everything revolves around the tourists , ” complained local resident sergio malara .
“ it ’ s difficult to find the basics , such as a butcher shop or a fruit and vegetable store or a boot maker . ”

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists bring revenue to venice , but they 're turning the city into a museum another problem is getting around the city ’ s narrow pedestrian streets and bridges .
malara has just moved away from the center because with so many visitors streaming into venice in the summer months , it was just too stressful to get to work .
and when one local moves out , it ’ s not that another moves in .
property prices are so high that few venetians can afford to buy or rent in the center .
this means vacant properties are let to tourists who happily fork out 100 euros a night for the luxury of a tiny room with an outside bathroom and resident mosquito population .
in an effort to keep residential housing from disappearing , the city council recently tightened up zoning regulations making it more difficult to open hotels .
but unfortunately , a loophole in the provincial law means pensions and bed and breakfasts can sprout up without restraint .
in the past few years , more than 700 have opened in venice .
cap on visitors one proposition being tossed around to mitigate the tourist problem is the idea of limiting the number of visitors who can enter the city each day .
according to hotelier chiappa , however , the council needs to do more to even out the flow of tourists to venice before even discussing such “ drastic measures . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evening in venice “ the tourist season runs from april to october , and in winter hotel occupancy falls to below 50 percent , ” chiappa said .
he is critical that major events are held in june and september , and museum exhibitions tend to run over summer .
“ you can just as well go to a museum in winter , ” he said .
as the sun starts setting , the tourists trickle out of the city and the venetians descend into venice ’ s squares to enjoy the balmy evening .

hitler was n't seriously injured in the attack , codenamed operation valkyrie .
the filmmakers " will not be allowed to film at german military sites if count stauffenberg is played by tom cruise , who has publicly professed to being a member of the scientology cult , " german defense ministry spokesman harald kammerbauer said . the church of scientology is not recognized as legitimate by the german government .
kammerbauer said the ministry had not yet received official filming requests from the producers of " valkyrie . " cruise " per fect for the part " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruise is a controversial figure in germany the ban on filming at military sites drew criticism from cruise 's film producing partner , paula wagner , chief executive of united artists entertainment .
she said " valkyrie " is a " historically accurate thriller " and that cruise was offered the role because the movie 's director , bryan singer , " thought he was perfect for the part . "
" aside from his obvious admiration of the man he is portraying , mr. cruise 's personal beliefs have absolutely no bearing on the movie 's plot , themes , or content , " wagner said in a statement .
" and even though we could shoot the movie anywhere in the world , we believe germany is the only place we can truly do the story justice . " scientology 's biggest star bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientology is not an officially recognized religion in germany hollywood star tom cruise is one of the best-known members of the church of scientology .
the cult is based on the writings of the late science-fiction author l. ron hubbard , who began scientology as a self-help discipline .
cruise has lobbied german officials in the past over the country 's refusal to recognize scientology as a legitimate church .
the german government views it as a fake religion based on making money from its followers .
stauffenberg 's family has also expressed their displeasure with cruise portraying their father .
stauffenberg 's oldest son , berthold , said in a recent interview with süddeutsche zeitung newspaper that he objected to a practicing scientologist playing his father . " i hoped for a while that it was all just a publicity stunt by mr. cruise , " said the 72-year-old retired major general of the german bundeswehr .
he added that cruise " should keep his hands off my father . "
" it 's sure to be crap , " he said of the movie .
" of course i could be wrong - i would like to be . "
historical figure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the movie will focus on stauffenberg 's failed plot to assasinate hitler " in general , the bundeswehr -lrb- german military -rrb- has a special interest in the serious and authentic portrayal of the events of july 20 , 1944 and stauffenberg 's person , " kammerbauer said .
stauffenberg had deeply opposed to the nazis ' treatment of the jews .
stauffenberg was subsequently caught and shot by firing squad the same night .
the plot 's failure led to the arrest of more than 5,000 people , and the execution of some 200 others .
the film 's action will center around the bendlerblock memorial inside the defense ministry complex in berlin .
stauffenberg and his co-conspirators planned the assassination there .
it 's also the spot where they were executed after the plot failed .

but the measure has been criticized for ignoring the bigger issue of just how many tourists the lagoon city can handle . on this sunny june day , thousands of tourists mill around one of the world ’ s most famous squares , venice ’ s piazza san marco .
as tour groups from china to portugal throng around the entrance of st. mark ’ s basilica , others shriek with laughter as pigeons alight on their outstretched arms .
a group of brightly dressed indian tourists have kicked off their sandals and are relaxed on the steps surrounding the square .
next to them , a dutch family unpacks an large picnic hamper .
similar scenes are repeated all around the piazza , which with its combination of magnificent views and shaded loggia , seems like the ideal spot for a break .
but it ’ s exactly this type of behavior that the venice city council is trying to stop .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venice 's tourist " hostesses " - there to maintain decorum the council has banned eating , sunbathing , lying down and camping in the piazza and its surrounding neighborhood , and has introduced guards of a sort , called " hostesses , " to reprimand those who break the rules .
“ the seven hostesses are there to promote the idea of respect , ” said venice ’ s town councilor for tourism , augusto salvadori .
“ they explain to tourists that they can ’ t picnic in the square or bare their torsos , for example , and also remind them that they can ’ t just leave their rubbish on the ground . ”
salvadori said the introduction of the hostesses was a “ positive initiative ” which would restore “ decorum and cleanliness ” to the square .
but at piazza san marco , the crackdown doesn ’ t seem that popular with the visitors .
“ it ’ s ridiculous , ” said american courtney walker , clutching a burger and fries .
she ’ s just been shooed off the steps along with her friends for eating .
“ there ’ s nowhere in mcdonald ’ s to eat , and the square is enormous . ”
her sentiments are also shared many venetians , who say the hostesses don ’ t solve the bigger issue of how to deal with the more than 19.5 million tourists who flock to venice each year .
too many tourists ?
“ instead of devising policies for tourism and planning for the future , the administration is banning the eating of sandwiches , ” said andrea chiappa , the vice-president of venice ’ s hoteliers association , with a shake of his head .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venice 's charms are many , so are its tourists after rome , venice is the most popular destination in italy but the majority of visitors are day trippers who arrive with their water bottles and packed lunches in an effort to avoid venice ’ s high prices .
" the day trippers cost much more in maintenance and cleaning than they bring to the city , ” chiappa said .
the tourists aren ’ t just proving costly , however , they are also causing venetians to leave the city in every increasing numbers .
in the past fifty years , the population has halved to 62,000 .
according to statisticians , if the trend isn ’ t reversed , the city could be a ghost town by 2030 .
residents struggle “ one of the problems is that everything revolves around the tourists , ” complained local resident sergio malara .
“ it ’ s difficult to find the basics , such as a butcher shop or a fruit and vegetable store or a boot maker . ”
instead , streets in the center are lined with shops selling ceramic masks and venetian glass beads .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists bring revenue to venice , but they 're turning the city into a museum another problem is getting around the city ’ s narrow pedestrian streets and bridges .
malara has just moved away from the center because with so many visitors streaming into venice in the summer months , it was just too stressful to get to work .
and when one local moves out , it ’ s not that another moves in .
property prices are so high that few venetians can afford to buy or rent in the center .
this means vacant properties are let to tourists who happily fork out 100 euros a night for the luxury of a tiny room with an outside bathroom and resident mosquito population .
in an effort to keep residential housing from disappearing , the city council recently tightened up zoning regulations making it more difficult to open hotels .
but unfortunately , a loophole in the provincial law means pensions and bed and breakfasts can sprout up without restraint .
in the past few years , more than 700 have opened in venice .
cap on visitors one proposition being tossed around to mitigate the tourist problem is the idea of limiting the number of visitors who can enter the city each day .
according to hotelier chiappa , however , the council needs to do more to even out the flow of tourists to venice before even discussing such “ drastic measures . ”

" germans are still in a shopping mood , " gfk said .
" rapid successes on the labor market and a globally favorable economic climate ensure that the positive sentiment is continuing into the summer . "
the gfk 's monthly survey asks some 2,000 consumers about their views on the economy , income expectations and their propensity to buy .
four months of growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the negative effects of a 3-percent tax hike are behind germany , the gfk said along with a positive trend in income expectations , the propensity to buy is again making a significant contribution to the upturn in the consumer climate , the gfk said . after a weak phase caused by a 3 percent vat increase , which brought the tax to 19 percent from jan .
1 , the indicator has now risen four times in a row .
" in the light of the current general climate , it is reasonable to assume that the upswing in the consumer climate will be sustained into the coming months , " the gfk said .
shopping expected to continue on the economic front , the rapid recovery of the job market and a continuing advantageous global economy are ensuring that the positive economic climate will continue through the beginning of summer , it added .
" there 's nothing to be worried about this year , " said gfk chief klaus wübbenhorst .
" consumption will continue to be effective . "
but the gfk warned that for both companies and consumers , that sustaining a positive level of consumer development is contingent on political stability and accountability .
" it is possible that disruptive elements , such as protracted debates concerning tax increases and other potential financial burdens or a drastic rise in energy prices could have negative effects on the development of the consumer climate .

a french diplomat noted that not all policy areas could be treated the same . " negotiations with turkey continue , " he said , according to news reports .

eu officials would not only check whether turkey had met all of its conditions but also whether the eu is politically and economically strong enough to take turkey on as a new member .

the soccer teams have agreed not to reveal transfer details , but bayern increased an original offer of 10 million euros -lrb- $ 13.4 million -rrb- to at least 12 million euros , according to german sports magazine kicker . bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said " a fair solution for both sides " had been reached .
werder sports director klaus allofs meanwhile said the deal had come about after bayern this week hugely upped its offer for the 29-year-old .
" bayern have met our demands so that we can agree to the transfer in the circumstances , " he said .
money no object to bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several international stars are joining bayern next season klose , capped 69 times by germany , had originally said only a top club outside germany could lure him away from bremen , but relations with werder deteriorated after he revealed towards the end of last season that he had been in negotiations with bayern .
the transfer ends a period of unprecedented spending by bayern in an attempt by the bundesliga record champions to reverse their fortunes after a disappointing fourth-place end to last season , missing out on a champions league birth in their worst performance in 10 years .
the team has spent some 53 million euros to secure new players including italy striker luca toni and the france international midfielder franck ribery with the hopes of returning to the top of the german table and competing in the champions league .
others to join are germany defender marcell jansen , germany striker jan schlaudraff , argentinean midfielder jose ernesto sosa , the turkish midfielder hamit altintop and brazilian midfielder ze roberto .

both feyenoord rotterdam and psv eindhoven are said to be interested .
klose will now link up with his germany striker partner lukas podolski in munich , but it remains to be seen how coach ottmar hitzfeld will use them together with toni also in the picture .
end to wrangling werder and bayern had appeared to have reached deadlock over klose after weeks of negotiations , most of which took place openly in the german press .
werder had turned down bayern 's approaches for the player and insisted klose , who has scored 53 goals in 89 league games for werder , would complete his contract until 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego will be left managing bremen without klose next season " we know we are losing a successful player , but miro 's change of mind and the new offer from bayern has changed the situation we were in at the end of the season and persuaded us not to continue the cooperation , " allofs said .
allofs said werder would be making no immediate move to seek a replacement for klose .
werder will go into the new season with a strike force of markus rosenberg , hugo almeida , aaron hunt and youngsters kevin schindler and martin harnik .

the soccer teams have agreed not to reveal transfer details , but bayern increased an original offer of 10 million euros -lrb- $ 13.4 million -rrb- to at least 12 million euros , according to german sports magazine kicker . bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge said " a fair solution for both sides " had been reached .
werder sports director klaus allofs meanwhile said the deal had come about after bayern this week hugely upped its offer for the 29-year-old .
" bayern have met our demands so that we can agree to the transfer in the circumstances , " he said .

the transfer ends a period of unprecedented spending by bayern in an attempt by the bundesliga record champions to reverse their fortunes after a disappointing fourth-place end to last season , missing out on a champions league birth in their worst performance in 10 years .
the team has spent some 53 million euros to secure new players including italy striker luca toni and the france international midfielder franck ribery with the hopes of returning to the top of the german table and competing in the champions league .
others to join are germany defender marcell jansen , germany striker jan schlaudraff , argentinean midfielder jose ernesto sosa , the turkish midfielder hamit altintop and brazilian midfielder ze roberto .

klose will now link up with his germany striker partner lukas podolski in munich , but it remains to be seen how coach ottmar hitzfeld will use them together with toni also in the picture .
end to wrangling werder and bayern had appeared to have reached deadlock over klose after weeks of negotiations , most of which took place openly in the german press .
werder had turned down bayern 's approaches for the player and insisted klose , who has scored 53 goals in 89 league games for werder , would complete his contract until 2008 .

" something very negative is going on in germany , " kaczynski said in an interview for polish public radio on tuesday .
" like in an era which already passed , when the large majority of europeans did n't have the courage to talk about it , it is the same today . " " so i 'm issuing a warning , and i 'm addressing the german authorities as the polish prime minister , do not tolerate this kind of thing , these kind of statements , because that leads to the worst , to trouble which can happen in europe , but which in affecting europe will hit the germans too , " he said . kaczynski was reacting to a caricature in a berlin daily about replacing the majority voting process in the new eu treaty with the square root of all world war dead . the cartoon referred to polish proposals last week to change the voting system with an arithmetic calcuation that would take the square root of populations and comments that poland 's war dead should be taken into account . " there is now a situation in europe in which one can not talk about german blame for the war , but very well about polish concentration camps and a polish responsibility for the holocaust , " the polish leader said . breast-feeding image sparks anger kaczynski 's comments add further fuel to a bonfire already crackling between the two nations . in the aftermath of a turbulent eu summit , where germany and poland clashed over the voting procedure in the new eu treaty , german mass-market bild tabloid dubbed the polish president and prime minister , twins , " poison dwarves . " the polish press this week seemed to be contributing just as little to reconciliation between the two nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the front page of " wprost , " a conservative magazine which often has controversial covers some german politicians said tuesday they were outraged by the latest cover of wprosta , a widely-read conservative polish weekly magazine , depicting german chancellor angela merkel breast-feeding the kaczynski twins under the title " stepmother of europe . " " germany used to be an advocate of poland , but now it 's become our prosecutor , " read the subtitle of the leading article . " the poles should stop outdoing themselves with tasteless remarks , " said christian social union 's foreign expert eduard lintner .
" sooner or later , this will have an effect on the mood in germany , which is , at the moment , still cooperative . " according to markus meckel , head of the german-polish parliamentarian group , poland needs to rethink its diplomatic strategy .
" in the last weeks and months , poland has lost many friends , " meckel , who is a member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- said .
" in the future , the country should think hard about how it could win over partners and friends . "
" a little funny " neither the chancellor nor the kaczynski twins have commented on the cover story.what has rankled germany is that one of the authors of the story in the polish weekly , mariusz muszynski is an advisor on germany to the polish foreign ministry .
the editor of wprost , stanislaw janecki , however told german media that the reaction in germany was overblown . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who 's who ?
the polish power twins have been stirring things up in the eu " the cover 's message , " janecki told spiegel online , " is that germany , especially ms. merkel , was trying to treat poles and the polish leaders as small children completely unable to act on their own and somehow dependent on germany .
there is the impression that germany , being more powerful , wants to dominate poland and that the kaczynski brothers want to stand up to this domination . "
he said he could not imagine merkel taking offence . ” we looked for a model that was not too thin but who had a beautiful body , ” janecki said .
" we imagined it to be a little funny . the stepmother is often more sexy and more friendly that the real mother is . "
he pointed out that the image is n't just critical of merkel . " it is also critical of the kaczynskis because the relationship between these politicians has become abnormal .
it has become threatened by history and by national points of view .
there are many factors , but the relationship is clearly not working , " he said .
the wprost cover is just the latest in a long-running media satire saga between the two countries .
last year , polish president lech kaczynski cancelled a meeting with merkel after left-wing berlin daily taz portrayed him as a polish potato .
wprost too is known for its hard-hitting covers and has published irreverent satirical images of former german chancellor gerhard schröder and erika steinbach , head of the german expelle association .
" poland is a big , important partner " the latest tensions come just a day after germany struck a reconciliatory tone with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier saying his country " has a duty to patiently seek a dialogue with poland , especially in difficult times , " given the fact that both countries were linked by " a terrible 20th century history . "
german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said that chancellor angela merkel 's administration was committed to playing its part in ensuring close ties between the neighboring countries . " poland is a big , important partner , " added wilhelm . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" something very negative is going on in germany , " kaczynski said in an interview for polish public radio on tuesday .
" like in an era which already passed , when the large majority of europeans did n't have the courage to talk about it , it is the same today . " " so i 'm issuing a warning , and i 'm addressing the german authorities as the polish prime minister , do not tolerate this kind of thing , these kind of statements , because that leads to the worst , to trouble which can happen in europe , but which in affecting europe will hit the germans too , " he said . kaczynski was reacting to a caricature in a berlin daily about replacing the majority voting process in the new eu treaty with the square root of all world war dead . the cartoon referred to polish proposals last week to change the voting system with an arithmetic calcuation that would take the square root of populations and comments that poland 's war dead should be taken into account . " there is now a situation in europe in which one can not talk about german blame for the war , but very well about polish concentration camps and a polish responsibility for the holocaust , " the polish leader said . breast-feeding image sparks anger kaczynski 's comments add further fuel to a bonfire already crackling between the two nations . in the aftermath of a turbulent eu summit , where germany and poland clashed over the voting procedure in the new eu treaty , german mass-market bild tabloid dubbed the polish president and prime minister , twins , " poison dwarves . " the polish press this week seemed to be contributing just as little to reconciliation between the two nations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the front page of " wprost , " a conservative magazine which often has controversial covers some german politicians said tuesday they were outraged by the latest cover of wprosta , a widely-read conservative polish weekly magazine , depicting german chancellor angela merkel breast-feeding the kaczynski twins under the title " stepmother of europe . " " germany used to be an advocate of poland , but now it 's become our prosecutor , " read the subtitle of the leading article . " the poles should stop outdoing themselves with tasteless remarks , " said christian social union 's foreign expert eduard lintner .
" sooner or later , this will have an effect on the mood in germany , which is , at the moment , still cooperative . " according to markus meckel , head of the german-polish parliamentarian group , poland needs to rethink its diplomatic strategy .
" in the last weeks and months , poland has lost many friends , " meckel , who is a member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- said .
" in the future , the country should think hard about how it could win over partners and friends . "
" a little funny " neither the chancellor nor the kaczynski twins have commented on the cover story.what has rankled germany is that one of the authors of the story in the polish weekly , mariusz muszynski is an advisor on germany to the polish foreign ministry .
the editor of wprost , stanislaw janecki , however told german media that the reaction in germany was overblown . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who 's who ?
the polish power twins have been stirring things up in the eu " the cover 's message , " janecki told spiegel online , " is that germany , especially ms. merkel , was trying to treat poles and the polish leaders as small children completely unable to act on their own and somehow dependent on germany .
there is the impression that germany , being more powerful , wants to dominate poland and that the kaczynski brothers want to stand up to this domination . "
he said he could not imagine merkel taking offence . ” we looked for a model that was not too thin but who had a beautiful body , ” janecki said .
" we imagined it to be a little funny . the stepmother is often more sexy and more friendly that the real mother is . "
he pointed out that the image is n't just critical of merkel . " it is also critical of the kaczynskis because the relationship between these politicians has become abnormal .
it has become threatened by history and by national points of view .
there are many factors , but the relationship is clearly not working , " he said .
the wprost cover is just the latest in a long-running media satire saga between the two countries .
last year , polish president lech kaczynski cancelled a meeting with merkel after left-wing berlin daily taz portrayed him as a polish potato .
wprost too is known for its hard-hitting covers and has published irreverent satirical images of former german chancellor gerhard schröder and erika steinbach , head of the german expelle association .
" poland is a big , important partner " the latest tensions come just a day after germany struck a reconciliatory tone with german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier saying his country " has a duty to patiently seek a dialogue with poland , especially in difficult times , " given the fact that both countries were linked by " a terrible 20th century history . "
german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said that chancellor angela merkel 's administration was committed to playing its part in ensuring close ties between the neighboring countries .

writing in the journal regenerative medicine , uk-based company intercytex said it had produced promising results in early trials .
it said the skin seemed to incorporate itself much better with real tissue than any other skin substitutes tried in the past .
the researchers hope it might provide an alternative to skin grafts .
currently the best way of treating serious burns and large wounds is to take skin from part of a patient 's body and graft it on to the damaged area .
but this is not ideal , and there have been attempts to create a form of artificial skin .
however , some doctors say that the failure of these to fully integrate with the wound have rendered these efforts of limited value .
intercytex believes its latest version weaves into wounds much better .
artificial skin 1 .
icx-skn is produced from fibrin gel , a blood clotting protein and fibroblast cells , found in human skin .
2 .
the artificial skin can be cut to fit the wound and held in place with steri strips .
3 .
after four weeks the dressing is removed and the wound appears to have healed with little scarring .
4 .
a cross-section of the scar under microscope reveals little difference between the old and new skin .
back next 1 of 5 the skin is created from a matrix made up of fibrin , a protein found in healing wounds .
to this is added human fibroblasts - cells used by the body to synthesise new tissue .
in a process that effectively replicates the way the body makes new skin , the cells produce and release another protein , collagen , which makes the matrix more stable .
it is in this form that the " skin " is implanted into a wound .
the researchers say that because the matrix is in a stable form , it is more able to withstand changes that take place during the healing process .
the fact that the collagen is synthesised directly by the cells themselves also more closely mirrors the natural healing process .
quick healing in tests researchers cut an oval section of skin from the arms of six healthy volunteers and replaced it with their lab-grown skin .
after 28 days the artificial skin had remained stable and the wounds had healed with relatively little scarring .
dr paul kemp , intercytex 's chief scientist , said : " i was very surprised at how quickly the wounds healed .
fibroblast cells play a key role " if this continues in larger trials then it could revolutionise the way in which wounds and burns are treated in the future . "
dr kemp has been working with ken dunn , a consultant surgeon at the burns unit at wythenshawe hospital in manchester .
mr dunn said : " this particular product behaves like the patients ' own skin .
" it seems to excite much less reaction than the other materials we are using at the moment .
" if this is borne out in larger clinical trials then we would be very interested in using it with our patient group . "
others , however , have warned it is easy to heal a small , surgically-created wound in healthy volunteers , and that the true test will come when the technique is tried on real patients with real burns .
dr phil stephens , an expert in cell biology at cardiff university , said : " future studies are needed to establish whether this system is substantially better then those already on the market .
" but this skin replacement system has the potential to dramatically reduce scarring and help heal chronic wounds in aged patients to give them a better quality of life . "

the artificial skin can be cut to fit the wound and held in place with steri strips .
3 .
after four weeks the dressing is removed and the wound appears to have healed with little scarring .
4 .
a cross-section of the scar under microscope reveals little difference between the old and new skin .
back next 1 of 5 the skin is created from a matrix made up of fibrin , a protein found in healing wounds .
to this is added human fibroblasts - cells used by the body to synthesise new tissue .
in a process that effectively replicates the way the body makes new skin , the cells produce and release another protein , collagen , which makes the matrix more stable .
it is in this form that the " skin " is implanted into a wound .
the researchers say that because the matrix is in a stable form , it is more able to withstand changes that take place during the healing process .
the fact that the collagen is synthesised directly by the cells themselves also more closely mirrors the natural healing process .
quick healing in tests researchers cut an oval section of skin from the arms of six healthy volunteers and replaced it with their lab-grown skin .
after 28 days the artificial skin had remained stable and the wounds had healed with relatively little scarring .
dr paul kemp , intercytex 's chief scientist , said : " i was very surprised at how quickly the wounds healed .
fibroblast cells play a key role " if this continues in larger trials then it could revolutionise the way in which wounds and burns are treated in the future . "
dr kemp has been working with ken dunn , a consultant surgeon at the burns unit at wythenshawe hospital in manchester .
mr dunn said : " this particular product behaves like the patients ' own skin .
" it seems to excite much less reaction than the other materials we are using at the moment .
" if this is borne out in larger clinical trials then we would be very interested in using it with our patient group . "
others , however , have warned it is easy to heal a small , surgically-created wound in healthy volunteers , and that the true test will come when the technique is tried on real patients with real burns .
dr phil stephens , an expert in cell biology at cardiff university , said : " future studies are needed to establish whether this system is substantially better then those already on the market .
" but this skin replacement system has the potential to dramatically reduce scarring and help heal chronic wounds in aged patients to give them a better quality of life . "

the charge concerns the use of microsoft technology in the corporation 's forthcoming iplayer .
the web service , set for launch later this year , allows viewers to watch shows up to 30 days after broadcast .
the bbc has said it does intend to allow access to its content from computers with other operating systems .
a statement from the organisation read : " the bbc aims to make its content as widely available as possible and has always taken a platform agnostic approach to its internet services .
" it is not possible to put an exact timeframe on when bbc iplayer will be available for mac users .
however , we are working to ensure this happens as soon as possible and the bbc trust will be monitoring progress on a six monthly basis . "
next steps the accusations against the bbc have been made by advocacy group the open source consortium -lrb- osc -rrb- .
they argue that the iplayer will force people to use and purchase microsoft products because it will initially only work on microsoft windows computers .
this would give the software company an unfair advantage and would be uncompetitive , they say .

the osc would like to see the iplayer use formats that work on all operating systems .
" the bbc has a mandate to provide equal access to people irrespective of platform , " said mark taylor , president of osc .
" we do n't think it is appropriate to lock people into a particular desktop technology . "
the osc has compared the situation to the bbc offering programmes that only work on certain makes of television .
" we believe the bbc has a higher duty of care than a purely commercial organisation , " mr taylor told the bbc news website .
the group , composed of organisations , businesses and individual proponents of open source software , has already complained to the telecoms and broadcast regulator ofcom , as well as the dti and bbc trust .
ofcom have previously stated that access to the iplayer be " only one of many factors influencing the decision to purchase a new computer -lsb- or -rsb- operating system .
however , osc disagrees and says the next step is to make a formal complaint to the european commission -lrb- ec -rrb- .

the bbc had initially chosen to concentrate on a windows-based system as it is the world 's dominant operating system .
in addition , it allows the corporation to use microsoft 's off-the-shelf digital rights management -lrb- drm -rrb- system that means the programmes are deleted after 30 days .
all programmes , once downloaded , are only playable within iplayer or using windows media player 10 or 11 .
the drm also prevents them being copied to other mediums such as dvd .
when the broadband player was approved , the corporation 's governing body asked the bbc to ensure that the iplayer could run on different systems - such as apple macs - within " a reasonable time frame " , initially twenty-four months .
the bbc has previously said it can not commit to a two-year time frame as many decisions would have to be made by third parties .
a statement from the bbc read : " our ability to deliver this open approach will be influenced by the availability of alternative drm systems on the market .

the charge concerns the use of microsoft technology in the corporation 's forthcoming iplayer .
the web service , set for launch later this year , allows viewers to watch shows up to 30 days after broadcast .
the bbc has said it does intend to allow access to its content from computers with other operating systems .
a statement from the organisation read : " the bbc aims to make its content as widely available as possible and has always taken a platform agnostic approach to its internet services .
" it is not possible to put an exact timeframe on when bbc iplayer will be available for mac users .
however , we are working to ensure this happens as soon as possible and the bbc trust will be monitoring progress on a six monthly basis . "
next steps the accusations against the bbc have been made by advocacy group the open source consortium -lrb- osc -rrb- .
they argue that the iplayer will force people to use and purchase microsoft products because it will initially only work on microsoft windows computers .
this would give the software company an unfair advantage and would be uncompetitive , they say .
bbc iplayer iplayer will allow viewers to catch up on tv programmes for seven days some tv series can be downloaded and stored for 30 days viewers will be able to watch shows streamed live over the internet users will not be able to download programmes from other broadcasters classical recordings and book-readings are excluded from iplayer who else offers tv on-demand ?
the osc would like to see the iplayer use formats that work on all operating systems .
" the bbc has a mandate to provide equal access to people irrespective of platform , " said mark taylor , president of osc .
" we do n't think it is appropriate to lock people into a particular desktop technology . "
the osc has compared the situation to the bbc offering programmes that only work on certain makes of television .
" we believe the bbc has a higher duty of care than a purely commercial organisation , " mr taylor told the bbc news website .
the group , composed of organisations , businesses and individual proponents of open source software , has already complained to the telecoms and broadcast regulator ofcom , as well as the dti and bbc trust .
ofcom have previously stated that access to the iplayer be " only one of many factors influencing the decision to purchase a new computer -lsb- or -rsb- operating system .
however , osc disagrees and says the next step is to make a formal complaint to the european commission -lrb- ec -rrb- .
" we 're preparing the full details at the moment and we will be sending a formal letter within the next week , " said mr taylor .
the ec will then have to decide whether there is a case to answer .
public interest the windows-only media player was approved by the bbc trust at the end of april this year .
the bbc had initially chosen to concentrate on a windows-based system as it is the world 's dominant operating system .
the bbc intends to make content available on all platforms in addition , it allows the corporation to use microsoft 's off-the-shelf digital rights management -lrb- drm -rrb- system that means the programmes are deleted after 30 days .
all programmes , once downloaded , are only playable within iplayer or using windows media player 10 or 11 .
the drm also prevents them being copied to other mediums such as dvd .
when the broadband player was approved , the corporation 's governing body asked the bbc to ensure that the iplayer could run on different systems - such as apple macs - within " a reasonable time frame " , initially twenty-four months .
the bbc has previously said it can not commit to a two-year time frame as many decisions would have to be made by third parties .
a statement from the bbc read : " our ability to deliver this open approach will be influenced by the availability of alternative drm systems on the market .
" in order to maximise public value , the bbc must balance extending access to content with the need to maintain the interests of rights holders and the value of secondary rights in bbc programming .
without a time-based drm framework the bbc would not be able to meet the terms of the trust 's pvt -lrb- public value test -rrb- decision . "
however , the osc argue that drm-free downloads would be in the " public interest " .
" in an ideal world all drm would be removed , " said mr taylor .

victims of such attacks are alleged by their families to have disgraced them .
the crown prosecution service -lrb- cps -rrb- said islamist terror groups were behind one murder , as well as a case where a woman was threatened and is in hiding .
but the muslim council of britain said " honour " violence was a cultural practice , and nothing to do with faith .
the cps pointed to the death five years ago of heshu yones , 16 , who was stabbed to death by her father .
nazir afzal , the cps 's national lead on honour crime , told bbc radio 4 's file on 4 programme the threats to kill a woman known as miss b , who is now in hiding , came from her family but originated in an egyptian terrorist group .
he said : " they told her husband that if he did n't put his wife in her place then they would do it themselves . "
" you have a second generation youth who have an exaggerated concept of what home is like " nazir afzal cps heshu yones was stabbed to death by her father , abdalla yones , who had associations with a kurdish nationalist organisation , says mr afzal .
while he was on remand , the group raised substantial amounts of cash to try to secure his release on bail .
mr afzal said honour violence was not confined to fathers and grandfathers , but was carried out by younger relations too .
" you have a second generation youth who have an exaggerated concept of what home is like , " he said .
" they get their identity and their ethnicity from these traditions .
" we know they are bizarre and outdated but they get their identity from those traditions and they feel very strongly that how you treat your women is a demonstration of your commitment to radicalism and extremist thought . "
however , reefat drabu of the muslim council of britain told the bbc she disagreed with mr afzal 's comments .
she said : " first and foremost there has to be clarity that this is nothing to do with any faith , in particular islam .
" it is a cultural practice and there is nothing in any faith that would condone it or say that it is the right thing do it .
" this is to do with misguided notions of family honour .
it has nothing to do with radicalism or terrorism . "
contract killers according to the united nations population fund , 5,000 women a year die in honour killings .
there were a dozen such murders recorded in the uk last year although some police officers and campaigners say there may be many more .
two weeks ago , three men were found guilty of the murder of 20-year-old banaz mahmod who was found in a suitcase buried in a garden in birmingham last year .
she had been strangled with a bootlace by contract killers on the wishes of her father because she had fallen in love with a man her family did not approve of .
her case is now being reviewed by the independent police complaints commission after it emerged she made several attempts to warn police that her life was in danger .
file on 4 will be broadcast on tuesday 26 june 2007 at 2000 bst , repeated sunday 1 july at 1700 bst .

you have a second generation youth who have an exaggerated concept of what home is like nazir afzal cps heshu yones was stabbed to death by her father , abdalla yones , who had associations with a kurdish nationalist organisation , says mr afzal .
while he was on remand , the group raised substantial amounts of cash to try to secure his release on bail .
mr afzal said honour violence was not confined to fathers and grandfathers , but was carried out by younger relations too .
" you have a second generation youth who have an exaggerated concept of what home is like , " he said .
" they get their identity and their ethnicity from these traditions .
banaz mahmod paid the price for leaving her arranged marriage " we know they are bizarre and outdated but they get their identity from those traditions and they feel very strongly that how you treat your women is a demonstration of your commitment to radicalism and extremist thought . "
however , reefat drabu of the muslim council of britain told the bbc she disagreed with mr afzal 's comments .
she said : " first and foremost there has to be clarity that this is nothing to do with any faith , in particular islam .
" it is a cultural practice and there is nothing in any faith that would condone it or say that it is the right thing do it .
" this is to do with misguided notions of family honour .
it has nothing to do with radicalism or terrorism . "
contract killers according to the united nations population fund , 5,000 women a year die in honour killings .
there were a dozen such murders recorded in the uk last year although some police officers and campaigners say there may be many more .
two weeks ago , three men were found guilty of the murder of 20-year-old banaz mahmod who was found in a suitcase buried in a garden in birmingham last year .
she had been strangled with a bootlace by contract killers on the wishes of her father because she had fallen in love with a man her family did not approve of .
her case is now being reviewed by the independent police complaints commission after it emerged she made several attempts to warn police that her life was in danger .

sightings difficult " we were worried it would be pushed into the shallow water but fortuitously , the conditions were such that the ferry had to inch its way in , " he said .
" this gave the dolphin the confidence to edge its way around and , from what we can tell , it made its way back out to sea . "
he said that dolphin watchers would be looking out for any further signs of the animal , although he added that the conditions would make sightings difficult .

trading standards institute -lrb- tsi -rrb- tests found hydrogen peroxide levels were higher than the legal limit in 18 out of 20 diy products tested .
in one case the legal limit was exceeded by a factor of 230 times .
hydrogen peroxide , commonly used as a hair dye , can aggravate gum disease and cause sensitive teeth - or even chemical burns to the mouth . "
we strongly recommend that anyone considering having their teeth whitened cosmetically should consult a qualified dentist " ron gainsford trading standards institute it is thought that the use of tooth whitening kits is gaining in popularity , in part fuelled by a desire to replicate the dazzling smiles of hollywood stars .
ron gainsford , tsi chief executive , said kits for home use cost as little as £ 14 .
he said : " we strongly recommend that anyone considering having their teeth whitened cosmetically should consult a qualified dentist .
" however , i must stress that our tests were carried out on teeth whitening kits - and we are not suggesting there is a problem with the whitening toothpastes or polishes that are also on the market . "
only two passed officers from the central england trading standards authorities purchased 16 teeth whitening kits via the internet or over the counter from pharmacists or beauty shops across the midlands .
they found that only two complied with the cosmetic products -lrb- safety -rrb- regulations , which ban the sale or use of teeth whitening products that contain more than 0.1 % hydrogen peroxide .
the two that passed the test were boots expert teeth whitening programme and the ' brilliant ' tooth whitening system , distributed in the uk by brilliant products , of staines , middlesex .
the remaining 14 contained amounts of hydrogen peroxide ranging from 0.24 % to 23.8 % .
in addition , hertfordshire trading standards sampled four teeth whitening products , bought over the internet from uk suppliers .
they found all contained higher than the legal level of hydrogen peroxide , with one containing 7.3 % .
manufacturers and suppliers of all the items that did not comply with the 0.1 % limit are now being contacted and advised to withdraw the products from sale .
investigations are still going on with a view to possible further action .
a british dental association spokesperson said : " it is important any patient considering having their teeth whitened consults their dentist , who will examine their mouth properly , take a full medical history and discuss treatment options . "
the bda , through the european council of dentists , is involved in discussions to amend the eu cosmetics directive that will define the strength of products available to the public and remove restrictions on qualified dental practitioners using products of a higher strength .
