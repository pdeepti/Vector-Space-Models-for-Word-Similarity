it was a sign that the gdr , which disapproved of such fun , would soon be history . it 's difficult to imagine in 2007 that phil collins was ever cool - much less that he might have played a small role in the fall of the berlin wall .
but then again , in 1987 , few would have dared predict that the end of communist east germany was nigh . on june 8 of that year , the band genesis - collins ' troop of art-rockers-turned-pop-stars - headlined the final night of the " concert for berlin , " a three-day open-air festival staged in front of the reichstag .
the stage was only a stone 's throw from , and well within earshot of , the other side of the berlin wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east berliners could only gaze from a distance and fume as had been the case the previous two nights , which had featured david bowie and eurythmics , some 2,000 east berliners headed to the border at the brandenburg gate to get a listen .
few got there . " the police had cordoned off the street at the russian embassy -lrb- about a quarter-mile from the wall -rrb- , " eyewitness tina krone said . " they kept arresting people , dragging them along the surface of the street .
it was like a horror movie .
we were enraged . " as many as 200 people were taken into custody in what amounted to a small pitched battle between the cops and the kids .
and the frustrated east berliners , as gleefully noted by west german media , began chanting " the wall must fall ! " and " gorby get us out ! " land of confusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wall could n't keep east germans from listening to western music the communist party leadership of the gdr had always feared that rock music would incite the country 's entertainment-starved youth to rebel .
confronted with the " concert for berlin , " the stern guardians of socialist morality were determined to keep young east berliners away from what they say as a decadent influence . olof pock , a picture editor for dw-world.de who was fifteen years old at the time , climbed up on an east berlin rooftop to listen to eurythmics . " at the end of the concert , the police began to herd people back from the wall , " pock remembered .
" they completely overreacted .
they were beating kids with billy clubs . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : by 1989 east germans could get all the genesis they wanted east berliners were well informed about the concert by the radio station that sponsored it , rias 2 .
rias , which stood for radio in the american sector , convinced the musicians , despite the possibility of home taping , to allow the shows to be simulcast to all parts of the divided city . " the mood was one of enjoying forbidden fruit , " pock said .
" we knew that this was somehow being done for our benefit . " the west was very aware how hungry east german kids were for popular music from their capitalist " enemies . "
rias 2 had been specially formed as a music-oriented station broadcasting to all of berlin and the surrounding area . sweet dreams are made of this bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these aging english gentlemen played a role in cold war history so was the reichstag concert a conscious act of provocation ?
were some of the loudspeakers , as would later be alleged , aimed directly across the wall ? christoph lanz , today managing director of dw-tv , was deputy head of programming at rias 2 and the emcee at the concerts .
he says they were not . " i would have seen them , if they were , " lanz said .
" we were surprised when we heard about the reaction in the east .
i mean , we rocked the gdr ! " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gdr border guards killed some 190 people who tried to flee to the west but what people could see on or in front of the stage did n't tell the whole story .
peter schwenkow , the promoter and producer of the concert , says that at least a quarter of the speakers were indeed pointed at the eastern part of the city - as an act of revenge . " in 1977 , some crew members of tina turner were killed while in transit through east germany , " schwenkow said .
" a short time later , while in transit myself , i tried to find out what had happened and was interrogated at gunpoint by east german border guards .
ever since then i could n't stand those guys .
holding a show at the reichstag was an attempt to provoke them .
it was great fun . " both lanz and schwenkow look back with obvious pride and nostalgia on an event that called forth resentment and resistance to a repressive state . " on the afternoon before the genesis concert , i visited a friend of mine in east berlin , " lanz recalled .
" when it was time for me to leave , he said with teary eyes how much he wished he could go with me .
all he wanted to do was go hear a concert .
i still get goose bumps when i think of that . " ch-ch-ch-changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bowie , a former berlin resident , maintained close ties to the city in the wake of the concert , the gdr realized it had made a mistake . " it was the nervous reaction of a one-party state that was in over its head , " said rainer börner , an east berlin music producer and cultural secretary for the gdr 's main youth organization .
" some of us realized we had to increase what we were offering . " in 1989 bruce springsteen was booked to play a gig in east berlin - after organizers found a location far enough away form the wall to assuage fears that the music might inspire concert-goers to try to flee the gdr en masse .
but it was too little , too late . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today remnants of the wall have become places to chill " we saw what had happened in 1987 on western tv , " börner remembered .
" it just increased our frustration that we were n't allowed to do what we wanted . " " it was one stone in a whole mosaic , " concurred pock . on november 9 , 1989 , masses of east germans did precisely what the gdr leadership had feared they would be incited to do by the music of genesis .

but plenty of parliamentarians have extra money in their account at the end of the month from lucrative side jobs .
politicians will now have to report how much money they earn and where the extra money is coming from , germany 's federal constitutional court ruled on wednesday .
nine politicians from four leading german parties had challenged a regulation that took effect in january this year which requires all members of parliament to disclose all additional sources of income .
the constitutional court said that well-paid private sector jobs could seriously hamper mps ' independence and that the nation therefore " has a right to know " if parliamentary representatives earn money on the side . it added that in this instance , members of parliaments ' right to privacy was second to the public interest in transparency .
need for transparency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corruption is a concern the law on transparency were decided by the previous social democrat-green government in 2005 after an uproar in the country when it emerged that some politicians were making an additional tidy sum with lucrative jobs on the side .
some parliamentarians were on the payrolls of german corporations without seeming to do much to earn the extra incomes .
one high-profile politician was found to have accepted severance payments from an energy company which he had not even quit .
the revelations of these plum side jobs cost some politicians their jobs .
it also raised concerns in the country about possible corruption and a conflict of interest if politicians were closely connected to big companies .
some also questioned why politicians , who are paid well in germany , needed to take up another job .
critics say parliament will be filled with civil servants the transparency law passed in 2005 also said that voters had a right to know where elected politicians worked on the side and how much they earned .
opponents of the law however argued that it infringed on the right of parliamentarians to be free to choose to practise their professions .
hans-joachim otto , a member of the opposition free-market liberal fdp party , was one of the plaintiffs in the case .
otto is an attorney and notary .
he and three other partners have an office in frankfurt .
otto said he did n't want to give up his job for politics .
having a job is the best way to maintain independence and bring real-life experience to politics , otto told dw-world .
friedrich merz , former head of the parliamentary group of chancellor merkel 's christian democratic party , warned that the parliament would be filled with civil servants and career politicians who would have little touch with real life in germany .
privacy concerns " we do n't need only more professional politicians but also more people with work experience and life experience and who are independent , " otto said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's highest court ruled side jobs must be disclosed he said the law threatened politicians ' independence .
an unintended consequence of the new law is that political life becomes unattractive for self-employed people and entrepreneurs .
heinrich kolb of the fdp was another of the plaintiffs .
he owns a metal business with his brother .
kolb was worried the law would force him to disclose too much about his business , which he considers invasive . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but plenty of parliamentarians have extra money in their account at the end of the month from lucrative side jobs .
politicians will now have to report how much money they earn and where the extra money is coming from , germany 's federal constitutional court ruled on wednesday .
nine politicians from four leading german parties had challenged a regulation that took effect in january this year which requires all members of parliament to disclose all additional sources of income .
the constitutional court said that well-paid private sector jobs could seriously hamper mps ' independence and that the nation therefore " has a right to know " if parliamentary representatives earn money on the side . it added that in this instance , members of parliaments ' right to privacy was second to the public interest in transparency .
need for transparency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corruption is a concern the law on transparency were decided by the previous social democrat-green government in 2005 after an uproar in the country when it emerged that some politicians were making an additional tidy sum with lucrative jobs on the side .
some parliamentarians were on the payrolls of german corporations without seeming to do much to earn the extra incomes .
one high-profile politician was found to have accepted severance payments from an energy company which he had not even quit .
the revelations of these plum side jobs cost some politicians their jobs .
it also raised concerns in the country about possible corruption and a conflict of interest if politicians were closely connected to big companies .
some also questioned why politicians , who are paid well in germany , needed to take up another job .
critics say parliament will be filled with civil servants the transparency law passed in 2005 also said that voters had a right to know where elected politicians worked on the side and how much they earned .
opponents of the law however argued that it infringed on the right of parliamentarians to be free to choose to practise their professions .
hans-joachim otto , a member of the opposition free-market liberal fdp party , was one of the plaintiffs in the case .
otto is an attorney and notary .
he and three other partners have an office in frankfurt .
otto said he did n't want to give up his job for politics .
having a job is the best way to maintain independence and bring real-life experience to politics , otto told dw-world .
friedrich merz , former head of the parliamentary group of chancellor merkel 's christian democratic party , warned that the parliament would be filled with civil servants and career politicians who would have little touch with real life in germany .
privacy concerns " we do n't need only more professional politicians but also more people with work experience and life experience and who are independent , " otto said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's highest court ruled side jobs must be disclosed he said the law threatened politicians ' independence .
an unintended consequence of the new law is that political life becomes unattractive for self-employed people and entrepreneurs .

but plenty of parliamentarians have extra money in their account at the end of the month from lucrative side jobs .
politicians will now have to report how much money they earn and where the extra money is coming from , germany 's federal constitutional court ruled on wednesday .
nine politicians from four leading german parties had challenged a regulation that took effect in january this year which requires all members of parliament to disclose all additional sources of income .
the constitutional court said that well-paid private sector jobs could seriously hamper mps ' independence and that the nation therefore " has a right to know " if parliamentary representatives earn money on the side . it added that in this instance , members of parliaments ' right to privacy was second to the public interest in transparency .
need for transparency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corruption is a concern the law on transparency were decided by the previous social democrat-green government in 2005 after an uproar in the country when it emerged that some politicians were making an additional tidy sum with lucrative jobs on the side .
some parliamentarians were on the payrolls of german corporations without seeming to do much to earn the extra incomes .
one high-profile politician was found to have accepted severance payments from an energy company which he had not even quit .
the revelations of these plum side jobs cost some politicians their jobs .
it also raised concerns in the country about possible corruption and a conflict of interest if politicians were closely connected to big companies .
some also questioned why politicians , who are paid well in germany , needed to take up another job .
critics say parliament will be filled with civil servants the transparency law passed in 2005 also said that voters had a right to know where elected politicians worked on the side and how much they earned .
opponents of the law however argued that it infringed on the right of parliamentarians to be free to choose to practise their professions .
hans-joachim otto , a member of the opposition free-market liberal fdp party , was one of the plaintiffs in the case .
otto is an attorney and notary .
he and three other partners have an office in frankfurt .
otto said he did n't want to give up his job for politics .
having a job is the best way to maintain independence and bring real-life experience to politics , otto told dw-world .
friedrich merz , former head of the parliamentary group of chancellor merkel 's christian democratic party , warned that the parliament would be filled with civil servants and career politicians who would have little touch with real life in germany .
privacy concerns " we do n't need only more professional politicians but also more people with work experience and life experience and who are independent , " otto said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's highest court ruled side jobs must be disclosed he said the law threatened politicians ' independence .
an unintended consequence of the new law is that political life becomes unattractive for self-employed people and entrepreneurs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 04.07.2007 ' 87 concert was a genesis of east german rebellion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 60,000 west berliners packed the square in front of the reichstag for bowie twenty years ago this summer , young east berliners clashed with police while trying to listen in on a rock concert in the west .
it was a sign that the gdr , which disapproved of such fun , would soon be history . it 's difficult to imagine in 2007 that phil collins was ever cool - much less that he might have played a small role in the fall of the berlin wall .
but then again , in 1987 , few would have dared predict that the end of communist east germany was nigh . on june 8 of that year , the band genesis - collins ' troop of art-rockers-turned-pop-stars - headlined the final night of the " concert for berlin , " a three-day open-air festival staged in front of the reichstag .
the stage was only a stone 's throw from , and well within earshot of , the other side of the berlin wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east berliners could only gaze from a distance and fume as had been the case the previous two nights , which had featured david bowie and eurythmics , some 2,000 east berliners headed to the border at the brandenburg gate to get a listen .
few got there . " the police had cordoned off the street at the russian embassy -lrb- about a quarter-mile from the wall -rrb- , " eyewitness tina krone said . " they kept arresting people , dragging them along the surface of the street .
it was like a horror movie .
we were enraged . " as many as 200 people were taken into custody in what amounted to a small pitched battle between the cops and the kids .
and the frustrated east berliners , as gleefully noted by west german media , began chanting " the wall must fall ! " and " gorby get us out ! " land of confusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wall could n't keep east germans from listening to western music the communist party leadership of the gdr had always feared that rock music would incite the country 's entertainment-starved youth to rebel .
confronted with the " concert for berlin , " the stern guardians of socialist morality were determined to keep young east berliners away from what they say as a decadent influence . olof pock , a picture editor for dw-world.de who was fifteen years old at the time , climbed up on an east berlin rooftop to listen to eurythmics . " at the end of the concert , the police began to herd people back from the wall , " pock remembered .
" they completely overreacted .
they were beating kids with billy clubs . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : by 1989 east germans could get all the genesis they wanted east berliners were well informed about the concert by the radio station that sponsored it , rias 2 .
rias , which stood for radio in the american sector , convinced the musicians , despite the possibility of home taping , to allow the shows to be simulcast to all parts of the divided city . " the mood was one of enjoying forbidden fruit , " pock said .
" we knew that this was somehow being done for our benefit . " the west was very aware how hungry east german kids were for popular music from their capitalist " enemies . "
rias 2 had been specially formed as a music-oriented station broadcasting to all of berlin and the surrounding area . sweet dreams are made of this bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these aging english gentlemen played a role in cold war history so was the reichstag concert a conscious act of provocation ?
were some of the loudspeakers , as would later be alleged , aimed directly across the wall ? christoph lanz , today managing director of dw-tv , was deputy head of programming at rias 2 and the emcee at the concerts .
he says they were not . " i would have seen them , if they were , " lanz said .
" we were surprised when we heard about the reaction in the east .
i mean , we rocked the gdr ! " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gdr border guards killed some 190 people who tried to flee to the west but what people could see on or in front of the stage did n't tell the whole story .
peter schwenkow , the promoter and producer of the concert , says that at least a quarter of the speakers were indeed pointed at the eastern part of the city - as an act of revenge . " in 1977 , some crew members of tina turner were killed while in transit through east germany , " schwenkow said .
" a short time later , while in transit myself , i tried to find out what had happened and was interrogated at gunpoint by east german border guards .
ever since then i could n't stand those guys .
holding a show at the reichstag was an attempt to provoke them .
it was great fun . " both lanz and schwenkow look back with obvious pride and nostalgia on an event that called forth resentment and resistance to a repressive state . " on the afternoon before the genesis concert , i visited a friend of mine in east berlin , " lanz recalled .
" when it was time for me to leave , he said with teary eyes how much he wished he could go with me .
all he wanted to do was go hear a concert .
i still get goose bumps when i think of that . " ch-ch-ch-changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bowie , a former berlin resident , maintained close ties to the city in the wake of the concert , the gdr realized it had made a mistake . " it was the nervous reaction of a one-party state that was in over its head , " said rainer börner , an east berlin music producer and cultural secretary for the gdr 's main youth organization .
" some of us realized we had to increase what we were offering . " in 1989 bruce springsteen was booked to play a gig in east berlin - after organizers found a location far enough away form the wall to assuage fears that the music might inspire concert-goers to try to flee the gdr en masse .
but it was too little , too late . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today remnants of the wall have become places to chill " we saw what had happened in 1987 on western tv , " börner remembered .
" it just increased our frustration that we were n't allowed to do what we wanted . " " it was one stone in a whole mosaic , " concurred pock . on november 9 , 1989 , masses of east germans did precisely what the gdr leadership had feared they would be incited to do by the music of genesis .
they headed to the wall to cross a border that was soon to be history . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but plenty of parliamentarians have extra money in their account at the end of the month from lucrative side jobs .
politicians will now have to report how much money they earn and where the extra money is coming from , germany 's federal constitutional court ruled on wednesday .
nine politicians from four leading german parties had challenged a regulation that took effect in january this year which requires all members of parliament to disclose all additional sources of income .
the constitutional court said that well-paid private sector jobs could seriously hamper mps ' independence and that the nation therefore " has a right to know " if parliamentary representatives earn money on the side . it added that in this instance , members of parliaments ' right to privacy was second to the public interest in transparency .
need for transparency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corruption is a concern the law on transparency were decided by the previous social democrat-green government in 2005 after an uproar in the country when it emerged that some politicians were making an additional tidy sum with lucrative jobs on the side .
some parliamentarians were on the payrolls of german corporations without seeming to do much to earn the extra incomes .
one high-profile politician was found to have accepted severance payments from an energy company which he had not even quit .
the revelations of these plum side jobs cost some politicians their jobs .
it also raised concerns in the country about possible corruption and a conflict of interest if politicians were closely connected to big companies .
some also questioned why politicians , who are paid well in germany , needed to take up another job .
critics say parliament will be filled with civil servants the transparency law passed in 2005 also said that voters had a right to know where elected politicians worked on the side and how much they earned .
opponents of the law however argued that it infringed on the right of parliamentarians to be free to choose to practise their professions .
hans-joachim otto , a member of the opposition free-market liberal fdp party , was one of the plaintiffs in the case .
otto is an attorney and notary .
he and three other partners have an office in frankfurt .
otto said he did n't want to give up his job for politics .
having a job is the best way to maintain independence and bring real-life experience to politics , otto told dw-world .

it was a sign that the gdr , which disapproved of such fun , would soon be history . it 's difficult to imagine in 2007 that phil collins was ever cool - much less that he might have played a small role in the fall of the berlin wall .
but then again , in 1987 , few would have dared predict that the end of communist east germany was nigh . on june 8 of that year , the band genesis - collins ' troop of art-rockers-turned-pop-stars - headlined the final night of the " concert for berlin , " a three-day open-air festival staged in front of the reichstag .
the stage was only a stone 's throw from , and well within earshot of , the other side of the berlin wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east berliners could only gaze from a distance and fume as had been the case the previous two nights , which had featured david bowie and eurythmics , some 2,000 east berliners headed to the border at the brandenburg gate to get a listen .
few got there . " the police had cordoned off the street at the russian embassy -lrb- about a quarter-mile from the wall -rrb- , " eyewitness tina krone said . " they kept arresting people , dragging them along the surface of the street .
it was like a horror movie .
we were enraged . " as many as 200 people were taken into custody in what amounted to a small pitched battle between the cops and the kids .
and the frustrated east berliners , as gleefully noted by west german media , began chanting " the wall must fall ! " and " gorby get us out ! " land of confusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wall could n't keep east germans from listening to western music the communist party leadership of the gdr had always feared that rock music would incite the country 's entertainment-starved youth to rebel .
confronted with the " concert for berlin , " the stern guardians of socialist morality were determined to keep young east berliners away from what they say as a decadent influence . olof pock , a picture editor for dw-world.de who was fifteen years old at the time , climbed up on an east berlin rooftop to listen to eurythmics . " at the end of the concert , the police began to herd people back from the wall , " pock remembered .
" they completely overreacted .
they were beating kids with billy clubs . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : by 1989 east germans could get all the genesis they wanted east berliners were well informed about the concert by the radio station that sponsored it , rias 2 .
rias , which stood for radio in the american sector , convinced the musicians , despite the possibility of home taping , to allow the shows to be simulcast to all parts of the divided city . " the mood was one of enjoying forbidden fruit , " pock said .
" we knew that this was somehow being done for our benefit . " the west was very aware how hungry east german kids were for popular music from their capitalist " enemies . "
rias 2 had been specially formed as a music-oriented station broadcasting to all of berlin and the surrounding area . sweet dreams are made of this bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these aging english gentlemen played a role in cold war history so was the reichstag concert a conscious act of provocation ?
were some of the loudspeakers , as would later be alleged , aimed directly across the wall ? christoph lanz , today managing director of dw-tv , was deputy head of programming at rias 2 and the emcee at the concerts .
he says they were not . " i would have seen them , if they were , " lanz said .
" we were surprised when we heard about the reaction in the east .
i mean , we rocked the gdr ! " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gdr border guards killed some 190 people who tried to flee to the west but what people could see on or in front of the stage did n't tell the whole story .
peter schwenkow , the promoter and producer of the concert , says that at least a quarter of the speakers were indeed pointed at the eastern part of the city - as an act of revenge . " in 1977 , some crew members of tina turner were killed while in transit through east germany , " schwenkow said .
" a short time later , while in transit myself , i tried to find out what had happened and was interrogated at gunpoint by east german border guards .
ever since then i could n't stand those guys .
holding a show at the reichstag was an attempt to provoke them .
it was great fun . " both lanz and schwenkow look back with obvious pride and nostalgia on an event that called forth resentment and resistance to a repressive state . " on the afternoon before the genesis concert , i visited a friend of mine in east berlin , " lanz recalled .
" when it was time for me to leave , he said with teary eyes how much he wished he could go with me .
all he wanted to do was go hear a concert .
i still get goose bumps when i think of that . " ch-ch-ch-changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bowie , a former berlin resident , maintained close ties to the city in the wake of the concert , the gdr realized it had made a mistake . " it was the nervous reaction of a one-party state that was in over its head , " said rainer börner , an east berlin music producer and cultural secretary for the gdr 's main youth organization .
" some of us realized we had to increase what we were offering . " in 1989 bruce springsteen was booked to play a gig in east berlin - after organizers found a location far enough away form the wall to assuage fears that the music might inspire concert-goers to try to flee the gdr en masse .
but it was too little , too late . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today remnants of the wall have become places to chill " we saw what had happened in 1987 on western tv , " börner remembered .
" it just increased our frustration that we were n't allowed to do what we wanted . " " it was one stone in a whole mosaic , " concurred pock . on november 9 , 1989 , masses of east germans did precisely what the gdr leadership had feared they would be incited to do by the music of genesis .

some believe the number of terrorists with no formal training will rise . what does it mean that a group of doctors - recent immigrants to europe from different nations who seem to have had little prior contact with established terror networks - came together to plot a bombing ?
and was the failure of their bombs to detonate purely a blessing , or a signal that bombings in europe might become more frequent , now that it 's catching on among the untrained ?
the attacks in britain , when set alongside the recent rise in islamist activity in north africa and recent arrests of terrorist sympathizers in spain and germany can only mean one thing , says claude moniquet , chairman of the european strategic intelligence and security centre , a think tank in brussels .
" the al qaeda groups are trying to open a new jihad .
mostly there are two jihads - one in afghanistan and another in iraq .
they are trying to open a new one in … europe . "
details about the men in custody continue to come in , but to call plots like this one in britain as having a hard " link to al qaeda " might be premature .
at any rate , analysts say many recent terror plotters have had no formal training from al qaeda-proper in weaponry or logistics . advent of the ' do-it-yourself ' jihadists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the failed suitcase bombs found in germany last year they are simply very angry people who are inspired by the violent actions they 've seen carried out by al qaeda and others and are desperate to get in on the act , even if they do n't quite know how , says julianne smith , director of the europe program and the transatlantic dialogue on terrorism at the center for strategic and international studies in washington .
" i think it just shows the continuing evolution , that we 've gone from a highly trained set of individuals , to people who appear to have had some limited training to groups that appear not to know what they ’ re really doing whatsoever , " she says .
that these men 's bombs , like those of the so-called suitcase bombers who targeted german train stations last summer , failed to go off is a blessing .
but it may mean that in the long term europe could be facing more bombs from more bombers , expert and inept .
the desire to kill seems to be there , as does rudimentary information about building explosive devices .
internet coaching breeding new terrorists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet removes the need to attend training camps " as a potential bomber , you may not want to take the risk of traveling to the middle east , " says smith .
" you may be confused on how to find the individuals you would need to find , you may not want to sign up for the broader al qaeda movement , but what you 're going to do is find the information you need to get the job done , essentially on the internet . "
and while claude moniquet emphasized that britain ’ s participation in the iraq war and germany ’ s involvement in afghanistan mean the two countries are particularly vulnerable , all of europe is a potential target for terrorists .
" it 's important to understand that for the jihadis , they do n't make a lot of distinctions between the countries , " moniquet says .
" all the so-called western world is a target , for one very simple reason : they absolutely hate the way we live .
they hate democracy and they hate equality between women and men .
there are a lot of reasons for them to try and fight europe . "
the expanding body of evidence implies that anyone in any profession could be part of a sleeper cell intent on death and destruction in europe . no blueprint for modern terrorist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terror suspect mohammed asha raised few suspicions among the eight suspects arrested so far in the british investigation , at least six are doctors , including a jordanian surgeon and an iraqi physician .
an indian doctor is also being held in australia in connection with the london and glasgow attempted bombings after trying to flee the country with a one-way ticket to india .
none of those being held are british citizens , but the surprise has been evident that such well-educated and well-situated people , who once as doctors took an oath to help those in need , could take another oath to kill .
addressing the issue of the suspect 's backgrounds , the former head of the british government 's joint intelligence committee , pauline neville-jones , said recently that , essentially , anything now seems possible .
" it means obviously that you ca n't make any assumptions or have any preconceptions about the kind of people who might become terrorists .

"
having cruise play count claus schenk von stauffenberg in director bryan singer ’ s film " valkyrie " would promote germany 's image " more than 10 soccer world cups , " henckel von donnersmarck wrote in a full-page article in the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
berlin officials prevented singer from filming at the so-called bendlerblock , the site where stauffenberg was executed after his failed attempt to assassinate the nazi leader in 1944 , claiming that it was because it was a memorial site .
singer was also prevented from filming at the police station and yard for precinct 52 in the city 's kreuzberg neighborhood after senior officers complained that this would obstruct the various departments working on the site .
officials deny scientology claim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tom cruise plays count von stauffenberg in the film while some german politicians have said that cruise , 44 , is unwelcome because of his involvement with the church of scientology , officials have said that the decision to prevent filming at the bendlerblock , now part of the defense ministry , was unconnected with the star 's beliefs and was based purely on the disruption it would cause .
but in his article , henckel von donnersmarck accused german officials who had publicly raised concerns about cruise 's involvement with scientology of making the country appear intolerant .
" if stauffenberg and his consorts were considered un-german traitors to the fatherland , now even the biggest star of the victors ' nation is not enough to play our superman stauffenberg if this star is not in line with contemporary germany in his personal views , " he said .
the july 20 1944 foundation , a german organization set up to coordinate events and keep the story of von stauffenberg alive , also spoke out against the government ’ s decision .
rüdiger von voss , the foundation 's president , said that cruise should be allowed to play the german hero , regardless of his links to scientology . " it is unconstitutional to restrict artistic freedom and this freedom should be protected , " von voss was quoted as saying in the rheinischen merkur newspaper .
cruise links to church concern many bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bendlerblock is used as a memorial site in berlin however , peter steinbach , head of the memorial of the german opposition , weighed into the argument wednesday by saying that it was sadly ironic that the film about a national hero that stood up to the nazis would star a man widely perceived as being a member of a totalitarian organization .
steinbach also criticized henckel von donnersmarck for his article , in particular his description of von stauffenberg as a " superman " which could be misconstrued as a reference to the nazis ' desire to create a master race .
" henckel von donnersmarck should think seriously about the concepts he uses and which he so frivolously and irresponsibly puts out there in the world . "
the row over cruise 's beliefs took precedent in the location debate when defense minister franz josef jung made it clear that filmmakers could not shoot at any military sites as long as cruise plays von stauffenberg because of the hollywood actor 's link to scientology .
however , the german finance ministry , which oversees the locations and has the final word on such matters , said the filmmakers were welcome to film in germany - just not at the bendlerblock .
" they will not be permitted to film at the bendlerblock but this has nothing to do with -lrb- scientology -rrb- , " said finance ministry spokesman stefan olbermann .
" we welcome the fact that such a film is being made , " he added .
" we do n't think it would be appropriate to film there . "
he added that the ministry was still considering the filmmakers ' requests to shoot at other sites in germany , though he said there were no requests to film at military sites .

but plenty of parliamentarians have extra money in their account at the end of the month from lucrative side jobs .
politicians will now have to report how much money they earn and where the extra money is coming from , germany 's federal constitutional court ruled on wednesday .
nine politicians from four leading german parties had challenged a regulation that took effect in january this year which requires all members of parliament to disclose all additional sources of income .
the constitutional court said that well-paid private sector jobs could seriously hamper mps ' independence and that the nation therefore " has a right to know " if parliamentary representatives earn money on the side . it added that in this instance , members of parliaments ' right to privacy was second to the public interest in transparency .
need for transparency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corruption is a concern the law on transparency were decided by the previous social democrat-green government in 2005 after an uproar in the country when it emerged that some politicians were making an additional tidy sum with lucrative jobs on the side .
some parliamentarians were on the payrolls of german corporations without seeming to do much to earn the extra incomes .
one high-profile politician was found to have accepted severance payments from an energy company which he had not even quit .
the revelations of these plum side jobs cost some politicians their jobs .
it also raised concerns in the country about possible corruption and a conflict of interest if politicians were closely connected to big companies .
some also questioned why politicians , who are paid well in germany , needed to take up another job .
critics say parliament will be filled with civil servants the transparency law passed in 2005 also said that voters had a right to know where elected politicians worked on the side and how much they earned .
opponents of the law however argued that it infringed on the right of parliamentarians to be free to choose to practise their professions .
hans-joachim otto , a member of the opposition free-market liberal fdp party , was one of the plaintiffs in the case .
otto is an attorney and notary .
he and three other partners have an office in frankfurt .
otto said he did n't want to give up his job for politics .
having a job is the best way to maintain independence and bring real-life experience to politics , otto told dw-world .
friedrich merz , former head of the parliamentary group of chancellor merkel 's christian democratic party , warned that the parliament would be filled with civil servants and career politicians who would have little touch with real life in germany .
privacy concerns " we do n't need only more professional politicians but also more people with work experience and life experience and who are independent , " otto said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's highest court ruled side jobs must be disclosed he said the law threatened politicians ' independence .
an unintended consequence of the new law is that political life becomes unattractive for self-employed people and entrepreneurs .
heinrich kolb of the fdp was another of the plaintiffs .
he owns a metal business with his brother .
kolb was worried the law would force him to disclose too much about his business , which he considers invasive . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 04.07.2007 ' 87 concert was a genesis of east german rebellion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 60,000 west berliners packed the square in front of the reichstag for bowie twenty years ago this summer , young east berliners clashed with police while trying to listen in on a rock concert in the west .
it was a sign that the gdr , which disapproved of such fun , would soon be history . it 's difficult to imagine in 2007 that phil collins was ever cool - much less that he might have played a small role in the fall of the berlin wall .
but then again , in 1987 , few would have dared predict that the end of communist east germany was nigh . on june 8 of that year , the band genesis - collins ' troop of art-rockers-turned-pop-stars - headlined the final night of the " concert for berlin , " a three-day open-air festival staged in front of the reichstag .
the stage was only a stone 's throw from , and well within earshot of , the other side of the berlin wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east berliners could only gaze from a distance and fume as had been the case the previous two nights , which had featured david bowie and eurythmics , some 2,000 east berliners headed to the border at the brandenburg gate to get a listen .
few got there . " the police had cordoned off the street at the russian embassy -lrb- about a quarter-mile from the wall -rrb- , " eyewitness tina krone said . " they kept arresting people , dragging them along the surface of the street .
it was like a horror movie .
we were enraged . " as many as 200 people were taken into custody in what amounted to a small pitched battle between the cops and the kids .
and the frustrated east berliners , as gleefully noted by west german media , began chanting " the wall must fall ! " and " gorby get us out ! " land of confusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wall could n't keep east germans from listening to western music the communist party leadership of the gdr had always feared that rock music would incite the country 's entertainment-starved youth to rebel .
confronted with the " concert for berlin , " the stern guardians of socialist morality were determined to keep young east berliners away from what they say as a decadent influence . olof pock , a picture editor for dw-world.de who was fifteen years old at the time , climbed up on an east berlin rooftop to listen to eurythmics . " at the end of the concert , the police began to herd people back from the wall , " pock remembered .
" they completely overreacted .
they were beating kids with billy clubs . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : by 1989 east germans could get all the genesis they wanted east berliners were well informed about the concert by the radio station that sponsored it , rias 2 .
rias , which stood for radio in the american sector , convinced the musicians , despite the possibility of home taping , to allow the shows to be simulcast to all parts of the divided city . " the mood was one of enjoying forbidden fruit , " pock said .
" we knew that this was somehow being done for our benefit . " the west was very aware how hungry east german kids were for popular music from their capitalist " enemies . "
rias 2 had been specially formed as a music-oriented station broadcasting to all of berlin and the surrounding area . sweet dreams are made of this bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these aging english gentlemen played a role in cold war history so was the reichstag concert a conscious act of provocation ?
were some of the loudspeakers , as would later be alleged , aimed directly across the wall ? christoph lanz , today managing director of dw-tv , was deputy head of programming at rias 2 and the emcee at the concerts .
he says they were not . " i would have seen them , if they were , " lanz said .
" we were surprised when we heard about the reaction in the east .
i mean , we rocked the gdr ! " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gdr border guards killed some 190 people who tried to flee to the west but what people could see on or in front of the stage did n't tell the whole story .
peter schwenkow , the promoter and producer of the concert , says that at least a quarter of the speakers were indeed pointed at the eastern part of the city - as an act of revenge . " in 1977 , some crew members of tina turner were killed while in transit through east germany , " schwenkow said .
" a short time later , while in transit myself , i tried to find out what had happened and was interrogated at gunpoint by east german border guards .
ever since then i could n't stand those guys .
holding a show at the reichstag was an attempt to provoke them .
it was great fun . " both lanz and schwenkow look back with obvious pride and nostalgia on an event that called forth resentment and resistance to a repressive state . " on the afternoon before the genesis concert , i visited a friend of mine in east berlin , " lanz recalled .
" when it was time for me to leave , he said with teary eyes how much he wished he could go with me .
all he wanted to do was go hear a concert .
i still get goose bumps when i think of that . " ch-ch-ch-changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bowie , a former berlin resident , maintained close ties to the city in the wake of the concert , the gdr realized it had made a mistake . " it was the nervous reaction of a one-party state that was in over its head , " said rainer börner , an east berlin music producer and cultural secretary for the gdr 's main youth organization .
" some of us realized we had to increase what we were offering . " in 1989 bruce springsteen was booked to play a gig in east berlin - after organizers found a location far enough away form the wall to assuage fears that the music might inspire concert-goers to try to flee the gdr en masse .
but it was too little , too late . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today remnants of the wall have become places to chill " we saw what had happened in 1987 on western tv , " börner remembered .
" it just increased our frustration that we were n't allowed to do what we wanted . " " it was one stone in a whole mosaic , " concurred pock . on november 9 , 1989 , masses of east germans did precisely what the gdr leadership had feared they would be incited to do by the music of genesis .
they headed to the wall to cross a border that was soon to be history . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 04.07.2007 ' 87 concert was a genesis of east german rebellion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 60,000 west berliners packed the square in front of the reichstag for bowie twenty years ago this summer , young east berliners clashed with police while trying to listen in on a rock concert in the west .
it was a sign that the gdr , which disapproved of such fun , would soon be history . it 's difficult to imagine in 2007 that phil collins was ever cool - much less that he might have played a small role in the fall of the berlin wall .
but then again , in 1987 , few would have dared predict that the end of communist east germany was nigh . on june 8 of that year , the band genesis - collins ' troop of art-rockers-turned-pop-stars - headlined the final night of the " concert for berlin , " a three-day open-air festival staged in front of the reichstag .
the stage was only a stone 's throw from , and well within earshot of , the other side of the berlin wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east berliners could only gaze from a distance and fume as had been the case the previous two nights , which had featured david bowie and eurythmics , some 2,000 east berliners headed to the border at the brandenburg gate to get a listen .
few got there . " the police had cordoned off the street at the russian embassy -lrb- about a quarter-mile from the wall -rrb- , " eyewitness tina krone said . " they kept arresting people , dragging them along the surface of the street .
it was like a horror movie .
we were enraged . " as many as 200 people were taken into custody in what amounted to a small pitched battle between the cops and the kids .
and the frustrated east berliners , as gleefully noted by west german media , began chanting " the wall must fall ! " and " gorby get us out ! " land of confusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wall could n't keep east germans from listening to western music the communist party leadership of the gdr had always feared that rock music would incite the country 's entertainment-starved youth to rebel .
confronted with the " concert for berlin , " the stern guardians of socialist morality were determined to keep young east berliners away from what they say as a decadent influence . olof pock , a picture editor for dw-world.de who was fifteen years old at the time , climbed up on an east berlin rooftop to listen to eurythmics . " at the end of the concert , the police began to herd people back from the wall , " pock remembered .
" they completely overreacted .
they were beating kids with billy clubs . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : by 1989 east germans could get all the genesis they wanted east berliners were well informed about the concert by the radio station that sponsored it , rias 2 .
rias , which stood for radio in the american sector , convinced the musicians , despite the possibility of home taping , to allow the shows to be simulcast to all parts of the divided city . " the mood was one of enjoying forbidden fruit , " pock said .
" we knew that this was somehow being done for our benefit . " the west was very aware how hungry east german kids were for popular music from their capitalist " enemies . "
rias 2 had been specially formed as a music-oriented station broadcasting to all of berlin and the surrounding area . sweet dreams are made of this bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these aging english gentlemen played a role in cold war history so was the reichstag concert a conscious act of provocation ?
were some of the loudspeakers , as would later be alleged , aimed directly across the wall ? christoph lanz , today managing director of dw-tv , was deputy head of programming at rias 2 and the emcee at the concerts .
he says they were not . " i would have seen them , if they were , " lanz said .
" we were surprised when we heard about the reaction in the east .
i mean , we rocked the gdr ! " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gdr border guards killed some 190 people who tried to flee to the west but what people could see on or in front of the stage did n't tell the whole story .
peter schwenkow , the promoter and producer of the concert , says that at least a quarter of the speakers were indeed pointed at the eastern part of the city - as an act of revenge . " in 1977 , some crew members of tina turner were killed while in transit through east germany , " schwenkow said .
" a short time later , while in transit myself , i tried to find out what had happened and was interrogated at gunpoint by east german border guards .
ever since then i could n't stand those guys .
holding a show at the reichstag was an attempt to provoke them .
it was great fun . " both lanz and schwenkow look back with obvious pride and nostalgia on an event that called forth resentment and resistance to a repressive state . " on the afternoon before the genesis concert , i visited a friend of mine in east berlin , " lanz recalled .
" when it was time for me to leave , he said with teary eyes how much he wished he could go with me .
all he wanted to do was go hear a concert .
i still get goose bumps when i think of that . " ch-ch-ch-changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bowie , a former berlin resident , maintained close ties to the city in the wake of the concert , the gdr realized it had made a mistake . " it was the nervous reaction of a one-party state that was in over its head , " said rainer börner , an east berlin music producer and cultural secretary for the gdr 's main youth organization .
" some of us realized we had to increase what we were offering . " in 1989 bruce springsteen was booked to play a gig in east berlin - after organizers found a location far enough away form the wall to assuage fears that the music might inspire concert-goers to try to flee the gdr en masse .
but it was too little , too late . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today remnants of the wall have become places to chill " we saw what had happened in 1987 on western tv , " börner remembered .
" it just increased our frustration that we were n't allowed to do what we wanted . " " it was one stone in a whole mosaic , " concurred pock . on november 9 , 1989 , masses of east germans did precisely what the gdr leadership had feared they would be incited to do by the music of genesis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 04.07.2007 experts reassess changing face of europe 's terror threat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ever-changing face of terrorism is proving a constant challenge to law enforcement as details emerge about the suspects arrested in the car bombing plots in great britain , analysts are reassessing the terror threat against europe .
some believe the number of terrorists with no formal training will rise . what does it mean that a group of doctors - recent immigrants to europe from different nations who seem to have had little prior contact with established terror networks - came together to plot a bombing ?
and was the failure of their bombs to detonate purely a blessing , or a signal that bombings in europe might become more frequent , now that it 's catching on among the untrained ?
the attacks in britain , when set alongside the recent rise in islamist activity in north africa and recent arrests of terrorist sympathizers in spain and germany can only mean one thing , says claude moniquet , chairman of the european strategic intelligence and security centre , a think tank in brussels .
" the al qaeda groups are trying to open a new jihad .
mostly there are two jihads - one in afghanistan and another in iraq .
they are trying to open a new one in … europe . "
details about the men in custody continue to come in , but to call plots like this one in britain as having a hard " link to al qaeda " might be premature .
at any rate , analysts say many recent terror plotters have had no formal training from al qaeda-proper in weaponry or logistics . advent of the ' do-it-yourself ' jihadists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the failed suitcase bombs found in germany last year they are simply very angry people who are inspired by the violent actions they 've seen carried out by al qaeda and others and are desperate to get in on the act , even if they do n't quite know how , says julianne smith , director of the europe program and the transatlantic dialogue on terrorism at the center for strategic and international studies in washington .
" i think it just shows the continuing evolution , that we 've gone from a highly trained set of individuals , to people who appear to have had some limited training to groups that appear not to know what they ’ re really doing whatsoever , " she says .
that these men 's bombs , like those of the so-called suitcase bombers who targeted german train stations last summer , failed to go off is a blessing .
but it may mean that in the long term europe could be facing more bombs from more bombers , expert and inept .
the desire to kill seems to be there , as does rudimentary information about building explosive devices .
internet coaching breeding new terrorists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet removes the need to attend training camps " as a potential bomber , you may not want to take the risk of traveling to the middle east , " says smith .
" you may be confused on how to find the individuals you would need to find , you may not want to sign up for the broader al qaeda movement , but what you 're going to do is find the information you need to get the job done , essentially on the internet . "
and while claude moniquet emphasized that britain ’ s participation in the iraq war and germany ’ s involvement in afghanistan mean the two countries are particularly vulnerable , all of europe is a potential target for terrorists .
" it 's important to understand that for the jihadis , they do n't make a lot of distinctions between the countries , " moniquet says .
" all the so-called western world is a target , for one very simple reason : they absolutely hate the way we live .
they hate democracy and they hate equality between women and men .
there are a lot of reasons for them to try and fight europe . "
the expanding body of evidence implies that anyone in any profession could be part of a sleeper cell intent on death and destruction in europe . no blueprint for modern terrorist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terror suspect mohammed asha raised few suspicions among the eight suspects arrested so far in the british investigation , at least six are doctors , including a jordanian surgeon and an iraqi physician .
an indian doctor is also being held in australia in connection with the london and glasgow attempted bombings after trying to flee the country with a one-way ticket to india .
none of those being held are british citizens , but the surprise has been evident that such well-educated and well-situated people , who once as doctors took an oath to help those in need , could take another oath to kill .
addressing the issue of the suspect 's backgrounds , the former head of the british government 's joint intelligence committee , pauline neville-jones , said recently that , essentially , anything now seems possible .
" it means obviously that you ca n't make any assumptions or have any preconceptions about the kind of people who might become terrorists .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 04.07.2007 oscar winner leads voices criticizing germany over cruise film großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : florian henckel von donnersmarck has slammed the government 's stance on cruise a german government decision to prevent hollywood star tom cruise from filming scenes for his upcoming movie about a german aristocrat behind a daring plot to kill hitler has drawn criticism from a number of quarters . germany 's oscar-winning director florian henckel von donnersmarck , the creative brains behind stasi film " the lives of others , " which won the best foreign language picture award in february , slammed the government for wasting " a golden opportunity . "
having cruise play count claus schenk von stauffenberg in director bryan singer ’ s film " valkyrie " would promote germany 's image " more than 10 soccer world cups , " henckel von donnersmarck wrote in a full-page article in the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
berlin officials prevented singer from filming at the so-called bendlerblock , the site where stauffenberg was executed after his failed attempt to assassinate the nazi leader in 1944 , claiming that it was because it was a memorial site .
singer was also prevented from filming at the police station and yard for precinct 52 in the city 's kreuzberg neighborhood after senior officers complained that this would obstruct the various departments working on the site .
officials deny scientology claim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tom cruise plays count von stauffenberg in the film while some german politicians have said that cruise , 44 , is unwelcome because of his involvement with the church of scientology , officials have said that the decision to prevent filming at the bendlerblock , now part of the defense ministry , was unconnected with the star 's beliefs and was based purely on the disruption it would cause .
but in his article , henckel von donnersmarck accused german officials who had publicly raised concerns about cruise 's involvement with scientology of making the country appear intolerant .
" if stauffenberg and his consorts were considered un-german traitors to the fatherland , now even the biggest star of the victors ' nation is not enough to play our superman stauffenberg if this star is not in line with contemporary germany in his personal views , " he said .
the july 20 1944 foundation , a german organization set up to coordinate events and keep the story of von stauffenberg alive , also spoke out against the government ’ s decision .
rüdiger von voss , the foundation 's president , said that cruise should be allowed to play the german hero , regardless of his links to scientology . " it is unconstitutional to restrict artistic freedom and this freedom should be protected , " von voss was quoted as saying in the rheinischen merkur newspaper .
cruise links to church concern many bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bendlerblock is used as a memorial site in berlin however , peter steinbach , head of the memorial of the german opposition , weighed into the argument wednesday by saying that it was sadly ironic that the film about a national hero that stood up to the nazis would star a man widely perceived as being a member of a totalitarian organization .
steinbach also criticized henckel von donnersmarck for his article , in particular his description of von stauffenberg as a " superman " which could be misconstrued as a reference to the nazis ' desire to create a master race .
" henckel von donnersmarck should think seriously about the concepts he uses and which he so frivolously and irresponsibly puts out there in the world . "

" it is just the most fantastic thing to be free .
it was an appalling experience , " johnston , 45 , said in a brief telephone interview with the bbc television from the home of hamas leader ismail haniya , who was dismissed as prime minister last month by palestinian president mahmoud abbas after a hamas takeover of the gaza strip . the freed journalist later added " i think i 'm okay . " he said the ordeal was tremendously stressful . " we are delighted and extremely relieved , " the bbc said in a statement .
british prime minister gordon brown also said he welcomed the news of johnston 's release . " a friend of the palestinian people " later , in a press conference just after daybreak wednesday morning in gaza city , haniya described the journalist as a " friend of the palestinian people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a banner urging johnston to be freed in the west bank city of ramallah johnston said " the last 16 weeks , of course , were the worst of my life . "
the journalist , who was kidnapped and held by the shadowy army of islam , said being released was " the most unimaginable relief . " johnston was the only western correspondent based full-time in the troubled gaza strip .
he said he sensed his captors felt new pressure once hamas seized control in fighting three weeks ago . johnston thanked the hamas movement , and all those who worked for his freedom . " appalling and terrifying experience " johnston said his 16 weeks in captivity was " like being buried alive " with " dangerous and unpredictable " people who " threatened my life a number of times , in various ways . " he said there was no physical violence used against him , but that at times he was mistreated .
he said he was once chained for 24 hours but only in the last half hour did the captors " hit me a bit . " johnston , who appeared pale and to have lost weight , said he fell ill twice during his captivity .
the journalist added he was kept in a shuttered room for the last three months of his captivity and could not see the sun . johnston said he had a radio during his " appalling and terrifying experience , " and was able to follow events in gaza as well as the efforts to secure his release .
he said he had dreamed many times of being freed . " it 's hard to believe i wo n't wake up in that room again , " he said . prisoner swap led to johnston 's release bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas leader ismail haniya earlier tuesday night , hamas forces had laid siege to the area of gaza city where the army of islam , a group tied to the heavily armed doghmush clan , has its stronghold and where johnston was assumed to have been held . " i think this is a small ' jihadi ' group , " johnston said of his abductors . " i do n't know the details exactly and exactly who is behind it .
they had a jihadi agenda .
they were not so interested in israel-palestine .
they were interested in getting a knife into britain in some way . "
no ransom was paid , and there were no other conditions attached .
the group had previously demanded britain and other states free prisoners with ties to al qaeda . one week ago , a video was released in which johnston was shown wearing a explosive vest , which he said his captors would detonate if anyone tried to free him by force . in another statement released a day later , the group said it would " slaughter the prisoner like a sheep " if their demands were not met . johnston had been held captive longer than any other foreigner abducted in gaza . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
having cruise play count claus schenk von stauffenberg in director bryan singer ’ s film " valkyrie " would promote germany 's image " more than 10 soccer world cups , " henckel von donnersmarck wrote in a full-page article in the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
berlin officials prevented singer from filming at the so-called bendlerblock , the site where stauffenberg was executed after his failed attempt to assassinate the nazi leader in 1944 , claiming that it was because it was a memorial site .
singer was also prevented from filming at the police station and yard for precinct 52 in the city 's kreuzberg neighborhood after senior officers complained that this would obstruct the various departments working on the site .
officials deny scientology claim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tom cruise plays count von stauffenberg in the film while some german politicians have said that cruise , 44 , is unwelcome because of his involvement with the church of scientology , officials have said that the decision to prevent filming at the bendlerblock , now part of the defense ministry , was unconnected with the star 's beliefs and was based purely on the disruption it would cause .
but in his article , henckel von donnersmarck accused german officials who had publicly raised concerns about cruise 's involvement with scientology of making the country appear intolerant .
" if stauffenberg and his consorts were considered un-german traitors to the fatherland , now even the biggest star of the victors ' nation is not enough to play our superman stauffenberg if this star is not in line with contemporary germany in his personal views , " he said .
the july 20 1944 foundation , a german organization set up to coordinate events and keep the story of von stauffenberg alive , also spoke out against the government ’ s decision .
rüdiger von voss , the foundation 's president , said that cruise should be allowed to play the german hero , regardless of his links to scientology . " it is unconstitutional to restrict artistic freedom and this freedom should be protected , " von voss was quoted as saying in the rheinischen merkur newspaper .
cruise links to church concern many bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bendlerblock is used as a memorial site in berlin however , peter steinbach , head of the memorial of the german opposition , weighed into the argument wednesday by saying that it was sadly ironic that the film about a national hero that stood up to the nazis would star a man widely perceived as being a member of a totalitarian organization .
steinbach also criticized henckel von donnersmarck for his article , in particular his description of von stauffenberg as a " superman " which could be misconstrued as a reference to the nazis ' desire to create a master race .
" henckel von donnersmarck should think seriously about the concepts he uses and which he so frivolously and irresponsibly puts out there in the world . "
the row over cruise 's beliefs took precedent in the location debate when defense minister franz josef jung made it clear that filmmakers could not shoot at any military sites as long as cruise plays von stauffenberg because of the hollywood actor 's link to scientology .
however , the german finance ministry , which oversees the locations and has the final word on such matters , said the filmmakers were welcome to film in germany - just not at the bendlerblock .
" they will not be permitted to film at the bendlerblock but this has nothing to do with -lrb- scientology -rrb- , " said finance ministry spokesman stefan olbermann .
" we welcome the fact that such a film is being made , " he added .
" we do n't think it would be appropriate to film there . "
he added that the ministry was still considering the filmmakers ' requests to shoot at other sites in germany , though he said there were no requests to film at military sites .

but plenty of parliamentarians have extra money in their account at the end of the month from lucrative side jobs .
politicians will now have to report how much money they earn and where the extra money is coming from , germany 's federal constitutional court ruled on wednesday .
nine politicians from four leading german parties had challenged a regulation that took effect in january this year which requires all members of parliament to disclose all additional sources of income .
the constitutional court said that well-paid private sector jobs could seriously hamper mps ' independence and that the nation therefore " has a right to know " if parliamentary representatives earn money on the side . it added that in this instance , members of parliaments ' right to privacy was second to the public interest in transparency .
need for transparency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corruption is a concern the law on transparency were decided by the previous social democrat-green government in 2005 after an uproar in the country when it emerged that some politicians were making an additional tidy sum with lucrative jobs on the side .
some parliamentarians were on the payrolls of german corporations without seeming to do much to earn the extra incomes .
one high-profile politician was found to have accepted severance payments from an energy company which he had not even quit .
the revelations of these plum side jobs cost some politicians their jobs .
it also raised concerns in the country about possible corruption and a conflict of interest if politicians were closely connected to big companies .
some also questioned why politicians , who are paid well in germany , needed to take up another job .
critics say parliament will be filled with civil servants the transparency law passed in 2005 also said that voters had a right to know where elected politicians worked on the side and how much they earned .
opponents of the law however argued that it infringed on the right of parliamentarians to be free to choose to practise their professions .
hans-joachim otto , a member of the opposition free-market liberal fdp party , was one of the plaintiffs in the case .
otto is an attorney and notary .
he and three other partners have an office in frankfurt .
otto said he did n't want to give up his job for politics .
having a job is the best way to maintain independence and bring real-life experience to politics , otto told dw-world .
friedrich merz , former head of the parliamentary group of chancellor merkel 's christian democratic party , warned that the parliament would be filled with civil servants and career politicians who would have little touch with real life in germany .

but plenty of parliamentarians have extra money in their account at the end of the month from lucrative side jobs .
politicians will now have to report how much money they earn and where the extra money is coming from , germany 's federal constitutional court ruled on wednesday .
nine politicians from four leading german parties had challenged a regulation that took effect in january this year which requires all members of parliament to disclose all additional sources of income .
the constitutional court said that well-paid private sector jobs could seriously hamper mps ' independence and that the nation therefore " has a right to know " if parliamentary representatives earn money on the side . it added that in this instance , members of parliaments ' right to privacy was second to the public interest in transparency .
need for transparency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corruption is a concern the law on transparency were decided by the previous social democrat-green government in 2005 after an uproar in the country when it emerged that some politicians were making an additional tidy sum with lucrative jobs on the side .
some parliamentarians were on the payrolls of german corporations without seeming to do much to earn the extra incomes .
one high-profile politician was found to have accepted severance payments from an energy company which he had not even quit .
the revelations of these plum side jobs cost some politicians their jobs .
it also raised concerns in the country about possible corruption and a conflict of interest if politicians were closely connected to big companies .
some also questioned why politicians , who are paid well in germany , needed to take up another job .
critics say parliament will be filled with civil servants the transparency law passed in 2005 also said that voters had a right to know where elected politicians worked on the side and how much they earned .
opponents of the law however argued that it infringed on the right of parliamentarians to be free to choose to practise their professions .
hans-joachim otto , a member of the opposition free-market liberal fdp party , was one of the plaintiffs in the case .
otto is an attorney and notary .
he and three other partners have an office in frankfurt .
otto said he did n't want to give up his job for politics .
having a job is the best way to maintain independence and bring real-life experience to politics , otto told dw-world .
friedrich merz , former head of the parliamentary group of chancellor merkel 's christian democratic party , warned that the parliament would be filled with civil servants and career politicians who would have little touch with real life in germany .
privacy concerns " we do n't need only more professional politicians but also more people with work experience and life experience and who are independent , " otto said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's highest court ruled side jobs must be disclosed he said the law threatened politicians ' independence .
an unintended consequence of the new law is that political life becomes unattractive for self-employed people and entrepreneurs .

"
having cruise play count claus schenk von stauffenberg in director bryan singer ’ s film " valkyrie " would promote germany 's image " more than 10 soccer world cups , " henckel von donnersmarck wrote in a full-page article in the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
berlin officials prevented singer from filming at the so-called bendlerblock , the site where stauffenberg was executed after his failed attempt to assassinate the nazi leader in 1944 , claiming that it was because it was a memorial site .
singer was also prevented from filming at the police station and yard for precinct 52 in the city 's kreuzberg neighborhood after senior officers complained that this would obstruct the various departments working on the site .
officials deny scientology claim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tom cruise plays count von stauffenberg in the film while some german politicians have said that cruise , 44 , is unwelcome because of his involvement with the church of scientology , officials have said that the decision to prevent filming at the bendlerblock , now part of the defense ministry , was unconnected with the star 's beliefs and was based purely on the disruption it would cause .
but in his article , henckel von donnersmarck accused german officials who had publicly raised concerns about cruise 's involvement with scientology of making the country appear intolerant .
" if stauffenberg and his consorts were considered un-german traitors to the fatherland , now even the biggest star of the victors ' nation is not enough to play our superman stauffenberg if this star is not in line with contemporary germany in his personal views , " he said .
the july 20 1944 foundation , a german organization set up to coordinate events and keep the story of von stauffenberg alive , also spoke out against the government ’ s decision .
rüdiger von voss , the foundation 's president , said that cruise should be allowed to play the german hero , regardless of his links to scientology . " it is unconstitutional to restrict artistic freedom and this freedom should be protected , " von voss was quoted as saying in the rheinischen merkur newspaper .
cruise links to church concern many bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bendlerblock is used as a memorial site in berlin however , peter steinbach , head of the memorial of the german opposition , weighed into the argument wednesday by saying that it was sadly ironic that the film about a national hero that stood up to the nazis would star a man widely perceived as being a member of a totalitarian organization .
steinbach also criticized henckel von donnersmarck for his article , in particular his description of von stauffenberg as a " superman " which could be misconstrued as a reference to the nazis ' desire to create a master race .
" henckel von donnersmarck should think seriously about the concepts he uses and which he so frivolously and irresponsibly puts out there in the world . "
the row over cruise 's beliefs took precedent in the location debate when defense minister franz josef jung made it clear that filmmakers could not shoot at any military sites as long as cruise plays von stauffenberg because of the hollywood actor 's link to scientology .
however , the german finance ministry , which oversees the locations and has the final word on such matters , said the filmmakers were welcome to film in germany - just not at the bendlerblock .
" they will not be permitted to film at the bendlerblock but this has nothing to do with -lrb- scientology -rrb- , " said finance ministry spokesman stefan olbermann .
" we welcome the fact that such a film is being made , " he added .
" we do n't think it would be appropriate to film there . "
he added that the ministry was still considering the filmmakers ' requests to shoot at other sites in germany , though he said there were no requests to film at military sites .
scientologists under surveillance in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church of scientology is closely watched in germany the us-based church of scientology is under observation by the federal office for the protection of the constitution and several state security watchdogs , although not by the berlin authorities following a successful court challenge by the group .
anti-subversive agencies in germany fear its activities are " directed against the free democratic order " in the country .
the church opened a new center in berlin in january , sparking fears that it is trying to make inroads into german politics .

" henckel von donnersmarck should think seriously about the concepts he uses and which he so frivolously and irresponsibly puts out there in the world . "
the row over cruise 's beliefs took precedent in the location debate when defense minister franz josef jung made it clear that filmmakers could not shoot at any military sites as long as cruise plays von stauffenberg because of the hollywood actor 's link to scientology .
however , the german finance ministry , which oversees the locations and has the final word on such matters , said the filmmakers were welcome to film in germany - just not at the bendlerblock .
" they will not be permitted to film at the bendlerblock but this has nothing to do with -lrb- scientology -rrb- , " said finance ministry spokesman stefan olbermann .
" we welcome the fact that such a film is being made , " he added .
" we do n't think it would be appropriate to film there . "
he added that the ministry was still considering the filmmakers ' requests to shoot at other sites in germany , though he said there were no requests to film at military sites .
scientologists under surveillance in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church of scientology is closely watched in germany the us-based church of scientology is under observation by the federal office for the protection of the constitution and several state security watchdogs , although not by the berlin authorities following a successful court challenge by the group .
anti-subversive agencies in germany fear its activities are " directed against the free democratic order " in the country .
the church opened a new center in berlin in january , sparking fears that it is trying to make inroads into german politics .
scientologists are regarded with suspicion in many european countries , where authorities contend its leaders seek economic gain and use totalitarian methods to keep supporters in line . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was a sign that the gdr , which disapproved of such fun , would soon be history . it 's difficult to imagine in 2007 that phil collins was ever cool - much less that he might have played a small role in the fall of the berlin wall .
but then again , in 1987 , few would have dared predict that the end of communist east germany was nigh . on june 8 of that year , the band genesis - collins ' troop of art-rockers-turned-pop-stars - headlined the final night of the " concert for berlin , " a three-day open-air festival staged in front of the reichstag .
the stage was only a stone 's throw from , and well within earshot of , the other side of the berlin wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east berliners could only gaze from a distance and fume as had been the case the previous two nights , which had featured david bowie and eurythmics , some 2,000 east berliners headed to the border at the brandenburg gate to get a listen .
few got there . " the police had cordoned off the street at the russian embassy -lrb- about a quarter-mile from the wall -rrb- , " eyewitness tina krone said . " they kept arresting people , dragging them along the surface of the street .
it was like a horror movie .
we were enraged . " as many as 200 people were taken into custody in what amounted to a small pitched battle between the cops and the kids .
and the frustrated east berliners , as gleefully noted by west german media , began chanting " the wall must fall ! " and " gorby get us out ! " land of confusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wall could n't keep east germans from listening to western music the communist party leadership of the gdr had always feared that rock music would incite the country 's entertainment-starved youth to rebel .
confronted with the " concert for berlin , " the stern guardians of socialist morality were determined to keep young east berliners away from what they say as a decadent influence . olof pock , a picture editor for dw-world.de who was fifteen years old at the time , climbed up on an east berlin rooftop to listen to eurythmics . " at the end of the concert , the police began to herd people back from the wall , " pock remembered .
" they completely overreacted .
they were beating kids with billy clubs . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : by 1989 east germans could get all the genesis they wanted east berliners were well informed about the concert by the radio station that sponsored it , rias 2 .
rias , which stood for radio in the american sector , convinced the musicians , despite the possibility of home taping , to allow the shows to be simulcast to all parts of the divided city . " the mood was one of enjoying forbidden fruit , " pock said .
" we knew that this was somehow being done for our benefit . " the west was very aware how hungry east german kids were for popular music from their capitalist " enemies . "
rias 2 had been specially formed as a music-oriented station broadcasting to all of berlin and the surrounding area . sweet dreams are made of this bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these aging english gentlemen played a role in cold war history so was the reichstag concert a conscious act of provocation ?
were some of the loudspeakers , as would later be alleged , aimed directly across the wall ? christoph lanz , today managing director of dw-tv , was deputy head of programming at rias 2 and the emcee at the concerts .
he says they were not . " i would have seen them , if they were , " lanz said .
" we were surprised when we heard about the reaction in the east .
i mean , we rocked the gdr ! " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gdr border guards killed some 190 people who tried to flee to the west but what people could see on or in front of the stage did n't tell the whole story .
peter schwenkow , the promoter and producer of the concert , says that at least a quarter of the speakers were indeed pointed at the eastern part of the city - as an act of revenge . " in 1977 , some crew members of tina turner were killed while in transit through east germany , " schwenkow said .
" a short time later , while in transit myself , i tried to find out what had happened and was interrogated at gunpoint by east german border guards .
ever since then i could n't stand those guys .
holding a show at the reichstag was an attempt to provoke them .
it was great fun . " both lanz and schwenkow look back with obvious pride and nostalgia on an event that called forth resentment and resistance to a repressive state . " on the afternoon before the genesis concert , i visited a friend of mine in east berlin , " lanz recalled .
" when it was time for me to leave , he said with teary eyes how much he wished he could go with me .
all he wanted to do was go hear a concert .
i still get goose bumps when i think of that . " ch-ch-ch-changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bowie , a former berlin resident , maintained close ties to the city in the wake of the concert , the gdr realized it had made a mistake . " it was the nervous reaction of a one-party state that was in over its head , " said rainer börner , an east berlin music producer and cultural secretary for the gdr 's main youth organization .
" some of us realized we had to increase what we were offering . " in 1989 bruce springsteen was booked to play a gig in east berlin - after organizers found a location far enough away form the wall to assuage fears that the music might inspire concert-goers to try to flee the gdr en masse .
but it was too little , too late . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today remnants of the wall have become places to chill " we saw what had happened in 1987 on western tv , " börner remembered .
" it just increased our frustration that we were n't allowed to do what we wanted . " " it was one stone in a whole mosaic , " concurred pock . on november 9 , 1989 , masses of east germans did precisely what the gdr leadership had feared they would be incited to do by the music of genesis .
they headed to the wall to cross a border that was soon to be history . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

few got there . " the police had cordoned off the street at the russian embassy -lrb- about a quarter-mile from the wall -rrb- , " eyewitness tina krone said . " they kept arresting people , dragging them along the surface of the street .
it was like a horror movie .
we were enraged . " as many as 200 people were taken into custody in what amounted to a small pitched battle between the cops and the kids .
and the frustrated east berliners , as gleefully noted by west german media , began chanting " the wall must fall ! " and " gorby get us out ! " land of confusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wall could n't keep east germans from listening to western music the communist party leadership of the gdr had always feared that rock music would incite the country 's entertainment-starved youth to rebel .
confronted with the " concert for berlin , " the stern guardians of socialist morality were determined to keep young east berliners away from what they say as a decadent influence . olof pock , a picture editor for dw-world.de who was fifteen years old at the time , climbed up on an east berlin rooftop to listen to eurythmics . " at the end of the concert , the police began to herd people back from the wall , " pock remembered .
" they completely overreacted .
they were beating kids with billy clubs . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : by 1989 east germans could get all the genesis they wanted east berliners were well informed about the concert by the radio station that sponsored it , rias 2 .
rias , which stood for radio in the american sector , convinced the musicians , despite the possibility of home taping , to allow the shows to be simulcast to all parts of the divided city . " the mood was one of enjoying forbidden fruit , " pock said .
" we knew that this was somehow being done for our benefit . " the west was very aware how hungry east german kids were for popular music from their capitalist " enemies . "
rias 2 had been specially formed as a music-oriented station broadcasting to all of berlin and the surrounding area . sweet dreams are made of this bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these aging english gentlemen played a role in cold war history so was the reichstag concert a conscious act of provocation ?
were some of the loudspeakers , as would later be alleged , aimed directly across the wall ? christoph lanz , today managing director of dw-tv , was deputy head of programming at rias 2 and the emcee at the concerts .
he says they were not . " i would have seen them , if they were , " lanz said .
" we were surprised when we heard about the reaction in the east .
i mean , we rocked the gdr ! " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gdr border guards killed some 190 people who tried to flee to the west but what people could see on or in front of the stage did n't tell the whole story .
peter schwenkow , the promoter and producer of the concert , says that at least a quarter of the speakers were indeed pointed at the eastern part of the city - as an act of revenge . " in 1977 , some crew members of tina turner were killed while in transit through east germany , " schwenkow said .
" a short time later , while in transit myself , i tried to find out what had happened and was interrogated at gunpoint by east german border guards .
ever since then i could n't stand those guys .
holding a show at the reichstag was an attempt to provoke them .
it was great fun . " both lanz and schwenkow look back with obvious pride and nostalgia on an event that called forth resentment and resistance to a repressive state . " on the afternoon before the genesis concert , i visited a friend of mine in east berlin , " lanz recalled .
" when it was time for me to leave , he said with teary eyes how much he wished he could go with me .
all he wanted to do was go hear a concert .
i still get goose bumps when i think of that . " ch-ch-ch-changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bowie , a former berlin resident , maintained close ties to the city in the wake of the concert , the gdr realized it had made a mistake . " it was the nervous reaction of a one-party state that was in over its head , " said rainer börner , an east berlin music producer and cultural secretary for the gdr 's main youth organization .
" some of us realized we had to increase what we were offering . " in 1989 bruce springsteen was booked to play a gig in east berlin - after organizers found a location far enough away form the wall to assuage fears that the music might inspire concert-goers to try to flee the gdr en masse .
but it was too little , too late . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today remnants of the wall have become places to chill " we saw what had happened in 1987 on western tv , " börner remembered .
" it just increased our frustration that we were n't allowed to do what we wanted . " " it was one stone in a whole mosaic , " concurred pock . on november 9 , 1989 , masses of east germans did precisely what the gdr leadership had feared they would be incited to do by the music of genesis .
they headed to the wall to cross a border that was soon to be history . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 04.07.2007 ' 87 concert was a genesis of east german rebellion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 60,000 west berliners packed the square in front of the reichstag for bowie twenty years ago this summer , young east berliners clashed with police while trying to listen in on a rock concert in the west .
it was a sign that the gdr , which disapproved of such fun , would soon be history . it 's difficult to imagine in 2007 that phil collins was ever cool - much less that he might have played a small role in the fall of the berlin wall .
but then again , in 1987 , few would have dared predict that the end of communist east germany was nigh . on june 8 of that year , the band genesis - collins ' troop of art-rockers-turned-pop-stars - headlined the final night of the " concert for berlin , " a three-day open-air festival staged in front of the reichstag .
the stage was only a stone 's throw from , and well within earshot of , the other side of the berlin wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east berliners could only gaze from a distance and fume as had been the case the previous two nights , which had featured david bowie and eurythmics , some 2,000 east berliners headed to the border at the brandenburg gate to get a listen .
few got there . " the police had cordoned off the street at the russian embassy -lrb- about a quarter-mile from the wall -rrb- , " eyewitness tina krone said . " they kept arresting people , dragging them along the surface of the street .
it was like a horror movie .
we were enraged . " as many as 200 people were taken into custody in what amounted to a small pitched battle between the cops and the kids .
and the frustrated east berliners , as gleefully noted by west german media , began chanting " the wall must fall ! " and " gorby get us out ! " land of confusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wall could n't keep east germans from listening to western music the communist party leadership of the gdr had always feared that rock music would incite the country 's entertainment-starved youth to rebel .
confronted with the " concert for berlin , " the stern guardians of socialist morality were determined to keep young east berliners away from what they say as a decadent influence . olof pock , a picture editor for dw-world.de who was fifteen years old at the time , climbed up on an east berlin rooftop to listen to eurythmics . " at the end of the concert , the police began to herd people back from the wall , " pock remembered .
" they completely overreacted .
they were beating kids with billy clubs . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : by 1989 east germans could get all the genesis they wanted east berliners were well informed about the concert by the radio station that sponsored it , rias 2 .
rias , which stood for radio in the american sector , convinced the musicians , despite the possibility of home taping , to allow the shows to be simulcast to all parts of the divided city . " the mood was one of enjoying forbidden fruit , " pock said .
" we knew that this was somehow being done for our benefit . " the west was very aware how hungry east german kids were for popular music from their capitalist " enemies . "
rias 2 had been specially formed as a music-oriented station broadcasting to all of berlin and the surrounding area . sweet dreams are made of this bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these aging english gentlemen played a role in cold war history so was the reichstag concert a conscious act of provocation ?
were some of the loudspeakers , as would later be alleged , aimed directly across the wall ? christoph lanz , today managing director of dw-tv , was deputy head of programming at rias 2 and the emcee at the concerts .
he says they were not . " i would have seen them , if they were , " lanz said .
" we were surprised when we heard about the reaction in the east .
i mean , we rocked the gdr ! " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gdr border guards killed some 190 people who tried to flee to the west but what people could see on or in front of the stage did n't tell the whole story .
peter schwenkow , the promoter and producer of the concert , says that at least a quarter of the speakers were indeed pointed at the eastern part of the city - as an act of revenge . " in 1977 , some crew members of tina turner were killed while in transit through east germany , " schwenkow said .
" a short time later , while in transit myself , i tried to find out what had happened and was interrogated at gunpoint by east german border guards .
ever since then i could n't stand those guys .
holding a show at the reichstag was an attempt to provoke them .
it was great fun . " both lanz and schwenkow look back with obvious pride and nostalgia on an event that called forth resentment and resistance to a repressive state . " on the afternoon before the genesis concert , i visited a friend of mine in east berlin , " lanz recalled .
" when it was time for me to leave , he said with teary eyes how much he wished he could go with me .
all he wanted to do was go hear a concert .
i still get goose bumps when i think of that . " ch-ch-ch-changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bowie , a former berlin resident , maintained close ties to the city in the wake of the concert , the gdr realized it had made a mistake . " it was the nervous reaction of a one-party state that was in over its head , " said rainer börner , an east berlin music producer and cultural secretary for the gdr 's main youth organization .
" some of us realized we had to increase what we were offering . " in 1989 bruce springsteen was booked to play a gig in east berlin - after organizers found a location far enough away form the wall to assuage fears that the music might inspire concert-goers to try to flee the gdr en masse .
but it was too little , too late . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today remnants of the wall have become places to chill " we saw what had happened in 1987 on western tv , " börner remembered .
" it just increased our frustration that we were n't allowed to do what we wanted . " " it was one stone in a whole mosaic , " concurred pock . on november 9 , 1989 , masses of east germans did precisely what the gdr leadership had feared they would be incited to do by the music of genesis .
they headed to the wall to cross a border that was soon to be history . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
having cruise play count claus schenk von stauffenberg in director bryan singer ’ s film " valkyrie " would promote germany 's image " more than 10 soccer world cups , " henckel von donnersmarck wrote in a full-page article in the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
berlin officials prevented singer from filming at the so-called bendlerblock , the site where stauffenberg was executed after his failed attempt to assassinate the nazi leader in 1944 , claiming that it was because it was a memorial site .
singer was also prevented from filming at the police station and yard for precinct 52 in the city 's kreuzberg neighborhood after senior officers complained that this would obstruct the various departments working on the site .
officials deny scientology claim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tom cruise plays count von stauffenberg in the film while some german politicians have said that cruise , 44 , is unwelcome because of his involvement with the church of scientology , officials have said that the decision to prevent filming at the bendlerblock , now part of the defense ministry , was unconnected with the star 's beliefs and was based purely on the disruption it would cause .
but in his article , henckel von donnersmarck accused german officials who had publicly raised concerns about cruise 's involvement with scientology of making the country appear intolerant .
" if stauffenberg and his consorts were considered un-german traitors to the fatherland , now even the biggest star of the victors ' nation is not enough to play our superman stauffenberg if this star is not in line with contemporary germany in his personal views , " he said .
the july 20 1944 foundation , a german organization set up to coordinate events and keep the story of von stauffenberg alive , also spoke out against the government ’ s decision .
rüdiger von voss , the foundation 's president , said that cruise should be allowed to play the german hero , regardless of his links to scientology . " it is unconstitutional to restrict artistic freedom and this freedom should be protected , " von voss was quoted as saying in the rheinischen merkur newspaper .
cruise links to church concern many bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bendlerblock is used as a memorial site in berlin however , peter steinbach , head of the memorial of the german opposition , weighed into the argument wednesday by saying that it was sadly ironic that the film about a national hero that stood up to the nazis would star a man widely perceived as being a member of a totalitarian organization .
steinbach also criticized henckel von donnersmarck for his article , in particular his description of von stauffenberg as a " superman " which could be misconstrued as a reference to the nazis ' desire to create a master race .
" henckel von donnersmarck should think seriously about the concepts he uses and which he so frivolously and irresponsibly puts out there in the world . "
the row over cruise 's beliefs took precedent in the location debate when defense minister franz josef jung made it clear that filmmakers could not shoot at any military sites as long as cruise plays von stauffenberg because of the hollywood actor 's link to scientology .
however , the german finance ministry , which oversees the locations and has the final word on such matters , said the filmmakers were welcome to film in germany - just not at the bendlerblock .
" they will not be permitted to film at the bendlerblock but this has nothing to do with -lrb- scientology -rrb- , " said finance ministry spokesman stefan olbermann .
" we welcome the fact that such a film is being made , " he added .
" we do n't think it would be appropriate to film there . "
he added that the ministry was still considering the filmmakers ' requests to shoot at other sites in germany , though he said there were no requests to film at military sites .
scientologists under surveillance in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church of scientology is closely watched in germany the us-based church of scientology is under observation by the federal office for the protection of the constitution and several state security watchdogs , although not by the berlin authorities following a successful court challenge by the group .
anti-subversive agencies in germany fear its activities are " directed against the free democratic order " in the country .
the church opened a new center in berlin in january , sparking fears that it is trying to make inroads into german politics .
scientologists are regarded with suspicion in many european countries , where authorities contend its leaders seek economic gain and use totalitarian methods to keep supporters in line . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was a sign that the gdr , which disapproved of such fun , would soon be history . it 's difficult to imagine in 2007 that phil collins was ever cool - much less that he might have played a small role in the fall of the berlin wall .
but then again , in 1987 , few would have dared predict that the end of communist east germany was nigh . on june 8 of that year , the band genesis - collins ' troop of art-rockers-turned-pop-stars - headlined the final night of the " concert for berlin , " a three-day open-air festival staged in front of the reichstag .
the stage was only a stone 's throw from , and well within earshot of , the other side of the berlin wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east berliners could only gaze from a distance and fume as had been the case the previous two nights , which had featured david bowie and eurythmics , some 2,000 east berliners headed to the border at the brandenburg gate to get a listen .
few got there . " the police had cordoned off the street at the russian embassy -lrb- about a quarter-mile from the wall -rrb- , " eyewitness tina krone said . " they kept arresting people , dragging them along the surface of the street .
it was like a horror movie .
we were enraged . " as many as 200 people were taken into custody in what amounted to a small pitched battle between the cops and the kids .
and the frustrated east berliners , as gleefully noted by west german media , began chanting " the wall must fall ! " and " gorby get us out ! " land of confusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wall could n't keep east germans from listening to western music the communist party leadership of the gdr had always feared that rock music would incite the country 's entertainment-starved youth to rebel .
confronted with the " concert for berlin , " the stern guardians of socialist morality were determined to keep young east berliners away from what they say as a decadent influence . olof pock , a picture editor for dw-world.de who was fifteen years old at the time , climbed up on an east berlin rooftop to listen to eurythmics . " at the end of the concert , the police began to herd people back from the wall , " pock remembered .
" they completely overreacted .
they were beating kids with billy clubs . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : by 1989 east germans could get all the genesis they wanted east berliners were well informed about the concert by the radio station that sponsored it , rias 2 .
rias , which stood for radio in the american sector , convinced the musicians , despite the possibility of home taping , to allow the shows to be simulcast to all parts of the divided city . " the mood was one of enjoying forbidden fruit , " pock said .
" we knew that this was somehow being done for our benefit . " the west was very aware how hungry east german kids were for popular music from their capitalist " enemies . "
rias 2 had been specially formed as a music-oriented station broadcasting to all of berlin and the surrounding area . sweet dreams are made of this bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these aging english gentlemen played a role in cold war history so was the reichstag concert a conscious act of provocation ?
were some of the loudspeakers , as would later be alleged , aimed directly across the wall ? christoph lanz , today managing director of dw-tv , was deputy head of programming at rias 2 and the emcee at the concerts .
he says they were not . " i would have seen them , if they were , " lanz said .
" we were surprised when we heard about the reaction in the east .
i mean , we rocked the gdr ! " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gdr border guards killed some 190 people who tried to flee to the west but what people could see on or in front of the stage did n't tell the whole story .
peter schwenkow , the promoter and producer of the concert , says that at least a quarter of the speakers were indeed pointed at the eastern part of the city - as an act of revenge . " in 1977 , some crew members of tina turner were killed while in transit through east germany , " schwenkow said .
" a short time later , while in transit myself , i tried to find out what had happened and was interrogated at gunpoint by east german border guards .
ever since then i could n't stand those guys .
holding a show at the reichstag was an attempt to provoke them .
it was great fun . " both lanz and schwenkow look back with obvious pride and nostalgia on an event that called forth resentment and resistance to a repressive state . " on the afternoon before the genesis concert , i visited a friend of mine in east berlin , " lanz recalled .
" when it was time for me to leave , he said with teary eyes how much he wished he could go with me .

but wine producers are already griping about the new grape proposals . the eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel of denmark announced the proposed reforms in brussels , saying they were needed to save taxpayers ' money and make european wines more competitive against rising global imports . fischer boel said her proposals would " reinvigorate the european wine sector and put it back where it belongs , that is , back on top of the world . " she added : " everybody recognizes that a profound reform of the wine sector is needed , so we have to bite the bullet and do what we think is the best solution for our producers and our consumers . " the reform plans include reducing the amount of land used for producing wine in europe from 3.6 million to 3.2 million hectares by 2012 .
the eu also wants to completely do away with subsidies for grape juice concentrate , which is used to produce the alcohol in wine , and abolish the distinction between table and choice wine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish european commissioner for agriculture , mariann fischer boel the eu has a current annual wine budget of 1.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.4 billion -rrb- .
but up to 15 percent of european wine produced every year is simply thrown away or converted into industrial alcohol , and a third of the eu wine budget goes toward those ends . meanwhile , wine from other parts of the world is becoming more and more popular in europe - imports from south africa , for instance , have risen by 770 percent over the last decade .
consumption of domestic wines is declining by around .65 percent annually . wrath of grapes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industry groups say the reforms could raise the price of european wine the president of association of german wine producers , norbert weber , slammed the planned changes . " the commission has a completely inaccurate understanding of wine , " he said in an interview with german public television .
" it thinks of wine as a large industry and forgets family farming businesses . " in his organization 's official reaction , weber predicted that the proposed reforms would lead to " loss of income and significant economic disadvantages , especially in areas that produce high-quality wines where land is expensive . " weber also criticized eu plans to pay farmers some 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.36 billion -rrb- to uproot grape vines , objecting that farmers would be free to replant them as 2013 . fischer boel may have a hard time convincing agricultural ministers from the individual eu member states , especially the big wine producers , when they meeting to discuss the reforms this fall .

berlin officials prevented singer from filming at the so-called bendlerblock , the site where stauffenberg was executed after his failed attempt to assassinate the nazi leader in 1944 , claiming that it was because it was a memorial site .
singer was also prevented from filming at the police station and yard for precinct 52 in the city 's kreuzberg neighborhood after senior officers complained that this would obstruct the various departments working on the site .

steinbach also criticized henckel von donnersmarck for his article , in particular his description of von stauffenberg as a " superman " which could be misconstrued as a reference to the nazis ' desire to create a master race .
" henckel von donnersmarck should think seriously about the concepts he uses and which he so frivolously and irresponsibly puts out there in the world . "
the row over cruise 's beliefs took precedent in the location debate when defense minister franz josef jung made it clear that filmmakers could not shoot at any military sites as long as cruise plays von stauffenberg because of the hollywood actor 's link to scientology .

"
having cruise play count claus schenk von stauffenberg in director bryan singer ’ s film " valkyrie " would promote germany 's image " more than 10 soccer world cups , " henckel von donnersmarck wrote in a full-page article in the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
berlin officials prevented singer from filming at the so-called bendlerblock , the site where stauffenberg was executed after his failed attempt to assassinate the nazi leader in 1944 , claiming that it was because it was a memorial site .
singer was also prevented from filming at the police station and yard for precinct 52 in the city 's kreuzberg neighborhood after senior officers complained that this would obstruct the various departments working on the site .

steinbach also criticized henckel von donnersmarck for his article , in particular his description of von stauffenberg as a " superman " which could be misconstrued as a reference to the nazis ' desire to create a master race .
" henckel von donnersmarck should think seriously about the concepts he uses and which he so frivolously and irresponsibly puts out there in the world . "
the row over cruise 's beliefs took precedent in the location debate when defense minister franz josef jung made it clear that filmmakers could not shoot at any military sites as long as cruise plays von stauffenberg because of the hollywood actor 's link to scientology .
however , the german finance ministry , which oversees the locations and has the final word on such matters , said the filmmakers were welcome to film in germany - just not at the bendlerblock .
" they will not be permitted to film at the bendlerblock but this has nothing to do with -lrb- scientology -rrb- , " said finance ministry spokesman stefan olbermann .

but wine producers are already griping about the new grape proposals . the eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel of denmark announced the proposed reforms in brussels , saying they were needed to save taxpayers ' money and make european wines more competitive against rising global imports . fischer boel said her proposals would " reinvigorate the european wine sector and put it back where it belongs , that is , back on top of the world . " she added : " everybody recognizes that a profound reform of the wine sector is needed , so we have to bite the bullet and do what we think is the best solution for our producers and our consumers . " the reform plans include reducing the amount of land used for producing wine in europe from 3.6 million to 3.2 million hectares by 2012 .
the eu also wants to completely do away with subsidies for grape juice concentrate , which is used to produce the alcohol in wine , and abolish the distinction between table and choice wine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish european commissioner for agriculture , mariann fischer boel the eu has a current annual wine budget of 1.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.4 billion -rrb- .
but up to 15 percent of european wine produced every year is simply thrown away or converted into industrial alcohol , and a third of the eu wine budget goes toward those ends . meanwhile , wine from other parts of the world is becoming more and more popular in europe - imports from south africa , for instance , have risen by 770 percent over the last decade .
consumption of domestic wines is declining by around .65 percent annually . wrath of grapes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industry groups say the reforms could raise the price of european wine the president of association of german wine producers , norbert weber , slammed the planned changes . " the commission has a completely inaccurate understanding of wine , " he said in an interview with german public television .
" it thinks of wine as a large industry and forgets family farming businesses . " in his organization 's official reaction , weber predicted that the proposed reforms would lead to " loss of income and significant economic disadvantages , especially in areas that produce high-quality wines where land is expensive . " weber also criticized eu plans to pay farmers some 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.36 billion -rrb- to uproot grape vines , objecting that farmers would be free to replant them as 2013 . fischer boel may have a hard time convincing agricultural ministers from the individual eu member states , especially the big wine producers , when they meeting to discuss the reforms this fall .
and it probably wo n't help her cause that she comes from denmark - traditionally a beer-drinking country . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 04.07.2007 german court rules parliamentarians must report extra income großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians wo n't be able to hide extra income rejecting a challenge filed by a group of politicians , germany 's highest court ruled wednesday that parliamentarians must abide by tightened rules on transparency and disclose all private sources of income . german parliamentarians get a monthly salary of approximately 7,000 euros -lrb- $ 9,500 . -rrb-
but plenty of parliamentarians have extra money in their account at the end of the month from lucrative side jobs .
politicians will now have to report how much money they earn and where the extra money is coming from , germany 's federal constitutional court ruled on wednesday .
nine politicians from four leading german parties had challenged a regulation that took effect in january this year which requires all members of parliament to disclose all additional sources of income .
the constitutional court said that well-paid private sector jobs could seriously hamper mps ' independence and that the nation therefore " has a right to know " if parliamentary representatives earn money on the side . it added that in this instance , members of parliaments ' right to privacy was second to the public interest in transparency .
need for transparency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corruption is a concern the law on transparency were decided by the previous social democrat-green government in 2005 after an uproar in the country when it emerged that some politicians were making an additional tidy sum with lucrative jobs on the side .
some parliamentarians were on the payrolls of german corporations without seeming to do much to earn the extra incomes .
one high-profile politician was found to have accepted severance payments from an energy company which he had not even quit .
the revelations of these plum side jobs cost some politicians their jobs .
it also raised concerns in the country about possible corruption and a conflict of interest if politicians were closely connected to big companies .

nine politicians from four leading german parties had challenged a regulation that took effect in january this year which requires all members of parliament to disclose all additional sources of income .
the constitutional court said that well-paid private sector jobs could seriously hamper mps ' independence and that the nation therefore " has a right to know " if parliamentary representatives earn money on the side . it added that in this instance , members of parliaments ' right to privacy was second to the public interest in transparency .

one high-profile politician was found to have accepted severance payments from an energy company which he had not even quit .

the constitutional court said that well-paid private sector jobs could seriously hamper mps ' independence and that the nation therefore " has a right to know " if parliamentary representatives earn money on the side . it added that in this instance , members of parliaments ' right to privacy was second to the public interest in transparency .
need for transparency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corruption is a concern the law on transparency were decided by the previous social democrat-green government in 2005 after an uproar in the country when it emerged that some politicians were making an additional tidy sum with lucrative jobs on the side .
some parliamentarians were on the payrolls of german corporations without seeming to do much to earn the extra incomes .
one high-profile politician was found to have accepted severance payments from an energy company which he had not even quit .
the revelations of these plum side jobs cost some politicians their jobs .
it also raised concerns in the country about possible corruption and a conflict of interest if politicians were closely connected to big companies .
some also questioned why politicians , who are paid well in germany , needed to take up another job .
critics say parliament will be filled with civil servants the transparency law passed in 2005 also said that voters had a right to know where elected politicians worked on the side and how much they earned .
opponents of the law however argued that it infringed on the right of parliamentarians to be free to choose to practise their professions .
hans-joachim otto , a member of the opposition free-market liberal fdp party , was one of the plaintiffs in the case .
otto is an attorney and notary .
he and three other partners have an office in frankfurt .
otto said he did n't want to give up his job for politics .
having a job is the best way to maintain independence and bring real-life experience to politics , otto told dw-world .
friedrich merz , former head of the parliamentary group of chancellor merkel 's christian democratic party , warned that the parliament would be filled with civil servants and career politicians who would have little touch with real life in germany .
privacy concerns " we do n't need only more professional politicians but also more people with work experience and life experience and who are independent , " otto said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's highest court ruled side jobs must be disclosed he said the law threatened politicians ' independence .
an unintended consequence of the new law is that political life becomes unattractive for self-employed people and entrepreneurs .
heinrich kolb of the fdp was another of the plaintiffs .
he owns a metal business with his brother .
kolb was worried the law would force him to disclose too much about his business , which he considers invasive . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the stage was only a stone 's throw from , and well within earshot of , the other side of the berlin wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east berliners could only gaze from a distance and fume as had been the case the previous two nights , which had featured david bowie and eurythmics , some 2,000 east berliners headed to the border at the brandenburg gate to get a listen .

" a short time later , while in transit myself , i tried to find out what had happened and was interrogated at gunpoint by east german border guards .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 04.07.2007 ' 87 concert was a genesis of east german rebellion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 60,000 west berliners packed the square in front of the reichstag for bowie twenty years ago this summer , young east berliners clashed with police while trying to listen in on a rock concert in the west .
it was a sign that the gdr , which disapproved of such fun , would soon be history . it 's difficult to imagine in 2007 that phil collins was ever cool - much less that he might have played a small role in the fall of the berlin wall .
but then again , in 1987 , few would have dared predict that the end of communist east germany was nigh . on june 8 of that year , the band genesis - collins ' troop of art-rockers-turned-pop-stars - headlined the final night of the " concert for berlin , " a three-day open-air festival staged in front of the reichstag .
the stage was only a stone 's throw from , and well within earshot of , the other side of the berlin wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east berliners could only gaze from a distance and fume as had been the case the previous two nights , which had featured david bowie and eurythmics , some 2,000 east berliners headed to the border at the brandenburg gate to get a listen .
few got there . " the police had cordoned off the street at the russian embassy -lrb- about a quarter-mile from the wall -rrb- , " eyewitness tina krone said . " they kept arresting people , dragging them along the surface of the street .
it was like a horror movie .
we were enraged . " as many as 200 people were taken into custody in what amounted to a small pitched battle between the cops and the kids .
and the frustrated east berliners , as gleefully noted by west german media , began chanting " the wall must fall ! " and " gorby get us out ! " land of confusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wall could n't keep east germans from listening to western music the communist party leadership of the gdr had always feared that rock music would incite the country 's entertainment-starved youth to rebel .
confronted with the " concert for berlin , " the stern guardians of socialist morality were determined to keep young east berliners away from what they say as a decadent influence . olof pock , a picture editor for dw-world.de who was fifteen years old at the time , climbed up on an east berlin rooftop to listen to eurythmics . " at the end of the concert , the police began to herd people back from the wall , " pock remembered .
" they completely overreacted .
they were beating kids with billy clubs . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : by 1989 east germans could get all the genesis they wanted east berliners were well informed about the concert by the radio station that sponsored it , rias 2 .
rias , which stood for radio in the american sector , convinced the musicians , despite the possibility of home taping , to allow the shows to be simulcast to all parts of the divided city . " the mood was one of enjoying forbidden fruit , " pock said .
" we knew that this was somehow being done for our benefit . " the west was very aware how hungry east german kids were for popular music from their capitalist " enemies . "
rias 2 had been specially formed as a music-oriented station broadcasting to all of berlin and the surrounding area . sweet dreams are made of this bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these aging english gentlemen played a role in cold war history so was the reichstag concert a conscious act of provocation ?
were some of the loudspeakers , as would later be alleged , aimed directly across the wall ? christoph lanz , today managing director of dw-tv , was deputy head of programming at rias 2 and the emcee at the concerts .
he says they were not . " i would have seen them , if they were , " lanz said .
" we were surprised when we heard about the reaction in the east .
i mean , we rocked the gdr ! " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gdr border guards killed some 190 people who tried to flee to the west but what people could see on or in front of the stage did n't tell the whole story .
peter schwenkow , the promoter and producer of the concert , says that at least a quarter of the speakers were indeed pointed at the eastern part of the city - as an act of revenge . " in 1977 , some crew members of tina turner were killed while in transit through east germany , " schwenkow said .
" a short time later , while in transit myself , i tried to find out what had happened and was interrogated at gunpoint by east german border guards .
ever since then i could n't stand those guys .
holding a show at the reichstag was an attempt to provoke them .
it was great fun . " both lanz and schwenkow look back with obvious pride and nostalgia on an event that called forth resentment and resistance to a repressive state . " on the afternoon before the genesis concert , i visited a friend of mine in east berlin , " lanz recalled .
" when it was time for me to leave , he said with teary eyes how much he wished he could go with me .
all he wanted to do was go hear a concert .
i still get goose bumps when i think of that . " ch-ch-ch-changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bowie , a former berlin resident , maintained close ties to the city in the wake of the concert , the gdr realized it had made a mistake . " it was the nervous reaction of a one-party state that was in over its head , " said rainer börner , an east berlin music producer and cultural secretary for the gdr 's main youth organization .
" some of us realized we had to increase what we were offering . " in 1989 bruce springsteen was booked to play a gig in east berlin - after organizers found a location far enough away form the wall to assuage fears that the music might inspire concert-goers to try to flee the gdr en masse .
but it was too little , too late . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today remnants of the wall have become places to chill " we saw what had happened in 1987 on western tv , " börner remembered .
" it just increased our frustration that we were n't allowed to do what we wanted . " " it was one stone in a whole mosaic , " concurred pock . on november 9 , 1989 , masses of east germans did precisely what the gdr leadership had feared they would be incited to do by the music of genesis .

some believe the number of terrorists with no formal training will rise . what does it mean that a group of doctors - recent immigrants to europe from different nations who seem to have had little prior contact with established terror networks - came together to plot a bombing ?
and was the failure of their bombs to detonate purely a blessing , or a signal that bombings in europe might become more frequent , now that it 's catching on among the untrained ?
the attacks in britain , when set alongside the recent rise in islamist activity in north africa and recent arrests of terrorist sympathizers in spain and germany can only mean one thing , says claude moniquet , chairman of the european strategic intelligence and security centre , a think tank in brussels .
" the al qaeda groups are trying to open a new jihad .
mostly there are two jihads - one in afghanistan and another in iraq .
they are trying to open a new one in … europe . "
details about the men in custody continue to come in , but to call plots like this one in britain as having a hard " link to al qaeda " might be premature .
at any rate , analysts say many recent terror plotters have had no formal training from al qaeda-proper in weaponry or logistics . advent of the ' do-it-yourself ' jihadists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the failed suitcase bombs found in germany last year they are simply very angry people who are inspired by the violent actions they 've seen carried out by al qaeda and others and are desperate to get in on the act , even if they do n't quite know how , says julianne smith , director of the europe program and the transatlantic dialogue on terrorism at the center for strategic and international studies in washington .
" i think it just shows the continuing evolution , that we 've gone from a highly trained set of individuals , to people who appear to have had some limited training to groups that appear not to know what they ’ re really doing whatsoever , " she says .
that these men 's bombs , like those of the so-called suitcase bombers who targeted german train stations last summer , failed to go off is a blessing .

and while claude moniquet emphasized that britain ’ s participation in the iraq war and germany ’ s involvement in afghanistan mean the two countries are particularly vulnerable , all of europe is a potential target for terrorists .
" it 's important to understand that for the jihadis , they do n't make a lot of distinctions between the countries , " moniquet says .

some believe the number of terrorists with no formal training will rise . what does it mean that a group of doctors - recent immigrants to europe from different nations who seem to have had little prior contact with established terror networks - came together to plot a bombing ?
and was the failure of their bombs to detonate purely a blessing , or a signal that bombings in europe might become more frequent , now that it 's catching on among the untrained ?
the attacks in britain , when set alongside the recent rise in islamist activity in north africa and recent arrests of terrorist sympathizers in spain and germany can only mean one thing , says claude moniquet , chairman of the european strategic intelligence and security centre , a think tank in brussels .
" the al qaeda groups are trying to open a new jihad .
mostly there are two jihads - one in afghanistan and another in iraq .

details about the men in custody continue to come in , but to call plots like this one in britain as having a hard " link to al qaeda " might be premature .

" i think it just shows the continuing evolution , that we 've gone from a highly trained set of individuals , to people who appear to have had some limited training to groups that appear not to know what they ’ re really doing whatsoever , " she says .
that these men 's bombs , like those of the so-called suitcase bombers who targeted german train stations last summer , failed to go off is a blessing .
but it may mean that in the long term europe could be facing more bombs from more bombers , expert and inept .

" you may be confused on how to find the individuals you would need to find , you may not want to sign up for the broader al qaeda movement , but what you 're going to do is find the information you need to get the job done , essentially on the internet . "
and while claude moniquet emphasized that britain ’ s participation in the iraq war and germany ’ s involvement in afghanistan mean the two countries are particularly vulnerable , all of europe is a potential target for terrorists .
" it 's important to understand that for the jihadis , they do n't make a lot of distinctions between the countries , " moniquet says .
" all the so-called western world is a target , for one very simple reason : they absolutely hate the way we live .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 04.07.2007 ' 87 concert was a genesis of east german rebellion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 60,000 west berliners packed the square in front of the reichstag for bowie twenty years ago this summer , young east berliners clashed with police while trying to listen in on a rock concert in the west .
it was a sign that the gdr , which disapproved of such fun , would soon be history . it 's difficult to imagine in 2007 that phil collins was ever cool - much less that he might have played a small role in the fall of the berlin wall .
but then again , in 1987 , few would have dared predict that the end of communist east germany was nigh . on june 8 of that year , the band genesis - collins ' troop of art-rockers-turned-pop-stars - headlined the final night of the " concert for berlin , " a three-day open-air festival staged in front of the reichstag .
the stage was only a stone 's throw from , and well within earshot of , the other side of the berlin wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east berliners could only gaze from a distance and fume as had been the case the previous two nights , which had featured david bowie and eurythmics , some 2,000 east berliners headed to the border at the brandenburg gate to get a listen .
few got there . " the police had cordoned off the street at the russian embassy -lrb- about a quarter-mile from the wall -rrb- , " eyewitness tina krone said . " they kept arresting people , dragging them along the surface of the street .
it was like a horror movie .
we were enraged . " as many as 200 people were taken into custody in what amounted to a small pitched battle between the cops and the kids .
and the frustrated east berliners , as gleefully noted by west german media , began chanting " the wall must fall ! " and " gorby get us out ! " land of confusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wall could n't keep east germans from listening to western music the communist party leadership of the gdr had always feared that rock music would incite the country 's entertainment-starved youth to rebel .
confronted with the " concert for berlin , " the stern guardians of socialist morality were determined to keep young east berliners away from what they say as a decadent influence . olof pock , a picture editor for dw-world.de who was fifteen years old at the time , climbed up on an east berlin rooftop to listen to eurythmics . " at the end of the concert , the police began to herd people back from the wall , " pock remembered .
" they completely overreacted .
they were beating kids with billy clubs . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : by 1989 east germans could get all the genesis they wanted east berliners were well informed about the concert by the radio station that sponsored it , rias 2 .
rias , which stood for radio in the american sector , convinced the musicians , despite the possibility of home taping , to allow the shows to be simulcast to all parts of the divided city . " the mood was one of enjoying forbidden fruit , " pock said .
" we knew that this was somehow being done for our benefit . " the west was very aware how hungry east german kids were for popular music from their capitalist " enemies . "
rias 2 had been specially formed as a music-oriented station broadcasting to all of berlin and the surrounding area . sweet dreams are made of this bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these aging english gentlemen played a role in cold war history so was the reichstag concert a conscious act of provocation ?
were some of the loudspeakers , as would later be alleged , aimed directly across the wall ? christoph lanz , today managing director of dw-tv , was deputy head of programming at rias 2 and the emcee at the concerts .
he says they were not . " i would have seen them , if they were , " lanz said .
" we were surprised when we heard about the reaction in the east .
i mean , we rocked the gdr ! " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gdr border guards killed some 190 people who tried to flee to the west but what people could see on or in front of the stage did n't tell the whole story .
peter schwenkow , the promoter and producer of the concert , says that at least a quarter of the speakers were indeed pointed at the eastern part of the city - as an act of revenge . " in 1977 , some crew members of tina turner were killed while in transit through east germany , " schwenkow said .
" a short time later , while in transit myself , i tried to find out what had happened and was interrogated at gunpoint by east german border guards .
ever since then i could n't stand those guys .
holding a show at the reichstag was an attempt to provoke them .
it was great fun . " both lanz and schwenkow look back with obvious pride and nostalgia on an event that called forth resentment and resistance to a repressive state . " on the afternoon before the genesis concert , i visited a friend of mine in east berlin , " lanz recalled .
" when it was time for me to leave , he said with teary eyes how much he wished he could go with me .
all he wanted to do was go hear a concert .
i still get goose bumps when i think of that . " ch-ch-ch-changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bowie , a former berlin resident , maintained close ties to the city in the wake of the concert , the gdr realized it had made a mistake . " it was the nervous reaction of a one-party state that was in over its head , " said rainer börner , an east berlin music producer and cultural secretary for the gdr 's main youth organization .
" some of us realized we had to increase what we were offering . " in 1989 bruce springsteen was booked to play a gig in east berlin - after organizers found a location far enough away form the wall to assuage fears that the music might inspire concert-goers to try to flee the gdr en masse .
but it was too little , too late . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today remnants of the wall have become places to chill " we saw what had happened in 1987 on western tv , " börner remembered .
" it just increased our frustration that we were n't allowed to do what we wanted . " " it was one stone in a whole mosaic , " concurred pock . on november 9 , 1989 , masses of east germans did precisely what the gdr leadership had feared they would be incited to do by the music of genesis .
they headed to the wall to cross a border that was soon to be history . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 04.07.2007 ' 87 concert was a genesis of east german rebellion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 60,000 west berliners packed the square in front of the reichstag for bowie twenty years ago this summer , young east berliners clashed with police while trying to listen in on a rock concert in the west .
it was a sign that the gdr , which disapproved of such fun , would soon be history . it 's difficult to imagine in 2007 that phil collins was ever cool - much less that he might have played a small role in the fall of the berlin wall .
but then again , in 1987 , few would have dared predict that the end of communist east germany was nigh . on june 8 of that year , the band genesis - collins ' troop of art-rockers-turned-pop-stars - headlined the final night of the " concert for berlin , " a three-day open-air festival staged in front of the reichstag .
the stage was only a stone 's throw from , and well within earshot of , the other side of the berlin wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east berliners could only gaze from a distance and fume as had been the case the previous two nights , which had featured david bowie and eurythmics , some 2,000 east berliners headed to the border at the brandenburg gate to get a listen .
few got there . " the police had cordoned off the street at the russian embassy -lrb- about a quarter-mile from the wall -rrb- , " eyewitness tina krone said . " they kept arresting people , dragging them along the surface of the street .
it was like a horror movie .
we were enraged . " as many as 200 people were taken into custody in what amounted to a small pitched battle between the cops and the kids .
and the frustrated east berliners , as gleefully noted by west german media , began chanting " the wall must fall ! " and " gorby get us out ! " land of confusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wall could n't keep east germans from listening to western music the communist party leadership of the gdr had always feared that rock music would incite the country 's entertainment-starved youth to rebel .
confronted with the " concert for berlin , " the stern guardians of socialist morality were determined to keep young east berliners away from what they say as a decadent influence . olof pock , a picture editor for dw-world.de who was fifteen years old at the time , climbed up on an east berlin rooftop to listen to eurythmics . " at the end of the concert , the police began to herd people back from the wall , " pock remembered .
" they completely overreacted .
they were beating kids with billy clubs . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : by 1989 east germans could get all the genesis they wanted east berliners were well informed about the concert by the radio station that sponsored it , rias 2 .
rias , which stood for radio in the american sector , convinced the musicians , despite the possibility of home taping , to allow the shows to be simulcast to all parts of the divided city . " the mood was one of enjoying forbidden fruit , " pock said .
" we knew that this was somehow being done for our benefit . " the west was very aware how hungry east german kids were for popular music from their capitalist " enemies . "
rias 2 had been specially formed as a music-oriented station broadcasting to all of berlin and the surrounding area . sweet dreams are made of this bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these aging english gentlemen played a role in cold war history so was the reichstag concert a conscious act of provocation ?
were some of the loudspeakers , as would later be alleged , aimed directly across the wall ? christoph lanz , today managing director of dw-tv , was deputy head of programming at rias 2 and the emcee at the concerts .
he says they were not . " i would have seen them , if they were , " lanz said .
" we were surprised when we heard about the reaction in the east .
i mean , we rocked the gdr ! " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gdr border guards killed some 190 people who tried to flee to the west but what people could see on or in front of the stage did n't tell the whole story .
peter schwenkow , the promoter and producer of the concert , says that at least a quarter of the speakers were indeed pointed at the eastern part of the city - as an act of revenge . " in 1977 , some crew members of tina turner were killed while in transit through east germany , " schwenkow said .
" a short time later , while in transit myself , i tried to find out what had happened and was interrogated at gunpoint by east german border guards .
ever since then i could n't stand those guys .
holding a show at the reichstag was an attempt to provoke them .
it was great fun . " both lanz and schwenkow look back with obvious pride and nostalgia on an event that called forth resentment and resistance to a repressive state . " on the afternoon before the genesis concert , i visited a friend of mine in east berlin , " lanz recalled .
" when it was time for me to leave , he said with teary eyes how much he wished he could go with me .
all he wanted to do was go hear a concert .
i still get goose bumps when i think of that . " ch-ch-ch-changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bowie , a former berlin resident , maintained close ties to the city in the wake of the concert , the gdr realized it had made a mistake . " it was the nervous reaction of a one-party state that was in over its head , " said rainer börner , an east berlin music producer and cultural secretary for the gdr 's main youth organization .
" some of us realized we had to increase what we were offering . " in 1989 bruce springsteen was booked to play a gig in east berlin - after organizers found a location far enough away form the wall to assuage fears that the music might inspire concert-goers to try to flee the gdr en masse .
but it was too little , too late . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today remnants of the wall have become places to chill " we saw what had happened in 1987 on western tv , " börner remembered .
" it just increased our frustration that we were n't allowed to do what we wanted . " " it was one stone in a whole mosaic , " concurred pock . on november 9 , 1989 , masses of east germans did precisely what the gdr leadership had feared they would be incited to do by the music of genesis .
they headed to the wall to cross a border that was soon to be history . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was a sign that the gdr , which disapproved of such fun , would soon be history . it 's difficult to imagine in 2007 that phil collins was ever cool - much less that he might have played a small role in the fall of the berlin wall .
but then again , in 1987 , few would have dared predict that the end of communist east germany was nigh . on june 8 of that year , the band genesis - collins ' troop of art-rockers-turned-pop-stars - headlined the final night of the " concert for berlin , " a three-day open-air festival staged in front of the reichstag .
the stage was only a stone 's throw from , and well within earshot of , the other side of the berlin wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east berliners could only gaze from a distance and fume as had been the case the previous two nights , which had featured david bowie and eurythmics , some 2,000 east berliners headed to the border at the brandenburg gate to get a listen .
few got there . " the police had cordoned off the street at the russian embassy -lrb- about a quarter-mile from the wall -rrb- , " eyewitness tina krone said . " they kept arresting people , dragging them along the surface of the street .
it was like a horror movie .
we were enraged . " as many as 200 people were taken into custody in what amounted to a small pitched battle between the cops and the kids .
and the frustrated east berliners , as gleefully noted by west german media , began chanting " the wall must fall ! " and " gorby get us out ! " land of confusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wall could n't keep east germans from listening to western music the communist party leadership of the gdr had always feared that rock music would incite the country 's entertainment-starved youth to rebel .
confronted with the " concert for berlin , " the stern guardians of socialist morality were determined to keep young east berliners away from what they say as a decadent influence . olof pock , a picture editor for dw-world.de who was fifteen years old at the time , climbed up on an east berlin rooftop to listen to eurythmics . " at the end of the concert , the police began to herd people back from the wall , " pock remembered .
" they completely overreacted .
they were beating kids with billy clubs . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : by 1989 east germans could get all the genesis they wanted east berliners were well informed about the concert by the radio station that sponsored it , rias 2 .
rias , which stood for radio in the american sector , convinced the musicians , despite the possibility of home taping , to allow the shows to be simulcast to all parts of the divided city . " the mood was one of enjoying forbidden fruit , " pock said .
" we knew that this was somehow being done for our benefit . " the west was very aware how hungry east german kids were for popular music from their capitalist " enemies . "
rias 2 had been specially formed as a music-oriented station broadcasting to all of berlin and the surrounding area . sweet dreams are made of this bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these aging english gentlemen played a role in cold war history so was the reichstag concert a conscious act of provocation ?
were some of the loudspeakers , as would later be alleged , aimed directly across the wall ? christoph lanz , today managing director of dw-tv , was deputy head of programming at rias 2 and the emcee at the concerts .
he says they were not . " i would have seen them , if they were , " lanz said .
" we were surprised when we heard about the reaction in the east .
i mean , we rocked the gdr ! " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gdr border guards killed some 190 people who tried to flee to the west but what people could see on or in front of the stage did n't tell the whole story .
peter schwenkow , the promoter and producer of the concert , says that at least a quarter of the speakers were indeed pointed at the eastern part of the city - as an act of revenge . " in 1977 , some crew members of tina turner were killed while in transit through east germany , " schwenkow said .
" a short time later , while in transit myself , i tried to find out what had happened and was interrogated at gunpoint by east german border guards .
ever since then i could n't stand those guys .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 04.07.2007 german court rules parliamentarians must report extra income großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians wo n't be able to hide extra income rejecting a challenge filed by a group of politicians , germany 's highest court ruled wednesday that parliamentarians must abide by tightened rules on transparency and disclose all private sources of income . german parliamentarians get a monthly salary of approximately 7,000 euros -lrb- $ 9,500 . -rrb-
but plenty of parliamentarians have extra money in their account at the end of the month from lucrative side jobs .
politicians will now have to report how much money they earn and where the extra money is coming from , germany 's federal constitutional court ruled on wednesday .
nine politicians from four leading german parties had challenged a regulation that took effect in january this year which requires all members of parliament to disclose all additional sources of income .
the constitutional court said that well-paid private sector jobs could seriously hamper mps ' independence and that the nation therefore " has a right to know " if parliamentary representatives earn money on the side . it added that in this instance , members of parliaments ' right to privacy was second to the public interest in transparency .
need for transparency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corruption is a concern the law on transparency were decided by the previous social democrat-green government in 2005 after an uproar in the country when it emerged that some politicians were making an additional tidy sum with lucrative jobs on the side .
some parliamentarians were on the payrolls of german corporations without seeming to do much to earn the extra incomes .
one high-profile politician was found to have accepted severance payments from an energy company which he had not even quit .
the revelations of these plum side jobs cost some politicians their jobs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 04.07.2007 experts reassess changing face of europe 's terror threat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ever-changing face of terrorism is proving a constant challenge to law enforcement as details emerge about the suspects arrested in the car bombing plots in great britain , analysts are reassessing the terror threat against europe .
some believe the number of terrorists with no formal training will rise . what does it mean that a group of doctors - recent immigrants to europe from different nations who seem to have had little prior contact with established terror networks - came together to plot a bombing ?
and was the failure of their bombs to detonate purely a blessing , or a signal that bombings in europe might become more frequent , now that it 's catching on among the untrained ?
the attacks in britain , when set alongside the recent rise in islamist activity in north africa and recent arrests of terrorist sympathizers in spain and germany can only mean one thing , says claude moniquet , chairman of the european strategic intelligence and security centre , a think tank in brussels .
" the al qaeda groups are trying to open a new jihad .
mostly there are two jihads - one in afghanistan and another in iraq .
they are trying to open a new one in … europe . "
details about the men in custody continue to come in , but to call plots like this one in britain as having a hard " link to al qaeda " might be premature .
at any rate , analysts say many recent terror plotters have had no formal training from al qaeda-proper in weaponry or logistics . advent of the ' do-it-yourself ' jihadists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the failed suitcase bombs found in germany last year they are simply very angry people who are inspired by the violent actions they 've seen carried out by al qaeda and others and are desperate to get in on the act , even if they do n't quite know how , says julianne smith , director of the europe program and the transatlantic dialogue on terrorism at the center for strategic and international studies in washington .
" i think it just shows the continuing evolution , that we 've gone from a highly trained set of individuals , to people who appear to have had some limited training to groups that appear not to know what they ’ re really doing whatsoever , " she says .
that these men 's bombs , like those of the so-called suitcase bombers who targeted german train stations last summer , failed to go off is a blessing .
but it may mean that in the long term europe could be facing more bombs from more bombers , expert and inept .
the desire to kill seems to be there , as does rudimentary information about building explosive devices .
internet coaching breeding new terrorists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet removes the need to attend training camps " as a potential bomber , you may not want to take the risk of traveling to the middle east , " says smith .
" you may be confused on how to find the individuals you would need to find , you may not want to sign up for the broader al qaeda movement , but what you 're going to do is find the information you need to get the job done , essentially on the internet . "
and while claude moniquet emphasized that britain ’ s participation in the iraq war and germany ’ s involvement in afghanistan mean the two countries are particularly vulnerable , all of europe is a potential target for terrorists .
" it 's important to understand that for the jihadis , they do n't make a lot of distinctions between the countries , " moniquet says .
" all the so-called western world is a target , for one very simple reason : they absolutely hate the way we live .
they hate democracy and they hate equality between women and men .
there are a lot of reasons for them to try and fight europe . "
the expanding body of evidence implies that anyone in any profession could be part of a sleeper cell intent on death and destruction in europe . no blueprint for modern terrorist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terror suspect mohammed asha raised few suspicions among the eight suspects arrested so far in the british investigation , at least six are doctors , including a jordanian surgeon and an iraqi physician .
an indian doctor is also being held in australia in connection with the london and glasgow attempted bombings after trying to flee the country with a one-way ticket to india .
none of those being held are british citizens , but the surprise has been evident that such well-educated and well-situated people , who once as doctors took an oath to help those in need , could take another oath to kill .
addressing the issue of the suspect 's backgrounds , the former head of the british government 's joint intelligence committee , pauline neville-jones , said recently that , essentially , anything now seems possible .
" it means obviously that you ca n't make any assumptions or have any preconceptions about the kind of people who might become terrorists .

some believe the number of terrorists with no formal training will rise . what does it mean that a group of doctors - recent immigrants to europe from different nations who seem to have had little prior contact with established terror networks - came together to plot a bombing ?
and was the failure of their bombs to detonate purely a blessing , or a signal that bombings in europe might become more frequent , now that it 's catching on among the untrained ?
the attacks in britain , when set alongside the recent rise in islamist activity in north africa and recent arrests of terrorist sympathizers in spain and germany can only mean one thing , says claude moniquet , chairman of the european strategic intelligence and security centre , a think tank in brussels .
" the al qaeda groups are trying to open a new jihad .
mostly there are two jihads - one in afghanistan and another in iraq .
they are trying to open a new one in … europe . "
details about the men in custody continue to come in , but to call plots like this one in britain as having a hard " link to al qaeda " might be premature .

" i think it just shows the continuing evolution , that we 've gone from a highly trained set of individuals , to people who appear to have had some limited training to groups that appear not to know what they ’ re really doing whatsoever , " she says .
that these men 's bombs , like those of the so-called suitcase bombers who targeted german train stations last summer , failed to go off is a blessing .
but it may mean that in the long term europe could be facing more bombs from more bombers , expert and inept .
the desire to kill seems to be there , as does rudimentary information about building explosive devices .

and while claude moniquet emphasized that britain ’ s participation in the iraq war and germany ’ s involvement in afghanistan mean the two countries are particularly vulnerable , all of europe is a potential target for terrorists .
" it 's important to understand that for the jihadis , they do n't make a lot of distinctions between the countries , " moniquet says .
" all the so-called western world is a target , for one very simple reason : they absolutely hate the way we live .

berlin officials prevented singer from filming at the so-called bendlerblock , the site where stauffenberg was executed after his failed attempt to assassinate the nazi leader in 1944 , claiming that it was because it was a memorial site .

the row over cruise 's beliefs took precedent in the location debate when defense minister franz josef jung made it clear that filmmakers could not shoot at any military sites as long as cruise plays von stauffenberg because of the hollywood actor 's link to scientology .
however , the german finance ministry , which oversees the locations and has the final word on such matters , said the filmmakers were welcome to film in germany - just not at the bendlerblock .

" the reform plans include reducing the amount of land used for producing wine in europe from 3.6 million to 3.2 million hectares by 2012 .
the eu also wants to completely do away with subsidies for grape juice concentrate , which is used to produce the alcohol in wine , and abolish the distinction between table and choice wine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish european commissioner for agriculture , mariann fischer boel the eu has a current annual wine budget of 1.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.4 billion -rrb- .
but up to 15 percent of european wine produced every year is simply thrown away or converted into industrial alcohol , and a third of the eu wine budget goes toward those ends . meanwhile , wine from other parts of the world is becoming more and more popular in europe - imports from south africa , for instance , have risen by 770 percent over the last decade .
consumption of domestic wines is declining by around .65 percent annually . wrath of grapes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industry groups say the reforms could raise the price of european wine the president of association of german wine producers , norbert weber , slammed the planned changes . " the commission has a completely inaccurate understanding of wine , " he said in an interview with german public television .
" it thinks of wine as a large industry and forgets family farming businesses . " in his organization 's official reaction , weber predicted that the proposed reforms would lead to " loss of income and significant economic disadvantages , especially in areas that produce high-quality wines where land is expensive . " weber also criticized eu plans to pay farmers some 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.36 billion -rrb- to uproot grape vines , objecting that farmers would be free to replant them as 2013 . fischer boel may have a hard time convincing agricultural ministers from the individual eu member states , especially the big wine producers , when they meeting to discuss the reforms this fall .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 04.07.2007 experts reassess changing face of europe 's terror threat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ever-changing face of terrorism is proving a constant challenge to law enforcement as details emerge about the suspects arrested in the car bombing plots in great britain , analysts are reassessing the terror threat against europe .
some believe the number of terrorists with no formal training will rise . what does it mean that a group of doctors - recent immigrants to europe from different nations who seem to have had little prior contact with established terror networks - came together to plot a bombing ?
and was the failure of their bombs to detonate purely a blessing , or a signal that bombings in europe might become more frequent , now that it 's catching on among the untrained ?
the attacks in britain , when set alongside the recent rise in islamist activity in north africa and recent arrests of terrorist sympathizers in spain and germany can only mean one thing , says claude moniquet , chairman of the european strategic intelligence and security centre , a think tank in brussels .
" the al qaeda groups are trying to open a new jihad .
mostly there are two jihads - one in afghanistan and another in iraq .
they are trying to open a new one in … europe . "
details about the men in custody continue to come in , but to call plots like this one in britain as having a hard " link to al qaeda " might be premature .
at any rate , analysts say many recent terror plotters have had no formal training from al qaeda-proper in weaponry or logistics . advent of the ' do-it-yourself ' jihadists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the failed suitcase bombs found in germany last year they are simply very angry people who are inspired by the violent actions they 've seen carried out by al qaeda and others and are desperate to get in on the act , even if they do n't quite know how , says julianne smith , director of the europe program and the transatlantic dialogue on terrorism at the center for strategic and international studies in washington .
" i think it just shows the continuing evolution , that we 've gone from a highly trained set of individuals , to people who appear to have had some limited training to groups that appear not to know what they ’ re really doing whatsoever , " she says .
that these men 's bombs , like those of the so-called suitcase bombers who targeted german train stations last summer , failed to go off is a blessing .
but it may mean that in the long term europe could be facing more bombs from more bombers , expert and inept .
the desire to kill seems to be there , as does rudimentary information about building explosive devices .
internet coaching breeding new terrorists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet removes the need to attend training camps " as a potential bomber , you may not want to take the risk of traveling to the middle east , " says smith .
" you may be confused on how to find the individuals you would need to find , you may not want to sign up for the broader al qaeda movement , but what you 're going to do is find the information you need to get the job done , essentially on the internet . "
and while claude moniquet emphasized that britain ’ s participation in the iraq war and germany ’ s involvement in afghanistan mean the two countries are particularly vulnerable , all of europe is a potential target for terrorists .
" it 's important to understand that for the jihadis , they do n't make a lot of distinctions between the countries , " moniquet says .
" all the so-called western world is a target , for one very simple reason : they absolutely hate the way we live .
they hate democracy and they hate equality between women and men .
there are a lot of reasons for them to try and fight europe . "
the expanding body of evidence implies that anyone in any profession could be part of a sleeper cell intent on death and destruction in europe . no blueprint for modern terrorist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terror suspect mohammed asha raised few suspicions among the eight suspects arrested so far in the british investigation , at least six are doctors , including a jordanian surgeon and an iraqi physician .
an indian doctor is also being held in australia in connection with the london and glasgow attempted bombings after trying to flee the country with a one-way ticket to india .
none of those being held are british citizens , but the surprise has been evident that such well-educated and well-situated people , who once as doctors took an oath to help those in need , could take another oath to kill .
addressing the issue of the suspect 's backgrounds , the former head of the british government 's joint intelligence committee , pauline neville-jones , said recently that , essentially , anything now seems possible .
" it means obviously that you ca n't make any assumptions or have any preconceptions about the kind of people who might become terrorists .

but wine producers are already griping about the new grape proposals . the eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel of denmark announced the proposed reforms in brussels , saying they were needed to save taxpayers ' money and make european wines more competitive against rising global imports . fischer boel said her proposals would " reinvigorate the european wine sector and put it back where it belongs , that is , back on top of the world .

some believe the number of terrorists with no formal training will rise . what does it mean that a group of doctors - recent immigrants to europe from different nations who seem to have had little prior contact with established terror networks - came together to plot a bombing ?
and was the failure of their bombs to detonate purely a blessing , or a signal that bombings in europe might become more frequent , now that it 's catching on among the untrained ?
the attacks in britain , when set alongside the recent rise in islamist activity in north africa and recent arrests of terrorist sympathizers in spain and germany can only mean one thing , says claude moniquet , chairman of the european strategic intelligence and security centre , a think tank in brussels .
" the al qaeda groups are trying to open a new jihad .
mostly there are two jihads - one in afghanistan and another in iraq .
they are trying to open a new one in … europe . "
details about the men in custody continue to come in , but to call plots like this one in britain as having a hard " link to al qaeda " might be premature .
at any rate , analysts say many recent terror plotters have had no formal training from al qaeda-proper in weaponry or logistics . advent of the ' do-it-yourself ' jihadists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the failed suitcase bombs found in germany last year they are simply very angry people who are inspired by the violent actions they 've seen carried out by al qaeda and others and are desperate to get in on the act , even if they do n't quite know how , says julianne smith , director of the europe program and the transatlantic dialogue on terrorism at the center for strategic and international studies in washington .
" i think it just shows the continuing evolution , that we 've gone from a highly trained set of individuals , to people who appear to have had some limited training to groups that appear not to know what they ’ re really doing whatsoever , " she says .
that these men 's bombs , like those of the so-called suitcase bombers who targeted german train stations last summer , failed to go off is a blessing .
but it may mean that in the long term europe could be facing more bombs from more bombers , expert and inept .
the desire to kill seems to be there , as does rudimentary information about building explosive devices .
internet coaching breeding new terrorists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet removes the need to attend training camps " as a potential bomber , you may not want to take the risk of traveling to the middle east , " says smith .
" you may be confused on how to find the individuals you would need to find , you may not want to sign up for the broader al qaeda movement , but what you 're going to do is find the information you need to get the job done , essentially on the internet . "
and while claude moniquet emphasized that britain ’ s participation in the iraq war and germany ’ s involvement in afghanistan mean the two countries are particularly vulnerable , all of europe is a potential target for terrorists .
" it 's important to understand that for the jihadis , they do n't make a lot of distinctions between the countries , " moniquet says .
" all the so-called western world is a target , for one very simple reason : they absolutely hate the way we live .
they hate democracy and they hate equality between women and men .
there are a lot of reasons for them to try and fight europe . "
the expanding body of evidence implies that anyone in any profession could be part of a sleeper cell intent on death and destruction in europe . no blueprint for modern terrorist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terror suspect mohammed asha raised few suspicions among the eight suspects arrested so far in the british investigation , at least six are doctors , including a jordanian surgeon and an iraqi physician .
an indian doctor is also being held in australia in connection with the london and glasgow attempted bombings after trying to flee the country with a one-way ticket to india .
none of those being held are british citizens , but the surprise has been evident that such well-educated and well-situated people , who once as doctors took an oath to help those in need , could take another oath to kill .
addressing the issue of the suspect 's backgrounds , the former head of the british government 's joint intelligence committee , pauline neville-jones , said recently that , essentially , anything now seems possible .
" it means obviously that you ca n't make any assumptions or have any preconceptions about the kind of people who might become terrorists .

but wine producers are already griping about the new grape proposals . the eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel of denmark announced the proposed reforms in brussels , saying they were needed to save taxpayers ' money and make european wines more competitive against rising global imports . fischer boel said her proposals would " reinvigorate the european wine sector and put it back where it belongs , that is , back on top of the world . " she added : " everybody recognizes that a profound reform of the wine sector is needed , so we have to bite the bullet and do what we think is the best solution for our producers and our consumers . " the reform plans include reducing the amount of land used for producing wine in europe from 3.6 million to 3.2 million hectares by 2012 .
the eu also wants to completely do away with subsidies for grape juice concentrate , which is used to produce the alcohol in wine , and abolish the distinction between table and choice wine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish european commissioner for agriculture , mariann fischer boel the eu has a current annual wine budget of 1.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.4 billion -rrb- .
but up to 15 percent of european wine produced every year is simply thrown away or converted into industrial alcohol , and a third of the eu wine budget goes toward those ends . meanwhile , wine from other parts of the world is becoming more and more popular in europe - imports from south africa , for instance , have risen by 770 percent over the last decade .
consumption of domestic wines is declining by around .65 percent annually . wrath of grapes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industry groups say the reforms could raise the price of european wine the president of association of german wine producers , norbert weber , slammed the planned changes . " the commission has a completely inaccurate understanding of wine , " he said in an interview with german public television .
" it thinks of wine as a large industry and forgets family farming businesses . " in his organization 's official reaction , weber predicted that the proposed reforms would lead to " loss of income and significant economic disadvantages , especially in areas that produce high-quality wines where land is expensive . " weber also criticized eu plans to pay farmers some 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.36 billion -rrb- to uproot grape vines , objecting that farmers would be free to replant them as 2013 . fischer boel may have a hard time convincing agricultural ministers from the individual eu member states , especially the big wine producers , when they meeting to discuss the reforms this fall .

"
having cruise play count claus schenk von stauffenberg in director bryan singer ’ s film " valkyrie " would promote germany 's image " more than 10 soccer world cups , " henckel von donnersmarck wrote in a full-page article in the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
berlin officials prevented singer from filming at the so-called bendlerblock , the site where stauffenberg was executed after his failed attempt to assassinate the nazi leader in 1944 , claiming that it was because it was a memorial site .
singer was also prevented from filming at the police station and yard for precinct 52 in the city 's kreuzberg neighborhood after senior officers complained that this would obstruct the various departments working on the site .
officials deny scientology claim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tom cruise plays count von stauffenberg in the film while some german politicians have said that cruise , 44 , is unwelcome because of his involvement with the church of scientology , officials have said that the decision to prevent filming at the bendlerblock , now part of the defense ministry , was unconnected with the star 's beliefs and was based purely on the disruption it would cause .
but in his article , henckel von donnersmarck accused german officials who had publicly raised concerns about cruise 's involvement with scientology of making the country appear intolerant .
" if stauffenberg and his consorts were considered un-german traitors to the fatherland , now even the biggest star of the victors ' nation is not enough to play our superman stauffenberg if this star is not in line with contemporary germany in his personal views , " he said .
the july 20 1944 foundation , a german organization set up to coordinate events and keep the story of von stauffenberg alive , also spoke out against the government ’ s decision .
rüdiger von voss , the foundation 's president , said that cruise should be allowed to play the german hero , regardless of his links to scientology . " it is unconstitutional to restrict artistic freedom and this freedom should be protected , " von voss was quoted as saying in the rheinischen merkur newspaper .
cruise links to church concern many bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bendlerblock is used as a memorial site in berlin however , peter steinbach , head of the memorial of the german opposition , weighed into the argument wednesday by saying that it was sadly ironic that the film about a national hero that stood up to the nazis would star a man widely perceived as being a member of a totalitarian organization .
steinbach also criticized henckel von donnersmarck for his article , in particular his description of von stauffenberg as a " superman " which could be misconstrued as a reference to the nazis ' desire to create a master race .
" henckel von donnersmarck should think seriously about the concepts he uses and which he so frivolously and irresponsibly puts out there in the world . "
the row over cruise 's beliefs took precedent in the location debate when defense minister franz josef jung made it clear that filmmakers could not shoot at any military sites as long as cruise plays von stauffenberg because of the hollywood actor 's link to scientology .
however , the german finance ministry , which oversees the locations and has the final word on such matters , said the filmmakers were welcome to film in germany - just not at the bendlerblock .
" they will not be permitted to film at the bendlerblock but this has nothing to do with -lrb- scientology -rrb- , " said finance ministry spokesman stefan olbermann .
" we welcome the fact that such a film is being made , " he added .
" we do n't think it would be appropriate to film there . "
he added that the ministry was still considering the filmmakers ' requests to shoot at other sites in germany , though he said there were no requests to film at military sites .

anti-subversive agencies in germany fear its activities are " directed against the free democratic order " in the country .
the church opened a new center in berlin in january , sparking fears that it is trying to make inroads into german politics .

" if stauffenberg and his consorts were considered un-german traitors to the fatherland , now even the biggest star of the victors ' nation is not enough to play our superman stauffenberg if this star is not in line with contemporary germany in his personal views , " he said .
the july 20 1944 foundation , a german organization set up to coordinate events and keep the story of von stauffenberg alive , also spoke out against the government ’ s decision .
rüdiger von voss , the foundation 's president , said that cruise should be allowed to play the german hero , regardless of his links to scientology . " it is unconstitutional to restrict artistic freedom and this freedom should be protected , " von voss was quoted as saying in the rheinischen merkur newspaper .
cruise links to church concern many bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bendlerblock is used as a memorial site in berlin however , peter steinbach , head of the memorial of the german opposition , weighed into the argument wednesday by saying that it was sadly ironic that the film about a national hero that stood up to the nazis would star a man widely perceived as being a member of a totalitarian organization .
steinbach also criticized henckel von donnersmarck for his article , in particular his description of von stauffenberg as a " superman " which could be misconstrued as a reference to the nazis ' desire to create a master race .
" henckel von donnersmarck should think seriously about the concepts he uses and which he so frivolously and irresponsibly puts out there in the world . "
the row over cruise 's beliefs took precedent in the location debate when defense minister franz josef jung made it clear that filmmakers could not shoot at any military sites as long as cruise plays von stauffenberg because of the hollywood actor 's link to scientology .
however , the german finance ministry , which oversees the locations and has the final word on such matters , said the filmmakers were welcome to film in germany - just not at the bendlerblock .
" they will not be permitted to film at the bendlerblock but this has nothing to do with -lrb- scientology -rrb- , " said finance ministry spokesman stefan olbermann .
" we welcome the fact that such a film is being made , " he added .
" we do n't think it would be appropriate to film there . "
he added that the ministry was still considering the filmmakers ' requests to shoot at other sites in germany , though he said there were no requests to film at military sites .
scientologists under surveillance in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church of scientology is closely watched in germany the us-based church of scientology is under observation by the federal office for the protection of the constitution and several state security watchdogs , although not by the berlin authorities following a successful court challenge by the group .
anti-subversive agencies in germany fear its activities are " directed against the free democratic order " in the country .
the church opened a new center in berlin in january , sparking fears that it is trying to make inroads into german politics .

but plenty of parliamentarians have extra money in their account at the end of the month from lucrative side jobs .
politicians will now have to report how much money they earn and where the extra money is coming from , germany 's federal constitutional court ruled on wednesday .
nine politicians from four leading german parties had challenged a regulation that took effect in january this year which requires all members of parliament to disclose all additional sources of income .
the constitutional court said that well-paid private sector jobs could seriously hamper mps ' independence and that the nation therefore " has a right to know " if parliamentary representatives earn money on the side . it added that in this instance , members of parliaments ' right to privacy was second to the public interest in transparency .

some parliamentarians were on the payrolls of german corporations without seeming to do much to earn the extra incomes .
one high-profile politician was found to have accepted severance payments from an energy company which he had not even quit .
the revelations of these plum side jobs cost some politicians their jobs .
it also raised concerns in the country about possible corruption and a conflict of interest if politicians were closely connected to big companies .
some also questioned why politicians , who are paid well in germany , needed to take up another job .
critics say parliament will be filled with civil servants the transparency law passed in 2005 also said that voters had a right to know where elected politicians worked on the side and how much they earned .
opponents of the law however argued that it infringed on the right of parliamentarians to be free to choose to practise their professions .
hans-joachim otto , a member of the opposition free-market liberal fdp party , was one of the plaintiffs in the case .
otto is an attorney and notary .
he and three other partners have an office in frankfurt .
otto said he did n't want to give up his job for politics .
having a job is the best way to maintain independence and bring real-life experience to politics , otto told dw-world .
friedrich merz , former head of the parliamentary group of chancellor merkel 's christian democratic party , warned that the parliament would be filled with civil servants and career politicians who would have little touch with real life in germany .

" it is just the most fantastic thing to be free .
it was an appalling experience , " johnston , 45 , said in a brief telephone interview with the bbc television from the home of hamas leader ismail haniya , who was dismissed as prime minister last month by palestinian president mahmoud abbas after a hamas takeover of the gaza strip . the freed journalist later added " i think i 'm okay . " he said the ordeal was tremendously stressful . " we are delighted and extremely relieved , " the bbc said in a statement .
british prime minister gordon brown also said he welcomed the news of johnston 's release . " a friend of the palestinian people " later , in a press conference just after daybreak wednesday morning in gaza city , haniya described the journalist as a " friend of the palestinian people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a banner urging johnston to be freed in the west bank city of ramallah johnston said " the last 16 weeks , of course , were the worst of my life . "
the journalist , who was kidnapped and held by the shadowy army of islam , said being released was " the most unimaginable relief . " johnston was the only western correspondent based full-time in the troubled gaza strip .
he said he sensed his captors felt new pressure once hamas seized control in fighting three weeks ago . johnston thanked the hamas movement , and all those who worked for his freedom . " appalling and terrifying experience " johnston said his 16 weeks in captivity was " like being buried alive " with " dangerous and unpredictable " people who " threatened my life a number of times , in various ways . " he said there was no physical violence used against him , but that at times he was mistreated .
he said he was once chained for 24 hours but only in the last half hour did the captors " hit me a bit . " johnston , who appeared pale and to have lost weight , said he fell ill twice during his captivity .
the journalist added he was kept in a shuttered room for the last three months of his captivity and could not see the sun . johnston said he had a radio during his " appalling and terrifying experience , " and was able to follow events in gaza as well as the efforts to secure his release .
he said he had dreamed many times of being freed . " it 's hard to believe i wo n't wake up in that room again , " he said . prisoner swap led to johnston 's release bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas leader ismail haniya earlier tuesday night , hamas forces had laid siege to the area of gaza city where the army of islam , a group tied to the heavily armed doghmush clan , has its stronghold and where johnston was assumed to have been held . " i think this is a small ' jihadi ' group , " johnston said of his abductors . " i do n't know the details exactly and exactly who is behind it .
they had a jihadi agenda .
they were not so interested in israel-palestine .
they were interested in getting a knife into britain in some way . "
no ransom was paid , and there were no other conditions attached .
the group had previously demanded britain and other states free prisoners with ties to al qaeda . one week ago , a video was released in which johnston was shown wearing a explosive vest , which he said his captors would detonate if anyone tried to free him by force . in another statement released a day later , the group said it would " slaughter the prisoner like a sheep " if their demands were not met . johnston had been held captive longer than any other foreigner abducted in gaza . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was a sign that the gdr , which disapproved of such fun , would soon be history . it 's difficult to imagine in 2007 that phil collins was ever cool - much less that he might have played a small role in the fall of the berlin wall .
but then again , in 1987 , few would have dared predict that the end of communist east germany was nigh . on june 8 of that year , the band genesis - collins ' troop of art-rockers-turned-pop-stars - headlined the final night of the " concert for berlin , " a three-day open-air festival staged in front of the reichstag .
the stage was only a stone 's throw from , and well within earshot of , the other side of the berlin wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east berliners could only gaze from a distance and fume as had been the case the previous two nights , which had featured david bowie and eurythmics , some 2,000 east berliners headed to the border at the brandenburg gate to get a listen .
few got there . " the police had cordoned off the street at the russian embassy -lrb- about a quarter-mile from the wall -rrb- , " eyewitness tina krone said . " they kept arresting people , dragging them along the surface of the street .
it was like a horror movie .
we were enraged . " as many as 200 people were taken into custody in what amounted to a small pitched battle between the cops and the kids .
and the frustrated east berliners , as gleefully noted by west german media , began chanting " the wall must fall ! " and " gorby get us out ! " land of confusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wall could n't keep east germans from listening to western music the communist party leadership of the gdr had always feared that rock music would incite the country 's entertainment-starved youth to rebel .
confronted with the " concert for berlin , " the stern guardians of socialist morality were determined to keep young east berliners away from what they say as a decadent influence . olof pock , a picture editor for dw-world.de who was fifteen years old at the time , climbed up on an east berlin rooftop to listen to eurythmics . " at the end of the concert , the police began to herd people back from the wall , " pock remembered .
" they completely overreacted .
they were beating kids with billy clubs . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : by 1989 east germans could get all the genesis they wanted east berliners were well informed about the concert by the radio station that sponsored it , rias 2 .
rias , which stood for radio in the american sector , convinced the musicians , despite the possibility of home taping , to allow the shows to be simulcast to all parts of the divided city . " the mood was one of enjoying forbidden fruit , " pock said .
" we knew that this was somehow being done for our benefit . " the west was very aware how hungry east german kids were for popular music from their capitalist " enemies . "
rias 2 had been specially formed as a music-oriented station broadcasting to all of berlin and the surrounding area . sweet dreams are made of this bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these aging english gentlemen played a role in cold war history so was the reichstag concert a conscious act of provocation ?
were some of the loudspeakers , as would later be alleged , aimed directly across the wall ? christoph lanz , today managing director of dw-tv , was deputy head of programming at rias 2 and the emcee at the concerts .
he says they were not . " i would have seen them , if they were , " lanz said .
" we were surprised when we heard about the reaction in the east .
i mean , we rocked the gdr ! " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gdr border guards killed some 190 people who tried to flee to the west but what people could see on or in front of the stage did n't tell the whole story .
peter schwenkow , the promoter and producer of the concert , says that at least a quarter of the speakers were indeed pointed at the eastern part of the city - as an act of revenge . " in 1977 , some crew members of tina turner were killed while in transit through east germany , " schwenkow said .
" a short time later , while in transit myself , i tried to find out what had happened and was interrogated at gunpoint by east german border guards .
ever since then i could n't stand those guys .
holding a show at the reichstag was an attempt to provoke them .
it was great fun . " both lanz and schwenkow look back with obvious pride and nostalgia on an event that called forth resentment and resistance to a repressive state . " on the afternoon before the genesis concert , i visited a friend of mine in east berlin , " lanz recalled .
" when it was time for me to leave , he said with teary eyes how much he wished he could go with me .
all he wanted to do was go hear a concert .
i still get goose bumps when i think of that . " ch-ch-ch-changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bowie , a former berlin resident , maintained close ties to the city in the wake of the concert , the gdr realized it had made a mistake . " it was the nervous reaction of a one-party state that was in over its head , " said rainer börner , an east berlin music producer and cultural secretary for the gdr 's main youth organization .
" some of us realized we had to increase what we were offering . " in 1989 bruce springsteen was booked to play a gig in east berlin - after organizers found a location far enough away form the wall to assuage fears that the music might inspire concert-goers to try to flee the gdr en masse .

it was a sign that the gdr , which disapproved of such fun , would soon be history . it 's difficult to imagine in 2007 that phil collins was ever cool - much less that he might have played a small role in the fall of the berlin wall .
but then again , in 1987 , few would have dared predict that the end of communist east germany was nigh . on june 8 of that year , the band genesis - collins ' troop of art-rockers-turned-pop-stars - headlined the final night of the " concert for berlin , " a three-day open-air festival staged in front of the reichstag .
the stage was only a stone 's throw from , and well within earshot of , the other side of the berlin wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east berliners could only gaze from a distance and fume as had been the case the previous two nights , which had featured david bowie and eurythmics , some 2,000 east berliners headed to the border at the brandenburg gate to get a listen .
few got there . " the police had cordoned off the street at the russian embassy -lrb- about a quarter-mile from the wall -rrb- , " eyewitness tina krone said . " they kept arresting people , dragging them along the surface of the street .
it was like a horror movie .
we were enraged . " as many as 200 people were taken into custody in what amounted to a small pitched battle between the cops and the kids .
and the frustrated east berliners , as gleefully noted by west german media , began chanting " the wall must fall ! " and " gorby get us out ! " land of confusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wall could n't keep east germans from listening to western music the communist party leadership of the gdr had always feared that rock music would incite the country 's entertainment-starved youth to rebel .
confronted with the " concert for berlin , " the stern guardians of socialist morality were determined to keep young east berliners away from what they say as a decadent influence . olof pock , a picture editor for dw-world.de who was fifteen years old at the time , climbed up on an east berlin rooftop to listen to eurythmics . " at the end of the concert , the police began to herd people back from the wall , " pock remembered .
" they completely overreacted .
they were beating kids with billy clubs . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : by 1989 east germans could get all the genesis they wanted east berliners were well informed about the concert by the radio station that sponsored it , rias 2 .
rias , which stood for radio in the american sector , convinced the musicians , despite the possibility of home taping , to allow the shows to be simulcast to all parts of the divided city . " the mood was one of enjoying forbidden fruit , " pock said .
" we knew that this was somehow being done for our benefit . " the west was very aware how hungry east german kids were for popular music from their capitalist " enemies . "
rias 2 had been specially formed as a music-oriented station broadcasting to all of berlin and the surrounding area . sweet dreams are made of this bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these aging english gentlemen played a role in cold war history so was the reichstag concert a conscious act of provocation ?
were some of the loudspeakers , as would later be alleged , aimed directly across the wall ? christoph lanz , today managing director of dw-tv , was deputy head of programming at rias 2 and the emcee at the concerts .
he says they were not . " i would have seen them , if they were , " lanz said .
" we were surprised when we heard about the reaction in the east .
i mean , we rocked the gdr ! " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gdr border guards killed some 190 people who tried to flee to the west but what people could see on or in front of the stage did n't tell the whole story .
peter schwenkow , the promoter and producer of the concert , says that at least a quarter of the speakers were indeed pointed at the eastern part of the city - as an act of revenge . " in 1977 , some crew members of tina turner were killed while in transit through east germany , " schwenkow said .
" a short time later , while in transit myself , i tried to find out what had happened and was interrogated at gunpoint by east german border guards .
ever since then i could n't stand those guys .
holding a show at the reichstag was an attempt to provoke them .
it was great fun . " both lanz and schwenkow look back with obvious pride and nostalgia on an event that called forth resentment and resistance to a repressive state . " on the afternoon before the genesis concert , i visited a friend of mine in east berlin , " lanz recalled .
" when it was time for me to leave , he said with teary eyes how much he wished he could go with me .
all he wanted to do was go hear a concert .
i still get goose bumps when i think of that .

some believe the number of terrorists with no formal training will rise . what does it mean that a group of doctors - recent immigrants to europe from different nations who seem to have had little prior contact with established terror networks - came together to plot a bombing ?
and was the failure of their bombs to detonate purely a blessing , or a signal that bombings in europe might become more frequent , now that it 's catching on among the untrained ?
the attacks in britain , when set alongside the recent rise in islamist activity in north africa and recent arrests of terrorist sympathizers in spain and germany can only mean one thing , says claude moniquet , chairman of the european strategic intelligence and security centre , a think tank in brussels .
" the al qaeda groups are trying to open a new jihad .
mostly there are two jihads - one in afghanistan and another in iraq .
they are trying to open a new one in … europe . "
details about the men in custody continue to come in , but to call plots like this one in britain as having a hard " link to al qaeda " might be premature .
at any rate , analysts say many recent terror plotters have had no formal training from al qaeda-proper in weaponry or logistics . advent of the ' do-it-yourself ' jihadists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the failed suitcase bombs found in germany last year they are simply very angry people who are inspired by the violent actions they 've seen carried out by al qaeda and others and are desperate to get in on the act , even if they do n't quite know how , says julianne smith , director of the europe program and the transatlantic dialogue on terrorism at the center for strategic and international studies in washington .
" i think it just shows the continuing evolution , that we 've gone from a highly trained set of individuals , to people who appear to have had some limited training to groups that appear not to know what they ’ re really doing whatsoever , " she says .
that these men 's bombs , like those of the so-called suitcase bombers who targeted german train stations last summer , failed to go off is a blessing .
but it may mean that in the long term europe could be facing more bombs from more bombers , expert and inept .
the desire to kill seems to be there , as does rudimentary information about building explosive devices .
internet coaching breeding new terrorists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the internet removes the need to attend training camps " as a potential bomber , you may not want to take the risk of traveling to the middle east , " says smith .
" you may be confused on how to find the individuals you would need to find , you may not want to sign up for the broader al qaeda movement , but what you 're going to do is find the information you need to get the job done , essentially on the internet . "
and while claude moniquet emphasized that britain ’ s participation in the iraq war and germany ’ s involvement in afghanistan mean the two countries are particularly vulnerable , all of europe is a potential target for terrorists .
" it 's important to understand that for the jihadis , they do n't make a lot of distinctions between the countries , " moniquet says .
" all the so-called western world is a target , for one very simple reason : they absolutely hate the way we live .
they hate democracy and they hate equality between women and men .
there are a lot of reasons for them to try and fight europe . "
the expanding body of evidence implies that anyone in any profession could be part of a sleeper cell intent on death and destruction in europe . no blueprint for modern terrorist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terror suspect mohammed asha raised few suspicions among the eight suspects arrested so far in the british investigation , at least six are doctors , including a jordanian surgeon and an iraqi physician .
an indian doctor is also being held in australia in connection with the london and glasgow attempted bombings after trying to flee the country with a one-way ticket to india .
none of those being held are british citizens , but the surprise has been evident that such well-educated and well-situated people , who once as doctors took an oath to help those in need , could take another oath to kill .
addressing the issue of the suspect 's backgrounds , the former head of the british government 's joint intelligence committee , pauline neville-jones , said recently that , essentially , anything now seems possible .
" it means obviously that you ca n't make any assumptions or have any preconceptions about the kind of people who might become terrorists .

some believe the number of terrorists with no formal training will rise . what does it mean that a group of doctors - recent immigrants to europe from different nations who seem to have had little prior contact with established terror networks - came together to plot a bombing ?
and was the failure of their bombs to detonate purely a blessing , or a signal that bombings in europe might become more frequent , now that it 's catching on among the untrained ?
the attacks in britain , when set alongside the recent rise in islamist activity in north africa and recent arrests of terrorist sympathizers in spain and germany can only mean one thing , says claude moniquet , chairman of the european strategic intelligence and security centre , a think tank in brussels .
" the al qaeda groups are trying to open a new jihad .

some believe the number of terrorists with no formal training will rise . what does it mean that a group of doctors - recent immigrants to europe from different nations who seem to have had little prior contact with established terror networks - came together to plot a bombing ?
and was the failure of their bombs to detonate purely a blessing , or a signal that bombings in europe might become more frequent , now that it 's catching on among the untrained ?
the attacks in britain , when set alongside the recent rise in islamist activity in north africa and recent arrests of terrorist sympathizers in spain and germany can only mean one thing , says claude moniquet , chairman of the european strategic intelligence and security centre , a think tank in brussels .
" the al qaeda groups are trying to open a new jihad .
mostly there are two jihads - one in afghanistan and another in iraq .
they are trying to open a new one in … europe . "

"
having cruise play count claus schenk von stauffenberg in director bryan singer ’ s film " valkyrie " would promote germany 's image " more than 10 soccer world cups , " henckel von donnersmarck wrote in a full-page article in the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
berlin officials prevented singer from filming at the so-called bendlerblock , the site where stauffenberg was executed after his failed attempt to assassinate the nazi leader in 1944 , claiming that it was because it was a memorial site .
singer was also prevented from filming at the police station and yard for precinct 52 in the city 's kreuzberg neighborhood after senior officers complained that this would obstruct the various departments working on the site .
officials deny scientology claim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tom cruise plays count von stauffenberg in the film while some german politicians have said that cruise , 44 , is unwelcome because of his involvement with the church of scientology , officials have said that the decision to prevent filming at the bendlerblock , now part of the defense ministry , was unconnected with the star 's beliefs and was based purely on the disruption it would cause .
but in his article , henckel von donnersmarck accused german officials who had publicly raised concerns about cruise 's involvement with scientology of making the country appear intolerant .
" if stauffenberg and his consorts were considered un-german traitors to the fatherland , now even the biggest star of the victors ' nation is not enough to play our superman stauffenberg if this star is not in line with contemporary germany in his personal views , " he said .
the july 20 1944 foundation , a german organization set up to coordinate events and keep the story of von stauffenberg alive , also spoke out against the government ’ s decision .
rüdiger von voss , the foundation 's president , said that cruise should be allowed to play the german hero , regardless of his links to scientology . " it is unconstitutional to restrict artistic freedom and this freedom should be protected , " von voss was quoted as saying in the rheinischen merkur newspaper .
cruise links to church concern many bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bendlerblock is used as a memorial site in berlin however , peter steinbach , head of the memorial of the german opposition , weighed into the argument wednesday by saying that it was sadly ironic that the film about a national hero that stood up to the nazis would star a man widely perceived as being a member of a totalitarian organization .
steinbach also criticized henckel von donnersmarck for his article , in particular his description of von stauffenberg as a " superman " which could be misconstrued as a reference to the nazis ' desire to create a master race .
" henckel von donnersmarck should think seriously about the concepts he uses and which he so frivolously and irresponsibly puts out there in the world . "
the row over cruise 's beliefs took precedent in the location debate when defense minister franz josef jung made it clear that filmmakers could not shoot at any military sites as long as cruise plays von stauffenberg because of the hollywood actor 's link to scientology .
however , the german finance ministry , which oversees the locations and has the final word on such matters , said the filmmakers were welcome to film in germany - just not at the bendlerblock .
" they will not be permitted to film at the bendlerblock but this has nothing to do with -lrb- scientology -rrb- , " said finance ministry spokesman stefan olbermann .
" we welcome the fact that such a film is being made , " he added .
" we do n't think it would be appropriate to film there . "
he added that the ministry was still considering the filmmakers ' requests to shoot at other sites in germany , though he said there were no requests to film at military sites .
scientologists under surveillance in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church of scientology is closely watched in germany the us-based church of scientology is under observation by the federal office for the protection of the constitution and several state security watchdogs , although not by the berlin authorities following a successful court challenge by the group .
anti-subversive agencies in germany fear its activities are " directed against the free democratic order " in the country .
the church opened a new center in berlin in january , sparking fears that it is trying to make inroads into german politics .
scientologists are regarded with suspicion in many european countries , where authorities contend its leaders seek economic gain and use totalitarian methods to keep supporters in line . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the row over cruise 's beliefs took precedent in the location debate when defense minister franz josef jung made it clear that filmmakers could not shoot at any military sites as long as cruise plays von stauffenberg because of the hollywood actor 's link to scientology .

but plenty of parliamentarians have extra money in their account at the end of the month from lucrative side jobs .
politicians will now have to report how much money they earn and where the extra money is coming from , germany 's federal constitutional court ruled on wednesday .
nine politicians from four leading german parties had challenged a regulation that took effect in january this year which requires all members of parliament to disclose all additional sources of income .
the constitutional court said that well-paid private sector jobs could seriously hamper mps ' independence and that the nation therefore " has a right to know " if parliamentary representatives earn money on the side . it added that in this instance , members of parliaments ' right to privacy was second to the public interest in transparency .
need for transparency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corruption is a concern the law on transparency were decided by the previous social democrat-green government in 2005 after an uproar in the country when it emerged that some politicians were making an additional tidy sum with lucrative jobs on the side .
some parliamentarians were on the payrolls of german corporations without seeming to do much to earn the extra incomes .
one high-profile politician was found to have accepted severance payments from an energy company which he had not even quit .
the revelations of these plum side jobs cost some politicians their jobs .
it also raised concerns in the country about possible corruption and a conflict of interest if politicians were closely connected to big companies .
some also questioned why politicians , who are paid well in germany , needed to take up another job .
critics say parliament will be filled with civil servants the transparency law passed in 2005 also said that voters had a right to know where elected politicians worked on the side and how much they earned .
opponents of the law however argued that it infringed on the right of parliamentarians to be free to choose to practise their professions .
hans-joachim otto , a member of the opposition free-market liberal fdp party , was one of the plaintiffs in the case .
otto is an attorney and notary .
he and three other partners have an office in frankfurt .
otto said he did n't want to give up his job for politics .
having a job is the best way to maintain independence and bring real-life experience to politics , otto told dw-world .
friedrich merz , former head of the parliamentary group of chancellor merkel 's christian democratic party , warned that the parliament would be filled with civil servants and career politicians who would have little touch with real life in germany .
privacy concerns " we do n't need only more professional politicians but also more people with work experience and life experience and who are independent , " otto said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's highest court ruled side jobs must be disclosed he said the law threatened politicians ' independence .
an unintended consequence of the new law is that political life becomes unattractive for self-employed people and entrepreneurs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 04.07.2007 oscar winner leads voices criticizing germany over cruise film großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : florian henckel von donnersmarck has slammed the government 's stance on cruise a german government decision to prevent hollywood star tom cruise from filming scenes for his upcoming movie about a german aristocrat behind a daring plot to kill hitler has drawn criticism from a number of quarters . germany 's oscar-winning director florian henckel von donnersmarck , the creative brains behind stasi film " the lives of others , " which won the best foreign language picture award in february , slammed the government for wasting " a golden opportunity . "
having cruise play count claus schenk von stauffenberg in director bryan singer ’ s film " valkyrie " would promote germany 's image " more than 10 soccer world cups , " henckel von donnersmarck wrote in a full-page article in the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
berlin officials prevented singer from filming at the so-called bendlerblock , the site where stauffenberg was executed after his failed attempt to assassinate the nazi leader in 1944 , claiming that it was because it was a memorial site .
singer was also prevented from filming at the police station and yard for precinct 52 in the city 's kreuzberg neighborhood after senior officers complained that this would obstruct the various departments working on the site .
officials deny scientology claim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tom cruise plays count von stauffenberg in the film while some german politicians have said that cruise , 44 , is unwelcome because of his involvement with the church of scientology , officials have said that the decision to prevent filming at the bendlerblock , now part of the defense ministry , was unconnected with the star 's beliefs and was based purely on the disruption it would cause .
but in his article , henckel von donnersmarck accused german officials who had publicly raised concerns about cruise 's involvement with scientology of making the country appear intolerant .
" if stauffenberg and his consorts were considered un-german traitors to the fatherland , now even the biggest star of the victors ' nation is not enough to play our superman stauffenberg if this star is not in line with contemporary germany in his personal views , " he said .
the july 20 1944 foundation , a german organization set up to coordinate events and keep the story of von stauffenberg alive , also spoke out against the government ’ s decision .
rüdiger von voss , the foundation 's president , said that cruise should be allowed to play the german hero , regardless of his links to scientology . " it is unconstitutional to restrict artistic freedom and this freedom should be protected , " von voss was quoted as saying in the rheinischen merkur newspaper .
cruise links to church concern many bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bendlerblock is used as a memorial site in berlin however , peter steinbach , head of the memorial of the german opposition , weighed into the argument wednesday by saying that it was sadly ironic that the film about a national hero that stood up to the nazis would star a man widely perceived as being a member of a totalitarian organization .
steinbach also criticized henckel von donnersmarck for his article , in particular his description of von stauffenberg as a " superman " which could be misconstrued as a reference to the nazis ' desire to create a master race .
" henckel von donnersmarck should think seriously about the concepts he uses and which he so frivolously and irresponsibly puts out there in the world . "
the row over cruise 's beliefs took precedent in the location debate when defense minister franz josef jung made it clear that filmmakers could not shoot at any military sites as long as cruise plays von stauffenberg because of the hollywood actor 's link to scientology .
however , the german finance ministry , which oversees the locations and has the final word on such matters , said the filmmakers were welcome to film in germany - just not at the bendlerblock .
" they will not be permitted to film at the bendlerblock but this has nothing to do with -lrb- scientology -rrb- , " said finance ministry spokesman stefan olbermann .
" we welcome the fact that such a film is being made , " he added .
" we do n't think it would be appropriate to film there . "
he added that the ministry was still considering the filmmakers ' requests to shoot at other sites in germany , though he said there were no requests to film at military sites .
scientologists under surveillance in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church of scientology is closely watched in germany the us-based church of scientology is under observation by the federal office for the protection of the constitution and several state security watchdogs , although not by the berlin authorities following a successful court challenge by the group .
anti-subversive agencies in germany fear its activities are " directed against the free democratic order " in the country .
the church opened a new center in berlin in january , sparking fears that it is trying to make inroads into german politics .
scientologists are regarded with suspicion in many european countries , where authorities contend its leaders seek economic gain and use totalitarian methods to keep supporters in line . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but wine producers are already griping about the new grape proposals . the eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel of denmark announced the proposed reforms in brussels , saying they were needed to save taxpayers ' money and make european wines more competitive against rising global imports . fischer boel said her proposals would " reinvigorate the european wine sector and put it back where it belongs , that is , back on top of the world . " she added : " everybody recognizes that a profound reform of the wine sector is needed , so we have to bite the bullet and do what we think is the best solution for our producers and our consumers . " the reform plans include reducing the amount of land used for producing wine in europe from 3.6 million to 3.2 million hectares by 2012 .

but plenty of parliamentarians have extra money in their account at the end of the month from lucrative side jobs .
politicians will now have to report how much money they earn and where the extra money is coming from , germany 's federal constitutional court ruled on wednesday .
nine politicians from four leading german parties had challenged a regulation that took effect in january this year which requires all members of parliament to disclose all additional sources of income .
the constitutional court said that well-paid private sector jobs could seriously hamper mps ' independence and that the nation therefore " has a right to know " if parliamentary representatives earn money on the side . it added that in this instance , members of parliaments ' right to privacy was second to the public interest in transparency .
need for transparency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corruption is a concern the law on transparency were decided by the previous social democrat-green government in 2005 after an uproar in the country when it emerged that some politicians were making an additional tidy sum with lucrative jobs on the side .
some parliamentarians were on the payrolls of german corporations without seeming to do much to earn the extra incomes .
one high-profile politician was found to have accepted severance payments from an energy company which he had not even quit .
the revelations of these plum side jobs cost some politicians their jobs .
it also raised concerns in the country about possible corruption and a conflict of interest if politicians were closely connected to big companies .
some also questioned why politicians , who are paid well in germany , needed to take up another job .
critics say parliament will be filled with civil servants the transparency law passed in 2005 also said that voters had a right to know where elected politicians worked on the side and how much they earned .
opponents of the law however argued that it infringed on the right of parliamentarians to be free to choose to practise their professions .
hans-joachim otto , a member of the opposition free-market liberal fdp party , was one of the plaintiffs in the case .
otto is an attorney and notary .
he and three other partners have an office in frankfurt .
otto said he did n't want to give up his job for politics .
having a job is the best way to maintain independence and bring real-life experience to politics , otto told dw-world .
friedrich merz , former head of the parliamentary group of chancellor merkel 's christian democratic party , warned that the parliament would be filled with civil servants and career politicians who would have little touch with real life in germany .
privacy concerns " we do n't need only more professional politicians but also more people with work experience and life experience and who are independent , " otto said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's highest court ruled side jobs must be disclosed he said the law threatened politicians ' independence .
an unintended consequence of the new law is that political life becomes unattractive for self-employed people and entrepreneurs .

but wine producers are already griping about the new grape proposals . the eu agriculture commissioner mariann fischer boel of denmark announced the proposed reforms in brussels , saying they were needed to save taxpayers ' money and make european wines more competitive against rising global imports . fischer boel said her proposals would " reinvigorate the european wine sector and put it back where it belongs , that is , back on top of the world . " she added : " everybody recognizes that a profound reform of the wine sector is needed , so we have to bite the bullet and do what we think is the best solution for our producers and our consumers . " the reform plans include reducing the amount of land used for producing wine in europe from 3.6 million to 3.2 million hectares by 2012 .
the eu also wants to completely do away with subsidies for grape juice concentrate , which is used to produce the alcohol in wine , and abolish the distinction between table and choice wine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danish european commissioner for agriculture , mariann fischer boel the eu has a current annual wine budget of 1.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.4 billion -rrb- .
but up to 15 percent of european wine produced every year is simply thrown away or converted into industrial alcohol , and a third of the eu wine budget goes toward those ends . meanwhile , wine from other parts of the world is becoming more and more popular in europe - imports from south africa , for instance , have risen by 770 percent over the last decade .
consumption of domestic wines is declining by around .65 percent annually . wrath of grapes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industry groups say the reforms could raise the price of european wine the president of association of german wine producers , norbert weber , slammed the planned changes . " the commission has a completely inaccurate understanding of wine , " he said in an interview with german public television .
" it thinks of wine as a large industry and forgets family farming businesses . " in his organization 's official reaction , weber predicted that the proposed reforms would lead to " loss of income and significant economic disadvantages , especially in areas that produce high-quality wines where land is expensive . " weber also criticized eu plans to pay farmers some 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.36 billion -rrb- to uproot grape vines , objecting that farmers would be free to replant them as 2013 . fischer boel may have a hard time convincing agricultural ministers from the individual eu member states , especially the big wine producers , when they meeting to discuss the reforms this fall .
and it probably wo n't help her cause that she comes from denmark - traditionally a beer-drinking country . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was a sign that the gdr , which disapproved of such fun , would soon be history . it 's difficult to imagine in 2007 that phil collins was ever cool - much less that he might have played a small role in the fall of the berlin wall .
but then again , in 1987 , few would have dared predict that the end of communist east germany was nigh . on june 8 of that year , the band genesis - collins ' troop of art-rockers-turned-pop-stars - headlined the final night of the " concert for berlin , " a three-day open-air festival staged in front of the reichstag .
the stage was only a stone 's throw from , and well within earshot of , the other side of the berlin wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east berliners could only gaze from a distance and fume as had been the case the previous two nights , which had featured david bowie and eurythmics , some 2,000 east berliners headed to the border at the brandenburg gate to get a listen .
few got there . " the police had cordoned off the street at the russian embassy -lrb- about a quarter-mile from the wall -rrb- , " eyewitness tina krone said . " they kept arresting people , dragging them along the surface of the street .
it was like a horror movie .
we were enraged . " as many as 200 people were taken into custody in what amounted to a small pitched battle between the cops and the kids .
and the frustrated east berliners , as gleefully noted by west german media , began chanting " the wall must fall ! " and " gorby get us out ! " land of confusion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wall could n't keep east germans from listening to western music the communist party leadership of the gdr had always feared that rock music would incite the country 's entertainment-starved youth to rebel .
confronted with the " concert for berlin , " the stern guardians of socialist morality were determined to keep young east berliners away from what they say as a decadent influence . olof pock , a picture editor for dw-world.de who was fifteen years old at the time , climbed up on an east berlin rooftop to listen to eurythmics . " at the end of the concert , the police began to herd people back from the wall , " pock remembered .
" they completely overreacted .
they were beating kids with billy clubs . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : by 1989 east germans could get all the genesis they wanted east berliners were well informed about the concert by the radio station that sponsored it , rias 2 .
rias , which stood for radio in the american sector , convinced the musicians , despite the possibility of home taping , to allow the shows to be simulcast to all parts of the divided city . " the mood was one of enjoying forbidden fruit , " pock said .
" we knew that this was somehow being done for our benefit . " the west was very aware how hungry east german kids were for popular music from their capitalist " enemies . "
rias 2 had been specially formed as a music-oriented station broadcasting to all of berlin and the surrounding area . sweet dreams are made of this bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : these aging english gentlemen played a role in cold war history so was the reichstag concert a conscious act of provocation ?
were some of the loudspeakers , as would later be alleged , aimed directly across the wall ? christoph lanz , today managing director of dw-tv , was deputy head of programming at rias 2 and the emcee at the concerts .
he says they were not . " i would have seen them , if they were , " lanz said .
" we were surprised when we heard about the reaction in the east .
i mean , we rocked the gdr ! " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gdr border guards killed some 190 people who tried to flee to the west but what people could see on or in front of the stage did n't tell the whole story .
peter schwenkow , the promoter and producer of the concert , says that at least a quarter of the speakers were indeed pointed at the eastern part of the city - as an act of revenge . " in 1977 , some crew members of tina turner were killed while in transit through east germany , " schwenkow said .
" a short time later , while in transit myself , i tried to find out what had happened and was interrogated at gunpoint by east german border guards .
ever since then i could n't stand those guys .
holding a show at the reichstag was an attempt to provoke them .
it was great fun . " both lanz and schwenkow look back with obvious pride and nostalgia on an event that called forth resentment and resistance to a repressive state . " on the afternoon before the genesis concert , i visited a friend of mine in east berlin , " lanz recalled .
" when it was time for me to leave , he said with teary eyes how much he wished he could go with me .
all he wanted to do was go hear a concert .
i still get goose bumps when i think of that . " ch-ch-ch-changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bowie , a former berlin resident , maintained close ties to the city in the wake of the concert , the gdr realized it had made a mistake . " it was the nervous reaction of a one-party state that was in over its head , " said rainer börner , an east berlin music producer and cultural secretary for the gdr 's main youth organization .
" some of us realized we had to increase what we were offering . " in 1989 bruce springsteen was booked to play a gig in east berlin - after organizers found a location far enough away form the wall to assuage fears that the music might inspire concert-goers to try to flee the gdr en masse .
but it was too little , too late . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today remnants of the wall have become places to chill " we saw what had happened in 1987 on western tv , " börner remembered .
" it just increased our frustration that we were n't allowed to do what we wanted . " " it was one stone in a whole mosaic , " concurred pock . on november 9 , 1989 , masses of east germans did precisely what the gdr leadership had feared they would be incited to do by the music of genesis .

health minister edwina hart told the assembly she wanted a fresh approach .
the plans to create a single service in cardiff were announced in 2006 after a health commission wales report into south wales neurosurgery .
ms hart also said would investigate the possibility of establishing an spinal surgery unit in wales .
neurosurgery treats disorders of the nervous system including diseases of the head , brain and spine .
currently , adult neurosurgery is performed in both cardiff and swansea .
swansea previously lost its child neurosurgery operations to cardiff in november 2004 .
since the overall move to cardiff was proposed a year ago , a high profile campaign of opposition has been underway in swansea .
in october , five ams from south west wales constituencies wrote to the then health minister brian gibbons asking him to consider other factors before moving neurosurgery between the two cities . "
it is time to make a decision and i think the overwhelming case is to keep this service in swansea " peter black am in november , dr gibbons then decided to delay the controversial decision until after the assembly election , and asked health commission wales -lrb- hcw -rrb- to reconsider its proposal .
more than 100,000 people signed a petition opposing the change .
in april , campaigners marched through swansea carrying a coffin to highlight concerns about the future of the city 's overall health services , including neurosurgery at morriston .
swansea nhs trust also argued morriston hospital was better placed geographically than cardiff 's university hospital of wales to serve all of south wales .
but at the time it published the report in july 2006 , hcw said a single service in cardiff would help safeguard the future of this service in south wales , and would allow it to develop a wider range of neurosurgical services for the region .
this decision , it added , was based on " solely on improving patient care " .
" overwhelming case " after making the announcement , ms hart said : " as long as operations are safely dealt with in both cardiff and swansea , this is what is going to happen .
" it is the people of wales who pay their taxes to ensure they have the health service they want . "
welsh liberal democrat am for south west wales peter black , said he welcomed the health minister 's announcement because it meant that neurosurgery services remained open in swansea for the time being .
he also felt the delay indicated there was an " overwhelming case " for keeping neurosurgery in swansea .
but he did accuse the minister of " fudging " and " putting off " the decision , and questioned the need for a review .
" clearly if there is going to be a review of what is in wales , they are just going to report what has already happened , " he said .

the plans to create a single service in cardiff were announced in 2006 after a health commission wales report into south wales neurosurgery .
ms hart also said would investigate the possibility of establishing an spinal surgery unit in wales .
neurosurgery treats disorders of the nervous system including diseases of the head , brain and spine .
currently , adult neurosurgery is performed in both cardiff and swansea .
swansea previously lost its child neurosurgery operations to cardiff in november 2004 .
since the overall move to cardiff was proposed a year ago , a high profile campaign of opposition has been underway in swansea .

more than 100,000 people signed a petition opposing the change .
in april , campaigners marched through swansea carrying a coffin to highlight concerns about the future of the city 's overall health services , including neurosurgery at morriston .
swansea nhs trust also argued morriston hospital was better placed geographically than cardiff 's university hospital of wales to serve all of south wales .
but at the time it published the report in july 2006 , hcw said a single service in cardiff would help safeguard the future of this service in south wales , and would allow it to develop a wider range of neurosurgical services for the region .
this decision , it added , was based on " solely on improving patient care " .
" overwhelming case " after making the announcement , ms hart said : " as long as operations are safely dealt with in both cardiff and swansea , this is what is going to happen .
" it is the people of wales who pay their taxes to ensure they have the health service they want . "
welsh liberal democrat am for south west wales peter black , said he welcomed the health minister 's announcement because it meant that neurosurgery services remained open in swansea for the time being .
he also felt the delay indicated there was an " overwhelming case " for keeping neurosurgery in swansea .
but he did accuse the minister of " fudging " and " putting off " the decision , and questioned the need for a review .

preimplantation genetic screening -lrb- pgs -rrb- checks embryos for abnormalities so the best ones can be implanted .
a fertility conference in lyon heard women who used pgs were nearly a third less likely to get pregnant than those who opted for conventional ivf .
experts said women desperate for a baby were being exploited financially . "
maybe there are still abnormal chromosomes that we can not see " sebastiaan mastenbroek university of amsterdam the pioneer of pgs , professor alan handyside , defended its use in high risk women .
the work , published in the new england journal of medicine , looked at 408 women aged 35-41 - a typical age range for pgs use .
sebastiaan mastenbroek 's team from the centre for reproductive medicine at the university of amsterdam compared three cycles of ivf with and without pgs in 408 women .
at 12 weeks , 74 or 37 % of the ivf group was pregnant compared with just 52 or 25 % of the pgs women .
the pgs women also had a significantly lower live birth rate - 49 or 24 % compared with 71 or 35 % with ivf .
damage to embryo mr mastenbroek offered several reasons for why this might be , and plans further work to test these theories .
" perhaps the biopsy of one cell that is needed for pgs is more damaging to the embryo than is thought at the moment .
" or the cell biopsied may not represent what is going on in the rest of the embryo .
" it is not possible to look at every chromosome in pgs , so maybe there are still abnormal chromosomes that we can not see . "
he said pgs should not be used routinely in patients .
" until this technology has been proven it should be kept in the research setting , " he said .
professor handyside of the london bridge fertility , gynaecology and genetics centre said : " we advocate that we target these testing to those couples that we do know are at risk of abnormalities .
" our worry is that women who are genuinely at risk will be put off having this treatment which can be of benefit to them . "
" patients who pay for pgs as part of their ivf treatment should be made aware of these results " professor alison murdoch newcastle fertility centre at life he said in the future it should be possible to screen for all 23 pairs of chromosomes with pgs and reduce the cost of the procedure .
british fertility society spokesman mr stuart lavery said : " we need to approach the use of pgs with caution .
it should not be offered routinely .
" but there are patients for whom pgs might be considered - such as patients who routinely produce good numbers of apparently healthy embryos that never achieve implantation when they are transferred into the uterus . "
professor peter braude , of kings college london , said : " vulnerable patients should no longer be exploited financially under the impression that it works .
" a similar study should be undertaken for pgs use in repeated ivf failure and recurrent miscarriage - other techniques in which it is purported to work . "
alison murdoch , professor of reproductive medicine , newcastle fertility centre at life , said : " patients who pay for pgs as part of their ivf treatment should be made aware of these results . "
of the 40,000 ivf cycles carried out in the uk in 2004 , 103 included pgs .
pgs typically costs £ 1,300 for a five chromosome screen and £ 1,700 for a seven chromosome screen in the uk .

the bbc correspondent was freed after 16 weeks of imprisonment in the sabra neighbourhood of gaza city , held by members of a much-feared family known for lawless behaviour with a dash of extremist islam .
in the words of their captive , they were not interested in the israeli-palestinian conflict , they wanted to target britain in the name of a global holy war .
alan quickly gave a series of press statements , showing incredible professionalism after such an ordeal .
he disclosed how he had been held by the only group in gaza thought to have a jihadist character , and who were capable of doing the unthinkable to their captive .
it was like being buried alive .

the bbc correspondent was freed after 16 weeks of imprisonment in the sabra neighbourhood of gaza city , held by members of a much-feared family known for lawless behaviour with a dash of extremist islam .
in the words of their captive , they were not interested in the israeli-palestinian conflict , they wanted to target britain in the name of a global holy war .
alan quickly gave a series of press statements , showing incredible professionalism after such an ordeal .
he disclosed how he had been held by the only group in gaza thought to have a jihadist character , and who were capable of doing the unthinkable to their captive .

splinter group alan johnston did not name his captors , though he clearly knew who they were .
the family is called the dogmush , and the branch of the clan which held him styled itself as the " army of islam " , under the command of mumtaz dogmush .
this tiny armed faction had in the past thrown its lot in with hamas , the radical islamist movement which won power in palestinian parliament elections in 2006 beating its rivals , the secular nationalist fatah movement .
army of islam facts small , islamist armed group operating in gaza splinter group of the popular resistance committees seeks liberation of palestine and an islamic state influenced by , but not affiliated with , al-qaeda led by mumtaz dugmush , also known as abu muhammad , a member of a powerful clan one of three groups allegedly holding captured israeli soldier cpl gilad shalit but when the army of islam captured alan , it was at loggerheads with both groups .
it appeared to be taking advantage of the massive upheaval that eventually saw hamas take-over gaza by force from pro-fatah palestinian authority security forces in mid-june 2007 .
there seemed to be nothing that the warring factions could do to free alan , despite a world-wide campaign to put pressure on the gaza authorities to achieve this aim .
fortunately for alan , when hamas took control in gaza the rules of the game changed .
hamas 's priority is to restore law and order to the gaza strip , and one the first items on that agenda was to get alan johnston freed .
the group 's executive forces , a kind of irregular police force in gaza , and its military wing , the izzedine al-qassam brigades , deployed in the dogmush neighbourhood .
it is a relief all round that the pro-hamas forces did not resort to a military solution , which could have endangered the lives of alan johnston , as well as captors , rescuers and bystanders up to five members of the clan were detained in the last few days .
there are reports that water and electricity were cut off in some streets .
calls also came from senior members of the family from different branches to free alan .
it is a relief all round that the pro-hamas forces did not resort to a military solution , which could have endangered the lives of alan johnston , as well as captors , rescuers and bystanders .
the captors were clearly afraid of such a possibility .
at one point they dressed alan in what appeared to be an explosives belt , of the type used by suicide bombers , which they said would be detonated if they were attacked .
friend the final details of alan 's release have not been made clear .
at his right-hand side when he came out of a building that presumably had been where he was handed over was his friend and bbc gaza bureau colleague fayed abu shammala .
fayed and a group of hamas gunmen guided alan through the throng to a car , and they drove straight to the house of former prime minister ismail haniya .
there he held a press conference with mr haniya and another hamas leader , former foreign minister mahmoud zahhar , who was reported to have taken a lead in efforts to free him .
mr zahhar hailed it as part of hamas 's efforts to extend security to all in gaza " without fear " and so that journalists could be free to work objectively .
he insisted no deal had been done with alan 's captors - who had been calling for the release of prisoners held in the uk and jordan .

snow monkeys warm themselves in hot springs in jigokudani-onsen -lrb- hell valley -rrb- in japan the project has started with the introduction of a dozen japanese macaques , or snow monkeys .
living in the mountainous areas of honshu , they survive freezing temperatures in naturally heated volcanic springs .
the monkeys are famous for washing their food and are often the subject of buddhist myths .
they are thought to be the inspiration behind the saying " see no evil , hear no evil , speak no evil " .
other proposed additions are : amur tiger there are thought to be only 400 amur tigers in the wild .
three species of tiger have already been lost and efforts are being made to save the remaining five .
the amur tigers come from far eastern russia in the wild .
their decline is due to a loss of habitat and poaching for fur and body parts for certain medial treatments .
amur leopard this animal is regarded as the world 's rarest cat and conservationists have warned that it is facing extinction in the wild .
it is estimated that only about 30 of the animals survive in the wild .
human settlements and forest fires have pushed the amur leopard to the brink of extinction - there are more in captivity than there are in the wild .
red panda red pandas look more like raccoons than their closest relative - the giant panda .
they are secretive and spend most of the day sleeping curled up with their tail wrapped around their head .
living wild in southern asia , they are found in bhutan , china , india , lao people 's democratic republic , myanmar and nepal .
they mainly feed on bamboo , but also eat berries and occasionally eggs and young birds .
polar bear david windmill , chief executive of the rzss , said the wildlife park could also be a new home for edinburgh zoo 's female polar bear , mercedes .
polar bears are the world 's largest land carnivore and evolved from brown bears about three million years ago .
fossil remains of a large extinct subspecies were excavated at a site near london in 1964 .

" our flights to and from terminal 1 at heathrow are operating , but with some delays . "
terminal 4 is used by klm , british airways , qantas , kenya airways , iberia airlines and brazilian airline tam .
alternative route earlier on tuesday a controlled explosion was carried out on a suspect device near hammersmith tube station .
during the morning rush-hour the station in west london and surrounding roads were closed when a suspect device was found at about 0825 bst .
there was an unconfirmed report the suspect objects had turned out to be three abandoned fire extinguishers .
up to 8,000 commuters were forced to find alternative routes into work as hammersmith and barons court stations were closed for an hour .
there were also severe delays for motorists as hammersmith broadway was closed between king street and shepherd 's bush road as well as hammersmith bridge .
tower hill and east ham tube stations were shut during the morning rush-hour in a separate alert .

schools could be closed under the first phase of the city council 's school reorganisation .
it is expected to be the biggest round of closures in wales with three high schools initially earmarked to shut .
authorities including anglesey , powys , gwynedd and denbighshire are also considering closure plans .
cardiff council unveiled its reorganisation plans for the city 's secondary schools on tuesday , saying change was needed because of shrinking family sizes and a big demand for children to be educated in welsh .
it is the second time the liberal democrat-led authority has tried to implement widespread closures in the city 's school system .
cardiff school proposals close llanedeyrn high , move st teilo 's onto its site welsh-medium secondary school to open on st teilo 's site close llanrumney and rumney high schools , build new school at eastern leisure centre unite whitchurch high on the lower school site eglwys newydd primary site to become play area for whitchurch high future of cantonian high and radyr comprehensive for discussion in september cefn onn and st anne 's primaries to close it has 8,000 spare school places , costing £ 3m a year , and has faced pressure from the assembly government and the school inspection body estyn to halt the waste in money .
when a school 's roll falls , so does its funding .
the council said if no action was taken then within 10 years about half the city 's secondary schools will have lost about 30 % of their funding .
last year fierce opposition among parents , pupils and political opponents stopped the reorganisation going ahead , but this time the council said it had reached " cross-party consensus " .
under the latest plans three high schools - llanedeyrn , llanrumney and rumney - are earmarked for closure .
the future of two other secondaries - cantonian and radyr - will also be considered in the autumn .
put children first two schools would be built , one a welsh-medium high school and the other an english-language secondary .
councillor judith woodman , whose pentwyn ward includes the threatened llanedeyrn school , said the changes must be pushed through this time round .
coun woodman said the council had reached consensus with all parties involved which she hoped would hold through next year 's election .
" we have to put the interests of the children in the city first . "
the latest closure plans in cardiff mostly affect secondaries with plans for primary closures expected next year .
one proposal would close llanedeyrn high school , and move st teilo 's church in wales school onto the site .
cardiff 's third welsh-medium secondary school would then open on the st teilo 's site .
there is also a plan to shut both llanrumney high and rumney high , and a build a new school for 11-16-year-olds on the site of eastern leisure centre in llanrumney .
the council also proposes uniting whitchurch high on one site , instead of the current two .
it would mean whitchurch moving onto the site of the lower school .
eglwys newydd primary school would also be acquired and demolished to use as a play area for whitchurch high .
partnership arrangements pupils from eglwys newydd and nearby eglwys wen primary will be merged into a brand new school building on the whitchurch upper school site .
the fate of cantonian high in fairwater and radyr comprehensive will be reconsidered in september .
glyn drew high and michaelston community college will be asked to formalise their partnership arrangements , and two primaries , cefn onn and st anne 's would close .
the proposals will be up for discussion at a council committee meeting on 13 july , and the future of primary schools will be examined further next year .
two sixth forms council leader rodney berman said : " we have difficult problems to tackle but , at the same time , this is our chance to improve educational provision for all children across cardiff for generations to come . "
the falling numbers of children and what to do with the unfilled school places is also being addressed across wales - and has resulted in many anti-closure campaigns .
in gwynedd and anglesey consultations with parents and local communities is under way .
powys is also reviewing its school provision after 4,000 surplus primary places were identified there .
last month a report recommending shutting two sixth-forms in rhyl in denbighshire and creating a new centre was put out to consultation .

uk consumers spend £ 12bn a year on electronics , much of which is less efficient than older technology , a study by the energy saving trust found .
by 2020 , the gadgets will account for about 45 % of electricity used in uk households , the organisation projected .
it said flat-screen tvs and digital radios were among the worst offenders .
see how the energy costs of different tv types compare paula owen , author of the report called the ampere strikes back , said household appliances currently consumed about a third of an average home 's electricity .
but she warned this was likely to increase as a result of people buying more energy-intensive devices .
the simple message to people is switch things off when you have finished using them dr paula owen , report author " your old-fashioned , bulky cathode ray tube tv on average consumed about 100 watts of electricity when it was switched on , " dr owen explained .
" what we are seeing now is a trend for much bigger flat-screened tvs .
on average , we are seeing a three-fold increase in the energy needed to power these tvs .
" pretty much in every other sector -lsb- such as fridges and washing machines -rsb- , we find that as the technology moves on , the products get more and more efficient .
" consumer electronics does not work like that . "
' radio ga-ga ' the equivalent of 14 power stations will be needed just to power consumer electronic devices by 2020 , the report warned .
by that time televisions on standby will consume 1.4 % of all domestic electricity , it predicted .
digital radios were also singled out by the report as being energy intensive .
" traditional analogue radios consume about two watts when they are switched on , " dr owen said .
" we 've looked at digital radios and the average consumption of these is eight watts . "
she added that listening to the radio via digital tvs or set-top boxes had an average consumption of more than 100 watts .
recent research by the communications watchdog ofcom said that more than 80 % of uk homes now had digital tv .
more people are buying digital tvs or set-top boxes because by the end of 2012 the analogue tv signal will no longer be available in the uk .
but not all new technology was criticised by the report .
" mobile phones and their chargers are one area where we have seen an improvement , " dr owen said .
a few years ago , she said , the current being drawn by chargers that were plugged in but not actually attached to a phone was about three to five watts .
" we have done some testing on the newest mobile phones and chargers you can buy today and reassuringly we could see that ' no-load ' consumption had fallen below one watt . "

he describes the " appalling experience " at the hands of his captors , called the army of islam . "
i am hugely grateful to all the people - an amazing number of people that worked on the palestinian side , the british government , the bbc from top to bottom , and a huge amount of support from bbc listeners and viewers .
i had a radio almost throughout , and was able to follow all the extraordinary level of support and interest in my case , and it was a huge psychological boost .
i am immensely grateful .
it 's just the most fantastic thing to be free .
it was an appalling experience as you can imagine - 16 weeks kidnapped , sometimes quite terrifying , and frightening always because i did n't know how it was going end ... "
i literally dreamt many times of being free , and always woke up back in that room " it was like being buried alive really , removed from the world and occasionally terrifying ...
it became almost hard to imagine normal life again .
i literally dreamt many times of being free , and always woke up back in that room .
and now it really is over , and it really is indescribably good .
last night , when they took me downstairs and said you 're going to britain , they had actually said that once before when they moved me to another prison , so i was really fighting the desire to believe that it was all about to end .
and even when i was in the car , i thought at first ' they are moving me again ' , and i thought maybe they 're handing me on to new kidnappers , but then as we got deeper and deeper into gaza city , i really began at last to believe that maybe we were finishing it .
when they let me out of the car , there were gunmen around and so on and i thought , ' no , no these are more kidnappers ' , but then i saw -lsb- bbc reporter -rsb- fayed abu shammala who i 'd worked with for three years and the most fantastic moment , and i really only then , only then believed it was over .
' told what to say ' -lsb- the captors -rsb- were often rude and unpleasant , as you can imagine .
they did threaten my life , really , a number of times in various ways .
there was one 24-hour period when they seemed to get very angry with the negotiation process , and they chained me up by my hands and ankles .
but that only lasted 24 hours .
you know , there were things that i said in -lsb- in a video posted by his captors on the internet on 1 june -rsb- about the situation in gaza which were factually true . "
they were n't interested in any kind of truth , they were interested in their world view being put over " there were other things i said which were factually not correct , and absolutely all of it lacked any of the kind of context that would make it any kind of truth .
but they were n't interested in any kind of truth , they were interested in their world view being put over , and my feeling was that nobody takes those kind of videos seriously .
and again , with the video involving the explosive jacket , i was told what to say there .
you really have very little choice in those situations .
i think it is , again , part of the wider nightmare of what you go through in that situation ...
i think i 'm ok .
it was an extraordinary level of stress and psychological pressure for a long , long time , and obviously difficult to keep your mind in the right place , a constant battle .
but i do feel that i 've probably got through it as well as i could 've , i probably wo n't know for a while but i feel as well as i could i think ...
' dangerous group ' i was in gaza for three years , and i know very well what palestinian culture is , and the extraordinary warmth and hospitality - especially of gaza .
i knew that the handful of people that kidnapped me were a complete aberration - something completely other .
my memories of gaza will be very much of the best kind , despite what happened to me . "
the kidnappers seemed very comfortable and very secure in their operation until ... it became clear that hamas would be in charge " it 's true that the kidnappings - i covered 27 of them here , almost all of them were over in about 12 days .
i knew that there was one very dangerous group .
i knew about them , and i was always afraid of them .
they struck first last august , and i was worried that they might get me one day , and they indeed did .
the kidnappers seemed very comfortable and very secure in their operation - until a couple of weeks ago when it became clear that hamas would be in charge of the security situation on their own here , and after that the kidnappers were much more nervous .
it was appalling really ... not to be able to report on the extraordinary turmoil , the events that i could hear going on , the fighting in the streets around the hideout , for days on end and i just knew the scale of things that were happening .
it 's the biggest story since i 've been in gaza , but i could n't utter a word . "

mr anwar had sought 100m ringgit -lrb- us $ 28.5m -rrb- from dr mahathir for accusing him of homosexuality .
mr anwar , who was dr mahathir 's former deputy , was sacked in 1998 and served six years in prison on accusations of sodomy and corruption .
the sodomy conviction was later quashed and mr anwar released in 2004 .
mr anwar has said that dr mahathir 's comments were " falsely and maliciously " made and caused " irreparable damage " to his reputation .
the former deputy prime minister has recently returned to frontline politics , fighting a fierce campaign in recent by-elections for the opposition people 's justice party , led by his wife .
' public interest ' the latest lawsuit stemmed from remarks made by dr mahathir at a human rights conference he hosted in late 2005 , which repeated the allegation .
" imagine having a gay prime minister .
nobody would be safe , " dr mahathir said .
mr anwar filed his defamation suit last year , and dr mahathir then submitted a petition to the kuala lumpur high court to prevent it from going to trial .
on wednesday , judge tengku maimon tuan mat granted dr mahathir that application , saying that the former prime minister 's remarks were fair comment made in the public interest .
mr anwar is expected to appeal .
mr anwar has always said his convictions for sodomy and corruption were politically motivated after he emerged as a rival to dr mahathir in 1998 .
mr anwar has already successfully sued the author of a pamphlet , fifty reasons why anwar ibrahim can not be prime minister , which was widely circulated soon before he was sacked .
he also won damages from a police chief who beat him while he was in custody in 1998 .
mr anwar is currently barred from holding office until 2008 because the corruption conviction against him still stands .

he describes the " appalling experience " at the hands of his captors , called the army of islam .
i am hugely grateful to all the people - an amazing number of people that worked on the palestinian side , the british government , the bbc from top to bottom , and a huge amount of support from bbc listeners and viewers .
i had a radio almost throughout , and was able to follow all the extraordinary level of support and interest in my case , and it was a huge psychological boost .
i am immensely grateful .
it 's just the most fantastic thing to be free .
it was an appalling experience as you can imagine - 16 weeks kidnapped , sometimes quite terrifying , and frightening always because i did n't know how it was going end ...
i literally dreamt many times of being free , and always woke up back in that room it was like being buried alive really , removed from the world and occasionally terrifying ...
it became almost hard to imagine normal life again .
i literally dreamt many times of being free , and always woke up back in that room .
and now it really is over , and it really is indescribably good .
last night , when they took me downstairs and said you 're going to britain , they had actually said that once before when they moved me to another prison , so i was really fighting the desire to believe that it was all about to end .
and even when i was in the car , i thought at first ' they are moving me again ' , and i thought maybe they 're handing me on to new kidnappers , but then as we got deeper and deeper into gaza city , i really began at last to believe that maybe we were finishing it .
when they let me out of the car , there were gunmen around and so on and i thought , ' no , no these are more kidnappers ' , but then i saw -lsb- bbc reporter -rsb- fayed abu shammala who i 'd worked with for three years and the most fantastic moment , and i really only then , only then believed it was over .
' told what to say ' -lsb- the captors -rsb- were often rude and unpleasant , as you can imagine .
they did threaten my life , really , a number of times in various ways .
there was one 24-hour period when they seemed to get very angry with the negotiation process , and they chained me up by my hands and ankles .
but that only lasted 24 hours .
you know , there were things that i said in -lsb- in a video posted by his captors on the internet on 1 june -rsb- about the situation in gaza which were factually true .
they were n't interested in any kind of truth , they were interested in their world view being put over there were other things i said which were factually not correct , and absolutely all of it lacked any of the kind of context that would make it any kind of truth .
but they were n't interested in any kind of truth , they were interested in their world view being put over , and my feeling was that nobody takes those kind of videos seriously .
and again , with the video involving the explosive jacket , i was told what to say there .
you really have very little choice in those situations .
i think it is , again , part of the wider nightmare of what you go through in that situation ...
i think i 'm ok .
it was an extraordinary level of stress and psychological pressure for a long , long time , and obviously difficult to keep your mind in the right place , a constant battle .
but i do feel that i 've probably got through it as well as i could 've , i probably wo n't know for a while but i feel as well as i could i think ...
' dangerous group ' i was in gaza for three years , and i know very well what palestinian culture is , and the extraordinary warmth and hospitality - especially of gaza .
i knew that the handful of people that kidnapped me were a complete aberration - something completely other .
my memories of gaza will be very much of the best kind , despite what happened to me .
the kidnappers seemed very comfortable and very secure in their operation until ... it became clear that hamas would be in charge it 's true that the kidnappings - i covered 27 of them here , almost all of them were over in about 12 days .
i knew that there was one very dangerous group .
i knew about them , and i was always afraid of them .
they struck first last august , and i was worried that they might get me one day , and they indeed did .
the kidnappers seemed very comfortable and very secure in their operation - until a couple of weeks ago when it became clear that hamas would be in charge of the security situation on their own here , and after that the kidnappers were much more nervous .
it was appalling really ... not to be able to report on the extraordinary turmoil , the events that i could hear going on , the fighting in the streets around the hideout , for days on end and i just knew the scale of things that were happening .
it 's the biggest story since i 've been in gaza , but i could n't utter a word .

he describes the " appalling experience " at the hands of his captors , called the army of islam .
i am hugely grateful to all the people - an amazing number of people that worked on the palestinian side , the british government , the bbc from top to bottom , and a huge amount of support from bbc listeners and viewers .
i had a radio almost throughout , and was able to follow all the extraordinary level of support and interest in my case , and it was a huge psychological boost .
i am immensely grateful .
it 's just the most fantastic thing to be free .
it was an appalling experience as you can imagine - 16 weeks kidnapped , sometimes quite terrifying , and frightening always because i did n't know how it was going end ...
i literally dreamt many times of being free , and always woke up back in that room it was like being buried alive really , removed from the world and occasionally terrifying ...
it became almost hard to imagine normal life again .
i literally dreamt many times of being free , and always woke up back in that room .
and now it really is over , and it really is indescribably good .
last night , when they took me downstairs and said you 're going to britain , they had actually said that once before when they moved me to another prison , so i was really fighting the desire to believe that it was all about to end .
and even when i was in the car , i thought at first ' they are moving me again ' , and i thought maybe they 're handing me on to new kidnappers , but then as we got deeper and deeper into gaza city , i really began at last to believe that maybe we were finishing it .
when they let me out of the car , there were gunmen around and so on and i thought , ' no , no these are more kidnappers ' , but then i saw -lsb- bbc reporter -rsb- fayed abu shammala who i 'd worked with for three years and the most fantastic moment , and i really only then , only then believed it was over .
' told what to say ' -lsb- the captors -rsb- were often rude and unpleasant , as you can imagine .
they did threaten my life , really , a number of times in various ways .
there was one 24-hour period when they seemed to get very angry with the negotiation process , and they chained me up by my hands and ankles .
but that only lasted 24 hours .
you know , there were things that i said in -lsb- in a video posted by his captors on the internet on 1 june -rsb- about the situation in gaza which were factually true .
they were n't interested in any kind of truth , they were interested in their world view being put over there were other things i said which were factually not correct , and absolutely all of it lacked any of the kind of context that would make it any kind of truth .
but they were n't interested in any kind of truth , they were interested in their world view being put over , and my feeling was that nobody takes those kind of videos seriously .

mr anwar had sought 100m ringgit -lrb- us $ 28.5m -rrb- from dr mahathir for accusing him of homosexuality .
mr anwar , who was dr mahathir 's former deputy , was sacked in 1998 and served six years in prison on accusations of sodomy and corruption .
the sodomy conviction was later quashed and mr anwar released in 2004 .

prime ministers ' questions is one of only three regular events that can still be guaranteed to get a big audience in the chamber , the budget and the queen 's speech being the other , albeit less gore-soaked , two .
so , us anoraks love watching pmqs and millions of words are written and spoken about it .
but do these gladiatorial clashes add up to a row of beans in the wider political landscape ?
the answer is , absolutely , unequivocally " yes " .
quite a bit .
yes , because the performance of a leader in question time can quickly determine the way he or she is perceived by mps on all sides .
it also sends out a subliminal message to the public , via the media , about the party - if the leader is useless , the party must be useless as well .
that can lift backbenchers ' morale , particularly for an opposition struggling to make its mark , or plunge them into further despair and , fatally , leadership plotting .
little effect most recently , the relative performances of ex-tory leaders william hague and iain duncan smith are perfect examples of this .
mr hague 's performances boosted morale mr hague was one of the best question time performers in recent memory .
he regularly bested tony blair , usually with his flick-knife humour and ability to think on his feet .
virtually every week he gave his backbenchers reasons to be cheerful .
sadly for him , it never lasted long and he had to do it week after week .
his troops loved it , the politics observers enjoyed it and rated him highly and , as he has confessed himself , it had little effect on his electoral fortunes .
that is overly modest .
without those morale-boosting performances it is quite possible he would not have survived in the job long enough to find that out and his party may even have slumped further in the popularity stakes .
mr duncan smith discovered that when it very rapidly emerged that he was , to put it politely , rubbish .
his performances were marked by a persistent frog in his throat , indecisiveness and a lack of the sort of humour that can get a leader off the question time ropes .
watching him getting duffed up week after week was hugely dispiriting for his troops and seriously damaged his political health .
media filter his mps became desperate , fearing their leader was driving them towards extinction , and soon started plotting to remove him .
mr duncan smith had unfortunate question times it was n't entirely because of his question time performances - his other leadership qualities were widely seen as poor - but they contributed to his fall by adding to the public image of him as a man struggling to make an impact .
and that is the other reason these sessions matter .
most people do not ever watch question time , but they read newspapers , watch tv and listen to the radio .
and it is the media , acting as a filter , which passes on the commons view of a leader to the wider public .
none of this , of course , is to suggest question time is the only thing that matters .
if that was the case tony blair would still be prime minister - he may have faced a more dangerous adversary in the shape of david cameron , but he could easily match him and often beat him in the chamber .
wider political movements ultimately decide the fortunes of a leader but his or her chances of holding onto their job and lifting their party 's poll ratings is directly affected by the way he or she handles these sessions .
so , the first question time by a new prime minister or opposition leader is guaranteed to prove a huge draw .

so , us anoraks love watching pmqs and millions of words are written and spoken about it .
but do these gladiatorial clashes add up to a row of beans in the wider political landscape ?
the answer is , absolutely , unequivocally " yes " .
quite a bit .
yes , because the performance of a leader in question time can quickly determine the way he or she is perceived by mps on all sides .
it also sends out a subliminal message to the public , via the media , about the party - if the leader is useless , the party must be useless as well .
that can lift backbenchers ' morale , particularly for an opposition struggling to make its mark , or plunge them into further despair and , fatally , leadership plotting .
little effect most recently , the relative performances of ex-tory leaders william hague and iain duncan smith are perfect examples of this .
mr hague 's performances boosted morale mr hague was one of the best question time performers in recent memory .
he regularly bested tony blair , usually with his flick-knife humour and ability to think on his feet .
virtually every week he gave his backbenchers reasons to be cheerful .
sadly for him , it never lasted long and he had to do it week after week .
his troops loved it , the politics observers enjoyed it and rated him highly and , as he has confessed himself , it had little effect on his electoral fortunes .
that is overly modest .
without those morale-boosting performances it is quite possible he would not have survived in the job long enough to find that out and his party may even have slumped further in the popularity stakes .
mr duncan smith discovered that when it very rapidly emerged that he was , to put it politely , rubbish .
his performances were marked by a persistent frog in his throat , indecisiveness and a lack of the sort of humour that can get a leader off the question time ropes .
watching him getting duffed up week after week was hugely dispiriting for his troops and seriously damaged his political health .
media filter his mps became desperate , fearing their leader was driving them towards extinction , and soon started plotting to remove him .
mr duncan smith had unfortunate question times it was n't entirely because of his question time performances - his other leadership qualities were widely seen as poor - but they contributed to his fall by adding to the public image of him as a man struggling to make an impact .
and that is the other reason these sessions matter .
most people do not ever watch question time , but they read newspapers , watch tv and listen to the radio .
and it is the media , acting as a filter , which passes on the commons view of a leader to the wider public .
none of this , of course , is to suggest question time is the only thing that matters .
if that was the case tony blair would still be prime minister - he may have faced a more dangerous adversary in the shape of david cameron , but he could easily match him and often beat him in the chamber .
wider political movements ultimately decide the fortunes of a leader but his or her chances of holding onto their job and lifting their party 's poll ratings is directly affected by the way he or she handles these sessions .
so , the first question time by a new prime minister or opposition leader is guaranteed to prove a huge draw .
and whose head lies on the carpet at the end of it really does matter .

so , us anoraks love watching pmqs and millions of words are written and spoken about it .
but do these gladiatorial clashes add up to a row of beans in the wider political landscape ?
the answer is , absolutely , unequivocally " yes " .
quite a bit .
yes , because the performance of a leader in question time can quickly determine the way he or she is perceived by mps on all sides .
it also sends out a subliminal message to the public , via the media , about the party - if the leader is useless , the party must be useless as well .
that can lift backbenchers ' morale , particularly for an opposition struggling to make its mark , or plunge them into further despair and , fatally , leadership plotting .
little effect most recently , the relative performances of ex-tory leaders william hague and iain duncan smith are perfect examples of this .
mr hague 's performances boosted morale mr hague was one of the best question time performers in recent memory .
he regularly bested tony blair , usually with his flick-knife humour and ability to think on his feet .
virtually every week he gave his backbenchers reasons to be cheerful .
sadly for him , it never lasted long and he had to do it week after week .
his troops loved it , the politics observers enjoyed it and rated him highly and , as he has confessed himself , it had little effect on his electoral fortunes .
that is overly modest .
without those morale-boosting performances it is quite possible he would not have survived in the job long enough to find that out and his party may even have slumped further in the popularity stakes .
mr duncan smith discovered that when it very rapidly emerged that he was , to put it politely , rubbish .
his performances were marked by a persistent frog in his throat , indecisiveness and a lack of the sort of humour that can get a leader off the question time ropes .
watching him getting duffed up week after week was hugely dispiriting for his troops and seriously damaged his political health .
media filter his mps became desperate , fearing their leader was driving them towards extinction , and soon started plotting to remove him .
mr duncan smith had unfortunate question times it was n't entirely because of his question time performances - his other leadership qualities were widely seen as poor - but they contributed to his fall by adding to the public image of him as a man struggling to make an impact .
and that is the other reason these sessions matter .
most people do not ever watch question time , but they read newspapers , watch tv and listen to the radio .
and it is the media , acting as a filter , which passes on the commons view of a leader to the wider public .
none of this , of course , is to suggest question time is the only thing that matters .
if that was the case tony blair would still be prime minister - he may have faced a more dangerous adversary in the shape of david cameron , but he could easily match him and often beat him in the chamber .
wider political movements ultimately decide the fortunes of a leader but his or her chances of holding onto their job and lifting their party 's poll ratings is directly affected by the way he or she handles these sessions .
so , the first question time by a new prime minister or opposition leader is guaranteed to prove a huge draw .
and whose head lies on the carpet at the end of it really does matter .
up to a point .

the figures suggest that outside london , flats enjoyed a bigger surge in prices over the past decade than houses , but are now underperforming .
in the first quarter of 2007 , flat prices in nine out of 10 regions fell below those of houses .
and flats in those areas are often falling in price in real terms .
over supply ?
one explanation might be that the supply of flats has grown enormously over the last decade .
in england , only about one in six dwellings is a flat - but of new-built properties , it 's not far short of one in two .
developers say they are building a lot of flats because they are being encouraged to develop brown field sites with high density accommodation .
however , in a few cities the supply of new flats may be causing problems .
unoccupied city centre apartments are now sometimes being let for one or two night stays , in competition with hotels .
the phenomenon of the market for flats does not show up in the national land registry price data released to the press each month , because the overall figures are hugely affected by london where prices of everything have been rising fast .
earlier cycle ?
once the london effect is taken out , the slowdown becomes more apparent .
it is striking that the price of flats soared ahead of those for houses until the past year ; in the yorkshire and the humber region , flats rose 180 % between 1997 and 2005 , while house prices rose 154 % .
in the last year though , flats in that region have fallen by 3 % , while houses have risen by between 5 % and 10 % .
this may suggest that the market for apartments is simply experiencing an earlier or more pronounced cycle than the rest of the property market .

cruise plays colonel claus von stauffenberg , who was executed after plotting to assassinate hitler in 1944 .
germany 's finance ministry said the ban on valkyrie 's makers had nothing to do with the actor being a scientologist .
producers have already been barred from military sites because germany believes scientology is a money-making cult .
scientology leaders strongly reject that view , while cruise 's co-producer has said his personal beliefs were not relevant to the film 's subject matter .
a german government spokesman said the cast and crew had been refused permission to film on the so-called bendlerblock site , which is part of the defence ministry , because it was a memorial site .
meanwhile director florian henckel von donnersmarck - who won this year 's best foreign language film oscar for the lives of others - has defended cruise , telling the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper that having him play stauffenberg " would promote germany 's image more than 10 football world cups " .
valkyrie - named after operation valkyrie , the plot 's codename - is directed by bryan singer and also stars kenneth branagh .
it is due for release next year .
