afghan president hamid karzai had accused the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- of killing about 90 civilians in june , most of them in air operations .
karzai said that the casualties could damage support for the presence of foreign troops in the country .
smaller bombs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer more than 330 civilians have been killed during fighting involving foreign troops in afghanistan this year so far , according to afghan officials and western aid workers , reuters news agency reported .
scheffer said that nato officials were " working with weapons load on aircraft to reduce collateral damage . "
a nato diplomat told the financial times newspaper that using 250 kg -lrb- about 500 pounds -rrb- bombs rather than 500 kg bombs would " make a huge amount of difference " in terms of casualties .
nato officials also said that the afghan army should increasingly take on house-to-house searches to avoid confrontations .
no need to rush scheffer also said that nato troops would hold off on attacks against the taliban if the number of civilian casualties would run too high as the result of an attack .
" we realize that , if we can not neutralize our enemy today without harming civilians , our enemy will give us the opportunity tomorrow , " scheffer told the paper .
" if that means going after the taliban not on wednesday but on thusday , we will get him then . "
scheffer added , however , that it was impossible to avoid civilian casualties altogether .

saying that the middle east 's powder keg is already explosive enough , foreign policy experts for germany 's governing coalition criticized us plans for military aid worth billions to saudi arabia and other gulf states . an official for the us defense department had said over the weekend that washington planned to give some $ 20 billion -lrb- 14.6 billion euros -rrb- in military assistance to saudi arabia and other states in the gulf region to modernize their armed forces and limit iran 's influence .
israel in return would receive $ 30.4 billion in military aid over the next decade - a significant increase to what the country received before .
while israeli officials have welcomed the plan , which was officially announced by us secretary of state condoleezza rice on monday , german parliamentarians have criticized it as a move that will further destabilize an already fragile region .
a high risk strategy ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruprecht polenz " if you add more explosive things to a powder keg - and that 's what the middle east is - you heighten the risk and do n't make the region safer in the end , " ruprecht polenz , the chairman of the foreign affairs committee in the german parliament , told frankfurter rundschau newspaper .
" in any case , it 's a high-risk strategy , " added polenz , a member of parliament for the conservative christian democratic union of chancellor angela merkel .
" the aim - to signal iran that a struggle for hegemony based on military might wo n't lead to success - can lead to the wrong reaction in tehran : to try harder and arm faster . "
polenz suggested that the german government should push for a regional security conference and - together with the eu - lobby others not to send arms to crisis regions .
a csce for the mideast ?
" instead , one should try to get a process started that 's similar to the conference on security and cooperation in europe -lsb- csce -rsb- in the 1970s : to discuss the region 's security problems with everyone involved , to build trust and maybe dampen armament or even encourage disarmament this way , " polenz said .
while saying that the idea to establish a middle east equivalent of the csce was nothing new , johannes jung , a member of the parliament 's foreign affairs committee for the social democratic party , said that this was more urgent than ever .
" the region needs disarmament and not armament , " he said , according to the web site of german newsmagazine der spiegel . article based on news reports -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de : palestinian president mahmoud abbas said last week that he thought a peace agreement could be reached by the end of 2008 .
one of the reasons he gave was because us secretary of state condoleezza rice assured him of it .
is it wishful thinking ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former israeli ambassador avi primor avi primor : i think abbas is an optimist because he really wants this solution .
he stands for compromise , he is for freedom , he is against terrorism .
but he has , unfortunately , little power , not only because hamas is his opponent and because he has already lost the gaza strip , but also because he has to fight hard in the west bank not to lose power to hamas there as well .
but that 's not really the point .
the question is what can condoleezza rice get started ?
us president bush gave a speech on july 16 in which he laid out a new peace plan and called for an international conference , to be attended by condoleezza rice , in the autumn .
so now the one who has to actually implement the peace plan is condoleezza rice . will condoleezza rice be accepted by all sides as an acceptable negotiating partner during these talks ? she will be accepted by everyone , without a doubt .
i have my doubts about whether she will have the power of the president behind her to actually force a particular direction - because this new peace process needs to be forced .
i do not think that the president is serious about this peace plan , but that he is paying lip service to it to ease pressure from condoleezza rice .
so he can say , " okay , go play a little with the israelis and the palestinians and maybe you can invite a few other arab countries to your conference , saudi arabia would be ideal , but i do n't expect much of it . "
i remember that condoleezza rice wanted to support then president of the world bank james wolfensohn , blair 's processor as middle east envoy , but that she did not have the support of her president and she failed , just as mr. wolfensohn did .
nothing has changed since then , and i do not think that bush , at the end of his term , is really aiming to get something started ; even though he has all the means to do so if he wanted . what kinds of powers would condoleezza rice have to receive to make the plan more than lip service ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice will need the president 's complete support to reach a deal bush 's peace plan put forth several components that he had previously mentioned in his first speech dealing with the middle east in 2002 , so it is a bit of a repetition : israel has to leave its settlements , the palestinians have to fight terrorism , a compromise for jerusalem needs to be reached , the problem of refugees needs to be solved , an independent palestinian state needs to be build and recognized and cooperated with .
these are all great things and israeli politicians recognize that .
but they do n't have the political power to implement such a plan , just like the palestinian administration does not have the power to implement the fight against terrorism .
had the president used all his powers , had he been ready to send money and maybe even troops to ensure security , then he would have been able to push both governments into accepting his plan .
he has not done this since 2002 , and he 's obviously not ready to do it today .
in this respect , condoleezza rice 's mission is only lip service . has n't this conflict for some time been a proxy war , with iran and syria looking to gain influence on one side and the usa and the west on the other ? i think that syria can be separated from iran because syria wants to negotiate and make peace with israel , but the americans are preventing it .
the israeli government is n't excited about it because it does not have the power to relinquish the golan heights .
but it would have fundamentally accepted the syrian president 's offer that a way could have been found - if the americans were satisfied .
but they are not .
still , i believe there is a way .
all the peace plans since 2000 - from the first clinton plan to the bush plan and the quartet 's and the one from saudi arabia - have all had the same components .
everyone knows how the problem can and should actually be solved , but no one has the power to do it .
at its most basic , the problem is security .
if there were someone who was ready to put troops in the occupied territories after israel left them - robust troops that could actually provide security - then i think the governments would be strong enough to implement the various peace plans .
the only ones who can manage something like that today and also have the will to do so are the europeans - assuming that the americans do not object to it .
that 's where condoleezza rice as well as tony blair could be helpful . what step has to come next in order to move toward a realistic peace treaty ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new eu middle east envoy tony blair could help get eu nations to contribute troops the european union needs to draft a peace plan .
that 's not a problem since all the peace plans are similar anyhow .
but this time it should be an initiative from the european union to send robust troops to the middle east .
that does not have to be exclusively european troops , it could also include arab troops , such as from saudi arabia , egypt , jordan or islamic troops like the turks , and maybe even nato .
they should take over power in the occupied territories so that israel can leave the region .
but all of this can only happen if the american do are not against it . how great are your expectations for condoleezza rice 's visit and for her middle east conference in the fall ? very small , because , as i said , i expect that the american president is n't really behind it , and that it 's all just lip service for him .
and so everyone else , the israeli as well as the palestinian government , is also only going to pay it lip service .
i do n't know if the saudi government is going to take part in the conference as bush would like .
they wo n't do it if they are not sure that the americans are actually seriously behind it , and that is not the case .
i think the whole thing is just going to be a spectacle . ina rottscheidt interviewed avi primor -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

afghan president hamid karzai had accused the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- of killing about 90 civilians in june , most of them in air operations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 30.07.2007 the miracle of merkel - is there anything angela ca n't do ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel remains extremely popular , both in germany and abroad she moves in high circles , hangs out at the opera and gets backrubs from the leader of the free world .
now , most german businessmen say they 'd like to have her as their boss .
can angela merkel do anything wrong ? being famous is surely a tough job .
just ask brad and angelina .
or that good old overachiever madonna , who consistently refuses to stay with her own age .
they all work so hard at preserving their image and compromise so much of their privacy just to remain on the covers of glossy magazines .
angela , on the other hand , makes fame appear easy .
wherever she goes , she is praised for her winning combination of diplomatic skills and unflinching perseverance .
during a recent eu summit , the german chancellor practically saved europe from the brink of a disaster .
for her , however , it 's all just part of the job .
no more and no less .
let 's not get touchy-feely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a moment to remember -lrb- and a hit on youtube -rrb- : angela getting a backrub from george w. bush germany 's top job has , of course , its perks .
in 2006 , for instance , merkel received a widely-publicized backrub from the embarrassingly easy-going us president george w. bush .
not many politicians can say that they were groped by the leader of the free world .
she attends festival openings and mingles with the glitterati , but remains oddly down-to-earth .
when asked about whether fame had changed her and whether her husband was noticing anything different about her , she answered in her usual , direct , matter-of-fact tone that the breakfast she was preparing for them was still the same .
even though she might have done so , it 's silly to picture margaret thatcher frying bacon and eggs , or even just heating up a serving of refried beans for that scary abomination that the british call their breakfast .
but it is not hard to imagine angela hovering over a stove .
it 's a surprisingly credible and comforting image .
it gives representative democracy a glimmer of hope that some politicians , once they climb to the top , can actually remain human beings .
that is , perhaps , one of the reasons why she remains extremely popular in germany .
she rules , literally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business leaders think that merkel would be a good boss business leaders seem to agree .
in a recent poll about politicians as potential business leaders , the german chancellor got very positive reviews .
when asked about which german politician they would accept as their boss , 81 percent of german managers said angela merkel .
at the same time , 70 percent of those polled said they thought the trained physicist was capable of running a large enterprise .
in comparison , germany 's economy minister , michael gloss , got only 42 of positive votes in this category , while labor minister franz müntefering rated even worse - with only 37 percent of votes .
so what does the career of angela merkel teach us about life in general - other than that still water runs deep and that breakfast is the most important meal of the day ?
it teaches us that an unassuming and soft-spoken woman can break barriers and achieve more than a pompous , cigar-smoking macho of the gerhard schröder variety .
the former chancellor would probably beg to differ , but his portrait is already hanging in the german chancellery , which means he 's been relegated to history .
old angela , new angela angela 's transformation from an awkward and stuttering newcomer in the world of schröders , stoibers and their mostly male buddies is best judged by the media coverage of her arrival to the glitzy opening of the bayreuth opera festival .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the days of heavy prespiration are over two years ago , germany was roaring with laughter because the light apricot jacket-skirt combo , which merkel wore for the opening , was soiled with sweat stains underneath her armpits .
this year , however , german tabloid bild went gaga over merkel 's fashion accessory du jour - a strap-on purse which the newspaper , known for its familiarity with hyperbole , described as a " floating magic bag . "
gracefully walking down the red carpet in a sweat-free lilac outfit - which , admittedly , some catty observers said resembled a combination of a business jacket and a potato sack - merkel waved at the onlookers with her right hand , while her left arm remained comfortably limp with an elegant bag attached to her wrist .
from certain angles , it looked like merkel 's purse was indeed hovering in the air .
in two years , merkel went from being sneered upon as an extra in a deodorant ad to being admired as a middle-aged , top-tier version of sarah jessica parker .
transformation is her forte .
and it is no surprise that most german managers think she would make a good boss . that is the miracle of merkel . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de at string of summits , merkel ready to serve the finest wine there can be no bargain without wine , goes a latin saying .

can angela merkel do anything wrong ? being famous is surely a tough job .
just ask brad and angelina .

they all work so hard at preserving their image and compromise so much of their privacy just to remain on the covers of glossy magazines .
angela , on the other hand , makes fame appear easy .
wherever she goes , she is praised for her winning combination of diplomatic skills and unflinching perseverance .

in 2006 , for instance , merkel received a widely-publicized backrub from the embarrassingly easy-going us president george w. bush .
not many politicians can say that they were groped by the leader of the free world .
she attends festival openings and mingles with the glitterati , but remains oddly down-to-earth .
when asked about whether fame had changed her and whether her husband was noticing anything different about her , she answered in her usual , direct , matter-of-fact tone that the breakfast she was preparing for them was still the same .

but it is not hard to imagine angela hovering over a stove .
it 's a surprisingly credible and comforting image .
it gives representative democracy a glimmer of hope that some politicians , once they climb to the top , can actually remain human beings .
that is , perhaps , one of the reasons why she remains extremely popular in germany .
she rules , literally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business leaders think that merkel would be a good boss business leaders seem to agree .
in a recent poll about politicians as potential business leaders , the german chancellor got very positive reviews .
when asked about which german politician they would accept as their boss , 81 percent of german managers said angela merkel .
at the same time , 70 percent of those polled said they thought the trained physicist was capable of running a large enterprise .
in comparison , germany 's economy minister , michael gloss , got only 42 of positive votes in this category , while labor minister franz müntefering rated even worse - with only 37 percent of votes .
so what does the career of angela merkel teach us about life in general - other than that still water runs deep and that breakfast is the most important meal of the day ?
it teaches us that an unassuming and soft-spoken woman can break barriers and achieve more than a pompous , cigar-smoking macho of the gerhard schröder variety .

gracefully walking down the red carpet in a sweat-free lilac outfit - which , admittedly , some catty observers said resembled a combination of a business jacket and a potato sack - merkel waved at the onlookers with her right hand , while her left arm remained comfortably limp with an elegant bag attached to her wrist .

afghan president hamid karzai had accused the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- of killing about 90 civilians in june , most of them in air operations .
karzai said that the casualties could damage support for the presence of foreign troops in the country .
smaller bombs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer more than 330 civilians have been killed during fighting involving foreign troops in afghanistan this year so far , according to afghan officials and western aid workers , reuters news agency reported .
scheffer said that nato officials were " working with weapons load on aircraft to reduce collateral damage . "
a nato diplomat told the financial times newspaper that using 250 kg -lrb- about 500 pounds -rrb- bombs rather than 500 kg bombs would " make a huge amount of difference " in terms of casualties .
nato officials also said that the afghan army should increasingly take on house-to-house searches to avoid confrontations .
no need to rush scheffer also said that nato troops would hold off on attacks against the taliban if the number of civilian casualties would run too high as the result of an attack .
" we realize that , if we can not neutralize our enemy today without harming civilians , our enemy will give us the opportunity tomorrow , " scheffer told the paper .
" if that means going after the taliban not on wednesday but on thusday , we will get him then . "
scheffer added , however , that it was impossible to avoid civilian casualties altogether .

dw-world.de : palestinian president mahmoud abbas said last week that he thought a peace agreement could be reached by the end of 2008 .
one of the reasons he gave was because us secretary of state condoleezza rice assured him of it .
is it wishful thinking ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former israeli ambassador avi primor avi primor : i think abbas is an optimist because he really wants this solution .
he stands for compromise , he is for freedom , he is against terrorism .
but he has , unfortunately , little power , not only because hamas is his opponent and because he has already lost the gaza strip , but also because he has to fight hard in the west bank not to lose power to hamas there as well .
but that 's not really the point .
the question is what can condoleezza rice get started ?
us president bush gave a speech on july 16 in which he laid out a new peace plan and called for an international conference , to be attended by condoleezza rice , in the autumn .
so now the one who has to actually implement the peace plan is condoleezza rice . will condoleezza rice be accepted by all sides as an acceptable negotiating partner during these talks ? she will be accepted by everyone , without a doubt .
i have my doubts about whether she will have the power of the president behind her to actually force a particular direction - because this new peace process needs to be forced .
i do not think that the president is serious about this peace plan , but that he is paying lip service to it to ease pressure from condoleezza rice .
so he can say , " okay , go play a little with the israelis and the palestinians and maybe you can invite a few other arab countries to your conference , saudi arabia would be ideal , but i do n't expect much of it . "
i remember that condoleezza rice wanted to support then president of the world bank james wolfensohn , blair 's processor as middle east envoy , but that she did not have the support of her president and she failed , just as mr. wolfensohn did .
nothing has changed since then , and i do not think that bush , at the end of his term , is really aiming to get something started ; even though he has all the means to do so if he wanted . what kinds of powers would condoleezza rice have to receive to make the plan more than lip service ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice will need the president 's complete support to reach a deal bush 's peace plan put forth several components that he had previously mentioned in his first speech dealing with the middle east in 2002 , so it is a bit of a repetition : israel has to leave its settlements , the palestinians have to fight terrorism , a compromise for jerusalem needs to be reached , the problem of refugees needs to be solved , an independent palestinian state needs to be build and recognized and cooperated with .
these are all great things and israeli politicians recognize that .
but they do n't have the political power to implement such a plan , just like the palestinian administration does not have the power to implement the fight against terrorism .
had the president used all his powers , had he been ready to send money and maybe even troops to ensure security , then he would have been able to push both governments into accepting his plan .
he has not done this since 2002 , and he 's obviously not ready to do it today .
in this respect , condoleezza rice 's mission is only lip service . has n't this conflict for some time been a proxy war , with iran and syria looking to gain influence on one side and the usa and the west on the other ? i think that syria can be separated from iran because syria wants to negotiate and make peace with israel , but the americans are preventing it .
the israeli government is n't excited about it because it does not have the power to relinquish the golan heights .
but it would have fundamentally accepted the syrian president 's offer that a way could have been found - if the americans were satisfied .
but they are not .
still , i believe there is a way .
all the peace plans since 2000 - from the first clinton plan to the bush plan and the quartet 's and the one from saudi arabia - have all had the same components .
everyone knows how the problem can and should actually be solved , but no one has the power to do it .
at its most basic , the problem is security .
if there were someone who was ready to put troops in the occupied territories after israel left them - robust troops that could actually provide security - then i think the governments would be strong enough to implement the various peace plans .
the only ones who can manage something like that today and also have the will to do so are the europeans - assuming that the americans do not object to it .
that 's where condoleezza rice as well as tony blair could be helpful . what step has to come next in order to move toward a realistic peace treaty ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new eu middle east envoy tony blair could help get eu nations to contribute troops the european union needs to draft a peace plan .
that 's not a problem since all the peace plans are similar anyhow .
but this time it should be an initiative from the european union to send robust troops to the middle east .
that does not have to be exclusively european troops , it could also include arab troops , such as from saudi arabia , egypt , jordan or islamic troops like the turks , and maybe even nato .
they should take over power in the occupied territories so that israel can leave the region .
but all of this can only happen if the american do are not against it . how great are your expectations for condoleezza rice 's visit and for her middle east conference in the fall ? very small , because , as i said , i expect that the american president is n't really behind it , and that it 's all just lip service for him .
and so everyone else , the israeli as well as the palestinian government , is also only going to pay it lip service .
i do n't know if the saudi government is going to take part in the conference as bush would like .
they wo n't do it if they are not sure that the americans are actually seriously behind it , and that is not the case .

dw-world.de : palestinian president mahmoud abbas said last week that he thought a peace agreement could be reached by the end of 2008 .
one of the reasons he gave was because us secretary of state condoleezza rice assured him of it .
is it wishful thinking ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former israeli ambassador avi primor avi primor : i think abbas is an optimist because he really wants this solution .
he stands for compromise , he is for freedom , he is against terrorism .
but he has , unfortunately , little power , not only because hamas is his opponent and because he has already lost the gaza strip , but also because he has to fight hard in the west bank not to lose power to hamas there as well .
but that 's not really the point .
the question is what can condoleezza rice get started ?
us president bush gave a speech on july 16 in which he laid out a new peace plan and called for an international conference , to be attended by condoleezza rice , in the autumn .
so now the one who has to actually implement the peace plan is condoleezza rice . will condoleezza rice be accepted by all sides as an acceptable negotiating partner during these talks ? she will be accepted by everyone , without a doubt .
i have my doubts about whether she will have the power of the president behind her to actually force a particular direction - because this new peace process needs to be forced .
i do not think that the president is serious about this peace plan , but that he is paying lip service to it to ease pressure from condoleezza rice .
so he can say , " okay , go play a little with the israelis and the palestinians and maybe you can invite a few other arab countries to your conference , saudi arabia would be ideal , but i do n't expect much of it . "
i remember that condoleezza rice wanted to support then president of the world bank james wolfensohn , blair 's processor as middle east envoy , but that she did not have the support of her president and she failed , just as mr. wolfensohn did .
nothing has changed since then , and i do not think that bush , at the end of his term , is really aiming to get something started ; even though he has all the means to do so if he wanted . what kinds of powers would condoleezza rice have to receive to make the plan more than lip service ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice will need the president 's complete support to reach a deal bush 's peace plan put forth several components that he had previously mentioned in his first speech dealing with the middle east in 2002 , so it is a bit of a repetition : israel has to leave its settlements , the palestinians have to fight terrorism , a compromise for jerusalem needs to be reached , the problem of refugees needs to be solved , an independent palestinian state needs to be build and recognized and cooperated with .
these are all great things and israeli politicians recognize that .
but they do n't have the political power to implement such a plan , just like the palestinian administration does not have the power to implement the fight against terrorism .

saying that the middle east 's powder keg is already explosive enough , foreign policy experts for germany 's governing coalition criticized us plans for military aid worth billions to saudi arabia and other gulf states . an official for the us defense department had said over the weekend that washington planned to give some $ 20 billion -lrb- 14.6 billion euros -rrb- in military assistance to saudi arabia and other states in the gulf region to modernize their armed forces and limit iran 's influence .
israel in return would receive $ 30.4 billion in military aid over the next decade - a significant increase to what the country received before .
while israeli officials have welcomed the plan , which was officially announced by us secretary of state condoleezza rice on monday , german parliamentarians have criticized it as a move that will further destabilize an already fragile region .
a high risk strategy ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruprecht polenz " if you add more explosive things to a powder keg - and that 's what the middle east is - you heighten the risk and do n't make the region safer in the end , " ruprecht polenz , the chairman of the foreign affairs committee in the german parliament , told frankfurter rundschau newspaper .
" in any case , it 's a high-risk strategy , " added polenz , a member of parliament for the conservative christian democratic union of chancellor angela merkel .
" the aim - to signal iran that a struggle for hegemony based on military might wo n't lead to success - can lead to the wrong reaction in tehran : to try harder and arm faster . "
polenz suggested that the german government should push for a regional security conference and - together with the eu - lobby others not to send arms to crisis regions .
a csce for the mideast ?
" instead , one should try to get a process started that 's similar to the conference on security and cooperation in europe -lsb- csce -rsb- in the 1970s : to discuss the region 's security problems with everyone involved , to build trust and maybe dampen armament or even encourage disarmament this way , " polenz said .
while saying that the idea to establish a middle east equivalent of the csce was nothing new , johannes jung , a member of the parliament 's foreign affairs committee for the social democratic party , said that this was more urgent than ever .
" the region needs disarmament and not armament , " he said , according to the web site of german newsmagazine der spiegel . article based on news reports -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

us president bush gave a speech on july 16 in which he laid out a new peace plan and called for an international conference , to be attended by condoleezza rice , in the autumn .
so now the one who has to actually implement the peace plan is condoleezza rice . will condoleezza rice be accepted by all sides as an acceptable negotiating partner during these talks ? she will be accepted by everyone , without a doubt .
i have my doubts about whether she will have the power of the president behind her to actually force a particular direction - because this new peace process needs to be forced .
i do not think that the president is serious about this peace plan , but that he is paying lip service to it to ease pressure from condoleezza rice .
so he can say , " okay , go play a little with the israelis and the palestinians and maybe you can invite a few other arab countries to your conference , saudi arabia would be ideal , but i do n't expect much of it . "
i remember that condoleezza rice wanted to support then president of the world bank james wolfensohn , blair 's processor as middle east envoy , but that she did not have the support of her president and she failed , just as mr. wolfensohn did .
nothing has changed since then , and i do not think that bush , at the end of his term , is really aiming to get something started ; even though he has all the means to do so if he wanted . what kinds of powers would condoleezza rice have to receive to make the plan more than lip service ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice will need the president 's complete support to reach a deal bush 's peace plan put forth several components that he had previously mentioned in his first speech dealing with the middle east in 2002 , so it is a bit of a repetition : israel has to leave its settlements , the palestinians have to fight terrorism , a compromise for jerusalem needs to be reached , the problem of refugees needs to be solved , an independent palestinian state needs to be build and recognized and cooperated with .
these are all great things and israeli politicians recognize that .
but they do n't have the political power to implement such a plan , just like the palestinian administration does not have the power to implement the fight against terrorism .
had the president used all his powers , had he been ready to send money and maybe even troops to ensure security , then he would have been able to push both governments into accepting his plan .
he has not done this since 2002 , and he 's obviously not ready to do it today .
in this respect , condoleezza rice 's mission is only lip service . has n't this conflict for some time been a proxy war , with iran and syria looking to gain influence on one side and the usa and the west on the other ? i think that syria can be separated from iran because syria wants to negotiate and make peace with israel , but the americans are preventing it .
the israeli government is n't excited about it because it does not have the power to relinquish the golan heights .
but it would have fundamentally accepted the syrian president 's offer that a way could have been found - if the americans were satisfied .
but they are not .
still , i believe there is a way .
all the peace plans since 2000 - from the first clinton plan to the bush plan and the quartet 's and the one from saudi arabia - have all had the same components .
everyone knows how the problem can and should actually be solved , but no one has the power to do it .
at its most basic , the problem is security .
if there were someone who was ready to put troops in the occupied territories after israel left them - robust troops that could actually provide security - then i think the governments would be strong enough to implement the various peace plans .
the only ones who can manage something like that today and also have the will to do so are the europeans - assuming that the americans do not object to it .
that 's where condoleezza rice as well as tony blair could be helpful . what step has to come next in order to move toward a realistic peace treaty ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new eu middle east envoy tony blair could help get eu nations to contribute troops the european union needs to draft a peace plan .
that 's not a problem since all the peace plans are similar anyhow .
but this time it should be an initiative from the european union to send robust troops to the middle east .
that does not have to be exclusively european troops , it could also include arab troops , such as from saudi arabia , egypt , jordan or islamic troops like the turks , and maybe even nato .
they should take over power in the occupied territories so that israel can leave the region .
but all of this can only happen if the american do are not against it . how great are your expectations for condoleezza rice 's visit and for her middle east conference in the fall ? very small , because , as i said , i expect that the american president is n't really behind it , and that it 's all just lip service for him .
and so everyone else , the israeli as well as the palestinian government , is also only going to pay it lip service .
i do n't know if the saudi government is going to take part in the conference as bush would like .
they wo n't do it if they are not sure that the americans are actually seriously behind it , and that is not the case .
i think the whole thing is just going to be a spectacle . ina rottscheidt interviewed avi primor -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

saying that the middle east 's powder keg is already explosive enough , foreign policy experts for germany 's governing coalition criticized us plans for military aid worth billions to saudi arabia and other gulf states . an official for the us defense department had said over the weekend that washington planned to give some $ 20 billion -lrb- 14.6 billion euros -rrb- in military assistance to saudi arabia and other states in the gulf region to modernize their armed forces and limit iran 's influence .
israel in return would receive $ 30.4 billion in military aid over the next decade - a significant increase to what the country received before .
while israeli officials have welcomed the plan , which was officially announced by us secretary of state condoleezza rice on monday , german parliamentarians have criticized it as a move that will further destabilize an already fragile region .
a high risk strategy ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruprecht polenz " if you add more explosive things to a powder keg - and that 's what the middle east is - you heighten the risk and do n't make the region safer in the end , " ruprecht polenz , the chairman of the foreign affairs committee in the german parliament , told frankfurter rundschau newspaper .
" in any case , it 's a high-risk strategy , " added polenz , a member of parliament for the conservative christian democratic union of chancellor angela merkel .
" the aim - to signal iran that a struggle for hegemony based on military might wo n't lead to success - can lead to the wrong reaction in tehran : to try harder and arm faster . "
polenz suggested that the german government should push for a regional security conference and - together with the eu - lobby others not to send arms to crisis regions .
a csce for the mideast ?
" instead , one should try to get a process started that 's similar to the conference on security and cooperation in europe -lsb- csce -rsb- in the 1970s : to discuss the region 's security problems with everyone involved , to build trust and maybe dampen armament or even encourage disarmament this way , " polenz said .
while saying that the idea to establish a middle east equivalent of the csce was nothing new , johannes jung , a member of the parliament 's foreign affairs committee for the social democratic party , said that this was more urgent than ever .
" the region needs disarmament and not armament , " he said , according to the web site of german newsmagazine der spiegel . article based on news reports -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , most german businessmen say they 'd like to have her as their boss .
can angela merkel do anything wrong ? being famous is surely a tough job .
just ask brad and angelina .
or that good old overachiever madonna , who consistently refuses to stay with her own age .
they all work so hard at preserving their image and compromise so much of their privacy just to remain on the covers of glossy magazines .
angela , on the other hand , makes fame appear easy .
wherever she goes , she is praised for her winning combination of diplomatic skills and unflinching perseverance .
during a recent eu summit , the german chancellor practically saved europe from the brink of a disaster .
for her , however , it 's all just part of the job .
no more and no less .
let 's not get touchy-feely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a moment to remember -lrb- and a hit on youtube -rrb- : angela getting a backrub from george w. bush germany 's top job has , of course , its perks .
in 2006 , for instance , merkel received a widely-publicized backrub from the embarrassingly easy-going us president george w. bush .
not many politicians can say that they were groped by the leader of the free world .
she attends festival openings and mingles with the glitterati , but remains oddly down-to-earth .
when asked about whether fame had changed her and whether her husband was noticing anything different about her , she answered in her usual , direct , matter-of-fact tone that the breakfast she was preparing for them was still the same .
even though she might have done so , it 's silly to picture margaret thatcher frying bacon and eggs , or even just heating up a serving of refried beans for that scary abomination that the british call their breakfast .
but it is not hard to imagine angela hovering over a stove .
it 's a surprisingly credible and comforting image .
it gives representative democracy a glimmer of hope that some politicians , once they climb to the top , can actually remain human beings .
that is , perhaps , one of the reasons why she remains extremely popular in germany .
she rules , literally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business leaders think that merkel would be a good boss business leaders seem to agree .
in a recent poll about politicians as potential business leaders , the german chancellor got very positive reviews .
when asked about which german politician they would accept as their boss , 81 percent of german managers said angela merkel .
at the same time , 70 percent of those polled said they thought the trained physicist was capable of running a large enterprise .
in comparison , germany 's economy minister , michael gloss , got only 42 of positive votes in this category , while labor minister franz müntefering rated even worse - with only 37 percent of votes .
so what does the career of angela merkel teach us about life in general - other than that still water runs deep and that breakfast is the most important meal of the day ?
it teaches us that an unassuming and soft-spoken woman can break barriers and achieve more than a pompous , cigar-smoking macho of the gerhard schröder variety .
the former chancellor would probably beg to differ , but his portrait is already hanging in the german chancellery , which means he 's been relegated to history .
old angela , new angela angela 's transformation from an awkward and stuttering newcomer in the world of schröders , stoibers and their mostly male buddies is best judged by the media coverage of her arrival to the glitzy opening of the bayreuth opera festival .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the days of heavy prespiration are over two years ago , germany was roaring with laughter because the light apricot jacket-skirt combo , which merkel wore for the opening , was soiled with sweat stains underneath her armpits .
this year , however , german tabloid bild went gaga over merkel 's fashion accessory du jour - a strap-on purse which the newspaper , known for its familiarity with hyperbole , described as a " floating magic bag . "
gracefully walking down the red carpet in a sweat-free lilac outfit - which , admittedly , some catty observers said resembled a combination of a business jacket and a potato sack - merkel waved at the onlookers with her right hand , while her left arm remained comfortably limp with an elegant bag attached to her wrist .
from certain angles , it looked like merkel 's purse was indeed hovering in the air .
in two years , merkel went from being sneered upon as an extra in a deodorant ad to being admired as a middle-aged , top-tier version of sarah jessica parker .
transformation is her forte .
and it is no surprise that most german managers think she would make a good boss . that is the miracle of merkel . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de at string of summits , merkel ready to serve the finest wine there can be no bargain without wine , goes a latin saying .
so it 's no surprise that germany 's chancellor angela merkel has personally handpicked the country 's best wines to serve at the upcoming eu and g8 summits .
-lrb- 07.03.2007 -rrb- bush vows " no backrubs " for merkel when president george w. bush hosted german chancellor angela merkel this week , he promised to behave and keep his hands to himself .
-lrb- 05.01.2007 -rrb- breakfast at angela 's reviewing her first year as chancellor , angela merkel revealed wednesday that leading a country - surprise , surprise - pretty much turns one 's life upside down .
but there 's at least one thing that 's remained unchanged .
-lrb- 22.11.2006 -rrb- feedback do you think that angela merkel will remain popular in the future ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang ischinger has a great deal of experience with the balkan region the 61-year old , who is the german ambassador to britain , is an expert on balkan affairs .
he was - together with us diplomat richard holbrooke - instrumental in brokering the 1995 dayton peace agreement which brought an end to the war in bosnia .
ischinger will be joining top us and russian diplomats under a scheme announced last week to negotiate the future status of the southern serbian province .
a new attempt the scheme was announced by the six members of the kosovo contact group , which said talks on the future status should take place in the form of an eu-us-russian troika .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for serbia , kosovo and its medieval monasteries have a great deal of symbolic value the six members - balkan experts from the us , russia , germany , france , britain and italy - announced it as an attempt to overcome the us-russian deadlock a week after russia blocked a resolution on a un plan to grant kosovo internationally-monitored independence .
kosovo leaders , however , warned on monday that they would not accept further delays in determining the province 's final status and would not give up their demands for independence .
" we consider that this will be the last delay and we will not accept any other deadlines , " said kosovo 's president fatmir sejdiu in an address to the province 's 120-seat parliament .
" further deadlines carry with them dangers not only in compromising the process but also raising concerns and tensions with unforeseeable consequences , " sejdiu said .
" we stress that kosovo 's independence is not negotiable . "
the role of russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo is currently run by the united nations in what was considered a surprise move , russia agreed to the troika format suggested by german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier at the eu foreign ministers ' meeting last monday , even though it previously insisted on keeping the process in the security council , where it holds veto power .
agreement has yet to be reached on the timing of a new round of talks .
the eu had suggested limiting negotiations to 120 days , while russia prefers open-ended talks .
diplomat frank wisner has been appointed to represent the us in the talks .
russia is yet to announce its representative .
opposing views the talks on the future of kosovo are bound to remain extremely difficult and are unlikely to bring any substantial improvements in the relations between belgrade and pristina .
kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority , frustrated by setbacks and delays , will accept nothing short of full independence .
belgrade , on the other hand , is only ready to grant far-reaching autonomy , fearing kosovo 's serb minority will be endangered in case of independence .
a unilateral declaration of independence by the province 's leadership could lead to a further destabilization of the region , diplomats fear . article based on news reports -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 30.07.2007 the miracle of merkel - is there anything angela ca n't do ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel remains extremely popular , both in germany and abroad she moves in high circles , hangs out at the opera and gets backrubs from the leader of the free world .
now , most german businessmen say they 'd like to have her as their boss .
can angela merkel do anything wrong ? being famous is surely a tough job .
just ask brad and angelina .
or that good old overachiever madonna , who consistently refuses to stay with her own age .
they all work so hard at preserving their image and compromise so much of their privacy just to remain on the covers of glossy magazines .
angela , on the other hand , makes fame appear easy .
wherever she goes , she is praised for her winning combination of diplomatic skills and unflinching perseverance .
during a recent eu summit , the german chancellor practically saved europe from the brink of a disaster .
for her , however , it 's all just part of the job .
no more and no less .
let 's not get touchy-feely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a moment to remember -lrb- and a hit on youtube -rrb- : angela getting a backrub from george w. bush germany 's top job has , of course , its perks .
in 2006 , for instance , merkel received a widely-publicized backrub from the embarrassingly easy-going us president george w. bush .
not many politicians can say that they were groped by the leader of the free world .
she attends festival openings and mingles with the glitterati , but remains oddly down-to-earth .
when asked about whether fame had changed her and whether her husband was noticing anything different about her , she answered in her usual , direct , matter-of-fact tone that the breakfast she was preparing for them was still the same .
even though she might have done so , it 's silly to picture margaret thatcher frying bacon and eggs , or even just heating up a serving of refried beans for that scary abomination that the british call their breakfast .
but it is not hard to imagine angela hovering over a stove .
it 's a surprisingly credible and comforting image .
it gives representative democracy a glimmer of hope that some politicians , once they climb to the top , can actually remain human beings .
that is , perhaps , one of the reasons why she remains extremely popular in germany .
she rules , literally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business leaders think that merkel would be a good boss business leaders seem to agree .
in a recent poll about politicians as potential business leaders , the german chancellor got very positive reviews .
when asked about which german politician they would accept as their boss , 81 percent of german managers said angela merkel .
at the same time , 70 percent of those polled said they thought the trained physicist was capable of running a large enterprise .
in comparison , germany 's economy minister , michael gloss , got only 42 of positive votes in this category , while labor minister franz müntefering rated even worse - with only 37 percent of votes .
so what does the career of angela merkel teach us about life in general - other than that still water runs deep and that breakfast is the most important meal of the day ?
it teaches us that an unassuming and soft-spoken woman can break barriers and achieve more than a pompous , cigar-smoking macho of the gerhard schröder variety .
the former chancellor would probably beg to differ , but his portrait is already hanging in the german chancellery , which means he 's been relegated to history .
old angela , new angela angela 's transformation from an awkward and stuttering newcomer in the world of schröders , stoibers and their mostly male buddies is best judged by the media coverage of her arrival to the glitzy opening of the bayreuth opera festival .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the days of heavy prespiration are over two years ago , germany was roaring with laughter because the light apricot jacket-skirt combo , which merkel wore for the opening , was soiled with sweat stains underneath her armpits .
this year , however , german tabloid bild went gaga over merkel 's fashion accessory du jour - a strap-on purse which the newspaper , known for its familiarity with hyperbole , described as a " floating magic bag . "
gracefully walking down the red carpet in a sweat-free lilac outfit - which , admittedly , some catty observers said resembled a combination of a business jacket and a potato sack - merkel waved at the onlookers with her right hand , while her left arm remained comfortably limp with an elegant bag attached to her wrist .
from certain angles , it looked like merkel 's purse was indeed hovering in the air .
in two years , merkel went from being sneered upon as an extra in a deodorant ad to being admired as a middle-aged , top-tier version of sarah jessica parker .
transformation is her forte .

now , most german businessmen say they 'd like to have her as their boss .
can angela merkel do anything wrong ? being famous is surely a tough job .
just ask brad and angelina .
or that good old overachiever madonna , who consistently refuses to stay with her own age .
they all work so hard at preserving their image and compromise so much of their privacy just to remain on the covers of glossy magazines .
angela , on the other hand , makes fame appear easy .
wherever she goes , she is praised for her winning combination of diplomatic skills and unflinching perseverance .
during a recent eu summit , the german chancellor practically saved europe from the brink of a disaster .
for her , however , it 's all just part of the job .
no more and no less .
let 's not get touchy-feely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a moment to remember -lrb- and a hit on youtube -rrb- : angela getting a backrub from george w. bush germany 's top job has , of course , its perks .
in 2006 , for instance , merkel received a widely-publicized backrub from the embarrassingly easy-going us president george w. bush .
not many politicians can say that they were groped by the leader of the free world .
she attends festival openings and mingles with the glitterati , but remains oddly down-to-earth .
when asked about whether fame had changed her and whether her husband was noticing anything different about her , she answered in her usual , direct , matter-of-fact tone that the breakfast she was preparing for them was still the same .
even though she might have done so , it 's silly to picture margaret thatcher frying bacon and eggs , or even just heating up a serving of refried beans for that scary abomination that the british call their breakfast .
but it is not hard to imagine angela hovering over a stove .
it 's a surprisingly credible and comforting image .
it gives representative democracy a glimmer of hope that some politicians , once they climb to the top , can actually remain human beings .
that is , perhaps , one of the reasons why she remains extremely popular in germany .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang ischinger has a great deal of experience with the balkan region the 61-year old , who is the german ambassador to britain , is an expert on balkan affairs .
he was - together with us diplomat richard holbrooke - instrumental in brokering the 1995 dayton peace agreement which brought an end to the war in bosnia .
ischinger will be joining top us and russian diplomats under a scheme announced last week to negotiate the future status of the southern serbian province .
a new attempt the scheme was announced by the six members of the kosovo contact group , which said talks on the future status should take place in the form of an eu-us-russian troika .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for serbia , kosovo and its medieval monasteries have a great deal of symbolic value the six members - balkan experts from the us , russia , germany , france , britain and italy - announced it as an attempt to overcome the us-russian deadlock a week after russia blocked a resolution on a un plan to grant kosovo internationally-monitored independence .
kosovo leaders , however , warned on monday that they would not accept further delays in determining the province 's final status and would not give up their demands for independence .
" we consider that this will be the last delay and we will not accept any other deadlines , " said kosovo 's president fatmir sejdiu in an address to the province 's 120-seat parliament .
" further deadlines carry with them dangers not only in compromising the process but also raising concerns and tensions with unforeseeable consequences , " sejdiu said .
" we stress that kosovo 's independence is not negotiable . "

agreement has yet to be reached on the timing of a new round of talks .
the eu had suggested limiting negotiations to 120 days , while russia prefers open-ended talks .
diplomat frank wisner has been appointed to represent the us in the talks .
russia is yet to announce its representative .
opposing views the talks on the future of kosovo are bound to remain extremely difficult and are unlikely to bring any substantial improvements in the relations between belgrade and pristina .
kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority , frustrated by setbacks and delays , will accept nothing short of full independence .
belgrade , on the other hand , is only ready to grant far-reaching autonomy , fearing kosovo 's serb minority will be endangered in case of independence .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang ischinger has a great deal of experience with the balkan region the 61-year old , who is the german ambassador to britain , is an expert on balkan affairs .
he was - together with us diplomat richard holbrooke - instrumental in brokering the 1995 dayton peace agreement which brought an end to the war in bosnia .
ischinger will be joining top us and russian diplomats under a scheme announced last week to negotiate the future status of the southern serbian province .
a new attempt the scheme was announced by the six members of the kosovo contact group , which said talks on the future status should take place in the form of an eu-us-russian troika .

kosovo leaders , however , warned on monday that they would not accept further delays in determining the province 's final status and would not give up their demands for independence .
" we consider that this will be the last delay and we will not accept any other deadlines , " said kosovo 's president fatmir sejdiu in an address to the province 's 120-seat parliament .
" further deadlines carry with them dangers not only in compromising the process but also raising concerns and tensions with unforeseeable consequences , " sejdiu said .

agreement has yet to be reached on the timing of a new round of talks .
the eu had suggested limiting negotiations to 120 days , while russia prefers open-ended talks .
diplomat frank wisner has been appointed to represent the us in the talks .
russia is yet to announce its representative .
opposing views the talks on the future of kosovo are bound to remain extremely difficult and are unlikely to bring any substantial improvements in the relations between belgrade and pristina .
kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority , frustrated by setbacks and delays , will accept nothing short of full independence .
belgrade , on the other hand , is only ready to grant far-reaching autonomy , fearing kosovo 's serb minority will be endangered in case of independence .

dw-world.de : palestinian president mahmoud abbas said last week that he thought a peace agreement could be reached by the end of 2008 .
one of the reasons he gave was because us secretary of state condoleezza rice assured him of it .
is it wishful thinking ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former israeli ambassador avi primor avi primor : i think abbas is an optimist because he really wants this solution .
he stands for compromise , he is for freedom , he is against terrorism .
but he has , unfortunately , little power , not only because hamas is his opponent and because he has already lost the gaza strip , but also because he has to fight hard in the west bank not to lose power to hamas there as well .
but that 's not really the point .
the question is what can condoleezza rice get started ?
us president bush gave a speech on july 16 in which he laid out a new peace plan and called for an international conference , to be attended by condoleezza rice , in the autumn .
so now the one who has to actually implement the peace plan is condoleezza rice . will condoleezza rice be accepted by all sides as an acceptable negotiating partner during these talks ? she will be accepted by everyone , without a doubt .
i have my doubts about whether she will have the power of the president behind her to actually force a particular direction - because this new peace process needs to be forced .
i do not think that the president is serious about this peace plan , but that he is paying lip service to it to ease pressure from condoleezza rice .
so he can say , " okay , go play a little with the israelis and the palestinians and maybe you can invite a few other arab countries to your conference , saudi arabia would be ideal , but i do n't expect much of it . "
i remember that condoleezza rice wanted to support then president of the world bank james wolfensohn , blair 's processor as middle east envoy , but that she did not have the support of her president and she failed , just as mr. wolfensohn did .
nothing has changed since then , and i do not think that bush , at the end of his term , is really aiming to get something started ; even though he has all the means to do so if he wanted . what kinds of powers would condoleezza rice have to receive to make the plan more than lip service ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice will need the president 's complete support to reach a deal bush 's peace plan put forth several components that he had previously mentioned in his first speech dealing with the middle east in 2002 , so it is a bit of a repetition : israel has to leave its settlements , the palestinians have to fight terrorism , a compromise for jerusalem needs to be reached , the problem of refugees needs to be solved , an independent palestinian state needs to be build and recognized and cooperated with .
these are all great things and israeli politicians recognize that .
but they do n't have the political power to implement such a plan , just like the palestinian administration does not have the power to implement the fight against terrorism .
had the president used all his powers , had he been ready to send money and maybe even troops to ensure security , then he would have been able to push both governments into accepting his plan .
he has not done this since 2002 , and he 's obviously not ready to do it today .
in this respect , condoleezza rice 's mission is only lip service . has n't this conflict for some time been a proxy war , with iran and syria looking to gain influence on one side and the usa and the west on the other ? i think that syria can be separated from iran because syria wants to negotiate and make peace with israel , but the americans are preventing it .
the israeli government is n't excited about it because it does not have the power to relinquish the golan heights .
but it would have fundamentally accepted the syrian president 's offer that a way could have been found - if the americans were satisfied .
but they are not .
still , i believe there is a way .
all the peace plans since 2000 - from the first clinton plan to the bush plan and the quartet 's and the one from saudi arabia - have all had the same components .
everyone knows how the problem can and should actually be solved , but no one has the power to do it .
at its most basic , the problem is security .
if there were someone who was ready to put troops in the occupied territories after israel left them - robust troops that could actually provide security - then i think the governments would be strong enough to implement the various peace plans .
the only ones who can manage something like that today and also have the will to do so are the europeans - assuming that the americans do not object to it .
that 's where condoleezza rice as well as tony blair could be helpful . what step has to come next in order to move toward a realistic peace treaty ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new eu middle east envoy tony blair could help get eu nations to contribute troops the european union needs to draft a peace plan .
that 's not a problem since all the peace plans are similar anyhow .
but this time it should be an initiative from the european union to send robust troops to the middle east .
that does not have to be exclusively european troops , it could also include arab troops , such as from saudi arabia , egypt , jordan or islamic troops like the turks , and maybe even nato .
they should take over power in the occupied territories so that israel can leave the region .
but all of this can only happen if the american do are not against it . how great are your expectations for condoleezza rice 's visit and for her middle east conference in the fall ? very small , because , as i said , i expect that the american president is n't really behind it , and that it 's all just lip service for him .
and so everyone else , the israeli as well as the palestinian government , is also only going to pay it lip service .
i do n't know if the saudi government is going to take part in the conference as bush would like .
they wo n't do it if they are not sure that the americans are actually seriously behind it , and that is not the case .
i think the whole thing is just going to be a spectacle . ina rottscheidt interviewed avi primor -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

saying that the middle east 's powder keg is already explosive enough , foreign policy experts for germany 's governing coalition criticized us plans for military aid worth billions to saudi arabia and other gulf states . an official for the us defense department had said over the weekend that washington planned to give some $ 20 billion -lrb- 14.6 billion euros -rrb- in military assistance to saudi arabia and other states in the gulf region to modernize their armed forces and limit iran 's influence .
israel in return would receive $ 30.4 billion in military aid over the next decade - a significant increase to what the country received before .
while israeli officials have welcomed the plan , which was officially announced by us secretary of state condoleezza rice on monday , german parliamentarians have criticized it as a move that will further destabilize an already fragile region .
a high risk strategy ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruprecht polenz " if you add more explosive things to a powder keg - and that 's what the middle east is - you heighten the risk and do n't make the region safer in the end , " ruprecht polenz , the chairman of the foreign affairs committee in the german parliament , told frankfurter rundschau newspaper .
" in any case , it 's a high-risk strategy , " added polenz , a member of parliament for the conservative christian democratic union of chancellor angela merkel .
" the aim - to signal iran that a struggle for hegemony based on military might wo n't lead to success - can lead to the wrong reaction in tehran : to try harder and arm faster . "
polenz suggested that the german government should push for a regional security conference and - together with the eu - lobby others not to send arms to crisis regions .
a csce for the mideast ?
" instead , one should try to get a process started that 's similar to the conference on security and cooperation in europe -lsb- csce -rsb- in the 1970s : to discuss the region 's security problems with everyone involved , to build trust and maybe dampen armament or even encourage disarmament this way , " polenz said .
while saying that the idea to establish a middle east equivalent of the csce was nothing new , johannes jung , a member of the parliament 's foreign affairs committee for the social democratic party , said that this was more urgent than ever .
" the region needs disarmament and not armament , " he said , according to the web site of german newsmagazine der spiegel . article based on news reports -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de : palestinian president mahmoud abbas said last week that he thought a peace agreement could be reached by the end of 2008 .
one of the reasons he gave was because us secretary of state condoleezza rice assured him of it .
is it wishful thinking ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former israeli ambassador avi primor avi primor : i think abbas is an optimist because he really wants this solution .
he stands for compromise , he is for freedom , he is against terrorism .
but he has , unfortunately , little power , not only because hamas is his opponent and because he has already lost the gaza strip , but also because he has to fight hard in the west bank not to lose power to hamas there as well .
but that 's not really the point .
the question is what can condoleezza rice get started ?
us president bush gave a speech on july 16 in which he laid out a new peace plan and called for an international conference , to be attended by condoleezza rice , in the autumn .
so now the one who has to actually implement the peace plan is condoleezza rice . will condoleezza rice be accepted by all sides as an acceptable negotiating partner during these talks ? she will be accepted by everyone , without a doubt .
i have my doubts about whether she will have the power of the president behind her to actually force a particular direction - because this new peace process needs to be forced .
i do not think that the president is serious about this peace plan , but that he is paying lip service to it to ease pressure from condoleezza rice .
so he can say , " okay , go play a little with the israelis and the palestinians and maybe you can invite a few other arab countries to your conference , saudi arabia would be ideal , but i do n't expect much of it . "
i remember that condoleezza rice wanted to support then president of the world bank james wolfensohn , blair 's processor as middle east envoy , but that she did not have the support of her president and she failed , just as mr. wolfensohn did .
nothing has changed since then , and i do not think that bush , at the end of his term , is really aiming to get something started ; even though he has all the means to do so if he wanted . what kinds of powers would condoleezza rice have to receive to make the plan more than lip service ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice will need the president 's complete support to reach a deal bush 's peace plan put forth several components that he had previously mentioned in his first speech dealing with the middle east in 2002 , so it is a bit of a repetition : israel has to leave its settlements , the palestinians have to fight terrorism , a compromise for jerusalem needs to be reached , the problem of refugees needs to be solved , an independent palestinian state needs to be build and recognized and cooperated with .
these are all great things and israeli politicians recognize that .
but they do n't have the political power to implement such a plan , just like the palestinian administration does not have the power to implement the fight against terrorism .
had the president used all his powers , had he been ready to send money and maybe even troops to ensure security , then he would have been able to push both governments into accepting his plan .
he has not done this since 2002 , and he 's obviously not ready to do it today .
in this respect , condoleezza rice 's mission is only lip service . has n't this conflict for some time been a proxy war , with iran and syria looking to gain influence on one side and the usa and the west on the other ? i think that syria can be separated from iran because syria wants to negotiate and make peace with israel , but the americans are preventing it .
the israeli government is n't excited about it because it does not have the power to relinquish the golan heights .
but it would have fundamentally accepted the syrian president 's offer that a way could have been found - if the americans were satisfied .
but they are not .
still , i believe there is a way .
all the peace plans since 2000 - from the first clinton plan to the bush plan and the quartet 's and the one from saudi arabia - have all had the same components .
everyone knows how the problem can and should actually be solved , but no one has the power to do it .
at its most basic , the problem is security .
if there were someone who was ready to put troops in the occupied territories after israel left them - robust troops that could actually provide security - then i think the governments would be strong enough to implement the various peace plans .
the only ones who can manage something like that today and also have the will to do so are the europeans - assuming that the americans do not object to it .
that 's where condoleezza rice as well as tony blair could be helpful . what step has to come next in order to move toward a realistic peace treaty ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new eu middle east envoy tony blair could help get eu nations to contribute troops the european union needs to draft a peace plan .
that 's not a problem since all the peace plans are similar anyhow .
but this time it should be an initiative from the european union to send robust troops to the middle east .
that does not have to be exclusively european troops , it could also include arab troops , such as from saudi arabia , egypt , jordan or islamic troops like the turks , and maybe even nato .
they should take over power in the occupied territories so that israel can leave the region .
but all of this can only happen if the american do are not against it . how great are your expectations for condoleezza rice 's visit and for her middle east conference in the fall ? very small , because , as i said , i expect that the american president is n't really behind it , and that it 's all just lip service for him .
and so everyone else , the israeli as well as the palestinian government , is also only going to pay it lip service .
i do n't know if the saudi government is going to take part in the conference as bush would like .
they wo n't do it if they are not sure that the americans are actually seriously behind it , and that is not the case .
i think the whole thing is just going to be a spectacle . ina rottscheidt interviewed avi primor -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

saying that the middle east 's powder keg is already explosive enough , foreign policy experts for germany 's governing coalition criticized us plans for military aid worth billions to saudi arabia and other gulf states . an official for the us defense department had said over the weekend that washington planned to give some $ 20 billion -lrb- 14.6 billion euros -rrb- in military assistance to saudi arabia and other states in the gulf region to modernize their armed forces and limit iran 's influence .
israel in return would receive $ 30.4 billion in military aid over the next decade - a significant increase to what the country received before .
while israeli officials have welcomed the plan , which was officially announced by us secretary of state condoleezza rice on monday , german parliamentarians have criticized it as a move that will further destabilize an already fragile region .

" we have duties to discharge and responsibilities to keep in support of the democratically elected government and in support of the explicit will of the international community , " brown said in his first press conference with bush since becoming prime minister in june . finding common ground bush and brown met at the camp david presidential retreat outside washington for two days of talks that began sunday amid a great deal of speculation as to whether the leaders would enjoy the close relationship bush has with brown 's predecessor tony blair . bush too sought to cast aside any questions about his ability to work with brown while emphasizing the close ties between the united states and britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two leaders , seen here in a golf cart , demonstrated they get along " so everybody 's wondering whether or not the prime minister and i were able to find common ground , to get along , to have a meaningful discussion , " bush said .
" and the answer is absolutely . " brown gave no promises on how long britain would maintain its forces in iraq , saying only that a decision to hand over control for security in basra province to iraqi forces would be based on military advice . " we intend to move to overwatch in the fourth province , and that decision will be made on the military advice of our commanders on the ground , " brown said . bush stressed that the two allies would work together towards securing peace in iraq . " there is no doubt in my mind that gordon brown understands that failure in iraq would be a disaster for the security of our own countries , " bush said . he said his relationship with brown would be " a constructive strategic relationship for the good of our peoples . " cracking down on iran bush and brown also discussed the humanitarian crisis in sudan 's darfur region and the us-eu effort to forge a trade plan to help boost the world 's underdeveloped economies . on iran , the two leaders agreed on the need to pursue tougher sanctions over the country 's covert nuclear program . " we 're in agreement that sanctions are working and the next stage we are ready to move towards is to toughen the sanctions with a further un resolution , " brown said . brown arrived sunday at camp david , his first visit to the united states since succeeding blair june 27 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown did not specify how long britain would maintain its forces in iraq bush enjoyed a close personal relationship and political partnership with blair , who stood by bush over the war in iraq despite the british public 's strong disapproval of blair 's decision to order british participation in the 2003 invasion . the continuing struggle in iraq helped to undermine blair and sped his departure from downing street .
observers believe brown will stake out a more businesslike relationship with bush that will emphasize common goals between the two countries . bush has also faced deep opposition to the conflict in iraq at home and increasing calls to set a timeframe for withdrawing us troops . on tuesday , brown will hold talks with un secretary-general ban ki-moon in new york and give a speech at the world body . article based on news reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

afghan president hamid karzai had accused the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- of killing about 90 civilians in june , most of them in air operations .
karzai said that the casualties could damage support for the presence of foreign troops in the country .
smaller bombs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer more than 330 civilians have been killed during fighting involving foreign troops in afghanistan this year so far , according to afghan officials and western aid workers , reuters news agency reported .
scheffer said that nato officials were " working with weapons load on aircraft to reduce collateral damage . "
a nato diplomat told the financial times newspaper that using 250 kg -lrb- about 500 pounds -rrb- bombs rather than 500 kg bombs would " make a huge amount of difference " in terms of casualties .
nato officials also said that the afghan army should increasingly take on house-to-house searches to avoid confrontations .
no need to rush scheffer also said that nato troops would hold off on attacks against the taliban if the number of civilian casualties would run too high as the result of an attack .
" we realize that , if we can not neutralize our enemy today without harming civilians , our enemy will give us the opportunity tomorrow , " scheffer told the paper .
" if that means going after the taliban not on wednesday but on thusday , we will get him then . "
scheffer added , however , that it was impossible to avoid civilian casualties altogether .

dw-world.de : palestinian president mahmoud abbas said last week that he thought a peace agreement could be reached by the end of 2008 .
one of the reasons he gave was because us secretary of state condoleezza rice assured him of it .
is it wishful thinking ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former israeli ambassador avi primor avi primor : i think abbas is an optimist because he really wants this solution .
he stands for compromise , he is for freedom , he is against terrorism .
but he has , unfortunately , little power , not only because hamas is his opponent and because he has already lost the gaza strip , but also because he has to fight hard in the west bank not to lose power to hamas there as well .
but that 's not really the point .
the question is what can condoleezza rice get started ?
us president bush gave a speech on july 16 in which he laid out a new peace plan and called for an international conference , to be attended by condoleezza rice , in the autumn .
so now the one who has to actually implement the peace plan is condoleezza rice . will condoleezza rice be accepted by all sides as an acceptable negotiating partner during these talks ? she will be accepted by everyone , without a doubt .
i have my doubts about whether she will have the power of the president behind her to actually force a particular direction - because this new peace process needs to be forced .
i do not think that the president is serious about this peace plan , but that he is paying lip service to it to ease pressure from condoleezza rice .
so he can say , " okay , go play a little with the israelis and the palestinians and maybe you can invite a few other arab countries to your conference , saudi arabia would be ideal , but i do n't expect much of it . "
i remember that condoleezza rice wanted to support then president of the world bank james wolfensohn , blair 's processor as middle east envoy , but that she did not have the support of her president and she failed , just as mr. wolfensohn did .
nothing has changed since then , and i do not think that bush , at the end of his term , is really aiming to get something started ; even though he has all the means to do so if he wanted . what kinds of powers would condoleezza rice have to receive to make the plan more than lip service ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice will need the president 's complete support to reach a deal bush 's peace plan put forth several components that he had previously mentioned in his first speech dealing with the middle east in 2002 , so it is a bit of a repetition : israel has to leave its settlements , the palestinians have to fight terrorism , a compromise for jerusalem needs to be reached , the problem of refugees needs to be solved , an independent palestinian state needs to be build and recognized and cooperated with .
these are all great things and israeli politicians recognize that .
but they do n't have the political power to implement such a plan , just like the palestinian administration does not have the power to implement the fight against terrorism .
had the president used all his powers , had he been ready to send money and maybe even troops to ensure security , then he would have been able to push both governments into accepting his plan .
he has not done this since 2002 , and he 's obviously not ready to do it today .
in this respect , condoleezza rice 's mission is only lip service . has n't this conflict for some time been a proxy war , with iran and syria looking to gain influence on one side and the usa and the west on the other ? i think that syria can be separated from iran because syria wants to negotiate and make peace with israel , but the americans are preventing it .
the israeli government is n't excited about it because it does not have the power to relinquish the golan heights .
but it would have fundamentally accepted the syrian president 's offer that a way could have been found - if the americans were satisfied .
but they are not .
still , i believe there is a way .
all the peace plans since 2000 - from the first clinton plan to the bush plan and the quartet 's and the one from saudi arabia - have all had the same components .
everyone knows how the problem can and should actually be solved , but no one has the power to do it .
at its most basic , the problem is security .
if there were someone who was ready to put troops in the occupied territories after israel left them - robust troops that could actually provide security - then i think the governments would be strong enough to implement the various peace plans .
the only ones who can manage something like that today and also have the will to do so are the europeans - assuming that the americans do not object to it .
that 's where condoleezza rice as well as tony blair could be helpful . what step has to come next in order to move toward a realistic peace treaty ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new eu middle east envoy tony blair could help get eu nations to contribute troops the european union needs to draft a peace plan .
that 's not a problem since all the peace plans are similar anyhow .
but this time it should be an initiative from the european union to send robust troops to the middle east .
that does not have to be exclusively european troops , it could also include arab troops , such as from saudi arabia , egypt , jordan or islamic troops like the turks , and maybe even nato .
they should take over power in the occupied territories so that israel can leave the region .
but all of this can only happen if the american do are not against it . how great are your expectations for condoleezza rice 's visit and for her middle east conference in the fall ? very small , because , as i said , i expect that the american president is n't really behind it , and that it 's all just lip service for him .
and so everyone else , the israeli as well as the palestinian government , is also only going to pay it lip service .
i do n't know if the saudi government is going to take part in the conference as bush would like .
they wo n't do it if they are not sure that the americans are actually seriously behind it , and that is not the case .

in this respect , condoleezza rice 's mission is only lip service . has n't this conflict for some time been a proxy war , with iran and syria looking to gain influence on one side and the usa and the west on the other ? i think that syria can be separated from iran because syria wants to negotiate and make peace with israel , but the americans are preventing it .
the israeli government is n't excited about it because it does not have the power to relinquish the golan heights .
but it would have fundamentally accepted the syrian president 's offer that a way could have been found - if the americans were satisfied .
but they are not .
still , i believe there is a way .
all the peace plans since 2000 - from the first clinton plan to the bush plan and the quartet 's and the one from saudi arabia - have all had the same components .
everyone knows how the problem can and should actually be solved , but no one has the power to do it .
at its most basic , the problem is security .
if there were someone who was ready to put troops in the occupied territories after israel left them - robust troops that could actually provide security - then i think the governments would be strong enough to implement the various peace plans .
the only ones who can manage something like that today and also have the will to do so are the europeans - assuming that the americans do not object to it .
that 's where condoleezza rice as well as tony blair could be helpful . what step has to come next in order to move toward a realistic peace treaty ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new eu middle east envoy tony blair could help get eu nations to contribute troops the european union needs to draft a peace plan .
that 's not a problem since all the peace plans are similar anyhow .
but this time it should be an initiative from the european union to send robust troops to the middle east .
that does not have to be exclusively european troops , it could also include arab troops , such as from saudi arabia , egypt , jordan or islamic troops like the turks , and maybe even nato .
they should take over power in the occupied territories so that israel can leave the region .
but all of this can only happen if the american do are not against it . how great are your expectations for condoleezza rice 's visit and for her middle east conference in the fall ? very small , because , as i said , i expect that the american president is n't really behind it , and that it 's all just lip service for him .
and so everyone else , the israeli as well as the palestinian government , is also only going to pay it lip service .
i do n't know if the saudi government is going to take part in the conference as bush would like .
they wo n't do it if they are not sure that the americans are actually seriously behind it , and that is not the case .
i think the whole thing is just going to be a spectacle . ina rottscheidt interviewed avi primor -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gadhafi -lrb- left -rrb- with sarkozy in tripoli last week the deal has been criticized by german and eu officials , who see the plan as a threat to nuclear non-proliferation efforts .
siemens owns a third of the company that is expected to supply the nuclear technology , areva np , leading german politicians to call on the company to rethink its involvement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael müller " we must know what siemens will say about this immoral deal , " michael müller , a social democrat and the parliamentary state secretary at germany 's environment ministry , told handelsblatt newspaper .
he added that similar deals are often organized via foreign subsidiaries .
" there are a lot of strange cases like this in the atomic energy sector , " müller said .
playing with fire ?
he received backing from margareta wolf , the foreign affairs spokeswoman of the opposition greens party .
" siemens would be wise in terms of its image and its responsibilities not to play with fire with this , " she told the paper .
siemens declined to comment on the story , telling handelsblatt reporters to contact areva np instead .
germany this week stepped up criticism of the nuclear deal between paris and tripoli , saying neither the eu nor berlin had been informed of the plans .
ruprecht polenz of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- said the nuclear deal was " a bitter pill to swallow for the eu . "
in an interview with german paper , tagesspiegel am sonntag , polenz said it sent a wrong signal to the middle east .
he criticized france 's unilateral move , saying it weakened europe 's capability to act on the foreign policy front .
the german government 's deputy press spokesman , thomas steg , however rejected reports suggesting the deal would put a strain on franco-german relations .
" the franco-german relationship is excellent , " steg said , pointing out that unlike iran , libya had stressed its willingness for international cooperation and underlined it would not use nuclear technology to produce weapons . article based on news reports -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

afghan president hamid karzai had accused the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- of killing about 90 civilians in june , most of them in air operations .
karzai said that the casualties could damage support for the presence of foreign troops in the country .
smaller bombs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer more than 330 civilians have been killed during fighting involving foreign troops in afghanistan this year so far , according to afghan officials and western aid workers , reuters news agency reported .
scheffer said that nato officials were " working with weapons load on aircraft to reduce collateral damage . "
a nato diplomat told the financial times newspaper that using 250 kg -lrb- about 500 pounds -rrb- bombs rather than 500 kg bombs would " make a huge amount of difference " in terms of casualties .
nato officials also said that the afghan army should increasingly take on house-to-house searches to avoid confrontations .
no need to rush scheffer also said that nato troops would hold off on attacks against the taliban if the number of civilian casualties would run too high as the result of an attack .
" we realize that , if we can not neutralize our enemy today without harming civilians , our enemy will give us the opportunity tomorrow , " scheffer told the paper .
" if that means going after the taliban not on wednesday but on thusday , we will get him then . "
scheffer added , however , that it was impossible to avoid civilian casualties altogether .
more than 50,000 foreign soldiers are currently stationed in afghanistan , including some 3,000 germans . article based on news reports -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gadhafi -lrb- left -rrb- with sarkozy in tripoli last week the deal has been criticized by german and eu officials , who see the plan as a threat to nuclear non-proliferation efforts .
siemens owns a third of the company that is expected to supply the nuclear technology , areva np , leading german politicians to call on the company to rethink its involvement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael müller " we must know what siemens will say about this immoral deal , " michael müller , a social democrat and the parliamentary state secretary at germany 's environment ministry , told handelsblatt newspaper .

" there are a lot of strange cases like this in the atomic energy sector , " müller said .
playing with fire ?
he received backing from margareta wolf , the foreign affairs spokeswoman of the opposition greens party .
" siemens would be wise in terms of its image and its responsibilities not to play with fire with this , " she told the paper .
siemens declined to comment on the story , telling handelsblatt reporters to contact areva np instead .
germany this week stepped up criticism of the nuclear deal between paris and tripoli , saying neither the eu nor berlin had been informed of the plans .
ruprecht polenz of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- said the nuclear deal was " a bitter pill to swallow for the eu . "
in an interview with german paper , tagesspiegel am sonntag , polenz said it sent a wrong signal to the middle east .
he criticized france 's unilateral move , saying it weakened europe 's capability to act on the foreign policy front .
the german government 's deputy press spokesman , thomas steg , however rejected reports suggesting the deal would put a strain on franco-german relations .
" the franco-german relationship is excellent , " steg said , pointing out that unlike iran , libya had stressed its willingness for international cooperation and underlined it would not use nuclear technology to produce weapons . article based on news reports -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruprecht polenz " if you add more explosive things to a powder keg - and that 's what the middle east is - you heighten the risk and do n't make the region safer in the end , " ruprecht polenz , the chairman of the foreign affairs committee in the german parliament , told frankfurter rundschau newspaper .
" in any case , it 's a high-risk strategy , " added polenz , a member of parliament for the conservative christian democratic union of chancellor angela merkel .
" the aim - to signal iran that a struggle for hegemony based on military might wo n't lead to success - can lead to the wrong reaction in tehran : to try harder and arm faster . "
polenz suggested that the german government should push for a regional security conference and - together with the eu - lobby others not to send arms to crisis regions .

while saying that the idea to establish a middle east equivalent of the csce was nothing new , johannes jung , a member of the parliament 's foreign affairs committee for the social democratic party , said that this was more urgent than ever .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 30.07.2007 the miracle of merkel - is there anything angela ca n't do ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel remains extremely popular , both in germany and abroad she moves in high circles , hangs out at the opera and gets backrubs from the leader of the free world .
now , most german businessmen say they 'd like to have her as their boss .
can angela merkel do anything wrong ? being famous is surely a tough job .
just ask brad and angelina .
or that good old overachiever madonna , who consistently refuses to stay with her own age .
they all work so hard at preserving their image and compromise so much of their privacy just to remain on the covers of glossy magazines .
angela , on the other hand , makes fame appear easy .
wherever she goes , she is praised for her winning combination of diplomatic skills and unflinching perseverance .
during a recent eu summit , the german chancellor practically saved europe from the brink of a disaster .
for her , however , it 's all just part of the job .
no more and no less .
let 's not get touchy-feely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a moment to remember -lrb- and a hit on youtube -rrb- : angela getting a backrub from george w. bush germany 's top job has , of course , its perks .
in 2006 , for instance , merkel received a widely-publicized backrub from the embarrassingly easy-going us president george w. bush .
not many politicians can say that they were groped by the leader of the free world .
she attends festival openings and mingles with the glitterati , but remains oddly down-to-earth .
when asked about whether fame had changed her and whether her husband was noticing anything different about her , she answered in her usual , direct , matter-of-fact tone that the breakfast she was preparing for them was still the same .
even though she might have done so , it 's silly to picture margaret thatcher frying bacon and eggs , or even just heating up a serving of refried beans for that scary abomination that the british call their breakfast .
but it is not hard to imagine angela hovering over a stove .
it 's a surprisingly credible and comforting image .
it gives representative democracy a glimmer of hope that some politicians , once they climb to the top , can actually remain human beings .
that is , perhaps , one of the reasons why she remains extremely popular in germany .
she rules , literally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business leaders think that merkel would be a good boss business leaders seem to agree .
in a recent poll about politicians as potential business leaders , the german chancellor got very positive reviews .
when asked about which german politician they would accept as their boss , 81 percent of german managers said angela merkel .
at the same time , 70 percent of those polled said they thought the trained physicist was capable of running a large enterprise .
in comparison , germany 's economy minister , michael gloss , got only 42 of positive votes in this category , while labor minister franz müntefering rated even worse - with only 37 percent of votes .
so what does the career of angela merkel teach us about life in general - other than that still water runs deep and that breakfast is the most important meal of the day ?
it teaches us that an unassuming and soft-spoken woman can break barriers and achieve more than a pompous , cigar-smoking macho of the gerhard schröder variety .
the former chancellor would probably beg to differ , but his portrait is already hanging in the german chancellery , which means he 's been relegated to history .
old angela , new angela angela 's transformation from an awkward and stuttering newcomer in the world of schröders , stoibers and their mostly male buddies is best judged by the media coverage of her arrival to the glitzy opening of the bayreuth opera festival .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the days of heavy prespiration are over two years ago , germany was roaring with laughter because the light apricot jacket-skirt combo , which merkel wore for the opening , was soiled with sweat stains underneath her armpits .
this year , however , german tabloid bild went gaga over merkel 's fashion accessory du jour - a strap-on purse which the newspaper , known for its familiarity with hyperbole , described as a " floating magic bag . "
gracefully walking down the red carpet in a sweat-free lilac outfit - which , admittedly , some catty observers said resembled a combination of a business jacket and a potato sack - merkel waved at the onlookers with her right hand , while her left arm remained comfortably limp with an elegant bag attached to her wrist .
from certain angles , it looked like merkel 's purse was indeed hovering in the air .

afghan president hamid karzai had accused the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- of killing about 90 civilians in june , most of them in air operations .
karzai said that the casualties could damage support for the presence of foreign troops in the country .
smaller bombs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer more than 330 civilians have been killed during fighting involving foreign troops in afghanistan this year so far , according to afghan officials and western aid workers , reuters news agency reported .
scheffer said that nato officials were " working with weapons load on aircraft to reduce collateral damage . "
a nato diplomat told the financial times newspaper that using 250 kg -lrb- about 500 pounds -rrb- bombs rather than 500 kg bombs would " make a huge amount of difference " in terms of casualties .
nato officials also said that the afghan army should increasingly take on house-to-house searches to avoid confrontations .
no need to rush scheffer also said that nato troops would hold off on attacks against the taliban if the number of civilian casualties would run too high as the result of an attack .
" we realize that , if we can not neutralize our enemy today without harming civilians , our enemy will give us the opportunity tomorrow , " scheffer told the paper .
" if that means going after the taliban not on wednesday but on thusday , we will get him then . "
scheffer added , however , that it was impossible to avoid civilian casualties altogether .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 30.07.2007 the miracle of merkel - is there anything angela ca n't do ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel remains extremely popular , both in germany and abroad she moves in high circles , hangs out at the opera and gets backrubs from the leader of the free world .
now , most german businessmen say they 'd like to have her as their boss .
can angela merkel do anything wrong ? being famous is surely a tough job .
just ask brad and angelina .
or that good old overachiever madonna , who consistently refuses to stay with her own age .
they all work so hard at preserving their image and compromise so much of their privacy just to remain on the covers of glossy magazines .
angela , on the other hand , makes fame appear easy .
wherever she goes , she is praised for her winning combination of diplomatic skills and unflinching perseverance .
during a recent eu summit , the german chancellor practically saved europe from the brink of a disaster .
for her , however , it 's all just part of the job .
no more and no less .
let 's not get touchy-feely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a moment to remember -lrb- and a hit on youtube -rrb- : angela getting a backrub from george w. bush germany 's top job has , of course , its perks .
in 2006 , for instance , merkel received a widely-publicized backrub from the embarrassingly easy-going us president george w. bush .
not many politicians can say that they were groped by the leader of the free world .
she attends festival openings and mingles with the glitterati , but remains oddly down-to-earth .
when asked about whether fame had changed her and whether her husband was noticing anything different about her , she answered in her usual , direct , matter-of-fact tone that the breakfast she was preparing for them was still the same .
even though she might have done so , it 's silly to picture margaret thatcher frying bacon and eggs , or even just heating up a serving of refried beans for that scary abomination that the british call their breakfast .
but it is not hard to imagine angela hovering over a stove .
it 's a surprisingly credible and comforting image .
it gives representative democracy a glimmer of hope that some politicians , once they climb to the top , can actually remain human beings .
that is , perhaps , one of the reasons why she remains extremely popular in germany .
she rules , literally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business leaders think that merkel would be a good boss business leaders seem to agree .
in a recent poll about politicians as potential business leaders , the german chancellor got very positive reviews .
when asked about which german politician they would accept as their boss , 81 percent of german managers said angela merkel .
at the same time , 70 percent of those polled said they thought the trained physicist was capable of running a large enterprise .
in comparison , germany 's economy minister , michael gloss , got only 42 of positive votes in this category , while labor minister franz müntefering rated even worse - with only 37 percent of votes .
so what does the career of angela merkel teach us about life in general - other than that still water runs deep and that breakfast is the most important meal of the day ?
it teaches us that an unassuming and soft-spoken woman can break barriers and achieve more than a pompous , cigar-smoking macho of the gerhard schröder variety .
the former chancellor would probably beg to differ , but his portrait is already hanging in the german chancellery , which means he 's been relegated to history .
old angela , new angela angela 's transformation from an awkward and stuttering newcomer in the world of schröders , stoibers and their mostly male buddies is best judged by the media coverage of her arrival to the glitzy opening of the bayreuth opera festival .

that is , perhaps , one of the reasons why she remains extremely popular in germany .
she rules , literally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business leaders think that merkel would be a good boss business leaders seem to agree .
in a recent poll about politicians as potential business leaders , the german chancellor got very positive reviews .
when asked about which german politician they would accept as their boss , 81 percent of german managers said angela merkel .
at the same time , 70 percent of those polled said they thought the trained physicist was capable of running a large enterprise .
in comparison , germany 's economy minister , michael gloss , got only 42 of positive votes in this category , while labor minister franz müntefering rated even worse - with only 37 percent of votes .
so what does the career of angela merkel teach us about life in general - other than that still water runs deep and that breakfast is the most important meal of the day ?
it teaches us that an unassuming and soft-spoken woman can break barriers and achieve more than a pompous , cigar-smoking macho of the gerhard schröder variety .

afghan president hamid karzai had accused the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- of killing about 90 civilians in june , most of them in air operations .
karzai said that the casualties could damage support for the presence of foreign troops in the country .
smaller bombs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer more than 330 civilians have been killed during fighting involving foreign troops in afghanistan this year so far , according to afghan officials and western aid workers , reuters news agency reported .
scheffer said that nato officials were " working with weapons load on aircraft to reduce collateral damage . "
a nato diplomat told the financial times newspaper that using 250 kg -lrb- about 500 pounds -rrb- bombs rather than 500 kg bombs would " make a huge amount of difference " in terms of casualties .
nato officials also said that the afghan army should increasingly take on house-to-house searches to avoid confrontations .
no need to rush scheffer also said that nato troops would hold off on attacks against the taliban if the number of civilian casualties would run too high as the result of an attack .
" we realize that , if we can not neutralize our enemy today without harming civilians , our enemy will give us the opportunity tomorrow , " scheffer told the paper .
" if that means going after the taliban not on wednesday but on thusday , we will get him then . "
scheffer added , however , that it was impossible to avoid civilian casualties altogether .

for her , however , it 's all just part of the job .
no more and no less .
let 's not get touchy-feely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a moment to remember -lrb- and a hit on youtube -rrb- : angela getting a backrub from george w. bush germany 's top job has , of course , its perks .
in 2006 , for instance , merkel received a widely-publicized backrub from the embarrassingly easy-going us president george w. bush .
not many politicians can say that they were groped by the leader of the free world .
she attends festival openings and mingles with the glitterati , but remains oddly down-to-earth .
when asked about whether fame had changed her and whether her husband was noticing anything different about her , she answered in her usual , direct , matter-of-fact tone that the breakfast she was preparing for them was still the same .
even though she might have done so , it 's silly to picture margaret thatcher frying bacon and eggs , or even just heating up a serving of refried beans for that scary abomination that the british call their breakfast .
but it is not hard to imagine angela hovering over a stove .
it 's a surprisingly credible and comforting image .
it gives representative democracy a glimmer of hope that some politicians , once they climb to the top , can actually remain human beings .
that is , perhaps , one of the reasons why she remains extremely popular in germany .
she rules , literally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business leaders think that merkel would be a good boss business leaders seem to agree .
in a recent poll about politicians as potential business leaders , the german chancellor got very positive reviews .
when asked about which german politician they would accept as their boss , 81 percent of german managers said angela merkel .
at the same time , 70 percent of those polled said they thought the trained physicist was capable of running a large enterprise .
in comparison , germany 's economy minister , michael gloss , got only 42 of positive votes in this category , while labor minister franz müntefering rated even worse - with only 37 percent of votes .
so what does the career of angela merkel teach us about life in general - other than that still water runs deep and that breakfast is the most important meal of the day ?
it teaches us that an unassuming and soft-spoken woman can break barriers and achieve more than a pompous , cigar-smoking macho of the gerhard schröder variety .
the former chancellor would probably beg to differ , but his portrait is already hanging in the german chancellery , which means he 's been relegated to history .
old angela , new angela angela 's transformation from an awkward and stuttering newcomer in the world of schröders , stoibers and their mostly male buddies is best judged by the media coverage of her arrival to the glitzy opening of the bayreuth opera festival .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the days of heavy prespiration are over two years ago , germany was roaring with laughter because the light apricot jacket-skirt combo , which merkel wore for the opening , was soiled with sweat stains underneath her armpits .
this year , however , german tabloid bild went gaga over merkel 's fashion accessory du jour - a strap-on purse which the newspaper , known for its familiarity with hyperbole , described as a " floating magic bag . "
gracefully walking down the red carpet in a sweat-free lilac outfit - which , admittedly , some catty observers said resembled a combination of a business jacket and a potato sack - merkel waved at the onlookers with her right hand , while her left arm remained comfortably limp with an elegant bag attached to her wrist .
from certain angles , it looked like merkel 's purse was indeed hovering in the air .
in two years , merkel went from being sneered upon as an extra in a deodorant ad to being admired as a middle-aged , top-tier version of sarah jessica parker .
transformation is her forte .
and it is no surprise that most german managers think she would make a good boss . that is the miracle of merkel . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de at string of summits , merkel ready to serve the finest wine there can be no bargain without wine , goes a latin saying .
so it 's no surprise that germany 's chancellor angela merkel has personally handpicked the country 's best wines to serve at the upcoming eu and g8 summits .
-lrb- 07.03.2007 -rrb- bush vows " no backrubs " for merkel when president george w. bush hosted german chancellor angela merkel this week , he promised to behave and keep his hands to himself .
-lrb- 05.01.2007 -rrb- breakfast at angela 's reviewing her first year as chancellor , angela merkel revealed wednesday that leading a country - surprise , surprise - pretty much turns one 's life upside down .
but there 's at least one thing that 's remained unchanged .

saying that the middle east 's powder keg is already explosive enough , foreign policy experts for germany 's governing coalition criticized us plans for military aid worth billions to saudi arabia and other gulf states . an official for the us defense department had said over the weekend that washington planned to give some $ 20 billion -lrb- 14.6 billion euros -rrb- in military assistance to saudi arabia and other states in the gulf region to modernize their armed forces and limit iran 's influence .
israel in return would receive $ 30.4 billion in military aid over the next decade - a significant increase to what the country received before .
while israeli officials have welcomed the plan , which was officially announced by us secretary of state condoleezza rice on monday , german parliamentarians have criticized it as a move that will further destabilize an already fragile region .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruprecht polenz " if you add more explosive things to a powder keg - and that 's what the middle east is - you heighten the risk and do n't make the region safer in the end , " ruprecht polenz , the chairman of the foreign affairs committee in the german parliament , told frankfurter rundschau newspaper .
" in any case , it 's a high-risk strategy , " added polenz , a member of parliament for the conservative christian democratic union of chancellor angela merkel .
" the aim - to signal iran that a struggle for hegemony based on military might wo n't lead to success - can lead to the wrong reaction in tehran : to try harder and arm faster . "
polenz suggested that the german government should push for a regional security conference and - together with the eu - lobby others not to send arms to crisis regions .

while saying that the idea to establish a middle east equivalent of the csce was nothing new , johannes jung , a member of the parliament 's foreign affairs committee for the social democratic party , said that this was more urgent than ever .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 30.07.2007 primor : eu troops could bring peace to middle east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu troops could bring the middle east peace process forward , primor said us secretary of state condoleezza rice is in the middle east to restart the peace process , but avi primor , israel 's former ambassador to germany , said the american efforts amount to nothing more than lip service . avi primor was israel 's ambassador to germany from 1993 to 1999 .
dw-world.de : palestinian president mahmoud abbas said last week that he thought a peace agreement could be reached by the end of 2008 .
one of the reasons he gave was because us secretary of state condoleezza rice assured him of it .
is it wishful thinking ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former israeli ambassador avi primor avi primor : i think abbas is an optimist because he really wants this solution .
he stands for compromise , he is for freedom , he is against terrorism .
but he has , unfortunately , little power , not only because hamas is his opponent and because he has already lost the gaza strip , but also because he has to fight hard in the west bank not to lose power to hamas there as well .
but that 's not really the point .
the question is what can condoleezza rice get started ?
us president bush gave a speech on july 16 in which he laid out a new peace plan and called for an international conference , to be attended by condoleezza rice , in the autumn .
so now the one who has to actually implement the peace plan is condoleezza rice . will condoleezza rice be accepted by all sides as an acceptable negotiating partner during these talks ? she will be accepted by everyone , without a doubt .
i have my doubts about whether she will have the power of the president behind her to actually force a particular direction - because this new peace process needs to be forced .
i do not think that the president is serious about this peace plan , but that he is paying lip service to it to ease pressure from condoleezza rice .
so he can say , " okay , go play a little with the israelis and the palestinians and maybe you can invite a few other arab countries to your conference , saudi arabia would be ideal , but i do n't expect much of it . "
i remember that condoleezza rice wanted to support then president of the world bank james wolfensohn , blair 's processor as middle east envoy , but that she did not have the support of her president and she failed , just as mr. wolfensohn did .
nothing has changed since then , and i do not think that bush , at the end of his term , is really aiming to get something started ; even though he has all the means to do so if he wanted . what kinds of powers would condoleezza rice have to receive to make the plan more than lip service ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice will need the president 's complete support to reach a deal bush 's peace plan put forth several components that he had previously mentioned in his first speech dealing with the middle east in 2002 , so it is a bit of a repetition : israel has to leave its settlements , the palestinians have to fight terrorism , a compromise for jerusalem needs to be reached , the problem of refugees needs to be solved , an independent palestinian state needs to be build and recognized and cooperated with .
these are all great things and israeli politicians recognize that .
but they do n't have the political power to implement such a plan , just like the palestinian administration does not have the power to implement the fight against terrorism .
had the president used all his powers , had he been ready to send money and maybe even troops to ensure security , then he would have been able to push both governments into accepting his plan .
he has not done this since 2002 , and he 's obviously not ready to do it today .
in this respect , condoleezza rice 's mission is only lip service . has n't this conflict for some time been a proxy war , with iran and syria looking to gain influence on one side and the usa and the west on the other ? i think that syria can be separated from iran because syria wants to negotiate and make peace with israel , but the americans are preventing it .
the israeli government is n't excited about it because it does not have the power to relinquish the golan heights .
but it would have fundamentally accepted the syrian president 's offer that a way could have been found - if the americans were satisfied .
but they are not .
still , i believe there is a way .
all the peace plans since 2000 - from the first clinton plan to the bush plan and the quartet 's and the one from saudi arabia - have all had the same components .
everyone knows how the problem can and should actually be solved , but no one has the power to do it .
at its most basic , the problem is security .
if there were someone who was ready to put troops in the occupied territories after israel left them - robust troops that could actually provide security - then i think the governments would be strong enough to implement the various peace plans .
the only ones who can manage something like that today and also have the will to do so are the europeans - assuming that the americans do not object to it .
that 's where condoleezza rice as well as tony blair could be helpful . what step has to come next in order to move toward a realistic peace treaty ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new eu middle east envoy tony blair could help get eu nations to contribute troops the european union needs to draft a peace plan .
that 's not a problem since all the peace plans are similar anyhow .
but this time it should be an initiative from the european union to send robust troops to the middle east .
that does not have to be exclusively european troops , it could also include arab troops , such as from saudi arabia , egypt , jordan or islamic troops like the turks , and maybe even nato .
they should take over power in the occupied territories so that israel can leave the region .
but all of this can only happen if the american do are not against it . how great are your expectations for condoleezza rice 's visit and for her middle east conference in the fall ? very small , because , as i said , i expect that the american president is n't really behind it , and that it 's all just lip service for him .
and so everyone else , the israeli as well as the palestinian government , is also only going to pay it lip service .
i do n't know if the saudi government is going to take part in the conference as bush would like .
they wo n't do it if they are not sure that the americans are actually seriously behind it , and that is not the case .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang ischinger has a great deal of experience with the balkan region the 61-year old , who is the german ambassador to britain , is an expert on balkan affairs .
he was - together with us diplomat richard holbrooke - instrumental in brokering the 1995 dayton peace agreement which brought an end to the war in bosnia .
ischinger will be joining top us and russian diplomats under a scheme announced last week to negotiate the future status of the southern serbian province .
a new attempt the scheme was announced by the six members of the kosovo contact group , which said talks on the future status should take place in the form of an eu-us-russian troika .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for serbia , kosovo and its medieval monasteries have a great deal of symbolic value the six members - balkan experts from the us , russia , germany , france , britain and italy - announced it as an attempt to overcome the us-russian deadlock a week after russia blocked a resolution on a un plan to grant kosovo internationally-monitored independence .
kosovo leaders , however , warned on monday that they would not accept further delays in determining the province 's final status and would not give up their demands for independence .
" we consider that this will be the last delay and we will not accept any other deadlines , " said kosovo 's president fatmir sejdiu in an address to the province 's 120-seat parliament .
" further deadlines carry with them dangers not only in compromising the process but also raising concerns and tensions with unforeseeable consequences , " sejdiu said .
" we stress that kosovo 's independence is not negotiable . "

agreement has yet to be reached on the timing of a new round of talks .
the eu had suggested limiting negotiations to 120 days , while russia prefers open-ended talks .
diplomat frank wisner has been appointed to represent the us in the talks .
russia is yet to announce its representative .
opposing views the talks on the future of kosovo are bound to remain extremely difficult and are unlikely to bring any substantial improvements in the relations between belgrade and pristina .
kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority , frustrated by setbacks and delays , will accept nothing short of full independence .
belgrade , on the other hand , is only ready to grant far-reaching autonomy , fearing kosovo 's serb minority will be endangered in case of independence .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang ischinger has a great deal of experience with the balkan region the 61-year old , who is the german ambassador to britain , is an expert on balkan affairs .
he was - together with us diplomat richard holbrooke - instrumental in brokering the 1995 dayton peace agreement which brought an end to the war in bosnia .
ischinger will be joining top us and russian diplomats under a scheme announced last week to negotiate the future status of the southern serbian province .
a new attempt the scheme was announced by the six members of the kosovo contact group , which said talks on the future status should take place in the form of an eu-us-russian troika .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for serbia , kosovo and its medieval monasteries have a great deal of symbolic value the six members - balkan experts from the us , russia , germany , france , britain and italy - announced it as an attempt to overcome the us-russian deadlock a week after russia blocked a resolution on a un plan to grant kosovo internationally-monitored independence .
kosovo leaders , however , warned on monday that they would not accept further delays in determining the province 's final status and would not give up their demands for independence .
" we consider that this will be the last delay and we will not accept any other deadlines , " said kosovo 's president fatmir sejdiu in an address to the province 's 120-seat parliament .
" further deadlines carry with them dangers not only in compromising the process but also raising concerns and tensions with unforeseeable consequences , " sejdiu said .
" we stress that kosovo 's independence is not negotiable . "
the role of russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo is currently run by the united nations in what was considered a surprise move , russia agreed to the troika format suggested by german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier at the eu foreign ministers ' meeting last monday , even though it previously insisted on keeping the process in the security council , where it holds veto power .
agreement has yet to be reached on the timing of a new round of talks .
the eu had suggested limiting negotiations to 120 days , while russia prefers open-ended talks .
diplomat frank wisner has been appointed to represent the us in the talks .
russia is yet to announce its representative .
opposing views the talks on the future of kosovo are bound to remain extremely difficult and are unlikely to bring any substantial improvements in the relations between belgrade and pristina .
kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority , frustrated by setbacks and delays , will accept nothing short of full independence .
belgrade , on the other hand , is only ready to grant far-reaching autonomy , fearing kosovo 's serb minority will be endangered in case of independence .
a unilateral declaration of independence by the province 's leadership could lead to a further destabilization of the region , diplomats fear . article based on news reports -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

afghan president hamid karzai had accused the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- of killing about 90 civilians in june , most of them in air operations .
karzai said that the casualties could damage support for the presence of foreign troops in the country .
smaller bombs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer more than 330 civilians have been killed during fighting involving foreign troops in afghanistan this year so far , according to afghan officials and western aid workers , reuters news agency reported .
scheffer said that nato officials were " working with weapons load on aircraft to reduce collateral damage . "
a nato diplomat told the financial times newspaper that using 250 kg -lrb- about 500 pounds -rrb- bombs rather than 500 kg bombs would " make a huge amount of difference " in terms of casualties .
nato officials also said that the afghan army should increasingly take on house-to-house searches to avoid confrontations .
no need to rush scheffer also said that nato troops would hold off on attacks against the taliban if the number of civilian casualties would run too high as the result of an attack .
" we realize that , if we can not neutralize our enemy today without harming civilians , our enemy will give us the opportunity tomorrow , " scheffer told the paper .
" if that means going after the taliban not on wednesday but on thusday , we will get him then . "
scheffer added , however , that it was impossible to avoid civilian casualties altogether .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 30.07.2007 primor : eu troops could bring peace to middle east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu troops could bring the middle east peace process forward , primor said us secretary of state condoleezza rice is in the middle east to restart the peace process , but avi primor , israel 's former ambassador to germany , said the american efforts amount to nothing more than lip service . avi primor was israel 's ambassador to germany from 1993 to 1999 .
dw-world.de : palestinian president mahmoud abbas said last week that he thought a peace agreement could be reached by the end of 2008 .
one of the reasons he gave was because us secretary of state condoleezza rice assured him of it .
is it wishful thinking ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former israeli ambassador avi primor avi primor : i think abbas is an optimist because he really wants this solution .
he stands for compromise , he is for freedom , he is against terrorism .
but he has , unfortunately , little power , not only because hamas is his opponent and because he has already lost the gaza strip , but also because he has to fight hard in the west bank not to lose power to hamas there as well .
but that 's not really the point .
the question is what can condoleezza rice get started ?
us president bush gave a speech on july 16 in which he laid out a new peace plan and called for an international conference , to be attended by condoleezza rice , in the autumn .
so now the one who has to actually implement the peace plan is condoleezza rice . will condoleezza rice be accepted by all sides as an acceptable negotiating partner during these talks ? she will be accepted by everyone , without a doubt .
i have my doubts about whether she will have the power of the president behind her to actually force a particular direction - because this new peace process needs to be forced .
i do not think that the president is serious about this peace plan , but that he is paying lip service to it to ease pressure from condoleezza rice .
so he can say , " okay , go play a little with the israelis and the palestinians and maybe you can invite a few other arab countries to your conference , saudi arabia would be ideal , but i do n't expect much of it . "
i remember that condoleezza rice wanted to support then president of the world bank james wolfensohn , blair 's processor as middle east envoy , but that she did not have the support of her president and she failed , just as mr. wolfensohn did .
nothing has changed since then , and i do not think that bush , at the end of his term , is really aiming to get something started ; even though he has all the means to do so if he wanted . what kinds of powers would condoleezza rice have to receive to make the plan more than lip service ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice will need the president 's complete support to reach a deal bush 's peace plan put forth several components that he had previously mentioned in his first speech dealing with the middle east in 2002 , so it is a bit of a repetition : israel has to leave its settlements , the palestinians have to fight terrorism , a compromise for jerusalem needs to be reached , the problem of refugees needs to be solved , an independent palestinian state needs to be build and recognized and cooperated with .
these are all great things and israeli politicians recognize that .
but they do n't have the political power to implement such a plan , just like the palestinian administration does not have the power to implement the fight against terrorism .
had the president used all his powers , had he been ready to send money and maybe even troops to ensure security , then he would have been able to push both governments into accepting his plan .
he has not done this since 2002 , and he 's obviously not ready to do it today .
in this respect , condoleezza rice 's mission is only lip service . has n't this conflict for some time been a proxy war , with iran and syria looking to gain influence on one side and the usa and the west on the other ? i think that syria can be separated from iran because syria wants to negotiate and make peace with israel , but the americans are preventing it .
the israeli government is n't excited about it because it does not have the power to relinquish the golan heights .
but it would have fundamentally accepted the syrian president 's offer that a way could have been found - if the americans were satisfied .
but they are not .
still , i believe there is a way .
all the peace plans since 2000 - from the first clinton plan to the bush plan and the quartet 's and the one from saudi arabia - have all had the same components .
everyone knows how the problem can and should actually be solved , but no one has the power to do it .
at its most basic , the problem is security .
if there were someone who was ready to put troops in the occupied territories after israel left them - robust troops that could actually provide security - then i think the governments would be strong enough to implement the various peace plans .
the only ones who can manage something like that today and also have the will to do so are the europeans - assuming that the americans do not object to it .
that 's where condoleezza rice as well as tony blair could be helpful . what step has to come next in order to move toward a realistic peace treaty ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new eu middle east envoy tony blair could help get eu nations to contribute troops the european union needs to draft a peace plan .
that 's not a problem since all the peace plans are similar anyhow .
but this time it should be an initiative from the european union to send robust troops to the middle east .
that does not have to be exclusively european troops , it could also include arab troops , such as from saudi arabia , egypt , jordan or islamic troops like the turks , and maybe even nato .
they should take over power in the occupied territories so that israel can leave the region .
but all of this can only happen if the american do are not against it . how great are your expectations for condoleezza rice 's visit and for her middle east conference in the fall ? very small , because , as i said , i expect that the american president is n't really behind it , and that it 's all just lip service for him .
and so everyone else , the israeli as well as the palestinian government , is also only going to pay it lip service .
i do n't know if the saudi government is going to take part in the conference as bush would like .
they wo n't do it if they are not sure that the americans are actually seriously behind it , and that is not the case .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 30.07.2007 primor : eu troops could bring peace to middle east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu troops could bring the middle east peace process forward , primor said us secretary of state condoleezza rice is in the middle east to restart the peace process , but avi primor , israel 's former ambassador to germany , said the american efforts amount to nothing more than lip service . avi primor was israel 's ambassador to germany from 1993 to 1999 .
dw-world.de : palestinian president mahmoud abbas said last week that he thought a peace agreement could be reached by the end of 2008 .
one of the reasons he gave was because us secretary of state condoleezza rice assured him of it .
is it wishful thinking ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former israeli ambassador avi primor avi primor : i think abbas is an optimist because he really wants this solution .
he stands for compromise , he is for freedom , he is against terrorism .
but he has , unfortunately , little power , not only because hamas is his opponent and because he has already lost the gaza strip , but also because he has to fight hard in the west bank not to lose power to hamas there as well .
but that 's not really the point .
the question is what can condoleezza rice get started ?
us president bush gave a speech on july 16 in which he laid out a new peace plan and called for an international conference , to be attended by condoleezza rice , in the autumn .
so now the one who has to actually implement the peace plan is condoleezza rice . will condoleezza rice be accepted by all sides as an acceptable negotiating partner during these talks ? she will be accepted by everyone , without a doubt .
i have my doubts about whether she will have the power of the president behind her to actually force a particular direction - because this new peace process needs to be forced .
i do not think that the president is serious about this peace plan , but that he is paying lip service to it to ease pressure from condoleezza rice .
so he can say , " okay , go play a little with the israelis and the palestinians and maybe you can invite a few other arab countries to your conference , saudi arabia would be ideal , but i do n't expect much of it . "
i remember that condoleezza rice wanted to support then president of the world bank james wolfensohn , blair 's processor as middle east envoy , but that she did not have the support of her president and she failed , just as mr. wolfensohn did .
nothing has changed since then , and i do not think that bush , at the end of his term , is really aiming to get something started ; even though he has all the means to do so if he wanted . what kinds of powers would condoleezza rice have to receive to make the plan more than lip service ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice will need the president 's complete support to reach a deal bush 's peace plan put forth several components that he had previously mentioned in his first speech dealing with the middle east in 2002 , so it is a bit of a repetition : israel has to leave its settlements , the palestinians have to fight terrorism , a compromise for jerusalem needs to be reached , the problem of refugees needs to be solved , an independent palestinian state needs to be build and recognized and cooperated with .
these are all great things and israeli politicians recognize that .
but they do n't have the political power to implement such a plan , just like the palestinian administration does not have the power to implement the fight against terrorism .
had the president used all his powers , had he been ready to send money and maybe even troops to ensure security , then he would have been able to push both governments into accepting his plan .
he has not done this since 2002 , and he 's obviously not ready to do it today .
in this respect , condoleezza rice 's mission is only lip service . has n't this conflict for some time been a proxy war , with iran and syria looking to gain influence on one side and the usa and the west on the other ? i think that syria can be separated from iran because syria wants to negotiate and make peace with israel , but the americans are preventing it .
the israeli government is n't excited about it because it does not have the power to relinquish the golan heights .
but it would have fundamentally accepted the syrian president 's offer that a way could have been found - if the americans were satisfied .
but they are not .
still , i believe there is a way .
all the peace plans since 2000 - from the first clinton plan to the bush plan and the quartet 's and the one from saudi arabia - have all had the same components .
everyone knows how the problem can and should actually be solved , but no one has the power to do it .
at its most basic , the problem is security .
if there were someone who was ready to put troops in the occupied territories after israel left them - robust troops that could actually provide security - then i think the governments would be strong enough to implement the various peace plans .
the only ones who can manage something like that today and also have the will to do so are the europeans - assuming that the americans do not object to it .
that 's where condoleezza rice as well as tony blair could be helpful . what step has to come next in order to move toward a realistic peace treaty ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new eu middle east envoy tony blair could help get eu nations to contribute troops the european union needs to draft a peace plan .
that 's not a problem since all the peace plans are similar anyhow .
but this time it should be an initiative from the european union to send robust troops to the middle east .
that does not have to be exclusively european troops , it could also include arab troops , such as from saudi arabia , egypt , jordan or islamic troops like the turks , and maybe even nato .
they should take over power in the occupied territories so that israel can leave the region .
but all of this can only happen if the american do are not against it . how great are your expectations for condoleezza rice 's visit and for her middle east conference in the fall ? very small , because , as i said , i expect that the american president is n't really behind it , and that it 's all just lip service for him .
and so everyone else , the israeli as well as the palestinian government , is also only going to pay it lip service .
i do n't know if the saudi government is going to take part in the conference as bush would like .
they wo n't do it if they are not sure that the americans are actually seriously behind it , and that is not the case .
i think the whole thing is just going to be a spectacle . ina rottscheidt interviewed avi primor -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

afghan president hamid karzai had accused the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- of killing about 90 civilians in june , most of them in air operations .
karzai said that the casualties could damage support for the presence of foreign troops in the country .
smaller bombs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer more than 330 civilians have been killed during fighting involving foreign troops in afghanistan this year so far , according to afghan officials and western aid workers , reuters news agency reported .
scheffer said that nato officials were " working with weapons load on aircraft to reduce collateral damage . "
a nato diplomat told the financial times newspaper that using 250 kg -lrb- about 500 pounds -rrb- bombs rather than 500 kg bombs would " make a huge amount of difference " in terms of casualties .
nato officials also said that the afghan army should increasingly take on house-to-house searches to avoid confrontations .
no need to rush scheffer also said that nato troops would hold off on attacks against the taliban if the number of civilian casualties would run too high as the result of an attack .
" we realize that , if we can not neutralize our enemy today without harming civilians , our enemy will give us the opportunity tomorrow , " scheffer told the paper .
" if that means going after the taliban not on wednesday but on thusday , we will get him then . "
scheffer added , however , that it was impossible to avoid civilian casualties altogether .

afghan president hamid karzai had accused the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- of killing about 90 civilians in june , most of them in air operations .
karzai said that the casualties could damage support for the presence of foreign troops in the country .

scheffer said that nato officials were " working with weapons load on aircraft to reduce collateral damage . "
a nato diplomat told the financial times newspaper that using 250 kg -lrb- about 500 pounds -rrb- bombs rather than 500 kg bombs would " make a huge amount of difference " in terms of casualties .
nato officials also said that the afghan army should increasingly take on house-to-house searches to avoid confrontations .
no need to rush scheffer also said that nato troops would hold off on attacks against the taliban if the number of civilian casualties would run too high as the result of an attack .
" we realize that , if we can not neutralize our enemy today without harming civilians , our enemy will give us the opportunity tomorrow , " scheffer told the paper .
" if that means going after the taliban not on wednesday but on thusday , we will get him then . "
scheffer added , however , that it was impossible to avoid civilian casualties altogether .

saying that the middle east 's powder keg is already explosive enough , foreign policy experts for germany 's governing coalition criticized us plans for military aid worth billions to saudi arabia and other gulf states . an official for the us defense department had said over the weekend that washington planned to give some $ 20 billion -lrb- 14.6 billion euros -rrb- in military assistance to saudi arabia and other states in the gulf region to modernize their armed forces and limit iran 's influence .
israel in return would receive $ 30.4 billion in military aid over the next decade - a significant increase to what the country received before .
while israeli officials have welcomed the plan , which was officially announced by us secretary of state condoleezza rice on monday , german parliamentarians have criticized it as a move that will further destabilize an already fragile region .
a high risk strategy ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruprecht polenz " if you add more explosive things to a powder keg - and that 's what the middle east is - you heighten the risk and do n't make the region safer in the end , " ruprecht polenz , the chairman of the foreign affairs committee in the german parliament , told frankfurter rundschau newspaper .
" in any case , it 's a high-risk strategy , " added polenz , a member of parliament for the conservative christian democratic union of chancellor angela merkel .
" the aim - to signal iran that a struggle for hegemony based on military might wo n't lead to success - can lead to the wrong reaction in tehran : to try harder and arm faster . "
polenz suggested that the german government should push for a regional security conference and - together with the eu - lobby others not to send arms to crisis regions .
a csce for the mideast ?
" instead , one should try to get a process started that 's similar to the conference on security and cooperation in europe -lsb- csce -rsb- in the 1970s : to discuss the region 's security problems with everyone involved , to build trust and maybe dampen armament or even encourage disarmament this way , " polenz said .
while saying that the idea to establish a middle east equivalent of the csce was nothing new , johannes jung , a member of the parliament 's foreign affairs committee for the social democratic party , said that this was more urgent than ever .
" the region needs disarmament and not armament , " he said , according to the web site of german newsmagazine der spiegel . article based on news reports -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 30.07.2007 the miracle of merkel - is there anything angela ca n't do ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel remains extremely popular , both in germany and abroad she moves in high circles , hangs out at the opera and gets backrubs from the leader of the free world .
now , most german businessmen say they 'd like to have her as their boss .
can angela merkel do anything wrong ? being famous is surely a tough job .
just ask brad and angelina .
or that good old overachiever madonna , who consistently refuses to stay with her own age .
they all work so hard at preserving their image and compromise so much of their privacy just to remain on the covers of glossy magazines .
angela , on the other hand , makes fame appear easy .
wherever she goes , she is praised for her winning combination of diplomatic skills and unflinching perseverance .
during a recent eu summit , the german chancellor practically saved europe from the brink of a disaster .
for her , however , it 's all just part of the job .
no more and no less .
let 's not get touchy-feely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a moment to remember -lrb- and a hit on youtube -rrb- : angela getting a backrub from george w. bush germany 's top job has , of course , its perks .
in 2006 , for instance , merkel received a widely-publicized backrub from the embarrassingly easy-going us president george w. bush .
not many politicians can say that they were groped by the leader of the free world .
she attends festival openings and mingles with the glitterati , but remains oddly down-to-earth .
when asked about whether fame had changed her and whether her husband was noticing anything different about her , she answered in her usual , direct , matter-of-fact tone that the breakfast she was preparing for them was still the same .
even though she might have done so , it 's silly to picture margaret thatcher frying bacon and eggs , or even just heating up a serving of refried beans for that scary abomination that the british call their breakfast .
but it is not hard to imagine angela hovering over a stove .
it 's a surprisingly credible and comforting image .
it gives representative democracy a glimmer of hope that some politicians , once they climb to the top , can actually remain human beings .
that is , perhaps , one of the reasons why she remains extremely popular in germany .
she rules , literally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business leaders think that merkel would be a good boss business leaders seem to agree .
in a recent poll about politicians as potential business leaders , the german chancellor got very positive reviews .
when asked about which german politician they would accept as their boss , 81 percent of german managers said angela merkel .
at the same time , 70 percent of those polled said they thought the trained physicist was capable of running a large enterprise .
in comparison , germany 's economy minister , michael gloss , got only 42 of positive votes in this category , while labor minister franz müntefering rated even worse - with only 37 percent of votes .
so what does the career of angela merkel teach us about life in general - other than that still water runs deep and that breakfast is the most important meal of the day ?
it teaches us that an unassuming and soft-spoken woman can break barriers and achieve more than a pompous , cigar-smoking macho of the gerhard schröder variety .

now , most german businessmen say they 'd like to have her as their boss .
can angela merkel do anything wrong ? being famous is surely a tough job .
just ask brad and angelina .
or that good old overachiever madonna , who consistently refuses to stay with her own age .
they all work so hard at preserving their image and compromise so much of their privacy just to remain on the covers of glossy magazines .
angela , on the other hand , makes fame appear easy .
wherever she goes , she is praised for her winning combination of diplomatic skills and unflinching perseverance .
during a recent eu summit , the german chancellor practically saved europe from the brink of a disaster .
for her , however , it 's all just part of the job .
no more and no less .
let 's not get touchy-feely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a moment to remember -lrb- and a hit on youtube -rrb- : angela getting a backrub from george w. bush germany 's top job has , of course , its perks .
in 2006 , for instance , merkel received a widely-publicized backrub from the embarrassingly easy-going us president george w. bush .
not many politicians can say that they were groped by the leader of the free world .
she attends festival openings and mingles with the glitterati , but remains oddly down-to-earth .
when asked about whether fame had changed her and whether her husband was noticing anything different about her , she answered in her usual , direct , matter-of-fact tone that the breakfast she was preparing for them was still the same .
even though she might have done so , it 's silly to picture margaret thatcher frying bacon and eggs , or even just heating up a serving of refried beans for that scary abomination that the british call their breakfast .
but it is not hard to imagine angela hovering over a stove .
it 's a surprisingly credible and comforting image .
it gives representative democracy a glimmer of hope that some politicians , once they climb to the top , can actually remain human beings .
that is , perhaps , one of the reasons why she remains extremely popular in germany .
she rules , literally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business leaders think that merkel would be a good boss business leaders seem to agree .
in a recent poll about politicians as potential business leaders , the german chancellor got very positive reviews .
when asked about which german politician they would accept as their boss , 81 percent of german managers said angela merkel .
at the same time , 70 percent of those polled said they thought the trained physicist was capable of running a large enterprise .
in comparison , germany 's economy minister , michael gloss , got only 42 of positive votes in this category , while labor minister franz müntefering rated even worse - with only 37 percent of votes .
so what does the career of angela merkel teach us about life in general - other than that still water runs deep and that breakfast is the most important meal of the day ?
it teaches us that an unassuming and soft-spoken woman can break barriers and achieve more than a pompous , cigar-smoking macho of the gerhard schröder variety .

" we have duties to discharge and responsibilities to keep in support of the democratically elected government and in support of the explicit will of the international community , " brown said in his first press conference with bush since becoming prime minister in june . finding common ground bush and brown met at the camp david presidential retreat outside washington for two days of talks that began sunday amid a great deal of speculation as to whether the leaders would enjoy the close relationship bush has with brown 's predecessor tony blair . bush too sought to cast aside any questions about his ability to work with brown while emphasizing the close ties between the united states and britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two leaders , seen here in a golf cart , demonstrated they get along " so everybody 's wondering whether or not the prime minister and i were able to find common ground , to get along , to have a meaningful discussion , " bush said .
" and the answer is absolutely . " brown gave no promises on how long britain would maintain its forces in iraq , saying only that a decision to hand over control for security in basra province to iraqi forces would be based on military advice . " we intend to move to overwatch in the fourth province , and that decision will be made on the military advice of our commanders on the ground , " brown said . bush stressed that the two allies would work together towards securing peace in iraq . " there is no doubt in my mind that gordon brown understands that failure in iraq would be a disaster for the security of our own countries , " bush said . he said his relationship with brown would be " a constructive strategic relationship for the good of our peoples . " cracking down on iran bush and brown also discussed the humanitarian crisis in sudan 's darfur region and the us-eu effort to forge a trade plan to help boost the world 's underdeveloped economies . on iran , the two leaders agreed on the need to pursue tougher sanctions over the country 's covert nuclear program . " we 're in agreement that sanctions are working and the next stage we are ready to move towards is to toughen the sanctions with a further un resolution , " brown said . brown arrived sunday at camp david , his first visit to the united states since succeeding blair june 27 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown did not specify how long britain would maintain its forces in iraq bush enjoyed a close personal relationship and political partnership with blair , who stood by bush over the war in iraq despite the british public 's strong disapproval of blair 's decision to order british participation in the 2003 invasion . the continuing struggle in iraq helped to undermine blair and sped his departure from downing street .
observers believe brown will stake out a more businesslike relationship with bush that will emphasize common goals between the two countries . bush has also faced deep opposition to the conflict in iraq at home and increasing calls to set a timeframe for withdrawing us troops . on tuesday , brown will hold talks with un secretary-general ban ki-moon in new york and give a speech at the world body . article based on news reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 30.07.2007 primor : eu troops could bring peace to middle east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu troops could bring the middle east peace process forward , primor said us secretary of state condoleezza rice is in the middle east to restart the peace process , but avi primor , israel 's former ambassador to germany , said the american efforts amount to nothing more than lip service . avi primor was israel 's ambassador to germany from 1993 to 1999 .
dw-world.de : palestinian president mahmoud abbas said last week that he thought a peace agreement could be reached by the end of 2008 .
one of the reasons he gave was because us secretary of state condoleezza rice assured him of it .
is it wishful thinking ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former israeli ambassador avi primor avi primor : i think abbas is an optimist because he really wants this solution .
he stands for compromise , he is for freedom , he is against terrorism .
but he has , unfortunately , little power , not only because hamas is his opponent and because he has already lost the gaza strip , but also because he has to fight hard in the west bank not to lose power to hamas there as well .
but that 's not really the point .
the question is what can condoleezza rice get started ?
us president bush gave a speech on july 16 in which he laid out a new peace plan and called for an international conference , to be attended by condoleezza rice , in the autumn .
so now the one who has to actually implement the peace plan is condoleezza rice . will condoleezza rice be accepted by all sides as an acceptable negotiating partner during these talks ? she will be accepted by everyone , without a doubt .
i have my doubts about whether she will have the power of the president behind her to actually force a particular direction - because this new peace process needs to be forced .
i do not think that the president is serious about this peace plan , but that he is paying lip service to it to ease pressure from condoleezza rice .
so he can say , " okay , go play a little with the israelis and the palestinians and maybe you can invite a few other arab countries to your conference , saudi arabia would be ideal , but i do n't expect much of it . "
i remember that condoleezza rice wanted to support then president of the world bank james wolfensohn , blair 's processor as middle east envoy , but that she did not have the support of her president and she failed , just as mr. wolfensohn did .
nothing has changed since then , and i do not think that bush , at the end of his term , is really aiming to get something started ; even though he has all the means to do so if he wanted . what kinds of powers would condoleezza rice have to receive to make the plan more than lip service ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice will need the president 's complete support to reach a deal bush 's peace plan put forth several components that he had previously mentioned in his first speech dealing with the middle east in 2002 , so it is a bit of a repetition : israel has to leave its settlements , the palestinians have to fight terrorism , a compromise for jerusalem needs to be reached , the problem of refugees needs to be solved , an independent palestinian state needs to be build and recognized and cooperated with .
these are all great things and israeli politicians recognize that .
but they do n't have the political power to implement such a plan , just like the palestinian administration does not have the power to implement the fight against terrorism .
had the president used all his powers , had he been ready to send money and maybe even troops to ensure security , then he would have been able to push both governments into accepting his plan .
he has not done this since 2002 , and he 's obviously not ready to do it today .
in this respect , condoleezza rice 's mission is only lip service . has n't this conflict for some time been a proxy war , with iran and syria looking to gain influence on one side and the usa and the west on the other ? i think that syria can be separated from iran because syria wants to negotiate and make peace with israel , but the americans are preventing it .
the israeli government is n't excited about it because it does not have the power to relinquish the golan heights .
but it would have fundamentally accepted the syrian president 's offer that a way could have been found - if the americans were satisfied .
but they are not .
still , i believe there is a way .
all the peace plans since 2000 - from the first clinton plan to the bush plan and the quartet 's and the one from saudi arabia - have all had the same components .
everyone knows how the problem can and should actually be solved , but no one has the power to do it .
at its most basic , the problem is security .
if there were someone who was ready to put troops in the occupied territories after israel left them - robust troops that could actually provide security - then i think the governments would be strong enough to implement the various peace plans .
the only ones who can manage something like that today and also have the will to do so are the europeans - assuming that the americans do not object to it .
that 's where condoleezza rice as well as tony blair could be helpful . what step has to come next in order to move toward a realistic peace treaty ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new eu middle east envoy tony blair could help get eu nations to contribute troops the european union needs to draft a peace plan .
that 's not a problem since all the peace plans are similar anyhow .
but this time it should be an initiative from the european union to send robust troops to the middle east .
that does not have to be exclusively european troops , it could also include arab troops , such as from saudi arabia , egypt , jordan or islamic troops like the turks , and maybe even nato .
they should take over power in the occupied territories so that israel can leave the region .
but all of this can only happen if the american do are not against it . how great are your expectations for condoleezza rice 's visit and for her middle east conference in the fall ? very small , because , as i said , i expect that the american president is n't really behind it , and that it 's all just lip service for him .
and so everyone else , the israeli as well as the palestinian government , is also only going to pay it lip service .
i do n't know if the saudi government is going to take part in the conference as bush would like .
they wo n't do it if they are not sure that the americans are actually seriously behind it , and that is not the case .
i think the whole thing is just going to be a spectacle . ina rottscheidt interviewed avi primor -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

kosovo leaders , however , warned on monday that they would not accept further delays in determining the province 's final status and would not give up their demands for independence .
" we consider that this will be the last delay and we will not accept any other deadlines , " said kosovo 's president fatmir sejdiu in an address to the province 's 120-seat parliament .
" further deadlines carry with them dangers not only in compromising the process but also raising concerns and tensions with unforeseeable consequences , " sejdiu said .

agreement has yet to be reached on the timing of a new round of talks .

afghan president hamid karzai had accused the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- of killing about 90 civilians in june , most of them in air operations .
karzai said that the casualties could damage support for the presence of foreign troops in the country .
smaller bombs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer more than 330 civilians have been killed during fighting involving foreign troops in afghanistan this year so far , according to afghan officials and western aid workers , reuters news agency reported .
scheffer said that nato officials were " working with weapons load on aircraft to reduce collateral damage . "
a nato diplomat told the financial times newspaper that using 250 kg -lrb- about 500 pounds -rrb- bombs rather than 500 kg bombs would " make a huge amount of difference " in terms of casualties .
nato officials also said that the afghan army should increasingly take on house-to-house searches to avoid confrontations .
no need to rush scheffer also said that nato troops would hold off on attacks against the taliban if the number of civilian casualties would run too high as the result of an attack .
" we realize that , if we can not neutralize our enemy today without harming civilians , our enemy will give us the opportunity tomorrow , " scheffer told the paper .
" if that means going after the taliban not on wednesday but on thusday , we will get him then . "
scheffer added , however , that it was impossible to avoid civilian casualties altogether .

dw-world.de : palestinian president mahmoud abbas said last week that he thought a peace agreement could be reached by the end of 2008 .
one of the reasons he gave was because us secretary of state condoleezza rice assured him of it .
is it wishful thinking ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former israeli ambassador avi primor avi primor : i think abbas is an optimist because he really wants this solution .
he stands for compromise , he is for freedom , he is against terrorism .
but he has , unfortunately , little power , not only because hamas is his opponent and because he has already lost the gaza strip , but also because he has to fight hard in the west bank not to lose power to hamas there as well .
but that 's not really the point .
the question is what can condoleezza rice get started ?
us president bush gave a speech on july 16 in which he laid out a new peace plan and called for an international conference , to be attended by condoleezza rice , in the autumn .
so now the one who has to actually implement the peace plan is condoleezza rice . will condoleezza rice be accepted by all sides as an acceptable negotiating partner during these talks ? she will be accepted by everyone , without a doubt .
i have my doubts about whether she will have the power of the president behind her to actually force a particular direction - because this new peace process needs to be forced .
i do not think that the president is serious about this peace plan , but that he is paying lip service to it to ease pressure from condoleezza rice .
so he can say , " okay , go play a little with the israelis and the palestinians and maybe you can invite a few other arab countries to your conference , saudi arabia would be ideal , but i do n't expect much of it . "
i remember that condoleezza rice wanted to support then president of the world bank james wolfensohn , blair 's processor as middle east envoy , but that she did not have the support of her president and she failed , just as mr. wolfensohn did .
nothing has changed since then , and i do not think that bush , at the end of his term , is really aiming to get something started ; even though he has all the means to do so if he wanted . what kinds of powers would condoleezza rice have to receive to make the plan more than lip service ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice will need the president 's complete support to reach a deal bush 's peace plan put forth several components that he had previously mentioned in his first speech dealing with the middle east in 2002 , so it is a bit of a repetition : israel has to leave its settlements , the palestinians have to fight terrorism , a compromise for jerusalem needs to be reached , the problem of refugees needs to be solved , an independent palestinian state needs to be build and recognized and cooperated with .
these are all great things and israeli politicians recognize that .
but they do n't have the political power to implement such a plan , just like the palestinian administration does not have the power to implement the fight against terrorism .
had the president used all his powers , had he been ready to send money and maybe even troops to ensure security , then he would have been able to push both governments into accepting his plan .
he has not done this since 2002 , and he 's obviously not ready to do it today .
in this respect , condoleezza rice 's mission is only lip service . has n't this conflict for some time been a proxy war , with iran and syria looking to gain influence on one side and the usa and the west on the other ? i think that syria can be separated from iran because syria wants to negotiate and make peace with israel , but the americans are preventing it .
the israeli government is n't excited about it because it does not have the power to relinquish the golan heights .
but it would have fundamentally accepted the syrian president 's offer that a way could have been found - if the americans were satisfied .
but they are not .
still , i believe there is a way .
all the peace plans since 2000 - from the first clinton plan to the bush plan and the quartet 's and the one from saudi arabia - have all had the same components .
everyone knows how the problem can and should actually be solved , but no one has the power to do it .
at its most basic , the problem is security .
if there were someone who was ready to put troops in the occupied territories after israel left them - robust troops that could actually provide security - then i think the governments would be strong enough to implement the various peace plans .
the only ones who can manage something like that today and also have the will to do so are the europeans - assuming that the americans do not object to it .
that 's where condoleezza rice as well as tony blair could be helpful . what step has to come next in order to move toward a realistic peace treaty ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new eu middle east envoy tony blair could help get eu nations to contribute troops the european union needs to draft a peace plan .
that 's not a problem since all the peace plans are similar anyhow .
but this time it should be an initiative from the european union to send robust troops to the middle east .
that does not have to be exclusively european troops , it could also include arab troops , such as from saudi arabia , egypt , jordan or islamic troops like the turks , and maybe even nato .
they should take over power in the occupied territories so that israel can leave the region .
but all of this can only happen if the american do are not against it . how great are your expectations for condoleezza rice 's visit and for her middle east conference in the fall ? very small , because , as i said , i expect that the american president is n't really behind it , and that it 's all just lip service for him .
and so everyone else , the israeli as well as the palestinian government , is also only going to pay it lip service .
i do n't know if the saudi government is going to take part in the conference as bush would like .
they wo n't do it if they are not sure that the americans are actually seriously behind it , and that is not the case .
i think the whole thing is just going to be a spectacle . ina rottscheidt interviewed avi primor -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang ischinger has a great deal of experience with the balkan region the 61-year old , who is the german ambassador to britain , is an expert on balkan affairs .
he was - together with us diplomat richard holbrooke - instrumental in brokering the 1995 dayton peace agreement which brought an end to the war in bosnia .
ischinger will be joining top us and russian diplomats under a scheme announced last week to negotiate the future status of the southern serbian province .
a new attempt the scheme was announced by the six members of the kosovo contact group , which said talks on the future status should take place in the form of an eu-us-russian troika .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for serbia , kosovo and its medieval monasteries have a great deal of symbolic value the six members - balkan experts from the us , russia , germany , france , britain and italy - announced it as an attempt to overcome the us-russian deadlock a week after russia blocked a resolution on a un plan to grant kosovo internationally-monitored independence .
kosovo leaders , however , warned on monday that they would not accept further delays in determining the province 's final status and would not give up their demands for independence .
" we consider that this will be the last delay and we will not accept any other deadlines , " said kosovo 's president fatmir sejdiu in an address to the province 's 120-seat parliament .
" further deadlines carry with them dangers not only in compromising the process but also raising concerns and tensions with unforeseeable consequences , " sejdiu said .
" we stress that kosovo 's independence is not negotiable . "
the role of russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo is currently run by the united nations in what was considered a surprise move , russia agreed to the troika format suggested by german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier at the eu foreign ministers ' meeting last monday , even though it previously insisted on keeping the process in the security council , where it holds veto power .
agreement has yet to be reached on the timing of a new round of talks .
the eu had suggested limiting negotiations to 120 days , while russia prefers open-ended talks .
diplomat frank wisner has been appointed to represent the us in the talks .
russia is yet to announce its representative .
opposing views the talks on the future of kosovo are bound to remain extremely difficult and are unlikely to bring any substantial improvements in the relations between belgrade and pristina .
kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority , frustrated by setbacks and delays , will accept nothing short of full independence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 30.07.2007 primor : eu troops could bring peace to middle east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu troops could bring the middle east peace process forward , primor said us secretary of state condoleezza rice is in the middle east to restart the peace process , but avi primor , israel 's former ambassador to germany , said the american efforts amount to nothing more than lip service . avi primor was israel 's ambassador to germany from 1993 to 1999 .
dw-world.de : palestinian president mahmoud abbas said last week that he thought a peace agreement could be reached by the end of 2008 .
one of the reasons he gave was because us secretary of state condoleezza rice assured him of it .
is it wishful thinking ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former israeli ambassador avi primor avi primor : i think abbas is an optimist because he really wants this solution .
he stands for compromise , he is for freedom , he is against terrorism .
but he has , unfortunately , little power , not only because hamas is his opponent and because he has already lost the gaza strip , but also because he has to fight hard in the west bank not to lose power to hamas there as well .
but that 's not really the point .
the question is what can condoleezza rice get started ?
us president bush gave a speech on july 16 in which he laid out a new peace plan and called for an international conference , to be attended by condoleezza rice , in the autumn .
so now the one who has to actually implement the peace plan is condoleezza rice . will condoleezza rice be accepted by all sides as an acceptable negotiating partner during these talks ? she will be accepted by everyone , without a doubt .
i have my doubts about whether she will have the power of the president behind her to actually force a particular direction - because this new peace process needs to be forced .
i do not think that the president is serious about this peace plan , but that he is paying lip service to it to ease pressure from condoleezza rice .
so he can say , " okay , go play a little with the israelis and the palestinians and maybe you can invite a few other arab countries to your conference , saudi arabia would be ideal , but i do n't expect much of it . "
i remember that condoleezza rice wanted to support then president of the world bank james wolfensohn , blair 's processor as middle east envoy , but that she did not have the support of her president and she failed , just as mr. wolfensohn did .
nothing has changed since then , and i do not think that bush , at the end of his term , is really aiming to get something started ; even though he has all the means to do so if he wanted . what kinds of powers would condoleezza rice have to receive to make the plan more than lip service ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice will need the president 's complete support to reach a deal bush 's peace plan put forth several components that he had previously mentioned in his first speech dealing with the middle east in 2002 , so it is a bit of a repetition : israel has to leave its settlements , the palestinians have to fight terrorism , a compromise for jerusalem needs to be reached , the problem of refugees needs to be solved , an independent palestinian state needs to be build and recognized and cooperated with .
these are all great things and israeli politicians recognize that .
but they do n't have the political power to implement such a plan , just like the palestinian administration does not have the power to implement the fight against terrorism .
had the president used all his powers , had he been ready to send money and maybe even troops to ensure security , then he would have been able to push both governments into accepting his plan .
he has not done this since 2002 , and he 's obviously not ready to do it today .
in this respect , condoleezza rice 's mission is only lip service . has n't this conflict for some time been a proxy war , with iran and syria looking to gain influence on one side and the usa and the west on the other ? i think that syria can be separated from iran because syria wants to negotiate and make peace with israel , but the americans are preventing it .
the israeli government is n't excited about it because it does not have the power to relinquish the golan heights .
but it would have fundamentally accepted the syrian president 's offer that a way could have been found - if the americans were satisfied .
but they are not .
still , i believe there is a way .
all the peace plans since 2000 - from the first clinton plan to the bush plan and the quartet 's and the one from saudi arabia - have all had the same components .
everyone knows how the problem can and should actually be solved , but no one has the power to do it .
at its most basic , the problem is security .
if there were someone who was ready to put troops in the occupied territories after israel left them - robust troops that could actually provide security - then i think the governments would be strong enough to implement the various peace plans .
the only ones who can manage something like that today and also have the will to do so are the europeans - assuming that the americans do not object to it .
that 's where condoleezza rice as well as tony blair could be helpful . what step has to come next in order to move toward a realistic peace treaty ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new eu middle east envoy tony blair could help get eu nations to contribute troops the european union needs to draft a peace plan .
that 's not a problem since all the peace plans are similar anyhow .
but this time it should be an initiative from the european union to send robust troops to the middle east .
that does not have to be exclusively european troops , it could also include arab troops , such as from saudi arabia , egypt , jordan or islamic troops like the turks , and maybe even nato .
they should take over power in the occupied territories so that israel can leave the region .
but all of this can only happen if the american do are not against it . how great are your expectations for condoleezza rice 's visit and for her middle east conference in the fall ? very small , because , as i said , i expect that the american president is n't really behind it , and that it 's all just lip service for him .
and so everyone else , the israeli as well as the palestinian government , is also only going to pay it lip service .
i do n't know if the saudi government is going to take part in the conference as bush would like .
they wo n't do it if they are not sure that the americans are actually seriously behind it , and that is not the case .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 30.07.2007 primor : eu troops could bring peace to middle east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu troops could bring the middle east peace process forward , primor said us secretary of state condoleezza rice is in the middle east to restart the peace process , but avi primor , israel 's former ambassador to germany , said the american efforts amount to nothing more than lip service . avi primor was israel 's ambassador to germany from 1993 to 1999 .
dw-world.de : palestinian president mahmoud abbas said last week that he thought a peace agreement could be reached by the end of 2008 .
one of the reasons he gave was because us secretary of state condoleezza rice assured him of it .
is it wishful thinking ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former israeli ambassador avi primor avi primor : i think abbas is an optimist because he really wants this solution .
he stands for compromise , he is for freedom , he is against terrorism .
but he has , unfortunately , little power , not only because hamas is his opponent and because he has already lost the gaza strip , but also because he has to fight hard in the west bank not to lose power to hamas there as well .
but that 's not really the point .
the question is what can condoleezza rice get started ?
us president bush gave a speech on july 16 in which he laid out a new peace plan and called for an international conference , to be attended by condoleezza rice , in the autumn .
so now the one who has to actually implement the peace plan is condoleezza rice . will condoleezza rice be accepted by all sides as an acceptable negotiating partner during these talks ? she will be accepted by everyone , without a doubt .
i have my doubts about whether she will have the power of the president behind her to actually force a particular direction - because this new peace process needs to be forced .
i do not think that the president is serious about this peace plan , but that he is paying lip service to it to ease pressure from condoleezza rice .
so he can say , " okay , go play a little with the israelis and the palestinians and maybe you can invite a few other arab countries to your conference , saudi arabia would be ideal , but i do n't expect much of it . "
i remember that condoleezza rice wanted to support then president of the world bank james wolfensohn , blair 's processor as middle east envoy , but that she did not have the support of her president and she failed , just as mr. wolfensohn did .
nothing has changed since then , and i do not think that bush , at the end of his term , is really aiming to get something started ; even though he has all the means to do so if he wanted . what kinds of powers would condoleezza rice have to receive to make the plan more than lip service ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice will need the president 's complete support to reach a deal bush 's peace plan put forth several components that he had previously mentioned in his first speech dealing with the middle east in 2002 , so it is a bit of a repetition : israel has to leave its settlements , the palestinians have to fight terrorism , a compromise for jerusalem needs to be reached , the problem of refugees needs to be solved , an independent palestinian state needs to be build and recognized and cooperated with .
these are all great things and israeli politicians recognize that .
but they do n't have the political power to implement such a plan , just like the palestinian administration does not have the power to implement the fight against terrorism .
had the president used all his powers , had he been ready to send money and maybe even troops to ensure security , then he would have been able to push both governments into accepting his plan .
he has not done this since 2002 , and he 's obviously not ready to do it today .
in this respect , condoleezza rice 's mission is only lip service . has n't this conflict for some time been a proxy war , with iran and syria looking to gain influence on one side and the usa and the west on the other ? i think that syria can be separated from iran because syria wants to negotiate and make peace with israel , but the americans are preventing it .
the israeli government is n't excited about it because it does not have the power to relinquish the golan heights .
but it would have fundamentally accepted the syrian president 's offer that a way could have been found - if the americans were satisfied .
but they are not .
still , i believe there is a way .
all the peace plans since 2000 - from the first clinton plan to the bush plan and the quartet 's and the one from saudi arabia - have all had the same components .
everyone knows how the problem can and should actually be solved , but no one has the power to do it .
at its most basic , the problem is security .
if there were someone who was ready to put troops in the occupied territories after israel left them - robust troops that could actually provide security - then i think the governments would be strong enough to implement the various peace plans .
the only ones who can manage something like that today and also have the will to do so are the europeans - assuming that the americans do not object to it .
that 's where condoleezza rice as well as tony blair could be helpful . what step has to come next in order to move toward a realistic peace treaty ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new eu middle east envoy tony blair could help get eu nations to contribute troops the european union needs to draft a peace plan .
that 's not a problem since all the peace plans are similar anyhow .
but this time it should be an initiative from the european union to send robust troops to the middle east .
that does not have to be exclusively european troops , it could also include arab troops , such as from saudi arabia , egypt , jordan or islamic troops like the turks , and maybe even nato .
they should take over power in the occupied territories so that israel can leave the region .
but all of this can only happen if the american do are not against it . how great are your expectations for condoleezza rice 's visit and for her middle east conference in the fall ? very small , because , as i said , i expect that the american president is n't really behind it , and that it 's all just lip service for him .
and so everyone else , the israeli as well as the palestinian government , is also only going to pay it lip service .
i do n't know if the saudi government is going to take part in the conference as bush would like .
they wo n't do it if they are not sure that the americans are actually seriously behind it , and that is not the case .
i think the whole thing is just going to be a spectacle . ina rottscheidt interviewed avi primor -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang ischinger has a great deal of experience with the balkan region the 61-year old , who is the german ambassador to britain , is an expert on balkan affairs .
he was - together with us diplomat richard holbrooke - instrumental in brokering the 1995 dayton peace agreement which brought an end to the war in bosnia .
ischinger will be joining top us and russian diplomats under a scheme announced last week to negotiate the future status of the southern serbian province .
a new attempt the scheme was announced by the six members of the kosovo contact group , which said talks on the future status should take place in the form of an eu-us-russian troika .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for serbia , kosovo and its medieval monasteries have a great deal of symbolic value the six members - balkan experts from the us , russia , germany , france , britain and italy - announced it as an attempt to overcome the us-russian deadlock a week after russia blocked a resolution on a un plan to grant kosovo internationally-monitored independence .
kosovo leaders , however , warned on monday that they would not accept further delays in determining the province 's final status and would not give up their demands for independence .
" we consider that this will be the last delay and we will not accept any other deadlines , " said kosovo 's president fatmir sejdiu in an address to the province 's 120-seat parliament .
" further deadlines carry with them dangers not only in compromising the process but also raising concerns and tensions with unforeseeable consequences , " sejdiu said .
" we stress that kosovo 's independence is not negotiable . "
the role of russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo is currently run by the united nations in what was considered a surprise move , russia agreed to the troika format suggested by german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier at the eu foreign ministers ' meeting last monday , even though it previously insisted on keeping the process in the security council , where it holds veto power .
agreement has yet to be reached on the timing of a new round of talks .
the eu had suggested limiting negotiations to 120 days , while russia prefers open-ended talks .
diplomat frank wisner has been appointed to represent the us in the talks .
russia is yet to announce its representative .
opposing views the talks on the future of kosovo are bound to remain extremely difficult and are unlikely to bring any substantial improvements in the relations between belgrade and pristina .
kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority , frustrated by setbacks and delays , will accept nothing short of full independence .
belgrade , on the other hand , is only ready to grant far-reaching autonomy , fearing kosovo 's serb minority will be endangered in case of independence .

" we have duties to discharge and responsibilities to keep in support of the democratically elected government and in support of the explicit will of the international community , " brown said in his first press conference with bush since becoming prime minister in june . finding common ground bush and brown met at the camp david presidential retreat outside washington for two days of talks that began sunday amid a great deal of speculation as to whether the leaders would enjoy the close relationship bush has with brown 's predecessor tony blair . bush too sought to cast aside any questions about his ability to work with brown while emphasizing the close ties between the united states and britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two leaders , seen here in a golf cart , demonstrated they get along " so everybody 's wondering whether or not the prime minister and i were able to find common ground , to get along , to have a meaningful discussion , " bush said .
" and the answer is absolutely . " brown gave no promises on how long britain would maintain its forces in iraq , saying only that a decision to hand over control for security in basra province to iraqi forces would be based on military advice . " we intend to move to overwatch in the fourth province , and that decision will be made on the military advice of our commanders on the ground , " brown said . bush stressed that the two allies would work together towards securing peace in iraq . " there is no doubt in my mind that gordon brown understands that failure in iraq would be a disaster for the security of our own countries , " bush said . he said his relationship with brown would be " a constructive strategic relationship for the good of our peoples . " cracking down on iran bush and brown also discussed the humanitarian crisis in sudan 's darfur region and the us-eu effort to forge a trade plan to help boost the world 's underdeveloped economies . on iran , the two leaders agreed on the need to pursue tougher sanctions over the country 's covert nuclear program . " we 're in agreement that sanctions are working and the next stage we are ready to move towards is to toughen the sanctions with a further un resolution , " brown said . brown arrived sunday at camp david , his first visit to the united states since succeeding blair june 27 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown did not specify how long britain would maintain its forces in iraq bush enjoyed a close personal relationship and political partnership with blair , who stood by bush over the war in iraq despite the british public 's strong disapproval of blair 's decision to order british participation in the 2003 invasion . the continuing struggle in iraq helped to undermine blair and sped his departure from downing street .
observers believe brown will stake out a more businesslike relationship with bush that will emphasize common goals between the two countries . bush has also faced deep opposition to the conflict in iraq at home and increasing calls to set a timeframe for withdrawing us troops . on tuesday , brown will hold talks with un secretary-general ban ki-moon in new york and give a speech at the world body . article based on news reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

afghan president hamid karzai had accused the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- of killing about 90 civilians in june , most of them in air operations .
karzai said that the casualties could damage support for the presence of foreign troops in the country .
smaller bombs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer more than 330 civilians have been killed during fighting involving foreign troops in afghanistan this year so far , according to afghan officials and western aid workers , reuters news agency reported .
scheffer said that nato officials were " working with weapons load on aircraft to reduce collateral damage . "
a nato diplomat told the financial times newspaper that using 250 kg -lrb- about 500 pounds -rrb- bombs rather than 500 kg bombs would " make a huge amount of difference " in terms of casualties .
nato officials also said that the afghan army should increasingly take on house-to-house searches to avoid confrontations .
no need to rush scheffer also said that nato troops would hold off on attacks against the taliban if the number of civilian casualties would run too high as the result of an attack .
" we realize that , if we can not neutralize our enemy today without harming civilians , our enemy will give us the opportunity tomorrow , " scheffer told the paper .
" if that means going after the taliban not on wednesday but on thusday , we will get him then . "
scheffer added , however , that it was impossible to avoid civilian casualties altogether .

saying that the middle east 's powder keg is already explosive enough , foreign policy experts for germany 's governing coalition criticized us plans for military aid worth billions to saudi arabia and other gulf states . an official for the us defense department had said over the weekend that washington planned to give some $ 20 billion -lrb- 14.6 billion euros -rrb- in military assistance to saudi arabia and other states in the gulf region to modernize their armed forces and limit iran 's influence .
israel in return would receive $ 30.4 billion in military aid over the next decade - a significant increase to what the country received before .
while israeli officials have welcomed the plan , which was officially announced by us secretary of state condoleezza rice on monday , german parliamentarians have criticized it as a move that will further destabilize an already fragile region .
a high risk strategy ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruprecht polenz " if you add more explosive things to a powder keg - and that 's what the middle east is - you heighten the risk and do n't make the region safer in the end , " ruprecht polenz , the chairman of the foreign affairs committee in the german parliament , told frankfurter rundschau newspaper .
" in any case , it 's a high-risk strategy , " added polenz , a member of parliament for the conservative christian democratic union of chancellor angela merkel .
" the aim - to signal iran that a struggle for hegemony based on military might wo n't lead to success - can lead to the wrong reaction in tehran : to try harder and arm faster . "
polenz suggested that the german government should push for a regional security conference and - together with the eu - lobby others not to send arms to crisis regions .
a csce for the mideast ?
" instead , one should try to get a process started that 's similar to the conference on security and cooperation in europe -lsb- csce -rsb- in the 1970s : to discuss the region 's security problems with everyone involved , to build trust and maybe dampen armament or even encourage disarmament this way , " polenz said .

saying that the middle east 's powder keg is already explosive enough , foreign policy experts for germany 's governing coalition criticized us plans for military aid worth billions to saudi arabia and other gulf states . an official for the us defense department had said over the weekend that washington planned to give some $ 20 billion -lrb- 14.6 billion euros -rrb- in military assistance to saudi arabia and other states in the gulf region to modernize their armed forces and limit iran 's influence .
israel in return would receive $ 30.4 billion in military aid over the next decade - a significant increase to what the country received before .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 30.07.2007 the miracle of merkel - is there anything angela ca n't do ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel remains extremely popular , both in germany and abroad she moves in high circles , hangs out at the opera and gets backrubs from the leader of the free world .
now , most german businessmen say they 'd like to have her as their boss .
can angela merkel do anything wrong ? being famous is surely a tough job .
just ask brad and angelina .
or that good old overachiever madonna , who consistently refuses to stay with her own age .
they all work so hard at preserving their image and compromise so much of their privacy just to remain on the covers of glossy magazines .
angela , on the other hand , makes fame appear easy .
wherever she goes , she is praised for her winning combination of diplomatic skills and unflinching perseverance .
during a recent eu summit , the german chancellor practically saved europe from the brink of a disaster .
for her , however , it 's all just part of the job .
no more and no less .
let 's not get touchy-feely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a moment to remember -lrb- and a hit on youtube -rrb- : angela getting a backrub from george w. bush germany 's top job has , of course , its perks .
in 2006 , for instance , merkel received a widely-publicized backrub from the embarrassingly easy-going us president george w. bush .
not many politicians can say that they were groped by the leader of the free world .
she attends festival openings and mingles with the glitterati , but remains oddly down-to-earth .
when asked about whether fame had changed her and whether her husband was noticing anything different about her , she answered in her usual , direct , matter-of-fact tone that the breakfast she was preparing for them was still the same .
even though she might have done so , it 's silly to picture margaret thatcher frying bacon and eggs , or even just heating up a serving of refried beans for that scary abomination that the british call their breakfast .
but it is not hard to imagine angela hovering over a stove .
it 's a surprisingly credible and comforting image .
it gives representative democracy a glimmer of hope that some politicians , once they climb to the top , can actually remain human beings .
that is , perhaps , one of the reasons why she remains extremely popular in germany .
she rules , literally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business leaders think that merkel would be a good boss business leaders seem to agree .
in a recent poll about politicians as potential business leaders , the german chancellor got very positive reviews .
when asked about which german politician they would accept as their boss , 81 percent of german managers said angela merkel .
at the same time , 70 percent of those polled said they thought the trained physicist was capable of running a large enterprise .
in comparison , germany 's economy minister , michael gloss , got only 42 of positive votes in this category , while labor minister franz müntefering rated even worse - with only 37 percent of votes .
so what does the career of angela merkel teach us about life in general - other than that still water runs deep and that breakfast is the most important meal of the day ?
it teaches us that an unassuming and soft-spoken woman can break barriers and achieve more than a pompous , cigar-smoking macho of the gerhard schröder variety .
the former chancellor would probably beg to differ , but his portrait is already hanging in the german chancellery , which means he 's been relegated to history .
old angela , new angela angela 's transformation from an awkward and stuttering newcomer in the world of schröders , stoibers and their mostly male buddies is best judged by the media coverage of her arrival to the glitzy opening of the bayreuth opera festival .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the days of heavy prespiration are over two years ago , germany was roaring with laughter because the light apricot jacket-skirt combo , which merkel wore for the opening , was soiled with sweat stains underneath her armpits .
this year , however , german tabloid bild went gaga over merkel 's fashion accessory du jour - a strap-on purse which the newspaper , known for its familiarity with hyperbole , described as a " floating magic bag . "
gracefully walking down the red carpet in a sweat-free lilac outfit - which , admittedly , some catty observers said resembled a combination of a business jacket and a potato sack - merkel waved at the onlookers with her right hand , while her left arm remained comfortably limp with an elegant bag attached to her wrist .
from certain angles , it looked like merkel 's purse was indeed hovering in the air .
in two years , merkel went from being sneered upon as an extra in a deodorant ad to being admired as a middle-aged , top-tier version of sarah jessica parker .
transformation is her forte .
and it is no surprise that most german managers think she would make a good boss . that is the miracle of merkel . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de at string of summits , merkel ready to serve the finest wine there can be no bargain without wine , goes a latin saying .
so it 's no surprise that germany 's chancellor angela merkel has personally handpicked the country 's best wines to serve at the upcoming eu and g8 summits .
-lrb- 07.03.2007 -rrb- bush vows " no backrubs " for merkel when president george w. bush hosted german chancellor angela merkel this week , he promised to behave and keep his hands to himself .
-lrb- 05.01.2007 -rrb- breakfast at angela 's reviewing her first year as chancellor , angela merkel revealed wednesday that leading a country - surprise , surprise - pretty much turns one 's life upside down .
but there 's at least one thing that 's remained unchanged .
-lrb- 22.11.2006 -rrb- feedback do you think that angela merkel will remain popular in the future ?

" we have duties to discharge and responsibilities to keep in support of the democratically elected government and in support of the explicit will of the international community , " brown said in his first press conference with bush since becoming prime minister in june . finding common ground bush and brown met at the camp david presidential retreat outside washington for two days of talks that began sunday amid a great deal of speculation as to whether the leaders would enjoy the close relationship bush has with brown 's predecessor tony blair . bush too sought to cast aside any questions about his ability to work with brown while emphasizing the close ties between the united states and britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two leaders , seen here in a golf cart , demonstrated they get along " so everybody 's wondering whether or not the prime minister and i were able to find common ground , to get along , to have a meaningful discussion , " bush said .
" and the answer is absolutely . " brown gave no promises on how long britain would maintain its forces in iraq , saying only that a decision to hand over control for security in basra province to iraqi forces would be based on military advice . " we intend to move to overwatch in the fourth province , and that decision will be made on the military advice of our commanders on the ground , " brown said . bush stressed that the two allies would work together towards securing peace in iraq . " there is no doubt in my mind that gordon brown understands that failure in iraq would be a disaster for the security of our own countries , " bush said . he said his relationship with brown would be " a constructive strategic relationship for the good of our peoples . " cracking down on iran bush and brown also discussed the humanitarian crisis in sudan 's darfur region and the us-eu effort to forge a trade plan to help boost the world 's underdeveloped economies . on iran , the two leaders agreed on the need to pursue tougher sanctions over the country 's covert nuclear program . " we 're in agreement that sanctions are working and the next stage we are ready to move towards is to toughen the sanctions with a further un resolution , " brown said . brown arrived sunday at camp david , his first visit to the united states since succeeding blair june 27 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown did not specify how long britain would maintain its forces in iraq bush enjoyed a close personal relationship and political partnership with blair , who stood by bush over the war in iraq despite the british public 's strong disapproval of blair 's decision to order british participation in the 2003 invasion . the continuing struggle in iraq helped to undermine blair and sped his departure from downing street .
observers believe brown will stake out a more businesslike relationship with bush that will emphasize common goals between the two countries . bush has also faced deep opposition to the conflict in iraq at home and increasing calls to set a timeframe for withdrawing us troops . on tuesday , brown will hold talks with un secretary-general ban ki-moon in new york and give a speech at the world body . article based on news reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have duties to discharge and responsibilities to keep in support of the democratically elected government and in support of the explicit will of the international community , " brown said in his first press conference with bush since becoming prime minister in june . finding common ground bush and brown met at the camp david presidential retreat outside washington for two days of talks that began sunday amid a great deal of speculation as to whether the leaders would enjoy the close relationship bush has with brown 's predecessor tony blair . bush too sought to cast aside any questions about his ability to work with brown while emphasizing the close ties between the united states and britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two leaders , seen here in a golf cart , demonstrated they get along " so everybody 's wondering whether or not the prime minister and i were able to find common ground , to get along , to have a meaningful discussion , " bush said .
" and the answer is absolutely . " brown gave no promises on how long britain would maintain its forces in iraq , saying only that a decision to hand over control for security in basra province to iraqi forces would be based on military advice . " we intend to move to overwatch in the fourth province , and that decision will be made on the military advice of our commanders on the ground , " brown said . bush stressed that the two allies would work together towards securing peace in iraq . " there is no doubt in my mind that gordon brown understands that failure in iraq would be a disaster for the security of our own countries , " bush said . he said his relationship with brown would be " a constructive strategic relationship for the good of our peoples . " cracking down on iran bush and brown also discussed the humanitarian crisis in sudan 's darfur region and the us-eu effort to forge a trade plan to help boost the world 's underdeveloped economies . on iran , the two leaders agreed on the need to pursue tougher sanctions over the country 's covert nuclear program . " we 're in agreement that sanctions are working and the next stage we are ready to move towards is to toughen the sanctions with a further un resolution , " brown said . brown arrived sunday at camp david , his first visit to the united states since succeeding blair june 27 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown did not specify how long britain would maintain its forces in iraq bush enjoyed a close personal relationship and political partnership with blair , who stood by bush over the war in iraq despite the british public 's strong disapproval of blair 's decision to order british participation in the 2003 invasion . the continuing struggle in iraq helped to undermine blair and sped his departure from downing street .
observers believe brown will stake out a more businesslike relationship with bush that will emphasize common goals between the two countries . bush has also faced deep opposition to the conflict in iraq at home and increasing calls to set a timeframe for withdrawing us troops . on tuesday , brown will hold talks with un secretary-general ban ki-moon in new york and give a speech at the world body . article based on news reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

saying that the middle east 's powder keg is already explosive enough , foreign policy experts for germany 's governing coalition criticized us plans for military aid worth billions to saudi arabia and other gulf states . an official for the us defense department had said over the weekend that washington planned to give some $ 20 billion -lrb- 14.6 billion euros -rrb- in military assistance to saudi arabia and other states in the gulf region to modernize their armed forces and limit iran 's influence .
israel in return would receive $ 30.4 billion in military aid over the next decade - a significant increase to what the country received before .
while israeli officials have welcomed the plan , which was officially announced by us secretary of state condoleezza rice on monday , german parliamentarians have criticized it as a move that will further destabilize an already fragile region .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruprecht polenz " if you add more explosive things to a powder keg - and that 's what the middle east is - you heighten the risk and do n't make the region safer in the end , " ruprecht polenz , the chairman of the foreign affairs committee in the german parliament , told frankfurter rundschau newspaper .
" in any case , it 's a high-risk strategy , " added polenz , a member of parliament for the conservative christian democratic union of chancellor angela merkel .
" the aim - to signal iran that a struggle for hegemony based on military might wo n't lead to success - can lead to the wrong reaction in tehran : to try harder and arm faster . "
polenz suggested that the german government should push for a regional security conference and - together with the eu - lobby others not to send arms to crisis regions .

" instead , one should try to get a process started that 's similar to the conference on security and cooperation in europe -lsb- csce -rsb- in the 1970s : to discuss the region 's security problems with everyone involved , to build trust and maybe dampen armament or even encourage disarmament this way , " polenz said .
while saying that the idea to establish a middle east equivalent of the csce was nothing new , johannes jung , a member of the parliament 's foreign affairs committee for the social democratic party , said that this was more urgent than ever .

now , most german businessmen say they 'd like to have her as their boss .
can angela merkel do anything wrong ? being famous is surely a tough job .
just ask brad and angelina .
or that good old overachiever madonna , who consistently refuses to stay with her own age .
they all work so hard at preserving their image and compromise so much of their privacy just to remain on the covers of glossy magazines .
angela , on the other hand , makes fame appear easy .
wherever she goes , she is praised for her winning combination of diplomatic skills and unflinching perseverance .
during a recent eu summit , the german chancellor practically saved europe from the brink of a disaster .
for her , however , it 's all just part of the job .
no more and no less .
let 's not get touchy-feely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a moment to remember -lrb- and a hit on youtube -rrb- : angela getting a backrub from george w. bush germany 's top job has , of course , its perks .
in 2006 , for instance , merkel received a widely-publicized backrub from the embarrassingly easy-going us president george w. bush .
not many politicians can say that they were groped by the leader of the free world .
she attends festival openings and mingles with the glitterati , but remains oddly down-to-earth .
when asked about whether fame had changed her and whether her husband was noticing anything different about her , she answered in her usual , direct , matter-of-fact tone that the breakfast she was preparing for them was still the same .
even though she might have done so , it 's silly to picture margaret thatcher frying bacon and eggs , or even just heating up a serving of refried beans for that scary abomination that the british call their breakfast .
but it is not hard to imagine angela hovering over a stove .
it 's a surprisingly credible and comforting image .
it gives representative democracy a glimmer of hope that some politicians , once they climb to the top , can actually remain human beings .
that is , perhaps , one of the reasons why she remains extremely popular in germany .
she rules , literally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business leaders think that merkel would be a good boss business leaders seem to agree .
in a recent poll about politicians as potential business leaders , the german chancellor got very positive reviews .
when asked about which german politician they would accept as their boss , 81 percent of german managers said angela merkel .
at the same time , 70 percent of those polled said they thought the trained physicist was capable of running a large enterprise .
in comparison , germany 's economy minister , michael gloss , got only 42 of positive votes in this category , while labor minister franz müntefering rated even worse - with only 37 percent of votes .
so what does the career of angela merkel teach us about life in general - other than that still water runs deep and that breakfast is the most important meal of the day ?
it teaches us that an unassuming and soft-spoken woman can break barriers and achieve more than a pompous , cigar-smoking macho of the gerhard schröder variety .
the former chancellor would probably beg to differ , but his portrait is already hanging in the german chancellery , which means he 's been relegated to history .
old angela , new angela angela 's transformation from an awkward and stuttering newcomer in the world of schröders , stoibers and their mostly male buddies is best judged by the media coverage of her arrival to the glitzy opening of the bayreuth opera festival .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the days of heavy prespiration are over two years ago , germany was roaring with laughter because the light apricot jacket-skirt combo , which merkel wore for the opening , was soiled with sweat stains underneath her armpits .
this year , however , german tabloid bild went gaga over merkel 's fashion accessory du jour - a strap-on purse which the newspaper , known for its familiarity with hyperbole , described as a " floating magic bag . "
gracefully walking down the red carpet in a sweat-free lilac outfit - which , admittedly , some catty observers said resembled a combination of a business jacket and a potato sack - merkel waved at the onlookers with her right hand , while her left arm remained comfortably limp with an elegant bag attached to her wrist .
from certain angles , it looked like merkel 's purse was indeed hovering in the air .
in two years , merkel went from being sneered upon as an extra in a deodorant ad to being admired as a middle-aged , top-tier version of sarah jessica parker .
transformation is her forte .

now , most german businessmen say they 'd like to have her as their boss .
can angela merkel do anything wrong ? being famous is surely a tough job .
just ask brad and angelina .
or that good old overachiever madonna , who consistently refuses to stay with her own age .
they all work so hard at preserving their image and compromise so much of their privacy just to remain on the covers of glossy magazines .
angela , on the other hand , makes fame appear easy .
wherever she goes , she is praised for her winning combination of diplomatic skills and unflinching perseverance .
during a recent eu summit , the german chancellor practically saved europe from the brink of a disaster .
for her , however , it 's all just part of the job .
no more and no less .
let 's not get touchy-feely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a moment to remember -lrb- and a hit on youtube -rrb- : angela getting a backrub from george w. bush germany 's top job has , of course , its perks .
in 2006 , for instance , merkel received a widely-publicized backrub from the embarrassingly easy-going us president george w. bush .
not many politicians can say that they were groped by the leader of the free world .
she attends festival openings and mingles with the glitterati , but remains oddly down-to-earth .
when asked about whether fame had changed her and whether her husband was noticing anything different about her , she answered in her usual , direct , matter-of-fact tone that the breakfast she was preparing for them was still the same .
even though she might have done so , it 's silly to picture margaret thatcher frying bacon and eggs , or even just heating up a serving of refried beans for that scary abomination that the british call their breakfast .
but it is not hard to imagine angela hovering over a stove .
it 's a surprisingly credible and comforting image .
it gives representative democracy a glimmer of hope that some politicians , once they climb to the top , can actually remain human beings .
that is , perhaps , one of the reasons why she remains extremely popular in germany .
she rules , literally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business leaders think that merkel would be a good boss business leaders seem to agree .
in a recent poll about politicians as potential business leaders , the german chancellor got very positive reviews .
when asked about which german politician they would accept as their boss , 81 percent of german managers said angela merkel .
at the same time , 70 percent of those polled said they thought the trained physicist was capable of running a large enterprise .
in comparison , germany 's economy minister , michael gloss , got only 42 of positive votes in this category , while labor minister franz müntefering rated even worse - with only 37 percent of votes .
so what does the career of angela merkel teach us about life in general - other than that still water runs deep and that breakfast is the most important meal of the day ?
it teaches us that an unassuming and soft-spoken woman can break barriers and achieve more than a pompous , cigar-smoking macho of the gerhard schröder variety .
the former chancellor would probably beg to differ , but his portrait is already hanging in the german chancellery , which means he 's been relegated to history .
old angela , new angela angela 's transformation from an awkward and stuttering newcomer in the world of schröders , stoibers and their mostly male buddies is best judged by the media coverage of her arrival to the glitzy opening of the bayreuth opera festival .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the days of heavy prespiration are over two years ago , germany was roaring with laughter because the light apricot jacket-skirt combo , which merkel wore for the opening , was soiled with sweat stains underneath her armpits .
this year , however , german tabloid bild went gaga over merkel 's fashion accessory du jour - a strap-on purse which the newspaper , known for its familiarity with hyperbole , described as a " floating magic bag . "
gracefully walking down the red carpet in a sweat-free lilac outfit - which , admittedly , some catty observers said resembled a combination of a business jacket and a potato sack - merkel waved at the onlookers with her right hand , while her left arm remained comfortably limp with an elegant bag attached to her wrist .
from certain angles , it looked like merkel 's purse was indeed hovering in the air .
in two years , merkel went from being sneered upon as an extra in a deodorant ad to being admired as a middle-aged , top-tier version of sarah jessica parker .
transformation is her forte .

afghan president hamid karzai had accused the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- of killing about 90 civilians in june , most of them in air operations .
karzai said that the casualties could damage support for the presence of foreign troops in the country .
smaller bombs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer more than 330 civilians have been killed during fighting involving foreign troops in afghanistan this year so far , according to afghan officials and western aid workers , reuters news agency reported .
scheffer said that nato officials were " working with weapons load on aircraft to reduce collateral damage . "
a nato diplomat told the financial times newspaper that using 250 kg -lrb- about 500 pounds -rrb- bombs rather than 500 kg bombs would " make a huge amount of difference " in terms of casualties .
nato officials also said that the afghan army should increasingly take on house-to-house searches to avoid confrontations .
no need to rush scheffer also said that nato troops would hold off on attacks against the taliban if the number of civilian casualties would run too high as the result of an attack .
" we realize that , if we can not neutralize our enemy today without harming civilians , our enemy will give us the opportunity tomorrow , " scheffer told the paper .
" if that means going after the taliban not on wednesday but on thusday , we will get him then . "
scheffer added , however , that it was impossible to avoid civilian casualties altogether .

afghan president hamid karzai had accused the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- of killing about 90 civilians in june , most of them in air operations .
karzai said that the casualties could damage support for the presence of foreign troops in the country .
smaller bombs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer more than 330 civilians have been killed during fighting involving foreign troops in afghanistan this year so far , according to afghan officials and western aid workers , reuters news agency reported .
scheffer said that nato officials were " working with weapons load on aircraft to reduce collateral damage . "
a nato diplomat told the financial times newspaper that using 250 kg -lrb- about 500 pounds -rrb- bombs rather than 500 kg bombs would " make a huge amount of difference " in terms of casualties .
nato officials also said that the afghan army should increasingly take on house-to-house searches to avoid confrontations .
no need to rush scheffer also said that nato troops would hold off on attacks against the taliban if the number of civilian casualties would run too high as the result of an attack .
" we realize that , if we can not neutralize our enemy today without harming civilians , our enemy will give us the opportunity tomorrow , " scheffer told the paper .
" if that means going after the taliban not on wednesday but on thusday , we will get him then . "
scheffer added , however , that it was impossible to avoid civilian casualties altogether .
more than 50,000 foreign soldiers are currently stationed in afghanistan , including some 3,000 germans . article based on news reports -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 30.07.2007 primor : eu troops could bring peace to middle east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu troops could bring the middle east peace process forward , primor said us secretary of state condoleezza rice is in the middle east to restart the peace process , but avi primor , israel 's former ambassador to germany , said the american efforts amount to nothing more than lip service . avi primor was israel 's ambassador to germany from 1993 to 1999 .
dw-world.de : palestinian president mahmoud abbas said last week that he thought a peace agreement could be reached by the end of 2008 .
one of the reasons he gave was because us secretary of state condoleezza rice assured him of it .
is it wishful thinking ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former israeli ambassador avi primor avi primor : i think abbas is an optimist because he really wants this solution .
he stands for compromise , he is for freedom , he is against terrorism .
but he has , unfortunately , little power , not only because hamas is his opponent and because he has already lost the gaza strip , but also because he has to fight hard in the west bank not to lose power to hamas there as well .
but that 's not really the point .
the question is what can condoleezza rice get started ?
us president bush gave a speech on july 16 in which he laid out a new peace plan and called for an international conference , to be attended by condoleezza rice , in the autumn .
so now the one who has to actually implement the peace plan is condoleezza rice . will condoleezza rice be accepted by all sides as an acceptable negotiating partner during these talks ? she will be accepted by everyone , without a doubt .
i have my doubts about whether she will have the power of the president behind her to actually force a particular direction - because this new peace process needs to be forced .
i do not think that the president is serious about this peace plan , but that he is paying lip service to it to ease pressure from condoleezza rice .
so he can say , " okay , go play a little with the israelis and the palestinians and maybe you can invite a few other arab countries to your conference , saudi arabia would be ideal , but i do n't expect much of it . "
i remember that condoleezza rice wanted to support then president of the world bank james wolfensohn , blair 's processor as middle east envoy , but that she did not have the support of her president and she failed , just as mr. wolfensohn did .
nothing has changed since then , and i do not think that bush , at the end of his term , is really aiming to get something started ; even though he has all the means to do so if he wanted . what kinds of powers would condoleezza rice have to receive to make the plan more than lip service ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice will need the president 's complete support to reach a deal bush 's peace plan put forth several components that he had previously mentioned in his first speech dealing with the middle east in 2002 , so it is a bit of a repetition : israel has to leave its settlements , the palestinians have to fight terrorism , a compromise for jerusalem needs to be reached , the problem of refugees needs to be solved , an independent palestinian state needs to be build and recognized and cooperated with .
these are all great things and israeli politicians recognize that .
but they do n't have the political power to implement such a plan , just like the palestinian administration does not have the power to implement the fight against terrorism .
had the president used all his powers , had he been ready to send money and maybe even troops to ensure security , then he would have been able to push both governments into accepting his plan .
he has not done this since 2002 , and he 's obviously not ready to do it today .
in this respect , condoleezza rice 's mission is only lip service . has n't this conflict for some time been a proxy war , with iran and syria looking to gain influence on one side and the usa and the west on the other ? i think that syria can be separated from iran because syria wants to negotiate and make peace with israel , but the americans are preventing it .
the israeli government is n't excited about it because it does not have the power to relinquish the golan heights .
but it would have fundamentally accepted the syrian president 's offer that a way could have been found - if the americans were satisfied .
but they are not .
still , i believe there is a way .
all the peace plans since 2000 - from the first clinton plan to the bush plan and the quartet 's and the one from saudi arabia - have all had the same components .
everyone knows how the problem can and should actually be solved , but no one has the power to do it .
at its most basic , the problem is security .
if there were someone who was ready to put troops in the occupied territories after israel left them - robust troops that could actually provide security - then i think the governments would be strong enough to implement the various peace plans .
the only ones who can manage something like that today and also have the will to do so are the europeans - assuming that the americans do not object to it .
that 's where condoleezza rice as well as tony blair could be helpful . what step has to come next in order to move toward a realistic peace treaty ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new eu middle east envoy tony blair could help get eu nations to contribute troops the european union needs to draft a peace plan .
that 's not a problem since all the peace plans are similar anyhow .
but this time it should be an initiative from the european union to send robust troops to the middle east .
that does not have to be exclusively european troops , it could also include arab troops , such as from saudi arabia , egypt , jordan or islamic troops like the turks , and maybe even nato .
they should take over power in the occupied territories so that israel can leave the region .
but all of this can only happen if the american do are not against it . how great are your expectations for condoleezza rice 's visit and for her middle east conference in the fall ? very small , because , as i said , i expect that the american president is n't really behind it , and that it 's all just lip service for him .
and so everyone else , the israeli as well as the palestinian government , is also only going to pay it lip service .
i do n't know if the saudi government is going to take part in the conference as bush would like .
they wo n't do it if they are not sure that the americans are actually seriously behind it , and that is not the case .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 30.07.2007 the miracle of merkel - is there anything angela ca n't do ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel remains extremely popular , both in germany and abroad she moves in high circles , hangs out at the opera and gets backrubs from the leader of the free world .
now , most german businessmen say they 'd like to have her as their boss .
can angela merkel do anything wrong ? being famous is surely a tough job .
just ask brad and angelina .
or that good old overachiever madonna , who consistently refuses to stay with her own age .
they all work so hard at preserving their image and compromise so much of their privacy just to remain on the covers of glossy magazines .
angela , on the other hand , makes fame appear easy .
wherever she goes , she is praised for her winning combination of diplomatic skills and unflinching perseverance .
during a recent eu summit , the german chancellor practically saved europe from the brink of a disaster .
for her , however , it 's all just part of the job .
no more and no less .
let 's not get touchy-feely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a moment to remember -lrb- and a hit on youtube -rrb- : angela getting a backrub from george w. bush germany 's top job has , of course , its perks .
in 2006 , for instance , merkel received a widely-publicized backrub from the embarrassingly easy-going us president george w. bush .
not many politicians can say that they were groped by the leader of the free world .
she attends festival openings and mingles with the glitterati , but remains oddly down-to-earth .
when asked about whether fame had changed her and whether her husband was noticing anything different about her , she answered in her usual , direct , matter-of-fact tone that the breakfast she was preparing for them was still the same .
even though she might have done so , it 's silly to picture margaret thatcher frying bacon and eggs , or even just heating up a serving of refried beans for that scary abomination that the british call their breakfast .
but it is not hard to imagine angela hovering over a stove .
it 's a surprisingly credible and comforting image .
it gives representative democracy a glimmer of hope that some politicians , once they climb to the top , can actually remain human beings .
that is , perhaps , one of the reasons why she remains extremely popular in germany .
she rules , literally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business leaders think that merkel would be a good boss business leaders seem to agree .
in a recent poll about politicians as potential business leaders , the german chancellor got very positive reviews .
when asked about which german politician they would accept as their boss , 81 percent of german managers said angela merkel .
at the same time , 70 percent of those polled said they thought the trained physicist was capable of running a large enterprise .
in comparison , germany 's economy minister , michael gloss , got only 42 of positive votes in this category , while labor minister franz müntefering rated even worse - with only 37 percent of votes .
so what does the career of angela merkel teach us about life in general - other than that still water runs deep and that breakfast is the most important meal of the day ?
it teaches us that an unassuming and soft-spoken woman can break barriers and achieve more than a pompous , cigar-smoking macho of the gerhard schröder variety .
the former chancellor would probably beg to differ , but his portrait is already hanging in the german chancellery , which means he 's been relegated to history .
old angela , new angela angela 's transformation from an awkward and stuttering newcomer in the world of schröders , stoibers and their mostly male buddies is best judged by the media coverage of her arrival to the glitzy opening of the bayreuth opera festival .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the days of heavy prespiration are over two years ago , germany was roaring with laughter because the light apricot jacket-skirt combo , which merkel wore for the opening , was soiled with sweat stains underneath her armpits .
this year , however , german tabloid bild went gaga over merkel 's fashion accessory du jour - a strap-on purse which the newspaper , known for its familiarity with hyperbole , described as a " floating magic bag . "
gracefully walking down the red carpet in a sweat-free lilac outfit - which , admittedly , some catty observers said resembled a combination of a business jacket and a potato sack - merkel waved at the onlookers with her right hand , while her left arm remained comfortably limp with an elegant bag attached to her wrist .
from certain angles , it looked like merkel 's purse was indeed hovering in the air .
in two years , merkel went from being sneered upon as an extra in a deodorant ad to being admired as a middle-aged , top-tier version of sarah jessica parker .
transformation is her forte .
and it is no surprise that most german managers think she would make a good boss . that is the miracle of merkel . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de at string of summits , merkel ready to serve the finest wine there can be no bargain without wine , goes a latin saying .
so it 's no surprise that germany 's chancellor angela merkel has personally handpicked the country 's best wines to serve at the upcoming eu and g8 summits .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 30.07.2007 the miracle of merkel - is there anything angela ca n't do ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel remains extremely popular , both in germany and abroad she moves in high circles , hangs out at the opera and gets backrubs from the leader of the free world .
now , most german businessmen say they 'd like to have her as their boss .
can angela merkel do anything wrong ? being famous is surely a tough job .
just ask brad and angelina .
or that good old overachiever madonna , who consistently refuses to stay with her own age .
they all work so hard at preserving their image and compromise so much of their privacy just to remain on the covers of glossy magazines .
angela , on the other hand , makes fame appear easy .
wherever she goes , she is praised for her winning combination of diplomatic skills and unflinching perseverance .
during a recent eu summit , the german chancellor practically saved europe from the brink of a disaster .
for her , however , it 's all just part of the job .
no more and no less .
let 's not get touchy-feely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a moment to remember -lrb- and a hit on youtube -rrb- : angela getting a backrub from george w. bush germany 's top job has , of course , its perks .
in 2006 , for instance , merkel received a widely-publicized backrub from the embarrassingly easy-going us president george w. bush .
not many politicians can say that they were groped by the leader of the free world .
she attends festival openings and mingles with the glitterati , but remains oddly down-to-earth .
when asked about whether fame had changed her and whether her husband was noticing anything different about her , she answered in her usual , direct , matter-of-fact tone that the breakfast she was preparing for them was still the same .
even though she might have done so , it 's silly to picture margaret thatcher frying bacon and eggs , or even just heating up a serving of refried beans for that scary abomination that the british call their breakfast .
but it is not hard to imagine angela hovering over a stove .
it 's a surprisingly credible and comforting image .
it gives representative democracy a glimmer of hope that some politicians , once they climb to the top , can actually remain human beings .
that is , perhaps , one of the reasons why she remains extremely popular in germany .
she rules , literally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business leaders think that merkel would be a good boss business leaders seem to agree .
in a recent poll about politicians as potential business leaders , the german chancellor got very positive reviews .
when asked about which german politician they would accept as their boss , 81 percent of german managers said angela merkel .
at the same time , 70 percent of those polled said they thought the trained physicist was capable of running a large enterprise .
in comparison , germany 's economy minister , michael gloss , got only 42 of positive votes in this category , while labor minister franz müntefering rated even worse - with only 37 percent of votes .
so what does the career of angela merkel teach us about life in general - other than that still water runs deep and that breakfast is the most important meal of the day ?
it teaches us that an unassuming and soft-spoken woman can break barriers and achieve more than a pompous , cigar-smoking macho of the gerhard schröder variety .
the former chancellor would probably beg to differ , but his portrait is already hanging in the german chancellery , which means he 's been relegated to history .
old angela , new angela angela 's transformation from an awkward and stuttering newcomer in the world of schröders , stoibers and their mostly male buddies is best judged by the media coverage of her arrival to the glitzy opening of the bayreuth opera festival .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the days of heavy prespiration are over two years ago , germany was roaring with laughter because the light apricot jacket-skirt combo , which merkel wore for the opening , was soiled with sweat stains underneath her armpits .
this year , however , german tabloid bild went gaga over merkel 's fashion accessory du jour - a strap-on purse which the newspaper , known for its familiarity with hyperbole , described as a " floating magic bag . "
gracefully walking down the red carpet in a sweat-free lilac outfit - which , admittedly , some catty observers said resembled a combination of a business jacket and a potato sack - merkel waved at the onlookers with her right hand , while her left arm remained comfortably limp with an elegant bag attached to her wrist .
from certain angles , it looked like merkel 's purse was indeed hovering in the air .
in two years , merkel went from being sneered upon as an extra in a deodorant ad to being admired as a middle-aged , top-tier version of sarah jessica parker .
transformation is her forte .
and it is no surprise that most german managers think she would make a good boss . that is the miracle of merkel . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de at string of summits , merkel ready to serve the finest wine there can be no bargain without wine , goes a latin saying .
so it 's no surprise that germany 's chancellor angela merkel has personally handpicked the country 's best wines to serve at the upcoming eu and g8 summits .
-lrb- 07.03.2007 -rrb- bush vows " no backrubs " for merkel when president george w. bush hosted german chancellor angela merkel this week , he promised to behave and keep his hands to himself .
-lrb- 05.01.2007 -rrb- breakfast at angela 's reviewing her first year as chancellor , angela merkel revealed wednesday that leading a country - surprise , surprise - pretty much turns one 's life upside down .
but there 's at least one thing that 's remained unchanged .
-lrb- 22.11.2006 -rrb- feedback do you think that angela merkel will remain popular in the future ?

now , most german businessmen say they 'd like to have her as their boss .
can angela merkel do anything wrong ? being famous is surely a tough job .
just ask brad and angelina .
or that good old overachiever madonna , who consistently refuses to stay with her own age .
they all work so hard at preserving their image and compromise so much of their privacy just to remain on the covers of glossy magazines .
angela , on the other hand , makes fame appear easy .
wherever she goes , she is praised for her winning combination of diplomatic skills and unflinching perseverance .
during a recent eu summit , the german chancellor practically saved europe from the brink of a disaster .
for her , however , it 's all just part of the job .
no more and no less .
let 's not get touchy-feely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a moment to remember -lrb- and a hit on youtube -rrb- : angela getting a backrub from george w. bush germany 's top job has , of course , its perks .
in 2006 , for instance , merkel received a widely-publicized backrub from the embarrassingly easy-going us president george w. bush .
not many politicians can say that they were groped by the leader of the free world .
she attends festival openings and mingles with the glitterati , but remains oddly down-to-earth .
when asked about whether fame had changed her and whether her husband was noticing anything different about her , she answered in her usual , direct , matter-of-fact tone that the breakfast she was preparing for them was still the same .
even though she might have done so , it 's silly to picture margaret thatcher frying bacon and eggs , or even just heating up a serving of refried beans for that scary abomination that the british call their breakfast .
but it is not hard to imagine angela hovering over a stove .
it 's a surprisingly credible and comforting image .
it gives representative democracy a glimmer of hope that some politicians , once they climb to the top , can actually remain human beings .
that is , perhaps , one of the reasons why she remains extremely popular in germany .
she rules , literally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business leaders think that merkel would be a good boss business leaders seem to agree .
in a recent poll about politicians as potential business leaders , the german chancellor got very positive reviews .
when asked about which german politician they would accept as their boss , 81 percent of german managers said angela merkel .
at the same time , 70 percent of those polled said they thought the trained physicist was capable of running a large enterprise .
in comparison , germany 's economy minister , michael gloss , got only 42 of positive votes in this category , while labor minister franz müntefering rated even worse - with only 37 percent of votes .
so what does the career of angela merkel teach us about life in general - other than that still water runs deep and that breakfast is the most important meal of the day ?
it teaches us that an unassuming and soft-spoken woman can break barriers and achieve more than a pompous , cigar-smoking macho of the gerhard schröder variety .
the former chancellor would probably beg to differ , but his portrait is already hanging in the german chancellery , which means he 's been relegated to history .
old angela , new angela angela 's transformation from an awkward and stuttering newcomer in the world of schröders , stoibers and their mostly male buddies is best judged by the media coverage of her arrival to the glitzy opening of the bayreuth opera festival .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the days of heavy prespiration are over two years ago , germany was roaring with laughter because the light apricot jacket-skirt combo , which merkel wore for the opening , was soiled with sweat stains underneath her armpits .
this year , however , german tabloid bild went gaga over merkel 's fashion accessory du jour - a strap-on purse which the newspaper , known for its familiarity with hyperbole , described as a " floating magic bag . "
gracefully walking down the red carpet in a sweat-free lilac outfit - which , admittedly , some catty observers said resembled a combination of a business jacket and a potato sack - merkel waved at the onlookers with her right hand , while her left arm remained comfortably limp with an elegant bag attached to her wrist .
from certain angles , it looked like merkel 's purse was indeed hovering in the air .
in two years , merkel went from being sneered upon as an extra in a deodorant ad to being admired as a middle-aged , top-tier version of sarah jessica parker .
transformation is her forte .
and it is no surprise that most german managers think she would make a good boss . that is the miracle of merkel . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de at string of summits , merkel ready to serve the finest wine there can be no bargain without wine , goes a latin saying .
so it 's no surprise that germany 's chancellor angela merkel has personally handpicked the country 's best wines to serve at the upcoming eu and g8 summits .
-lrb- 07.03.2007 -rrb- bush vows " no backrubs " for merkel when president george w. bush hosted german chancellor angela merkel this week , he promised to behave and keep his hands to himself .
-lrb- 05.01.2007 -rrb- breakfast at angela 's reviewing her first year as chancellor , angela merkel revealed wednesday that leading a country - surprise , surprise - pretty much turns one 's life upside down .
but there 's at least one thing that 's remained unchanged .

it teaches us that an unassuming and soft-spoken woman can break barriers and achieve more than a pompous , cigar-smoking macho of the gerhard schröder variety .
the former chancellor would probably beg to differ , but his portrait is already hanging in the german chancellery , which means he 's been relegated to history .
old angela , new angela angela 's transformation from an awkward and stuttering newcomer in the world of schröders , stoibers and their mostly male buddies is best judged by the media coverage of her arrival to the glitzy opening of the bayreuth opera festival .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the days of heavy prespiration are over two years ago , germany was roaring with laughter because the light apricot jacket-skirt combo , which merkel wore for the opening , was soiled with sweat stains underneath her armpits .
this year , however , german tabloid bild went gaga over merkel 's fashion accessory du jour - a strap-on purse which the newspaper , known for its familiarity with hyperbole , described as a " floating magic bag . "
gracefully walking down the red carpet in a sweat-free lilac outfit - which , admittedly , some catty observers said resembled a combination of a business jacket and a potato sack - merkel waved at the onlookers with her right hand , while her left arm remained comfortably limp with an elegant bag attached to her wrist .
from certain angles , it looked like merkel 's purse was indeed hovering in the air .
in two years , merkel went from being sneered upon as an extra in a deodorant ad to being admired as a middle-aged , top-tier version of sarah jessica parker .
transformation is her forte .
and it is no surprise that most german managers think she would make a good boss . that is the miracle of merkel . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de at string of summits , merkel ready to serve the finest wine there can be no bargain without wine , goes a latin saying .
so it 's no surprise that germany 's chancellor angela merkel has personally handpicked the country 's best wines to serve at the upcoming eu and g8 summits .
-lrb- 07.03.2007 -rrb- bush vows " no backrubs " for merkel when president george w. bush hosted german chancellor angela merkel this week , he promised to behave and keep his hands to himself .
-lrb- 05.01.2007 -rrb- breakfast at angela 's reviewing her first year as chancellor , angela merkel revealed wednesday that leading a country - surprise , surprise - pretty much turns one 's life upside down .
but there 's at least one thing that 's remained unchanged .
-lrb- 22.11.2006 -rrb- feedback do you think that angela merkel will remain popular in the future ?

ischinger will be joining top us and russian diplomats under a scheme announced last week to negotiate the future status of the southern serbian province .

kosovo leaders , however , warned on monday that they would not accept further delays in determining the province 's final status and would not give up their demands for independence .
" we consider that this will be the last delay and we will not accept any other deadlines , " said kosovo 's president fatmir sejdiu in an address to the province 's 120-seat parliament .

saying that the middle east 's powder keg is already explosive enough , foreign policy experts for germany 's governing coalition criticized us plans for military aid worth billions to saudi arabia and other gulf states . an official for the us defense department had said over the weekend that washington planned to give some $ 20 billion -lrb- 14.6 billion euros -rrb- in military assistance to saudi arabia and other states in the gulf region to modernize their armed forces and limit iran 's influence .
israel in return would receive $ 30.4 billion in military aid over the next decade - a significant increase to what the country received before .
while israeli officials have welcomed the plan , which was officially announced by us secretary of state condoleezza rice on monday , german parliamentarians have criticized it as a move that will further destabilize an already fragile region .

" in any case , it 's a high-risk strategy , " added polenz , a member of parliament for the conservative christian democratic union of chancellor angela merkel .
" the aim - to signal iran that a struggle for hegemony based on military might wo n't lead to success - can lead to the wrong reaction in tehran : to try harder and arm faster . "
polenz suggested that the german government should push for a regional security conference and - together with the eu - lobby others not to send arms to crisis regions .

while saying that the idea to establish a middle east equivalent of the csce was nothing new , johannes jung , a member of the parliament 's foreign affairs committee for the social democratic party , said that this was more urgent than ever .

saying that the middle east 's powder keg is already explosive enough , foreign policy experts for germany 's governing coalition criticized us plans for military aid worth billions to saudi arabia and other gulf states . an official for the us defense department had said over the weekend that washington planned to give some $ 20 billion -lrb- 14.6 billion euros -rrb- in military assistance to saudi arabia and other states in the gulf region to modernize their armed forces and limit iran 's influence .
israel in return would receive $ 30.4 billion in military aid over the next decade - a significant increase to what the country received before .
while israeli officials have welcomed the plan , which was officially announced by us secretary of state condoleezza rice on monday , german parliamentarians have criticized it as a move that will further destabilize an already fragile region .
a high risk strategy ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruprecht polenz " if you add more explosive things to a powder keg - and that 's what the middle east is - you heighten the risk and do n't make the region safer in the end , " ruprecht polenz , the chairman of the foreign affairs committee in the german parliament , told frankfurter rundschau newspaper .
" in any case , it 's a high-risk strategy , " added polenz , a member of parliament for the conservative christian democratic union of chancellor angela merkel .
" the aim - to signal iran that a struggle for hegemony based on military might wo n't lead to success - can lead to the wrong reaction in tehran : to try harder and arm faster . "
polenz suggested that the german government should push for a regional security conference and - together with the eu - lobby others not to send arms to crisis regions .

" instead , one should try to get a process started that 's similar to the conference on security and cooperation in europe -lsb- csce -rsb- in the 1970s : to discuss the region 's security problems with everyone involved , to build trust and maybe dampen armament or even encourage disarmament this way , " polenz said .
while saying that the idea to establish a middle east equivalent of the csce was nothing new , johannes jung , a member of the parliament 's foreign affairs committee for the social democratic party , said that this was more urgent than ever .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 30.07.2007 primor : eu troops could bring peace to middle east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu troops could bring the middle east peace process forward , primor said us secretary of state condoleezza rice is in the middle east to restart the peace process , but avi primor , israel 's former ambassador to germany , said the american efforts amount to nothing more than lip service . avi primor was israel 's ambassador to germany from 1993 to 1999 .
dw-world.de : palestinian president mahmoud abbas said last week that he thought a peace agreement could be reached by the end of 2008 .
one of the reasons he gave was because us secretary of state condoleezza rice assured him of it .
is it wishful thinking ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former israeli ambassador avi primor avi primor : i think abbas is an optimist because he really wants this solution .
he stands for compromise , he is for freedom , he is against terrorism .
but he has , unfortunately , little power , not only because hamas is his opponent and because he has already lost the gaza strip , but also because he has to fight hard in the west bank not to lose power to hamas there as well .
but that 's not really the point .
the question is what can condoleezza rice get started ?
us president bush gave a speech on july 16 in which he laid out a new peace plan and called for an international conference , to be attended by condoleezza rice , in the autumn .
so now the one who has to actually implement the peace plan is condoleezza rice . will condoleezza rice be accepted by all sides as an acceptable negotiating partner during these talks ? she will be accepted by everyone , without a doubt .
i have my doubts about whether she will have the power of the president behind her to actually force a particular direction - because this new peace process needs to be forced .
i do not think that the president is serious about this peace plan , but that he is paying lip service to it to ease pressure from condoleezza rice .
so he can say , " okay , go play a little with the israelis and the palestinians and maybe you can invite a few other arab countries to your conference , saudi arabia would be ideal , but i do n't expect much of it . "
i remember that condoleezza rice wanted to support then president of the world bank james wolfensohn , blair 's processor as middle east envoy , but that she did not have the support of her president and she failed , just as mr. wolfensohn did .
nothing has changed since then , and i do not think that bush , at the end of his term , is really aiming to get something started ; even though he has all the means to do so if he wanted . what kinds of powers would condoleezza rice have to receive to make the plan more than lip service ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice will need the president 's complete support to reach a deal bush 's peace plan put forth several components that he had previously mentioned in his first speech dealing with the middle east in 2002 , so it is a bit of a repetition : israel has to leave its settlements , the palestinians have to fight terrorism , a compromise for jerusalem needs to be reached , the problem of refugees needs to be solved , an independent palestinian state needs to be build and recognized and cooperated with .
these are all great things and israeli politicians recognize that .
but they do n't have the political power to implement such a plan , just like the palestinian administration does not have the power to implement the fight against terrorism .
had the president used all his powers , had he been ready to send money and maybe even troops to ensure security , then he would have been able to push both governments into accepting his plan .
he has not done this since 2002 , and he 's obviously not ready to do it today .
in this respect , condoleezza rice 's mission is only lip service . has n't this conflict for some time been a proxy war , with iran and syria looking to gain influence on one side and the usa and the west on the other ? i think that syria can be separated from iran because syria wants to negotiate and make peace with israel , but the americans are preventing it .
the israeli government is n't excited about it because it does not have the power to relinquish the golan heights .
but it would have fundamentally accepted the syrian president 's offer that a way could have been found - if the americans were satisfied .
but they are not .
still , i believe there is a way .
all the peace plans since 2000 - from the first clinton plan to the bush plan and the quartet 's and the one from saudi arabia - have all had the same components .
everyone knows how the problem can and should actually be solved , but no one has the power to do it .
at its most basic , the problem is security .
if there were someone who was ready to put troops in the occupied territories after israel left them - robust troops that could actually provide security - then i think the governments would be strong enough to implement the various peace plans .
the only ones who can manage something like that today and also have the will to do so are the europeans - assuming that the americans do not object to it .
that 's where condoleezza rice as well as tony blair could be helpful . what step has to come next in order to move toward a realistic peace treaty ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new eu middle east envoy tony blair could help get eu nations to contribute troops the european union needs to draft a peace plan .
that 's not a problem since all the peace plans are similar anyhow .
but this time it should be an initiative from the european union to send robust troops to the middle east .
that does not have to be exclusively european troops , it could also include arab troops , such as from saudi arabia , egypt , jordan or islamic troops like the turks , and maybe even nato .
they should take over power in the occupied territories so that israel can leave the region .
but all of this can only happen if the american do are not against it . how great are your expectations for condoleezza rice 's visit and for her middle east conference in the fall ? very small , because , as i said , i expect that the american president is n't really behind it , and that it 's all just lip service for him .
and so everyone else , the israeli as well as the palestinian government , is also only going to pay it lip service .
i do n't know if the saudi government is going to take part in the conference as bush would like .
they wo n't do it if they are not sure that the americans are actually seriously behind it , and that is not the case .

germany this week stepped up criticism of the nuclear deal between paris and tripoli , saying neither the eu nor berlin had been informed of the plans .
ruprecht polenz of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- said the nuclear deal was " a bitter pill to swallow for the eu . "
in an interview with german paper , tagesspiegel am sonntag , polenz said it sent a wrong signal to the middle east .
he criticized france 's unilateral move , saying it weakened europe 's capability to act on the foreign policy front .
the german government 's deputy press spokesman , thomas steg , however rejected reports suggesting the deal would put a strain on franco-german relations .
" the franco-german relationship is excellent , " steg said , pointing out that unlike iran , libya had stressed its willingness for international cooperation and underlined it would not use nuclear technology to produce weapons . article based on news reports -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

saying that the middle east 's powder keg is already explosive enough , foreign policy experts for germany 's governing coalition criticized us plans for military aid worth billions to saudi arabia and other gulf states . an official for the us defense department had said over the weekend that washington planned to give some $ 20 billion -lrb- 14.6 billion euros -rrb- in military assistance to saudi arabia and other states in the gulf region to modernize their armed forces and limit iran 's influence .
israel in return would receive $ 30.4 billion in military aid over the next decade - a significant increase to what the country received before .
while israeli officials have welcomed the plan , which was officially announced by us secretary of state condoleezza rice on monday , german parliamentarians have criticized it as a move that will further destabilize an already fragile region .
a high risk strategy ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruprecht polenz " if you add more explosive things to a powder keg - and that 's what the middle east is - you heighten the risk and do n't make the region safer in the end , " ruprecht polenz , the chairman of the foreign affairs committee in the german parliament , told frankfurter rundschau newspaper .
" in any case , it 's a high-risk strategy , " added polenz , a member of parliament for the conservative christian democratic union of chancellor angela merkel .
" the aim - to signal iran that a struggle for hegemony based on military might wo n't lead to success - can lead to the wrong reaction in tehran : to try harder and arm faster . "
polenz suggested that the german government should push for a regional security conference and - together with the eu - lobby others not to send arms to crisis regions .
a csce for the mideast ?
" instead , one should try to get a process started that 's similar to the conference on security and cooperation in europe -lsb- csce -rsb- in the 1970s : to discuss the region 's security problems with everyone involved , to build trust and maybe dampen armament or even encourage disarmament this way , " polenz said .
while saying that the idea to establish a middle east equivalent of the csce was nothing new , johannes jung , a member of the parliament 's foreign affairs committee for the social democratic party , said that this was more urgent than ever .
" the region needs disarmament and not armament , " he said , according to the web site of german newsmagazine der spiegel . article based on news reports -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

afghan president hamid karzai had accused the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- of killing about 90 civilians in june , most of them in air operations .
karzai said that the casualties could damage support for the presence of foreign troops in the country .

scheffer said that nato officials were " working with weapons load on aircraft to reduce collateral damage . "
a nato diplomat told the financial times newspaper that using 250 kg -lrb- about 500 pounds -rrb- bombs rather than 500 kg bombs would " make a huge amount of difference " in terms of casualties .
nato officials also said that the afghan army should increasingly take on house-to-house searches to avoid confrontations .
no need to rush scheffer also said that nato troops would hold off on attacks against the taliban if the number of civilian casualties would run too high as the result of an attack .
" we realize that , if we can not neutralize our enemy today without harming civilians , our enemy will give us the opportunity tomorrow , " scheffer told the paper .
" if that means going after the taliban not on wednesday but on thusday , we will get him then . "
scheffer added , however , that it was impossible to avoid civilian casualties altogether .

" we have duties to discharge and responsibilities to keep in support of the democratically elected government and in support of the explicit will of the international community , " brown said in his first press conference with bush since becoming prime minister in june . finding common ground bush and brown met at the camp david presidential retreat outside washington for two days of talks that began sunday amid a great deal of speculation as to whether the leaders would enjoy the close relationship bush has with brown 's predecessor tony blair . bush too sought to cast aside any questions about his ability to work with brown while emphasizing the close ties between the united states and britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two leaders , seen here in a golf cart , demonstrated they get along " so everybody 's wondering whether or not the prime minister and i were able to find common ground , to get along , to have a meaningful discussion , " bush said .
" and the answer is absolutely . " brown gave no promises on how long britain would maintain its forces in iraq , saying only that a decision to hand over control for security in basra province to iraqi forces would be based on military advice . " we intend to move to overwatch in the fourth province , and that decision will be made on the military advice of our commanders on the ground , " brown said . bush stressed that the two allies would work together towards securing peace in iraq . " there is no doubt in my mind that gordon brown understands that failure in iraq would be a disaster for the security of our own countries , " bush said . he said his relationship with brown would be " a constructive strategic relationship for the good of our peoples . " cracking down on iran bush and brown also discussed the humanitarian crisis in sudan 's darfur region and the us-eu effort to forge a trade plan to help boost the world 's underdeveloped economies . on iran , the two leaders agreed on the need to pursue tougher sanctions over the country 's covert nuclear program . " we 're in agreement that sanctions are working and the next stage we are ready to move towards is to toughen the sanctions with a further un resolution , " brown said . brown arrived sunday at camp david , his first visit to the united states since succeeding blair june 27 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown did not specify how long britain would maintain its forces in iraq bush enjoyed a close personal relationship and political partnership with blair , who stood by bush over the war in iraq despite the british public 's strong disapproval of blair 's decision to order british participation in the 2003 invasion . the continuing struggle in iraq helped to undermine blair and sped his departure from downing street .
observers believe brown will stake out a more businesslike relationship with bush that will emphasize common goals between the two countries . bush has also faced deep opposition to the conflict in iraq at home and increasing calls to set a timeframe for withdrawing us troops . on tuesday , brown will hold talks with un secretary-general ban ki-moon in new york and give a speech at the world body . article based on news reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

afghan president hamid karzai had accused the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- of killing about 90 civilians in june , most of them in air operations .
karzai said that the casualties could damage support for the presence of foreign troops in the country .

scheffer said that nato officials were " working with weapons load on aircraft to reduce collateral damage . "
a nato diplomat told the financial times newspaper that using 250 kg -lrb- about 500 pounds -rrb- bombs rather than 500 kg bombs would " make a huge amount of difference " in terms of casualties .
nato officials also said that the afghan army should increasingly take on house-to-house searches to avoid confrontations .
no need to rush scheffer also said that nato troops would hold off on attacks against the taliban if the number of civilian casualties would run too high as the result of an attack .
" we realize that , if we can not neutralize our enemy today without harming civilians , our enemy will give us the opportunity tomorrow , " scheffer told the paper .
" if that means going after the taliban not on wednesday but on thusday , we will get him then . "
scheffer added , however , that it was impossible to avoid civilian casualties altogether .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang ischinger has a great deal of experience with the balkan region the 61-year old , who is the german ambassador to britain , is an expert on balkan affairs .
he was - together with us diplomat richard holbrooke - instrumental in brokering the 1995 dayton peace agreement which brought an end to the war in bosnia .
ischinger will be joining top us and russian diplomats under a scheme announced last week to negotiate the future status of the southern serbian province .
a new attempt the scheme was announced by the six members of the kosovo contact group , which said talks on the future status should take place in the form of an eu-us-russian troika .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for serbia , kosovo and its medieval monasteries have a great deal of symbolic value the six members - balkan experts from the us , russia , germany , france , britain and italy - announced it as an attempt to overcome the us-russian deadlock a week after russia blocked a resolution on a un plan to grant kosovo internationally-monitored independence .
kosovo leaders , however , warned on monday that they would not accept further delays in determining the province 's final status and would not give up their demands for independence .
" we consider that this will be the last delay and we will not accept any other deadlines , " said kosovo 's president fatmir sejdiu in an address to the province 's 120-seat parliament .
" further deadlines carry with them dangers not only in compromising the process but also raising concerns and tensions with unforeseeable consequences , " sejdiu said .
" we stress that kosovo 's independence is not negotiable . "
the role of russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo is currently run by the united nations in what was considered a surprise move , russia agreed to the troika format suggested by german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier at the eu foreign ministers ' meeting last monday , even though it previously insisted on keeping the process in the security council , where it holds veto power .
agreement has yet to be reached on the timing of a new round of talks .
the eu had suggested limiting negotiations to 120 days , while russia prefers open-ended talks .
diplomat frank wisner has been appointed to represent the us in the talks .
russia is yet to announce its representative .
opposing views the talks on the future of kosovo are bound to remain extremely difficult and are unlikely to bring any substantial improvements in the relations between belgrade and pristina .
kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority , frustrated by setbacks and delays , will accept nothing short of full independence .
belgrade , on the other hand , is only ready to grant far-reaching autonomy , fearing kosovo 's serb minority will be endangered in case of independence .
a unilateral declaration of independence by the province 's leadership could lead to a further destabilization of the region , diplomats fear . article based on news reports -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 30.07.2007 the miracle of merkel - is there anything angela ca n't do ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel remains extremely popular , both in germany and abroad she moves in high circles , hangs out at the opera and gets backrubs from the leader of the free world .
now , most german businessmen say they 'd like to have her as their boss .
can angela merkel do anything wrong ? being famous is surely a tough job .
just ask brad and angelina .
or that good old overachiever madonna , who consistently refuses to stay with her own age .
they all work so hard at preserving their image and compromise so much of their privacy just to remain on the covers of glossy magazines .
angela , on the other hand , makes fame appear easy .
wherever she goes , she is praised for her winning combination of diplomatic skills and unflinching perseverance .
during a recent eu summit , the german chancellor practically saved europe from the brink of a disaster .
for her , however , it 's all just part of the job .
no more and no less .
let 's not get touchy-feely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a moment to remember -lrb- and a hit on youtube -rrb- : angela getting a backrub from george w. bush germany 's top job has , of course , its perks .
in 2006 , for instance , merkel received a widely-publicized backrub from the embarrassingly easy-going us president george w. bush .
not many politicians can say that they were groped by the leader of the free world .
she attends festival openings and mingles with the glitterati , but remains oddly down-to-earth .
when asked about whether fame had changed her and whether her husband was noticing anything different about her , she answered in her usual , direct , matter-of-fact tone that the breakfast she was preparing for them was still the same .
even though she might have done so , it 's silly to picture margaret thatcher frying bacon and eggs , or even just heating up a serving of refried beans for that scary abomination that the british call their breakfast .
but it is not hard to imagine angela hovering over a stove .
it 's a surprisingly credible and comforting image .
it gives representative democracy a glimmer of hope that some politicians , once they climb to the top , can actually remain human beings .
that is , perhaps , one of the reasons why she remains extremely popular in germany .
she rules , literally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business leaders think that merkel would be a good boss business leaders seem to agree .
in a recent poll about politicians as potential business leaders , the german chancellor got very positive reviews .
when asked about which german politician they would accept as their boss , 81 percent of german managers said angela merkel .
at the same time , 70 percent of those polled said they thought the trained physicist was capable of running a large enterprise .
in comparison , germany 's economy minister , michael gloss , got only 42 of positive votes in this category , while labor minister franz müntefering rated even worse - with only 37 percent of votes .
so what does the career of angela merkel teach us about life in general - other than that still water runs deep and that breakfast is the most important meal of the day ?
it teaches us that an unassuming and soft-spoken woman can break barriers and achieve more than a pompous , cigar-smoking macho of the gerhard schröder variety .
the former chancellor would probably beg to differ , but his portrait is already hanging in the german chancellery , which means he 's been relegated to history .
old angela , new angela angela 's transformation from an awkward and stuttering newcomer in the world of schröders , stoibers and their mostly male buddies is best judged by the media coverage of her arrival to the glitzy opening of the bayreuth opera festival .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the days of heavy prespiration are over two years ago , germany was roaring with laughter because the light apricot jacket-skirt combo , which merkel wore for the opening , was soiled with sweat stains underneath her armpits .
this year , however , german tabloid bild went gaga over merkel 's fashion accessory du jour - a strap-on purse which the newspaper , known for its familiarity with hyperbole , described as a " floating magic bag . "
gracefully walking down the red carpet in a sweat-free lilac outfit - which , admittedly , some catty observers said resembled a combination of a business jacket and a potato sack - merkel waved at the onlookers with her right hand , while her left arm remained comfortably limp with an elegant bag attached to her wrist .
from certain angles , it looked like merkel 's purse was indeed hovering in the air .
in two years , merkel went from being sneered upon as an extra in a deodorant ad to being admired as a middle-aged , top-tier version of sarah jessica parker .
transformation is her forte .
and it is no surprise that most german managers think she would make a good boss . that is the miracle of merkel . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de at string of summits , merkel ready to serve the finest wine there can be no bargain without wine , goes a latin saying .
so it 's no surprise that germany 's chancellor angela merkel has personally handpicked the country 's best wines to serve at the upcoming eu and g8 summits .
-lrb- 07.03.2007 -rrb- bush vows " no backrubs " for merkel when president george w. bush hosted german chancellor angela merkel this week , he promised to behave and keep his hands to himself .
-lrb- 05.01.2007 -rrb- breakfast at angela 's reviewing her first year as chancellor , angela merkel revealed wednesday that leading a country - surprise , surprise - pretty much turns one 's life upside down .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 30.07.2007 the miracle of merkel - is there anything angela ca n't do ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel remains extremely popular , both in germany and abroad she moves in high circles , hangs out at the opera and gets backrubs from the leader of the free world .
now , most german businessmen say they 'd like to have her as their boss .
can angela merkel do anything wrong ? being famous is surely a tough job .
just ask brad and angelina .
or that good old overachiever madonna , who consistently refuses to stay with her own age .
they all work so hard at preserving their image and compromise so much of their privacy just to remain on the covers of glossy magazines .
angela , on the other hand , makes fame appear easy .
wherever she goes , she is praised for her winning combination of diplomatic skills and unflinching perseverance .
during a recent eu summit , the german chancellor practically saved europe from the brink of a disaster .
for her , however , it 's all just part of the job .
no more and no less .
let 's not get touchy-feely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a moment to remember -lrb- and a hit on youtube -rrb- : angela getting a backrub from george w. bush germany 's top job has , of course , its perks .
in 2006 , for instance , merkel received a widely-publicized backrub from the embarrassingly easy-going us president george w. bush .
not many politicians can say that they were groped by the leader of the free world .
she attends festival openings and mingles with the glitterati , but remains oddly down-to-earth .
when asked about whether fame had changed her and whether her husband was noticing anything different about her , she answered in her usual , direct , matter-of-fact tone that the breakfast she was preparing for them was still the same .
even though she might have done so , it 's silly to picture margaret thatcher frying bacon and eggs , or even just heating up a serving of refried beans for that scary abomination that the british call their breakfast .
but it is not hard to imagine angela hovering over a stove .
it 's a surprisingly credible and comforting image .
it gives representative democracy a glimmer of hope that some politicians , once they climb to the top , can actually remain human beings .
that is , perhaps , one of the reasons why she remains extremely popular in germany .
she rules , literally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business leaders think that merkel would be a good boss business leaders seem to agree .
in a recent poll about politicians as potential business leaders , the german chancellor got very positive reviews .
when asked about which german politician they would accept as their boss , 81 percent of german managers said angela merkel .
at the same time , 70 percent of those polled said they thought the trained physicist was capable of running a large enterprise .
in comparison , germany 's economy minister , michael gloss , got only 42 of positive votes in this category , while labor minister franz müntefering rated even worse - with only 37 percent of votes .
so what does the career of angela merkel teach us about life in general - other than that still water runs deep and that breakfast is the most important meal of the day ?
it teaches us that an unassuming and soft-spoken woman can break barriers and achieve more than a pompous , cigar-smoking macho of the gerhard schröder variety .
the former chancellor would probably beg to differ , but his portrait is already hanging in the german chancellery , which means he 's been relegated to history .
old angela , new angela angela 's transformation from an awkward and stuttering newcomer in the world of schröders , stoibers and their mostly male buddies is best judged by the media coverage of her arrival to the glitzy opening of the bayreuth opera festival .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the days of heavy prespiration are over two years ago , germany was roaring with laughter because the light apricot jacket-skirt combo , which merkel wore for the opening , was soiled with sweat stains underneath her armpits .
this year , however , german tabloid bild went gaga over merkel 's fashion accessory du jour - a strap-on purse which the newspaper , known for its familiarity with hyperbole , described as a " floating magic bag . "
gracefully walking down the red carpet in a sweat-free lilac outfit - which , admittedly , some catty observers said resembled a combination of a business jacket and a potato sack - merkel waved at the onlookers with her right hand , while her left arm remained comfortably limp with an elegant bag attached to her wrist .
from certain angles , it looked like merkel 's purse was indeed hovering in the air .
in two years , merkel went from being sneered upon as an extra in a deodorant ad to being admired as a middle-aged , top-tier version of sarah jessica parker .
transformation is her forte .
and it is no surprise that most german managers think she would make a good boss . that is the miracle of merkel . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de at string of summits , merkel ready to serve the finest wine there can be no bargain without wine , goes a latin saying .
so it 's no surprise that germany 's chancellor angela merkel has personally handpicked the country 's best wines to serve at the upcoming eu and g8 summits .
-lrb- 07.03.2007 -rrb- bush vows " no backrubs " for merkel when president george w. bush hosted german chancellor angela merkel this week , he promised to behave and keep his hands to himself .
-lrb- 05.01.2007 -rrb- breakfast at angela 's reviewing her first year as chancellor , angela merkel revealed wednesday that leading a country - surprise , surprise - pretty much turns one 's life upside down .
but there 's at least one thing that 's remained unchanged .
-lrb- 22.11.2006 -rrb- feedback do you think that angela merkel will remain popular in the future ?

he was - together with us diplomat richard holbrooke - instrumental in brokering the 1995 dayton peace agreement which brought an end to the war in bosnia .
ischinger will be joining top us and russian diplomats under a scheme announced last week to negotiate the future status of the southern serbian province .
a new attempt the scheme was announced by the six members of the kosovo contact group , which said talks on the future status should take place in the form of an eu-us-russian troika .

kosovo leaders , however , warned on monday that they would not accept further delays in determining the province 's final status and would not give up their demands for independence .
" we consider that this will be the last delay and we will not accept any other deadlines , " said kosovo 's president fatmir sejdiu in an address to the province 's 120-seat parliament .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang ischinger has a great deal of experience with the balkan region the 61-year old , who is the german ambassador to britain , is an expert on balkan affairs .
he was - together with us diplomat richard holbrooke - instrumental in brokering the 1995 dayton peace agreement which brought an end to the war in bosnia .
ischinger will be joining top us and russian diplomats under a scheme announced last week to negotiate the future status of the southern serbian province .
a new attempt the scheme was announced by the six members of the kosovo contact group , which said talks on the future status should take place in the form of an eu-us-russian troika .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for serbia , kosovo and its medieval monasteries have a great deal of symbolic value the six members - balkan experts from the us , russia , germany , france , britain and italy - announced it as an attempt to overcome the us-russian deadlock a week after russia blocked a resolution on a un plan to grant kosovo internationally-monitored independence .
kosovo leaders , however , warned on monday that they would not accept further delays in determining the province 's final status and would not give up their demands for independence .
" we consider that this will be the last delay and we will not accept any other deadlines , " said kosovo 's president fatmir sejdiu in an address to the province 's 120-seat parliament .
" further deadlines carry with them dangers not only in compromising the process but also raising concerns and tensions with unforeseeable consequences , " sejdiu said .
" we stress that kosovo 's independence is not negotiable . "
the role of russia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo is currently run by the united nations in what was considered a surprise move , russia agreed to the troika format suggested by german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier at the eu foreign ministers ' meeting last monday , even though it previously insisted on keeping the process in the security council , where it holds veto power .
agreement has yet to be reached on the timing of a new round of talks .
the eu had suggested limiting negotiations to 120 days , while russia prefers open-ended talks .
diplomat frank wisner has been appointed to represent the us in the talks .
russia is yet to announce its representative .
opposing views the talks on the future of kosovo are bound to remain extremely difficult and are unlikely to bring any substantial improvements in the relations between belgrade and pristina .
kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority , frustrated by setbacks and delays , will accept nothing short of full independence .
belgrade , on the other hand , is only ready to grant far-reaching autonomy , fearing kosovo 's serb minority will be endangered in case of independence .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gadhafi -lrb- left -rrb- with sarkozy in tripoli last week the deal has been criticized by german and eu officials , who see the plan as a threat to nuclear non-proliferation efforts .
siemens owns a third of the company that is expected to supply the nuclear technology , areva np , leading german politicians to call on the company to rethink its involvement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael müller " we must know what siemens will say about this immoral deal , " michael müller , a social democrat and the parliamentary state secretary at germany 's environment ministry , told handelsblatt newspaper .
he added that similar deals are often organized via foreign subsidiaries .
" there are a lot of strange cases like this in the atomic energy sector , " müller said .
playing with fire ?
he received backing from margareta wolf , the foreign affairs spokeswoman of the opposition greens party .
" siemens would be wise in terms of its image and its responsibilities not to play with fire with this , " she told the paper .
siemens declined to comment on the story , telling handelsblatt reporters to contact areva np instead .
germany this week stepped up criticism of the nuclear deal between paris and tripoli , saying neither the eu nor berlin had been informed of the plans .
ruprecht polenz of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- said the nuclear deal was " a bitter pill to swallow for the eu . "
in an interview with german paper , tagesspiegel am sonntag , polenz said it sent a wrong signal to the middle east .
he criticized france 's unilateral move , saying it weakened europe 's capability to act on the foreign policy front .
the german government 's deputy press spokesman , thomas steg , however rejected reports suggesting the deal would put a strain on franco-german relations .
" the franco-german relationship is excellent , " steg said , pointing out that unlike iran , libya had stressed its willingness for international cooperation and underlined it would not use nuclear technology to produce weapons . article based on news reports -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in 2006 , for instance , merkel received a widely-publicized backrub from the embarrassingly easy-going us president george w. bush .
not many politicians can say that they were groped by the leader of the free world .
she attends festival openings and mingles with the glitterati , but remains oddly down-to-earth .
when asked about whether fame had changed her and whether her husband was noticing anything different about her , she answered in her usual , direct , matter-of-fact tone that the breakfast she was preparing for them was still the same .

in a recent poll about politicians as potential business leaders , the german chancellor got very positive reviews .
when asked about which german politician they would accept as their boss , 81 percent of german managers said angela merkel .
at the same time , 70 percent of those polled said they thought the trained physicist was capable of running a large enterprise .
in comparison , germany 's economy minister , michael gloss , got only 42 of positive votes in this category , while labor minister franz müntefering rated even worse - with only 37 percent of votes .
so what does the career of angela merkel teach us about life in general - other than that still water runs deep and that breakfast is the most important meal of the day ?
it teaches us that an unassuming and soft-spoken woman can break barriers and achieve more than a pompous , cigar-smoking macho of the gerhard schröder variety .
the former chancellor would probably beg to differ , but his portrait is already hanging in the german chancellery , which means he 's been relegated to history .
old angela , new angela angela 's transformation from an awkward and stuttering newcomer in the world of schröders , stoibers and their mostly male buddies is best judged by the media coverage of her arrival to the glitzy opening of the bayreuth opera festival .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the days of heavy prespiration are over two years ago , germany was roaring with laughter because the light apricot jacket-skirt combo , which merkel wore for the opening , was soiled with sweat stains underneath her armpits .

gracefully walking down the red carpet in a sweat-free lilac outfit - which , admittedly , some catty observers said resembled a combination of a business jacket and a potato sack - merkel waved at the onlookers with her right hand , while her left arm remained comfortably limp with an elegant bag attached to her wrist .
from certain angles , it looked like merkel 's purse was indeed hovering in the air .
in two years , merkel went from being sneered upon as an extra in a deodorant ad to being admired as a middle-aged , top-tier version of sarah jessica parker .

when asked about whether fame had changed her and whether her husband was noticing anything different about her , she answered in her usual , direct , matter-of-fact tone that the breakfast she was preparing for them was still the same .
even though she might have done so , it 's silly to picture margaret thatcher frying bacon and eggs , or even just heating up a serving of refried beans for that scary abomination that the british call their breakfast .
but it is not hard to imagine angela hovering over a stove .

that is , perhaps , one of the reasons why she remains extremely popular in germany .
she rules , literally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business leaders think that merkel would be a good boss business leaders seem to agree .
in a recent poll about politicians as potential business leaders , the german chancellor got very positive reviews .
when asked about which german politician they would accept as their boss , 81 percent of german managers said angela merkel .
at the same time , 70 percent of those polled said they thought the trained physicist was capable of running a large enterprise .
in comparison , germany 's economy minister , michael gloss , got only 42 of positive votes in this category , while labor minister franz müntefering rated even worse - with only 37 percent of votes .
so what does the career of angela merkel teach us about life in general - other than that still water runs deep and that breakfast is the most important meal of the day ?
it teaches us that an unassuming and soft-spoken woman can break barriers and achieve more than a pompous , cigar-smoking macho of the gerhard schröder variety .
the former chancellor would probably beg to differ , but his portrait is already hanging in the german chancellery , which means he 's been relegated to history .
old angela , new angela angela 's transformation from an awkward and stuttering newcomer in the world of schröders , stoibers and their mostly male buddies is best judged by the media coverage of her arrival to the glitzy opening of the bayreuth opera festival .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the days of heavy prespiration are over two years ago , germany was roaring with laughter because the light apricot jacket-skirt combo , which merkel wore for the opening , was soiled with sweat stains underneath her armpits .

gracefully walking down the red carpet in a sweat-free lilac outfit - which , admittedly , some catty observers said resembled a combination of a business jacket and a potato sack - merkel waved at the onlookers with her right hand , while her left arm remained comfortably limp with an elegant bag attached to her wrist .
from certain angles , it looked like merkel 's purse was indeed hovering in the air .
in two years , merkel went from being sneered upon as an extra in a deodorant ad to being admired as a middle-aged , top-tier version of sarah jessica parker .

" we have duties to discharge and responsibilities to keep in support of the democratically elected government and in support of the explicit will of the international community , " brown said in his first press conference with bush since becoming prime minister in june . finding common ground bush and brown met at the camp david presidential retreat outside washington for two days of talks that began sunday amid a great deal of speculation as to whether the leaders would enjoy the close relationship bush has with brown 's predecessor tony blair . bush too sought to cast aside any questions about his ability to work with brown while emphasizing the close ties between the united states and britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two leaders , seen here in a golf cart , demonstrated they get along " so everybody 's wondering whether or not the prime minister and i were able to find common ground , to get along , to have a meaningful discussion , " bush said .
" and the answer is absolutely . " brown gave no promises on how long britain would maintain its forces in iraq , saying only that a decision to hand over control for security in basra province to iraqi forces would be based on military advice . " we intend to move to overwatch in the fourth province , and that decision will be made on the military advice of our commanders on the ground , " brown said . bush stressed that the two allies would work together towards securing peace in iraq . " there is no doubt in my mind that gordon brown understands that failure in iraq would be a disaster for the security of our own countries , " bush said . he said his relationship with brown would be " a constructive strategic relationship for the good of our peoples . " cracking down on iran bush and brown also discussed the humanitarian crisis in sudan 's darfur region and the us-eu effort to forge a trade plan to help boost the world 's underdeveloped economies . on iran , the two leaders agreed on the need to pursue tougher sanctions over the country 's covert nuclear program . " we 're in agreement that sanctions are working and the next stage we are ready to move towards is to toughen the sanctions with a further un resolution , " brown said . brown arrived sunday at camp david , his first visit to the united states since succeeding blair june 27 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown did not specify how long britain would maintain its forces in iraq bush enjoyed a close personal relationship and political partnership with blair , who stood by bush over the war in iraq despite the british public 's strong disapproval of blair 's decision to order british participation in the 2003 invasion . the continuing struggle in iraq helped to undermine blair and sped his departure from downing street .
observers believe brown will stake out a more businesslike relationship with bush that will emphasize common goals between the two countries . bush has also faced deep opposition to the conflict in iraq at home and increasing calls to set a timeframe for withdrawing us troops . on tuesday , brown will hold talks with un secretary-general ban ki-moon in new york and give a speech at the world body . article based on news reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de : palestinian president mahmoud abbas said last week that he thought a peace agreement could be reached by the end of 2008 .
one of the reasons he gave was because us secretary of state condoleezza rice assured him of it .
is it wishful thinking ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former israeli ambassador avi primor avi primor : i think abbas is an optimist because he really wants this solution .
he stands for compromise , he is for freedom , he is against terrorism .
but he has , unfortunately , little power , not only because hamas is his opponent and because he has already lost the gaza strip , but also because he has to fight hard in the west bank not to lose power to hamas there as well .
but that 's not really the point .
the question is what can condoleezza rice get started ?
us president bush gave a speech on july 16 in which he laid out a new peace plan and called for an international conference , to be attended by condoleezza rice , in the autumn .
so now the one who has to actually implement the peace plan is condoleezza rice . will condoleezza rice be accepted by all sides as an acceptable negotiating partner during these talks ? she will be accepted by everyone , without a doubt .
i have my doubts about whether she will have the power of the president behind her to actually force a particular direction - because this new peace process needs to be forced .
i do not think that the president is serious about this peace plan , but that he is paying lip service to it to ease pressure from condoleezza rice .
so he can say , " okay , go play a little with the israelis and the palestinians and maybe you can invite a few other arab countries to your conference , saudi arabia would be ideal , but i do n't expect much of it . "
i remember that condoleezza rice wanted to support then president of the world bank james wolfensohn , blair 's processor as middle east envoy , but that she did not have the support of her president and she failed , just as mr. wolfensohn did .
nothing has changed since then , and i do not think that bush , at the end of his term , is really aiming to get something started ; even though he has all the means to do so if he wanted . what kinds of powers would condoleezza rice have to receive to make the plan more than lip service ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice will need the president 's complete support to reach a deal bush 's peace plan put forth several components that he had previously mentioned in his first speech dealing with the middle east in 2002 , so it is a bit of a repetition : israel has to leave its settlements , the palestinians have to fight terrorism , a compromise for jerusalem needs to be reached , the problem of refugees needs to be solved , an independent palestinian state needs to be build and recognized and cooperated with .
these are all great things and israeli politicians recognize that .
but they do n't have the political power to implement such a plan , just like the palestinian administration does not have the power to implement the fight against terrorism .
had the president used all his powers , had he been ready to send money and maybe even troops to ensure security , then he would have been able to push both governments into accepting his plan .
he has not done this since 2002 , and he 's obviously not ready to do it today .
in this respect , condoleezza rice 's mission is only lip service . has n't this conflict for some time been a proxy war , with iran and syria looking to gain influence on one side and the usa and the west on the other ? i think that syria can be separated from iran because syria wants to negotiate and make peace with israel , but the americans are preventing it .
the israeli government is n't excited about it because it does not have the power to relinquish the golan heights .
but it would have fundamentally accepted the syrian president 's offer that a way could have been found - if the americans were satisfied .
but they are not .
still , i believe there is a way .
all the peace plans since 2000 - from the first clinton plan to the bush plan and the quartet 's and the one from saudi arabia - have all had the same components .
everyone knows how the problem can and should actually be solved , but no one has the power to do it .
at its most basic , the problem is security .
if there were someone who was ready to put troops in the occupied territories after israel left them - robust troops that could actually provide security - then i think the governments would be strong enough to implement the various peace plans .
the only ones who can manage something like that today and also have the will to do so are the europeans - assuming that the americans do not object to it .
that 's where condoleezza rice as well as tony blair could be helpful . what step has to come next in order to move toward a realistic peace treaty ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new eu middle east envoy tony blair could help get eu nations to contribute troops the european union needs to draft a peace plan .
that 's not a problem since all the peace plans are similar anyhow .
but this time it should be an initiative from the european union to send robust troops to the middle east .
that does not have to be exclusively european troops , it could also include arab troops , such as from saudi arabia , egypt , jordan or islamic troops like the turks , and maybe even nato .
they should take over power in the occupied territories so that israel can leave the region .
but all of this can only happen if the american do are not against it . how great are your expectations for condoleezza rice 's visit and for her middle east conference in the fall ? very small , because , as i said , i expect that the american president is n't really behind it , and that it 's all just lip service for him .
and so everyone else , the israeli as well as the palestinian government , is also only going to pay it lip service .
i do n't know if the saudi government is going to take part in the conference as bush would like .
they wo n't do it if they are not sure that the americans are actually seriously behind it , and that is not the case .

dw-world.de : palestinian president mahmoud abbas said last week that he thought a peace agreement could be reached by the end of 2008 .
one of the reasons he gave was because us secretary of state condoleezza rice assured him of it .
is it wishful thinking ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former israeli ambassador avi primor avi primor : i think abbas is an optimist because he really wants this solution .
he stands for compromise , he is for freedom , he is against terrorism .
but he has , unfortunately , little power , not only because hamas is his opponent and because he has already lost the gaza strip , but also because he has to fight hard in the west bank not to lose power to hamas there as well .
but that 's not really the point .
the question is what can condoleezza rice get started ?
us president bush gave a speech on july 16 in which he laid out a new peace plan and called for an international conference , to be attended by condoleezza rice , in the autumn .
so now the one who has to actually implement the peace plan is condoleezza rice . will condoleezza rice be accepted by all sides as an acceptable negotiating partner during these talks ? she will be accepted by everyone , without a doubt .
i have my doubts about whether she will have the power of the president behind her to actually force a particular direction - because this new peace process needs to be forced .
i do not think that the president is serious about this peace plan , but that he is paying lip service to it to ease pressure from condoleezza rice .

that does not have to be exclusively european troops , it could also include arab troops , such as from saudi arabia , egypt , jordan or islamic troops like the turks , and maybe even nato .

dw-world.de : palestinian president mahmoud abbas said last week that he thought a peace agreement could be reached by the end of 2008 .
one of the reasons he gave was because us secretary of state condoleezza rice assured him of it .
is it wishful thinking ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former israeli ambassador avi primor avi primor : i think abbas is an optimist because he really wants this solution .
he stands for compromise , he is for freedom , he is against terrorism .
but he has , unfortunately , little power , not only because hamas is his opponent and because he has already lost the gaza strip , but also because he has to fight hard in the west bank not to lose power to hamas there as well .
but that 's not really the point .
the question is what can condoleezza rice get started ?
us president bush gave a speech on july 16 in which he laid out a new peace plan and called for an international conference , to be attended by condoleezza rice , in the autumn .
so now the one who has to actually implement the peace plan is condoleezza rice . will condoleezza rice be accepted by all sides as an acceptable negotiating partner during these talks ? she will be accepted by everyone , without a doubt .
i have my doubts about whether she will have the power of the president behind her to actually force a particular direction - because this new peace process needs to be forced .
i do not think that the president is serious about this peace plan , but that he is paying lip service to it to ease pressure from condoleezza rice .
so he can say , " okay , go play a little with the israelis and the palestinians and maybe you can invite a few other arab countries to your conference , saudi arabia would be ideal , but i do n't expect much of it . "
i remember that condoleezza rice wanted to support then president of the world bank james wolfensohn , blair 's processor as middle east envoy , but that she did not have the support of her president and she failed , just as mr. wolfensohn did .
nothing has changed since then , and i do not think that bush , at the end of his term , is really aiming to get something started ; even though he has all the means to do so if he wanted . what kinds of powers would condoleezza rice have to receive to make the plan more than lip service ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice will need the president 's complete support to reach a deal bush 's peace plan put forth several components that he had previously mentioned in his first speech dealing with the middle east in 2002 , so it is a bit of a repetition : israel has to leave its settlements , the palestinians have to fight terrorism , a compromise for jerusalem needs to be reached , the problem of refugees needs to be solved , an independent palestinian state needs to be build and recognized and cooperated with .
these are all great things and israeli politicians recognize that .
but they do n't have the political power to implement such a plan , just like the palestinian administration does not have the power to implement the fight against terrorism .
had the president used all his powers , had he been ready to send money and maybe even troops to ensure security , then he would have been able to push both governments into accepting his plan .
he has not done this since 2002 , and he 's obviously not ready to do it today .
in this respect , condoleezza rice 's mission is only lip service . has n't this conflict for some time been a proxy war , with iran and syria looking to gain influence on one side and the usa and the west on the other ? i think that syria can be separated from iran because syria wants to negotiate and make peace with israel , but the americans are preventing it .
the israeli government is n't excited about it because it does not have the power to relinquish the golan heights .
but it would have fundamentally accepted the syrian president 's offer that a way could have been found - if the americans were satisfied .
but they are not .
still , i believe there is a way .
all the peace plans since 2000 - from the first clinton plan to the bush plan and the quartet 's and the one from saudi arabia - have all had the same components .
everyone knows how the problem can and should actually be solved , but no one has the power to do it .
at its most basic , the problem is security .
if there were someone who was ready to put troops in the occupied territories after israel left them - robust troops that could actually provide security - then i think the governments would be strong enough to implement the various peace plans .
the only ones who can manage something like that today and also have the will to do so are the europeans - assuming that the americans do not object to it .
that 's where condoleezza rice as well as tony blair could be helpful . what step has to come next in order to move toward a realistic peace treaty ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new eu middle east envoy tony blair could help get eu nations to contribute troops the european union needs to draft a peace plan .

saying that the middle east 's powder keg is already explosive enough , foreign policy experts for germany 's governing coalition criticized us plans for military aid worth billions to saudi arabia and other gulf states . an official for the us defense department had said over the weekend that washington planned to give some $ 20 billion -lrb- 14.6 billion euros -rrb- in military assistance to saudi arabia and other states in the gulf region to modernize their armed forces and limit iran 's influence .
israel in return would receive $ 30.4 billion in military aid over the next decade - a significant increase to what the country received before .

" in any case , it 's a high-risk strategy , " added polenz , a member of parliament for the conservative christian democratic union of chancellor angela merkel .
" the aim - to signal iran that a struggle for hegemony based on military might wo n't lead to success - can lead to the wrong reaction in tehran : to try harder and arm faster . "
polenz suggested that the german government should push for a regional security conference and - together with the eu - lobby others not to send arms to crisis regions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 30.07.2007 the miracle of merkel - is there anything angela ca n't do ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel remains extremely popular , both in germany and abroad she moves in high circles , hangs out at the opera and gets backrubs from the leader of the free world .
now , most german businessmen say they 'd like to have her as their boss .
can angela merkel do anything wrong ? being famous is surely a tough job .
just ask brad and angelina .
or that good old overachiever madonna , who consistently refuses to stay with her own age .
they all work so hard at preserving their image and compromise so much of their privacy just to remain on the covers of glossy magazines .
angela , on the other hand , makes fame appear easy .
wherever she goes , she is praised for her winning combination of diplomatic skills and unflinching perseverance .
during a recent eu summit , the german chancellor practically saved europe from the brink of a disaster .
for her , however , it 's all just part of the job .
no more and no less .
let 's not get touchy-feely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a moment to remember -lrb- and a hit on youtube -rrb- : angela getting a backrub from george w. bush germany 's top job has , of course , its perks .
in 2006 , for instance , merkel received a widely-publicized backrub from the embarrassingly easy-going us president george w. bush .
not many politicians can say that they were groped by the leader of the free world .
she attends festival openings and mingles with the glitterati , but remains oddly down-to-earth .
when asked about whether fame had changed her and whether her husband was noticing anything different about her , she answered in her usual , direct , matter-of-fact tone that the breakfast she was preparing for them was still the same .
even though she might have done so , it 's silly to picture margaret thatcher frying bacon and eggs , or even just heating up a serving of refried beans for that scary abomination that the british call their breakfast .
but it is not hard to imagine angela hovering over a stove .
it 's a surprisingly credible and comforting image .
it gives representative democracy a glimmer of hope that some politicians , once they climb to the top , can actually remain human beings .
that is , perhaps , one of the reasons why she remains extremely popular in germany .
she rules , literally bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business leaders think that merkel would be a good boss business leaders seem to agree .
in a recent poll about politicians as potential business leaders , the german chancellor got very positive reviews .
when asked about which german politician they would accept as their boss , 81 percent of german managers said angela merkel .
at the same time , 70 percent of those polled said they thought the trained physicist was capable of running a large enterprise .
in comparison , germany 's economy minister , michael gloss , got only 42 of positive votes in this category , while labor minister franz müntefering rated even worse - with only 37 percent of votes .
so what does the career of angela merkel teach us about life in general - other than that still water runs deep and that breakfast is the most important meal of the day ?
it teaches us that an unassuming and soft-spoken woman can break barriers and achieve more than a pompous , cigar-smoking macho of the gerhard schröder variety .
the former chancellor would probably beg to differ , but his portrait is already hanging in the german chancellery , which means he 's been relegated to history .
old angela , new angela angela 's transformation from an awkward and stuttering newcomer in the world of schröders , stoibers and their mostly male buddies is best judged by the media coverage of her arrival to the glitzy opening of the bayreuth opera festival .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the days of heavy prespiration are over two years ago , germany was roaring with laughter because the light apricot jacket-skirt combo , which merkel wore for the opening , was soiled with sweat stains underneath her armpits .
this year , however , german tabloid bild went gaga over merkel 's fashion accessory du jour - a strap-on purse which the newspaper , known for its familiarity with hyperbole , described as a " floating magic bag . "
gracefully walking down the red carpet in a sweat-free lilac outfit - which , admittedly , some catty observers said resembled a combination of a business jacket and a potato sack - merkel waved at the onlookers with her right hand , while her left arm remained comfortably limp with an elegant bag attached to her wrist .
from certain angles , it looked like merkel 's purse was indeed hovering in the air .
in two years , merkel went from being sneered upon as an extra in a deodorant ad to being admired as a middle-aged , top-tier version of sarah jessica parker .
transformation is her forte .
and it is no surprise that most german managers think she would make a good boss . that is the miracle of merkel . toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de dw-world : at string of summits , merkel ready to serve the finest wine there can be no bargain without wine , goes a latin saying .
so it 's no surprise that germany 's chancellor angela merkel has personally handpicked the country 's best wines to serve at the upcoming eu and g8 summits .

" we have duties to discharge and responsibilities to keep in support of the democratically elected government and in support of the explicit will of the international community , " brown said in his first press conference with bush since becoming prime minister in june . finding common ground bush and brown met at the camp david presidential retreat outside washington for two days of talks that began sunday amid a great deal of speculation as to whether the leaders would enjoy the close relationship bush has with brown 's predecessor tony blair . bush too sought to cast aside any questions about his ability to work with brown while emphasizing the close ties between the united states and britain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two leaders , seen here in a golf cart , demonstrated they get along " so everybody 's wondering whether or not the prime minister and i were able to find common ground , to get along , to have a meaningful discussion , " bush said .
" and the answer is absolutely . " brown gave no promises on how long britain would maintain its forces in iraq , saying only that a decision to hand over control for security in basra province to iraqi forces would be based on military advice . " we intend to move to overwatch in the fourth province , and that decision will be made on the military advice of our commanders on the ground , " brown said . bush stressed that the two allies would work together towards securing peace in iraq . " there is no doubt in my mind that gordon brown understands that failure in iraq would be a disaster for the security of our own countries , " bush said . he said his relationship with brown would be " a constructive strategic relationship for the good of our peoples . " cracking down on iran bush and brown also discussed the humanitarian crisis in sudan 's darfur region and the us-eu effort to forge a trade plan to help boost the world 's underdeveloped economies . on iran , the two leaders agreed on the need to pursue tougher sanctions over the country 's covert nuclear program . " we 're in agreement that sanctions are working and the next stage we are ready to move towards is to toughen the sanctions with a further un resolution , " brown said . brown arrived sunday at camp david , his first visit to the united states since succeeding blair june 27 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown did not specify how long britain would maintain its forces in iraq bush enjoyed a close personal relationship and political partnership with blair , who stood by bush over the war in iraq despite the british public 's strong disapproval of blair 's decision to order british participation in the 2003 invasion . the continuing struggle in iraq helped to undermine blair and sped his departure from downing street .
observers believe brown will stake out a more businesslike relationship with bush that will emphasize common goals between the two countries . bush has also faced deep opposition to the conflict in iraq at home and increasing calls to set a timeframe for withdrawing us troops . on tuesday , brown will hold talks with un secretary-general ban ki-moon in new york and give a speech at the world body . article based on news reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

abn amro said it would not recommend either the barclays bid or a rival 71bn euros offer from a group led by the royal bank of scotland to investors .

for decades , many adventurous tourists have used this option - travelling on crowded , non-air conditioned carriages often with wooden seats , at a steady pace through the indian countryside .
it brought them face-to-face with millions of ordinary indians who make up the six billion people transported by this vast network every year - middle-class families on vacation , farm or factory workers heading home to their villages , soldiers off to join their colleagues on the frontier .
for years the state-owned system was the ultimate symbol of socialist india - a service subsidised by the state so that the vast lengths of the country could be linked .
while impressive , it was also characterised by poor services , slow trains , filthy stations and archaic signalling systems .
it also never made any money .
now , remarkably , all that has changed .
over the past year indian railways has generated profits of $ 4.5bn - double that of india 's largest private company , reliance industries .
turnaround it is also attracting more passengers and improving its services with better trains and improved comforts . "
there is no inherent conflict between commercial opportunities and social obligation " railway official sudhir kumar so how has indian railways - which is government-owned and operated by a vast bureaucracy - turned things around in a highly competitive market ?
i decided to start at the very beginning - at the magnificent and enormous victoria terminus in mumbai -lrb- bombay -rrb- - a gothic architectural masterpiece with lofty domes , carved stone friezes and stained glass windows .
it is a ready reminder that the railways were started when india was a part of the british empire .
this is where , in 1853 , 400 people boarded the first ever passenger service in india , from mumbai to neighbouring thane - a distance of 34km -lrb- about 20 miles -rrb- .
now , of course , the railways in india span 60,000km and bridge the enormous diversity of this continent-sized country - from the high himalayan mountains in the north to the western desert , the western and eastern coasts , the deep south and the distant north-eastern state of assam .
it is , in effect , india 's lifeline .
the vast terminal is teeming with people , as they wait patiently for the first of many of the long-distance expresses to pull in .
travelling by rail in india has always been relatively inexpensive - a trip from mumbai to the capital , delhi , costs between 425 and 3,000 rupees -lrb- $ 10- $ 73 -rrb- depending on the class of travel .
but the deregulation of the indian aviation market has led to a huge increase in budget airlines offering cheaper fares .
so the railways have decided to hit back .
on platform four , a huge crowd is waiting for the fully-air conditioned garib rath -lsb- poor-man 's chariot -rsb- to pull in .
among those waiting are the ansari family .
comfortable every year , mumbai shop worker zahir ansari takes his family to his village in north india .
but for the first time in their lives , they will be travelling in air-conditioned comfort .
" my wife read about this train in the papers and insisted i try and get us tickets , " he says .
" it will be so much more comfortable for the boys in the summer heat , " he adds , looking at his two little sons .
the garib rath is just one of many initiatives taken by indian railways in its effort to attract more passengers .
at the other end of the scale is the shatabdi express .
this high-speed inter-city train caters to business travellers making the point-to-point journey between indian cities which are located fairly close to each other - and can be covered in about eight hours or less .
on the mumbai-ahmedabad shatabdi , it is all about living in the fast lane .
as our blue and gold train pulls away , i am seated in an airline-style seat with a footrest , personal reading lamp , a laptop and mobile phone point and a personal lcd television screen to watch the latest stock market trends .
a uniformed attendant pushes a cart through the narrow aisle offering passengers beverages followed by soup and dinner .
changes the seven-hour journey costs 1,295 rupees -lrb- $ 32 -rrb- .
there are other changes too .
eating on board has always been a major part of the indian railway experience .
from piping hot tea served in little ceramic cups to spicy curries and omelette on toast - the railways have always catered to a variety of tastes .
but now , at the modern mumbai central station there is a huge sign towering over the concourse - twin golden arches of the world 's most famous fast-food brand , mcdonalds .
there is also a pizzeria , starbucks-style coffee shops and indian fast-food restaurants serving their takeaways in cardboard boxes .
and on board , tea is now made with teabags and served in a little plastic cup .
indian railways own vast spaces across the country - mostly around their stations .
these will now be rented or leased out to big retail giants - walmart , local retail brands and hotels .
considering that the railways have about 7,000 stations across the country , there is plenty of space .
it is estimated that 40,000 hectares of railway land is at the moment under-utilised or completely unused .
but to get a real sense of where their ambitions lie , i head out to mulund - a suburb of mumbai and home to one of the system 's many inland container depots .
this is where huge containers are brought in from mumbai port to be transported along the railway network to various parts of the country .
" every half-hour , a container train is setting off somewhere in the country , " says manish kumar , general manager of the depot .
business sense recognising that freight can be a major source of revenue in an economy that is one of the fastest growing in the world , the railways have now decided to build dedicated lines for freight trains connecting delhi with mumbai and calcutta .
a senior official at the railway ministry , sudhir kumar , says the system has been able to turn things around simply by working on their strengths - by improving the infrastructure so that they can carry more loads , people and cargo .
" we are still a public utility and are fully conscious of our social obligations , " he says .
" but i feel that there is no inherent conflict between commercial opportunities and social obligation . "
so as india continues to transform under its growing economy - some of its oldest and most venerated institutions are beginning to change with clear results .
even if some of the romance has gone out of one of the world 's oldest and largest railway systems .

it is a ready reminder that the railways were started when india was a part of the british empire .
this is where , in 1853 , 400 people boarded the first ever passenger service in india , from mumbai to neighbouring thane - a distance of 34km -lrb- about 20 miles -rrb- .

it is , in effect , india 's lifeline .
the vast terminal is teeming with people , as they wait patiently for the first of many of the long-distance expresses to pull in .
travelling by rail in india has always been relatively inexpensive - a trip from mumbai to the capital , delhi , costs between 425 and 3,000 rupees -lrb- $ 10- $ 73 -rrb- depending on the class of travel .
but the deregulation of the indian aviation market has led to a huge increase in budget airlines offering cheaper fares .
so the railways have decided to hit back .
on platform four , a huge crowd is waiting for the fully-air conditioned garib rath -lsb- poor-man 's chariot -rsb- to pull in .
among those waiting are the ansari family .
comfortable every year , mumbai shop worker zahir ansari takes his family to his village in north india .

" it will be so much more comfortable for the boys in the summer heat , " he adds , looking at his two little sons .
the garib rath is just one of many initiatives taken by indian railways in its effort to attract more passengers .
at the other end of the scale is the shatabdi express .
mr kumar says the railways are ready to face the competition this high-speed inter-city train caters to business travellers making the point-to-point journey between indian cities which are located fairly close to each other - and can be covered in about eight hours or less .

changes the seven-hour journey costs 1,295 rupees -lrb- $ 32 -rrb- .
there are other changes too .
eating on board has always been a major part of the indian railway experience .
from piping hot tea served in little ceramic cups to spicy curries and omelette on toast - the railways have always catered to a variety of tastes .
but now , at the modern mumbai central station there is a huge sign towering over the concourse - twin golden arches of the world 's most famous fast-food brand , mcdonalds .
there is also a pizzeria , starbucks-style coffee shops and indian fast-food restaurants serving their takeaways in cardboard boxes .
and on board , tea is now made with teabags and served in a little plastic cup .
the railway is india 's lifeline indian railways own vast spaces across the country - mostly around their stations .
these will now be rented or leased out to big retail giants - walmart , local retail brands and hotels .
considering that the railways have about 7,000 stations across the country , there is plenty of space .
it is estimated that 40,000 hectares of railway land is at the moment under-utilised or completely unused .
but to get a real sense of where their ambitions lie , i head out to mulund - a suburb of mumbai and home to one of the system 's many inland container depots .
this is where huge containers are brought in from mumbai port to be transported along the railway network to various parts of the country .
" every half-hour , a container train is setting off somewhere in the country , " says manish kumar , general manager of the depot .
business sense recognising that freight can be a major source of revenue in an economy that is one of the fastest growing in the world , the railways have now decided to build dedicated lines for freight trains connecting delhi with mumbai and calcutta .
a senior official at the railway ministry , sudhir kumar , says the system has been able to turn things around simply by working on their strengths - by improving the infrastructure so that they can carry more loads , people and cargo .
" we are still a public utility and are fully conscious of our social obligations , " he says .
" but i feel that there is no inherent conflict between commercial opportunities and social obligation . "
so as india continues to transform under its growing economy - some of its oldest and most venerated institutions are beginning to change with clear results .
even if some of the romance has gone out of one of the world 's oldest and largest railway systems .

sir ian mckellen , dame judi dench , patrick stewart , alan rickman , simon curtis , sir derek jacobi and emma thompson are among 120 signatories .
it warns the old vic theatre company could " fade away " while the theatre is closed for a £ 7m revamp .
the theatre 's chairman said future plays would depend on funding .
the theatre is due to close on 1 august until december 2008 .
rupert rhymes , the theatre chairman , has admitted there is a £ 2m shortfall in funding .
" we 've got to get a further £ 2m by christmas and there 's a save bristol old vic appeal that 's very much on the cards .
" i 'm looking forward to the result of the names giving inspiration to the appeal that is currently around . "
' fade away ' the letter raises fears the resident theatre company will die under plans to rent out the repaired building and calls for a new artistic director to be appointed after the resignation of simon reade .
but mr rhymes said unless they get the money for the repair work there would be no point in bringing in a new artistic director as there would be no money to pay for the position .
" we 're taking advantage of this pause to make sure that what we produce in future will appeal to bristol and the wider region 's audiences .
" it 's no good us putting on plays if in fact one runs out of money and it 's very important we gear future resources available to what is possible to put on , " he said .
the signatories write in the letter to the times : " what is clear is that the bristol old vic theatre company is in danger of being allowed to fade away .
" there is apparently no plan for the company to produce work during the closure period and , more importantly , no guarantee it will have a future at the theatre royal when it reopens in 2009 . "
equity has demanded a full and rigorous investigation and a clear statement from the bristol old vic trust about its plans for the future .
malcolm sinclair , of equity , said : " if the theatre closed , it would have a very bad effect on the profession .
it is perhaps the leading regional theatre . "

sir ian mckellen , dame judi dench , patrick stewart , alan rickman , simon curtis , sir derek jacobi and emma thompson are among 120 signatories .
it warns the old vic theatre company could " fade away " while the theatre is closed for a £ 7m revamp .
the theatre 's chairman said future plays would depend on funding .
the theatre is due to close on 1 august until december 2008 .
rupert rhymes , the theatre chairman , has admitted there is a £ 2m shortfall in funding .
" we 've got to get a further £ 2m by christmas and there 's a save bristol old vic appeal that 's very much on the cards .
" i 'm looking forward to the result of the names giving inspiration to the appeal that is currently around . "
' fade away ' the letter raises fears the resident theatre company will die under plans to rent out the repaired building and calls for a new artistic director to be appointed after the resignation of simon reade .
but mr rhymes said unless they get the money for the repair work there would be no point in bringing in a new artistic director as there would be no money to pay for the position .
" we 're taking advantage of this pause to make sure that what we produce in future will appeal to bristol and the wider region 's audiences .
" it 's no good us putting on plays if in fact one runs out of money and it 's very important we gear future resources available to what is possible to put on , " he said .
the signatories write in the letter to the times : " what is clear is that the bristol old vic theatre company is in danger of being allowed to fade away .
" there is apparently no plan for the company to produce work during the closure period and , more importantly , no guarantee it will have a future at the theatre royal when it reopens in 2009 . "
equity has demanded a full and rigorous investigation and a clear statement from the bristol old vic trust about its plans for the future .
malcolm sinclair , of equity , said : " if the theatre closed , it would have a very bad effect on the profession .
it is perhaps the leading regional theatre . "

sir ian mckellen , dame judi dench , patrick stewart , alan rickman , simon curtis , sir derek jacobi and emma thompson are among 120 signatories .
it warns the old vic theatre company could " fade away " while the theatre is closed for a £ 7m revamp .
the theatre 's chairman said future plays would depend on funding .
the theatre is due to close on 1 august until december 2008 .
rupert rhymes , the theatre chairman , has admitted there is a £ 2m shortfall in funding .
" we 've got to get a further £ 2m by christmas and there 's a save bristol old vic appeal that 's very much on the cards .
" i 'm looking forward to the result of the names giving inspiration to the appeal that is currently around . "
' fade away ' the letter raises fears the resident theatre company will die under plans to rent out the repaired building and calls for a new artistic director to be appointed after the resignation of simon reade .
but mr rhymes said unless they get the money for the repair work there would be no point in bringing in a new artistic director as there would be no money to pay for the position .
" we 're taking advantage of this pause to make sure that what we produce in future will appeal to bristol and the wider region 's audiences .
" it 's no good us putting on plays if in fact one runs out of money and it 's very important we gear future resources available to what is possible to put on , " he said .
the signatories write in the letter to the times : " what is clear is that the bristol old vic theatre company is in danger of being allowed to fade away .
" there is apparently no plan for the company to produce work during the closure period and , more importantly , no guarantee it will have a future at the theatre royal when it reopens in 2009 . "
equity has demanded a full and rigorous investigation and a clear statement from the bristol old vic trust about its plans for the future .
malcolm sinclair , of equity , said : " if the theatre closed , it would have a very bad effect on the profession .

akzo , whose brands include crown paints , had a 600p-per-share offer for ici rejected in june .

sunderland city council said the fine weather helped to attract hundreds of thousands of people to the annual event along the city 's seafront .
the 19th weekend airshow saw visitors treated to displays featuring modern and classic aircraft .
police said the event was " very busy " , but reported no serious incidents or significant arrests .
supt ron ardsley of northumbria police said : " once again the crowds have turned out for the airshow and it has been as busy as ever .
carbon neutral " sunday , in particular was extremely busy due to the fact that crowd favourites , the red arrows were appearing on that day only . "
crowds also saw the eurofighter typhoon , a chinook helicopter , a battle of britain memorial flight and catalina and the blades .
hms albion provided a backdrop out at sea and in a first for the show , the royal marines from the vessel treated the crowds to a spectacular beach invasion .
air show director peter chapman , said : " as the event is free , it 's very difficult to put an absolute figure on how many people have attended .
saturday was busy and sunday drew in bumper crowds .
" people come to the airshow from all over the country and abroad and once again it will have had a huge impact on the city and region 's economy . "

he said it helped create non-academic degrees such as surfing and knitwear .
but the department of children , schools and families said it wanted higher education to be " accessible " to all .
in a speech to the pat annual conference , in harrogate , mr morris will claim " the middle classes are becoming the new whipping boys for new labour " .

mr morris , who taught at bishop gore comprehensive school in swansea before he retired , said plans for university application forms from 2008 to ask whether the applicant 's parents had a degree were " creating barriers in education based on social class " .
